To help you in finding the spreadsheet that you might want, I    have categorized the spreadsheets into the following groups:          Corporate finance spreadsheets : These spreadsheets are      most useful if you are interested in conventional corporate financial analysis.      It includes spreadsheets to analyze a project's cashflows and viability, a      company's risk profile, its optimal capital structure and debt type, andwhether     it is paying out what it can afford to in dividends. These programs are broadly categorized into those that          Estimate risk in an investment and its hurdle rate, as well as assess investment returns (net present value, internal rate of return, accounting return)      Evaluate the right mix of debt and equity in a business and the right type of debt for a firm      Examine how much a firm should return to investors and in what form (dividends versus buybacks)                Valuation Inputs Spreadsheets : In this section,      you will find spreadsheets that allow you to           Estimate the right discount rate to use for your firm, starting with the       risk premium in your cost of equity and concluding with the cost of capital       for your firm.

Big-picture valuation spreadsheets :      If you are looking for one spreadsheet to help you in valuing      a company, I would recommend one of these 'ginzu' spreadsheets.      While they require a large number of inputs, they are flexible      enough to allow you to value just about any company. You do have      to decide whether you want to use a dividend, FCFE or FCFF model      spreadsheet. If you have no idea which one will work for you,      I would suggest that you try the &quot;right      model&quot; spreadsheet first.           Focused valuation spreadsheets : If      you have a clear choice in terms of models - stable growth dividend      discount, 2-stage FCFE etc. - you can download a spreadsheet     for the specific model in this section.      Valuation of specific types of companies: Valuation is all about     exceptions, and these spreadsheets are designed to help value specific    types of companies including:           Financial Service firms : While dividend discount      models tend to be the weapon of choice for many, you will find an excess      equity return model here.       Troubled firms : You will find an earnings      normalizer spreadsheet, a generic valuation model for valuing a firm as a      going concern and a spreadsheet that allows you to estimate the probability      that a troubled firm will not survive.

These spreadsheet programs are in Excel and are not copy     protected. Download them and feel free to modify them to your own     specifications. I do have video guides available for some of the     most accessed spreadsheets. I hope they are useful.       One more point. I am not an expert on Microsoft Excel and am frankly mystified     by some of the quirky differences between the Mac version (which I use)     and the PC version (which you probably have). If you want to refine your     spreadsheet skills, you can of course by a book on Excel.

To help you in finding the spreadsheet that you might want, I    have categorized the spreadsheets into the following groups:          Corporate finance spreadsheets : These spreadsheets are      most useful if you are interested in conventional corporate financial analysis.      It includes spreadsheets to analyze a project's cashflows and viability, a      company's risk profile, its optimal capital structure and debt type, andwhether     it is paying out what it can afford to in dividends. These programs are broadly categorized into those that          Estimate risk in an investment and its hurdle rate, as well as assess investment returns (net present value, internal rate of return, accounting return)      Evaluate the right mix of debt and equity in a business and the right type of debt for a firm      Examine how much a firm should return to investors and in what form (dividends versus buybacks)                Valuation Inputs Spreadsheets : In this section,      you will find spreadsheets that allow you to           Estimate the right discount rate to use for your firm, starting with the       risk premium in your cost of equity and concluding with the cost of capital       for your firm.       Convert R&amp;D and operating leases into capitalized assets       Estimate the right capital expenditures and diagnose the terminal value       assumptions to see if they are reasonable.                Valuation Model Reconciliation : In this section, you will find spreadsheets      that reconcile different DCF approaches - FCFE versus Dividend Discount Model,      FCFE versus FCFF model, EVA versus Cost of capital and Net Debt versus Gross     Debt Approaches.      Big-picture valuation spreadsheets :      If you are looking for one spreadsheet to help you in valuing      a company, I would recommend one of these 'ginzu' spreadsheets.      While they require a large number of inputs, they are flexible      enough to allow you to value just about any company. You do have      to decide whether you want to use a dividend, FCFE or FCFF model      spreadsheet. If you have no idea which one will work for you,      I would suggest that you try the &quot;right      model&quot; spreadsheet first.           Focused valuation spreadsheets : If      you have a clear choice in terms of models - stable growth dividend      discount, 2-stage FCFE etc. - you can download a spreadsheet     for the specific model in this section.      Valuation of specific types of companies: Valuation is all about     exceptions, and these spreadsheets are designed to help value specific    types of companies including:           Financial Service firms : While dividend discount      models tend to be the weapon of choice for many, you will find an excess      equity return model here.       Troubled firms : You will find an earnings      normalizer spreadsheet, a generic valuation model for valuing a firm as a      going concern and a spreadsheet that allows you to estimate the probability      that a troubled firm will not survive.       Private companies : You will find spreadsheets      for adjusting discount rates and estimating illiquidity discounts for private      companies.       Young and high-growth firms : You will find      a revenue growth estimator as well as a generic valuation model for high      growth firms in this section.                Multiples : You can estimate equity     as well as firm value multiples, based upon fundamentals.      Valuation in Acquisitions : You can value     synergy in an acquiisition and analyze a leveraged buyout.      Valuation of other assets : In this      section, you will find a model for valuing income-generating     real estate.      Value Enhancement Spreadsheets : In      this section, you will find a spreadsheet that reconciles EVA      and DCF valuation, a model for estimating CFROI and a DCF version     of a value enhancement spreadsheet.      Basic option pricing models : In      this seciton, you will find Black-Scholes models for valuing short      term options, long term options and options that result in dilution      of stock (such as warrants). In addition, you will find spreadsheets      that convert Black-Scholes inputs into Binomial model inputs and      use the binomial model to value options.           Real option models in corporate finance :      In this section, you will find three basic real option models -      the option to delay, the option to expand and the option to abandon.      In addition, the value of financial flexibility is considered as     an option.      Real option models in valuation : In      this section, you will find models to value both a patent (and      a firm owning a patent) as an option, natural resource firms and     equity in deeply troubled firms.         These spreadsheet programs are in Excel and are not copy     protected. Download them and feel free to modify them to your own     specifications. I do have video guides available for some of the     most accessed spreadsheets. I hope they are useful.       One more point. I am not an expert on Microsoft Excel and am frankly mystified     by some of the quirky differences between the Mac version (which I use)     and the PC version (which you probably have). If you want to refine your     spreadsheet skills, you can of course by a book on Excel. However, a reader     of this website, Alex Palfi of Tykoh Training, has been kind enough to offer     this     guide to using and building spreadsheets. Please feel free to download     it and use it and to then convey your appreciation to him.                                Program      Video guide            Description                Corporate Finance        Capital Budgeting          This spreadsheet allows you to do a basic capital budgeting analysis for    a project, and compute NPV, IRR and ROI.              Estimate a beta          This spreadsheet allows you to input past returns on a stock and a market    index to analyse its price performance (Jensen's Alpha), its sensitivity    to market movements (Beta) and the proportion of its risk that can be    attributed to the market.          Regression Analyzer    Webcast    This spreadsheet allows you to check your computations of Jensen's   alpha, range on beta and expected return, given the output from a return   regression (risk.xls above).              Lever &amp; unlever betas          This spreadsheet allows you to enter the current beta, tax rate and the    debt equity ratio for your stock, and obtain a table of betas at different    debt ratios.          Convert operating leases to debt    Webcast    This spreadsheet allows you to convert lease commitments to debt.              Estimate a synthetic rating &amp; cost of debt          This spreadsheet allows you to estimate a rating and a cost of debt for    your company from the firm's interext coverage ratio.           Adjusted Present Value (for optimizing debt)        This model allows you to estimate an &quot;optimal&quot; Capital   Structure for a company using the Adjusted Present Value Approach.              Optimum Capital Structure (Cost of capital approach)          This model allows you to estimate an &quot;optimal&quot; Capital   structure for a company using the cost of capital approach. An option in the model also allows you to build in indirect bankruptcy cost by letting your operating income vary with your bond rating.          Calculate accounting returns (ROE, ROIC)    Webcast    The return on invested capital and return on equity are accounting measures but useful measures, nevertheless, of the quality of existing projects.              Design debt (by looking at sensitivity to macro variables)          This model allows you to estimate the duration of a firm's assets    and its sensitivity to other macro economic variables. It may be useful    in the design of debt.              Estimate potential dividends &amp; compare to actual dividends        This model compares the dividends paid to what a firm could have paid,    by estimating the free cash flow to equity (the cash flow left over after    net debt payments, net capital expenditures and working capital investments.              Evaluate the effect of a buyback on EPS and value          This model allows you to assess how a buyback will affect earnings per share and make judgments on its consequences for overall value and value per share.           Corporate finance &amp; Valuation:    Inputs        readme1s.xls          This file describes the programs in this section and provides some insights    into their usage.          impliedROC&amp;ROE.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to compute the ROC or ROE implied in your   terminal value calculation.          wacccalc.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to estimate the cost of capital for your    firm.              cpxest.xls          This model summarizes the three approaches that can be used to estimate    the net capital expenditures for a firm, when it reaches stable growth.              oplease.xls      Webcast    This model converts operating lease expenses into financing expenses    and restates operating income and debt outstanding.              R&amp;DConv.xls      Webcast    This model converts R&amp; D expenses from operating to capital expenses,    estimates a value for the research asset and restates operating income.              implprem.xls          This spreadsheet calculates the implied risk premium in a market. This    can be used in discounted cashflow valuation to do market neutral valuation.           Valuation Model Reconciliation    fcfevsddm.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to reconcile the differences between the   FCFE and the dividend discount models for estimating equity value.          fcffvsfcfe.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to reconcile the differences between the   FCFF and the FCFE approaches to valuation.          fcffeva.xls        This spreadsheet reconciles a cost of capital DCF valuation with an   EVA valuation of the same company          GrossvsNet.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to reconcile the differences between the   Gross debt and Net debt approaches to valuation.           All-in-one    Valuation Models        model.xls          This model provides a rough guide to which discounted    cash flow model may be best suited to your firm.              higrowth.xls          This spreadsheet can be used to value tough-to-value firms, with negative    earnings, high growth in revenues and few comparables. If you have a dot.com    firm, this is your best choice.              divginzu.xls          A complete dividend discount model that can do stable growth, 2-stage    or 3-stage valuation. This is your best choice if you are analyzing financial    service firms.          fcfeginzu.xls        A complete FCFE valuation model that allows you to capital R&amp;D and    deal with options in the context of a valuation model.          growthbreakdown.xls        A model to value the premium you should pay for growth in either an intrinsic valuation or a relative valuation.          fcffsimpleginzu.xls        A complete FCFF model that allows for changing margins and has default assumptions built in (to protect you from inconsistent assumptions). If you want a quick, all-in-one model to value a company with relatively few inputs, try this.              fcffginzu.xls       Video    Presentation    This model tries to do it all, with all of the associated risks and    rewards. I hate having to work with a dozen spreadsheets to value a firm,    and I have tried to put them all into one spreadsheet - a ratings estimator,    an earnings normalizer, an R&amp;D converter, an operating lease converter,    a bottom-up beta estimator and industry averages. Try it out and make    your own additions.          fcffginzulambda.xls        This model is very similar to the fcffginzu model, but it allows the   user to enter a measure of company exposure to country risk (that is   different from beta).          Loose Ends in Valuation     controlvalue.xls        This model analyzes the value of control in a firm.           synergyvaluation.xls        This model estimates the value of synergy in a   merger.           brandnamevalue.xls        This spreadsheet provides different ways of estimating the value of   a brand name, although each comes with some baggage.           complscore.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to measure the complexity in a company   and give it a score.          employeeoption.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to value employee options and incorporate them into value.          GrossvsNet.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to understand why the gross and net debt   approaches give you different estimates of value for a firm.          liqdisc.xls        Estimates the illiquidity discount that should be   applied to a private firm as a function of the firm's size and financial   health. Uses both restricted stock approach and bid-ask spread regression.           distress.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to estimate the probability of distress   from the bond price of a company.           Focused    Valuation Models        ddmst.xls          Stable growth, dividend discount model; best suited for firms growing    at the same rate as the economy and paying residual cash as dividends.              ddm2st.xls      Two-stage DDM; best suited for firms paying residual cash in dividends    while having moderate growth.              ddm3st.xls      Three-stage DDM; best suited for firms paying residual cash in dividends,    while having high growth.              fcfest.xls          Stable growth, FCFE discount model; best suited for firms in stable    leverage and growing at the same rate as the economy.              fcfe2st.xls      Two-stage FCFE discount model; best suited for firms with stable leverage    and having moderate growth.              fcfe3st.xls      Three-stage FCFE discount model; best suited for firms with stable leverage    and having high growth.              fcffst.xls          Stable growth FCFF discount model; best suited for firms growing at    the same rate as the economy.              fcff2st.xls      Two-stage FCFF discount model; best suited for firms with shifting leverage    and growing at a moderate rate.              fcff3st.xls      Three-stage FCFF discount model; best suited for firms with shifting    leverage and high growth.              evavaln .xls          Three-stage FCFF valuation model, also presented in terms of projected    EVA.              fcffgen.xls          A generalised FCFF model, where the operating margins are allowed to    change each year; best suited for firms in transition.

These programs are broadly categorized into those that          Estimate risk in an investment and its hurdle rate, as well as assess investment returns (net present value, internal rate of return, accounting return)      Evaluate the right mix of debt and equity in a business and the right type of debt for a firm      Examine how much a firm should return to investors and in what form (dividends versus buybacks)                Valuation Inputs Spreadsheets : In this section,      you will find spreadsheets that allow you to           Estimate the right discount rate to use for your firm, starting with the       risk premium in your cost of equity and concluding with the cost of capital       for your firm.       Convert R&amp;D and operating leases into capitalized assets       Estimate the right capital expenditures and diagnose the terminal value       assumptions to see if they are reasonable.                Valuation Model Reconciliation : In this section, you will find spreadsheets      that reconcile different DCF approaches - FCFE versus Dividend Discount Model,      FCFE versus FCFF model, EVA versus Cost of capital and Net Debt versus Gross     Debt Approaches.      Big-picture valuation spreadsheets :      If you are looking for one spreadsheet to help you in valuing      a company, I would recommend one of these 'ginzu' spreadsheets.      While they require a large number of inputs, they are flexible      enough to allow you to value just about any company. You do have      to decide whether you want to use a dividend, FCFE or FCFF model      spreadsheet. If you have no idea which one will work for you,      I would suggest that you try the &quot;right      model&quot; spreadsheet first.           Focused valuation spreadsheets : If      you have a clear choice in terms of models - stable growth dividend      discount, 2-stage FCFE etc. - you can download a spreadsheet     for the specific model in this section.      Valuation of specific types of companies: Valuation is all about     exceptions, and these spreadsheets are designed to help value specific    types of companies including:           Financial Service firms : While dividend discount      models tend to be the weapon of choice for many, you will find an excess      equity return model here.       Troubled firms : You will find an earnings      normalizer spreadsheet, a generic valuation model for valuing a firm as a      going concern and a spreadsheet that allows you to estimate the probability      that a troubled firm will not survive.       Private companies : You will find spreadsheets      for adjusting discount rates and estimating illiquidity discounts for private      companies.       Young and high-growth firms : You will find      a revenue growth estimator as well as a generic valuation model for high      growth firms in this section.                Multiples : You can estimate equity     as well as firm value multiples, based upon fundamentals.      Valuation in Acquisitions : You can value     synergy in an acquiisition and analyze a leveraged buyout.      Valuation of other assets : In this      section, you will find a model for valuing income-generating     real estate.      Value Enhancement Spreadsheets : In      this section, you will find a spreadsheet that reconciles EVA      and DCF valuation, a model for estimating CFROI and a DCF version     of a value enhancement spreadsheet.      Basic option pricing models : In      this seciton, you will find Black-Scholes models for valuing short      term options, long term options and options that result in dilution      of stock (such as warrants). In addition, you will find spreadsheets      that convert Black-Scholes inputs into Binomial model inputs and      use the binomial model to value options.           Real option models in corporate finance :      In this section, you will find three basic real option models -      the option to delay, the option to expand and the option to abandon.      In addition, the value of financial flexibility is considered as     an option.      Real option models in valuation : In      this section, you will find models to value both a patent (and      a firm owning a patent) as an option, natural resource firms and     equity in deeply troubled firms.         These spreadsheet programs are in Excel and are not copy     protected. Download them and feel free to modify them to your own     specifications. I do have video guides available for some of the     most accessed spreadsheets. I hope they are useful.       One more point. I am not an expert on Microsoft Excel and am frankly mystified     by some of the quirky differences between the Mac version (which I use)     and the PC version (which you probably have). If you want to refine your     spreadsheet skills, you can of course by a book on Excel. However, a reader     of this website, Alex Palfi of Tykoh Training, has been kind enough to offer     this     guide to using and building spreadsheets. Please feel free to download     it and use it and to then convey your appreciation to him.

Estimate a beta          This spreadsheet allows you to input past returns on a stock and a market    index to analyse its price performance (Jensen's Alpha), its sensitivity    to market movements (Beta) and the proportion of its risk that can be    attributed to the market.          Regression Analyzer    Webcast    This spreadsheet allows you to check your computations of Jensen's   alpha, range on beta and expected return, given the output from a return   regression (risk.xls above).              Lever &amp; unlever betas          This spreadsheet allows you to enter the current beta, tax rate and the    debt equity ratio for your stock, and obtain a table of betas at different    debt ratios.          Convert operating leases to debt    Webcast    This spreadsheet allows you to convert lease commitments to debt.              Estimate a synthetic rating &amp; cost of debt          This spreadsheet allows you to estimate a rating and a cost of debt for    your company from the firm's interext coverage ratio.           Adjusted Present Value (for optimizing debt)        This model allows you to estimate an &quot;optimal&quot; Capital   Structure for a company using the Adjusted Present Value Approach.              Optimum Capital Structure (Cost of capital approach)          This model allows you to estimate an &quot;optimal&quot; Capital   structure for a company using the cost of capital approach. An option in the model also allows you to build in indirect bankruptcy cost by letting your operating income vary with your bond rating.          Calculate accounting returns (ROE, ROIC)    Webcast    The return on invested capital and return on equity are accounting measures but useful measures, nevertheless, of the quality of existing projects.              Design debt (by looking at sensitivity to macro variables)          This model allows you to estimate the duration of a firm's assets    and its sensitivity to other macro economic variables. It may be useful    in the design of debt.              Estimate potential dividends &amp; compare to actual dividends        This model compares the dividends paid to what a firm could have paid,    by estimating the free cash flow to equity (the cash flow left over after    net debt payments, net capital expenditures and working capital investments.              Evaluate the effect of a buyback on EPS and value          This model allows you to assess how a buyback will affect earnings per share and make judgments on its consequences for overall value and value per share.

I hate having to work with a dozen spreadsheets to value a firm,    and I have tried to put them all into one spreadsheet - a ratings estimator,    an earnings normalizer, an R&amp;D converter, an operating lease converter,    a bottom-up beta estimator and industry averages. Try it out and make    your own additions.          fcffginzulambda.xls        This model is very similar to the fcffginzu model, but it allows the   user to enter a measure of company exposure to country risk (that is   different from beta).

I generally categorize material by the three basic    approaches to valuation - discounted cash flow valuation, relative    valuation and option pricing applications on valuation. You can read    an overview of the three approaches to valuation before you begin.            1.

To help you in finding the spreadsheet that you might want, I    have categorized the spreadsheets into the following groups:          Corporate finance spreadsheets : These spreadsheets are      most useful if you are interested in conventional corporate financial analysis.      It includes spreadsheets to analyze a project's cashflows and viability, a      company's risk profile, its optimal capital structure and debt type, andwhether     it is paying out what it can afford to in dividends. These programs are broadly categorized into those that          Estimate risk in an investment and its hurdle rate, as well as assess investment returns (net present value, internal rate of return, accounting return)      Evaluate the right mix of debt and equity in a business and the right type of debt for a firm      Examine how much a firm should return to investors and in what form (dividends versus buybacks)                Valuation Inputs Spreadsheets : In this section,      you will find spreadsheets that allow you to           Estimate the right discount rate to use for your firm, starting with the       risk premium in your cost of equity and concluding with the cost of capital       for your firm.       Convert R&amp;D and operating leases into capitalized assets       Estimate the right capital expenditures and diagnose the terminal value       assumptions to see if they are reasonable.                Valuation Model Reconciliation : In this section, you will find spreadsheets      that reconcile different DCF approaches - FCFE versus Dividend Discount Model,      FCFE versus FCFF model, EVA versus Cost of capital and Net Debt versus Gross     Debt Approaches.      Big-picture valuation spreadsheets :      If you are looking for one spreadsheet to help you in valuing      a company, I would recommend one of these 'ginzu' spreadsheets.      While they require a large number of inputs, they are flexible      enough to allow you to value just about any company. You do have      to decide whether you want to use a dividend, FCFE or FCFF model      spreadsheet. If you have no idea which one will work for you,      I would suggest that you try the &quot;right      model&quot; spreadsheet first.           Focused valuation spreadsheets : If      you have a clear choice in terms of models - stable growth dividend      discount, 2-stage FCFE etc. - you can download a spreadsheet     for the specific model in this section.      Valuation of specific types of companies: Valuation is all about     exceptions, and these spreadsheets are designed to help value specific    types of companies including:           Financial Service firms : While dividend discount      models tend to be the weapon of choice for many, you will find an excess      equity return model here.       Troubled firms : You will find an earnings      normalizer spreadsheet, a generic valuation model for valuing a firm as a      going concern and a spreadsheet that allows you to estimate the probability      that a troubled firm will not survive.       Private companies : You will find spreadsheets      for adjusting discount rates and estimating illiquidity discounts for private      companies.       Young and high-growth firms : You will find      a revenue growth estimator as well as a generic valuation model for high      growth firms in this section.                Multiples : You can estimate equity     as well as firm value multiples, based upon fundamentals.      Valuation in Acquisitions : You can value     synergy in an acquiisition and analyze a leveraged buyout.      Valuation of other assets : In this      section, you will find a model for valuing income-generating     real estate.      Value Enhancement Spreadsheets : In      this section, you will find a spreadsheet that reconciles EVA      and DCF valuation, a model for estimating CFROI and a DCF version     of a value enhancement spreadsheet.      Basic option pricing models : In      this seciton, you will find Black-Scholes models for valuing short      term options, long term options and options that result in dilution      of stock (such as warrants). In addition, you will find spreadsheets      that convert Black-Scholes inputs into Binomial model inputs and      use the binomial model to value options.           Real option models in corporate finance :      In this section, you will find three basic real option models -      the option to delay, the option to expand and the option to abandon.      In addition, the value of financial flexibility is considered as     an option.      Real option models in valuation : In      this section, you will find models to value both a patent (and      a firm owning a patent) as an option, natural resource firms and     equity in deeply troubled firms.         These spreadsheet programs are in Excel and are not copy     protected. Download them and feel free to modify them to your own     specifications. I do have video guides available for some of the     most accessed spreadsheets. I hope they are useful.       One more point. I am not an expert on Microsoft Excel and am frankly mystified     by some of the quirky differences between the Mac version (which I use)     and the PC version (which you probably have). If you want to refine your     spreadsheet skills, you can of course by a book on Excel. However, a reader     of this website, Alex Palfi of Tykoh Training, has been kind enough to offer     this     guide to using and building spreadsheets. Please feel free to download     it and use it and to then convey your appreciation to him.                                Program      Video guide            Description                Corporate Finance        Capital Budgeting          This spreadsheet allows you to do a basic capital budgeting analysis for    a project, and compute NPV, IRR and ROI.              Estimate a beta          This spreadsheet allows you to input past returns on a stock and a market    index to analyse its price performance (Jensen's Alpha), its sensitivity    to market movements (Beta) and the proportion of its risk that can be    attributed to the market.          Regression Analyzer    Webcast    This spreadsheet allows you to check your computations of Jensen's   alpha, range on beta and expected return, given the output from a return   regression (risk.xls above).              Lever &amp; unlever betas          This spreadsheet allows you to enter the current beta, tax rate and the    debt equity ratio for your stock, and obtain a table of betas at different    debt ratios.          Convert operating leases to debt    Webcast    This spreadsheet allows you to convert lease commitments to debt.              Estimate a synthetic rating &amp; cost of debt          This spreadsheet allows you to estimate a rating and a cost of debt for    your company from the firm's interext coverage ratio.           Adjusted Present Value (for optimizing debt)        This model allows you to estimate an &quot;optimal&quot; Capital   Structure for a company using the Adjusted Present Value Approach.              Optimum Capital Structure (Cost of capital approach)          This model allows you to estimate an &quot;optimal&quot; Capital   structure for a company using the cost of capital approach. An option in the model also allows you to build in indirect bankruptcy cost by letting your operating income vary with your bond rating.          Calculate accounting returns (ROE, ROIC)    Webcast    The return on invested capital and return on equity are accounting measures but useful measures, nevertheless, of the quality of existing projects.              Design debt (by looking at sensitivity to macro variables)          This model allows you to estimate the duration of a firm's assets    and its sensitivity to other macro economic variables. It may be useful    in the design of debt.              Estimate potential dividends &amp; compare to actual dividends        This model compares the dividends paid to what a firm could have paid,    by estimating the free cash flow to equity (the cash flow left over after    net debt payments, net capital expenditures and working capital investments.              Evaluate the effect of a buyback on EPS and value          This model allows you to assess how a buyback will affect earnings per share and make judgments on its consequences for overall value and value per share.           Corporate finance &amp; Valuation:    Inputs        readme1s.xls          This file describes the programs in this section and provides some insights    into their usage.          impliedROC&amp;ROE.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to compute the ROC or ROE implied in your   terminal value calculation.          wacccalc.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to estimate the cost of capital for your    firm.              cpxest.xls          This model summarizes the three approaches that can be used to estimate    the net capital expenditures for a firm, when it reaches stable growth.              oplease.xls      Webcast    This model converts operating lease expenses into financing expenses    and restates operating income and debt outstanding.              R&amp;DConv.xls      Webcast    This model converts R&amp; D expenses from operating to capital expenses,    estimates a value for the research asset and restates operating income.              implprem.xls          This spreadsheet calculates the implied risk premium in a market. This    can be used in discounted cashflow valuation to do market neutral valuation.           Valuation Model Reconciliation    fcfevsddm.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to reconcile the differences between the   FCFE and the dividend discount models for estimating equity value.          fcffvsfcfe.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to reconcile the differences between the   FCFF and the FCFE approaches to valuation.          fcffeva.xls        This spreadsheet reconciles a cost of capital DCF valuation with an   EVA valuation of the same company          GrossvsNet.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to reconcile the differences between the   Gross debt and Net debt approaches to valuation.           All-in-one    Valuation Models        model.xls          This model provides a rough guide to which discounted    cash flow model may be best suited to your firm.              higrowth.xls          This spreadsheet can be used to value tough-to-value firms, with negative    earnings, high growth in revenues and few comparables. If you have a dot.com    firm, this is your best choice.              divginzu.xls          A complete dividend discount model that can do stable growth, 2-stage    or 3-stage valuation. This is your best choice if you are analyzing financial    service firms.          fcfeginzu.xls        A complete FCFE valuation model that allows you to capital R&amp;D and    deal with options in the context of a valuation model.          growthbreakdown.xls        A model to value the premium you should pay for growth in either an intrinsic valuation or a relative valuation.          fcffsimpleginzu.xls        A complete FCFF model that allows for changing margins and has default assumptions built in (to protect you from inconsistent assumptions). If you want a quick, all-in-one model to value a company with relatively few inputs, try this.              fcffginzu.xls       Video    Presentation    This model tries to do it all, with all of the associated risks and    rewards. I hate having to work with a dozen spreadsheets to value a firm,    and I have tried to put them all into one spreadsheet - a ratings estimator,    an earnings normalizer, an R&amp;D converter, an operating lease converter,    a bottom-up beta estimator and industry averages. Try it out and make    your own additions.          fcffginzulambda.xls        This model is very similar to the fcffginzu model, but it allows the   user to enter a measure of company exposure to country risk (that is   different from beta).          Loose Ends in Valuation     controlvalue.xls        This model analyzes the value of control in a firm.           synergyvaluation.xls        This model estimates the value of synergy in a   merger.           brandnamevalue.xls        This spreadsheet provides different ways of estimating the value of   a brand name, although each comes with some baggage.           complscore.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to measure the complexity in a company   and give it a score.          employeeoption.xls        This spreadsheet allows you to value employee options and incorporate them into value.
