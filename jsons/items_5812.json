Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare.

The NYU-HHC CTSI supports clinical and translational research that transforms health care and improves community health. We achieve this mission through an innovative public-private partnership of institutions with unique and complementary strengths: a private research university with a history of public service and substantial biomedical, behavioral, and population health expertise (NYU), the largest municipal healthcare system in the United States (HHC), a state psychiatric institute (Nathan Kline Institute), and numerous community organizations that represent the rich diversity of NYC. As a central hub, the CTSI catalyzes collaborative research and facilitates access to essential services, resources, and expertise necessary to engage in the full spectrum of clinical and translational research across our partners and the nationwide CTSA network.\u00a0                                                             Research Services                     Research Guidance   Funding Support &amp; Opportunities   Research Resources   Support for Collaboration   HHC Researcher Resources        More               Training &amp; Education                     Degree Programs   Certificate Programs   Career Development Programs   Mentoring Programs        More               CTSI News &amp; Events                     Newsletters   Calendar        More                                                                                  Quick Links       CTSI Newsletter   Cite the CTSI   Contact Us \u00a0                                                                                                                  NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}]},

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.   NYU College of Dentistry offers Advanced Education Programs that lead to proficiency in major areas of clinical study and satisfy the educational requirements for specialization and/or specialty board certification in six CODA-accredited specialties: Endodontics , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 6-year Integrated MD Program , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 4-year Certificate Program , Orthodontics &amp; Dentofacial Orthopedics , Pediatric Dentistry , Periodontics and Prosthodontics .

The NYU-HHC CTSI supports clinical and translational research that transforms health care and improves community health. We achieve this mission through an innovative public-private partnership of institutions with unique and complementary strengths: a private research university with a history of public service and substantial biomedical, behavioral, and population health expertise (NYU), the largest municipal healthcare system in the United States (HHC), a state psychiatric institute (Nathan Kline Institute), and numerous community organizations that represent the rich diversity of NYC. As a central hub, the CTSI catalyzes collaborative research and facilitates access to essential services, resources, and expertise necessary to engage in the full spectrum of clinical and translational research across our partners and the nationwide CTSA network.\u00a0                                                             Research Services                     Research Guidance   Funding Support &amp; Opportunities   Research Resources   Support for Collaboration   HHC Researcher Resources        More               Training &amp; Education                     Degree Programs   Certificate Programs   Career Development Programs   Mentoring Programs        More               CTSI News &amp; Events                     Newsletters   Calendar        More                                                                                  Quick Links       CTSI Newsletter   Cite the CTSI   Contact Us \u00a0                                                                                                                  NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}, {"content": "NYU Health Sciences Library                                                    Jump to navigation                             Locations       NYU Medical Archives                                                                              Home               Services                               - View all Services -               Literature Search Services               Education and Curriculum Support               Information for Patients and Families               Clinical Care Support               Research Support               Document Delivery and Interlibrary Loan               Publication Tracking                               Faculty Bibliography               Faculty Bibliography API                                                                   Meet your library liaison      Karen Yacobucci   Library liaison to the Cardiac and Vascular Institute and the Medical Center Hospitalists                                                 Subject Guides                                    - View all guides -                              What is a subject guide?
