relation to the economic tasks of life. It looks at how individuals within larger social groups, including communities, organizations, markets, and economies, make decisions about how much to work and play, spend and save. Economic analyses also consider how the economic decisions made by one group of people affect the decisions made by others. They then study how the aggregated effects of these decisions impact production, distribution, trade, and the consumption of goods and services across local regions, countries, and the world.   The Economics curriculum at NYU Abu Dhabi is designed to introduce students to these fundamental dynamics of human life and, in doing so, is grounded in three basic pedagogical principles:     Undergraduate students must be exposed to the \u201cbig ideas\u201d and pressing social issues of our world and given economic frameworks for thinking about them.   Meaningful study of economics requires being able to think about problems from local, regional, and global perspectives.   Effective economic reasoning increasingly involves a multi- disciplinary approach combining the best economic thinking with the best thinking in psychology, history, and politics.

It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples, and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.

The course begins with a discussion of some basic data used to analyze the relationships between macroeconomic aggregates such as production, inflation, and unemployment. Next, determinants of long run growth in national per capita incomes are discussed followed by a discussion of economic booms and recessions. The course concludes with descriptions of the tensions inherent in the formulation of monetary and fiscal macroeconomic policies and the pitfalls and opportunities afforded to nations within the context of an emergent global economy.    *Students NYUNY: This course counts for Societies and Social Sciences (College Core) credit;

The second part of the course covers the role of money and finance in global economic activity. Topics include: the roles of the exchange rate; current and capital accounts as key variables in international economic relations; purchasing power parity and interest rate parity; the international effects of macro policy and government exchange rate policies; the role of oil exports in the world economy; and the role of international economic organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.

We study the manner in which consumers, producers and resource owners, acting through markets, determine the prices and output of goods and the allocation of productive resources. Consumers and producers are viewed as agents with well-defined objectives, choosing optimally under constraints on their resources. The price mechanism is viewed as an institution that disseminates information to decision makers&mdash;firms and consumers&mdash;and coordinates their behavior. We will study circumstances under which markets promote an efficient allocation of resources, as well as sources of market failure where the price mechanism can lead to inefficient outcomes.

Similarities and differences between the patterns that have occurred in many of the sub-Saharan economies and those of other countries and in other times will be discussed. Emphasis is given to the range of factors involved: history, politics, demographics, urban planning, climate change, and economics. Accra is a particularly interesting location for this course as Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to become independent following World War II, and its leadership was advised by one of the leading development economists, Nobel Prize winner Arthur Lewis, who gave considerable attention to the role of cities in the development process. The course also considers the important roles played by slavery, the structural adjustment programs, and the colonial urban planning policies drawing out their implications for Ghana&#39;s economic development and its urbanization. A number of site visits to other cities will be included.    Note: Students in the NYUNY Metropolitan Studies Dept: This course counts for the major and minor    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful?

This class will study the various ways that workers and firms interact in labor markets. What factors determine how much labor individuals supply to the market? What determines labor demand by firms? How do firms design contracts to provide the right incentives to their workers? What determines wage inequality in the economy? What can insights from labor economics contribute to debates surrounding policies such as immigration reform, welfare reform, and income taxation? The class will expose students to the basic theoretical models used by economists to tackle these issues. We will also survey evidence from empirical studies on these topics.

In 1908 GDP per capita in Argentina was around 80% of GDP per capita in US, where GDP per capita is the value of production divided by the size of the population. One hundred years later, in 2008, GDP per capita in Argentina was around 35% of GDP per capita in US. In the course we aim to understand why the development of Argentina has been so disastrous focussing on economic factors. We will compare Argentina with other countries in order to gain insight into the crucial factors for economic growth and development. We will first study the history of Argentina with emphasis on its economic development. Next we will go into the mechanisms of growth by studying basic economic theory about supply and demand, production, consumer choice and growth. Using our knowledge about the history of Argentina and economics, we will try to understand some of the main causes of the actual economic development of Argentina. The insights we gain from studying the Argentinian experience will help us understand that economic growth and development are sensitive and delicate phenomena, not just for Argentina but for any country. The course includes excursions to see traces of earlier times and their current impact on Buenos Aires and its culture.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

ECON-AD 221 Understanding Financial Crises                                             The purpose of this course is to understand the key facts and basic mechanisms concerning financial crises and some related topics. The course will first lay down some foundations by studying empirical evidence about crises as well as the basic crisis mechanisms (bank runs, sovereign default decision, currency collapse). The empirical facts will provide a long run perspective on the recurrence of different types of financial crises (banking crises, currency crises, and sovereign debt crises), and will study their causes, their resolutions, and their long run consequences. The crisis mechanisms will be introduced through very simple canonical models, putting the emphasis on intuition and insight over model technicalities. Once the foundations are in place, the course will open up to a series of topics mixing themes &ndash; such as crises and long run growth; inequality and crises; crises, stabilization and reforms &ndash; and in-depth study of major crises episodes &ndash; such as the Great Depression, the US Financial Crises of 2007-2008 and the Euro Crisis.

This course revisits some of the most fundamental assumptions concerning human behavior in economics such as selfishness and individual rationality; discuss evidence illustrating systematic violations of them; and provide explanations for them. Further, it discusses some of the important implications of the new behavioral models for economic policy, finance, marketing, management, and industrial economics. Students will participate in classroom experiments to gain a deeper understanding of the issues at hand. The continuous interplay between economic theory and empirical data throughout the course means that this unit will appeal to anyone with an interest in understanding human behavior.

The course starts with a careful study of the functioning of markets, culminating with the first and second theorem of welfare economics. The next topics cover an introduction to strategic behavior and game theory, and subsequently a study of market failures situations in the case of adverse selection and moral hazard. This course involves more formal analysis than the one used in Intermediate Microeconomics.

Modeling the subtle mixture of strategic interactions across those &ldquo;coalitions&rdquo;, and equitable compromises within coalitions, is the difficult task of cooperative game theory. The course introduces the formal models of cooperative behavior, both from the normative viewpoint of sharing the benefits of cooperation, and the positive analysis of coalition formation. Applications include competitive markets, the provision of local public goods and the emergence of federations, cost sharing of joint ventures, routing games on networks, and more.

It emphasizes accounting as the process through which relevant financial information concerning an economic entity is recorded and communicated to different parties, such as stockholders, creditors, tax authorities, investors, etc. The underlying rationale of accounting principles is discussed, aiming to provide students with a clear understanding of accounting concepts. In this course students learn about the relevance and informativeness of financial statement for decision making, as resource allocation, evaluation and contracting activities. In addition to text-oriented materials, the classes also include cases so that students can discuss applications of basic concepts, actual financial reports, and articles from newspapers.

The course considers market failures; the evaluation of public expenditures; and the incidence, efficiency, and effects of various taxes. The primary purpose is to use economic tools (mainly microeconomic) to study the impact of government policy on the distribution of resources. Topics include: welfare economics; public goods and externalities; public choice; important issues of government expenditure, taxation, and activity (e.g., international public goods and institutions, tax competition and coordination, education, social security and health care); fiscal federalism (including European integration); and mechanisms of political influence (e.g. elections and lobbying).

The system has recently suffered two extraordinary shocks - the collapse of the mortgage finance market and the \"vicious downward cycle\" caused by linkages between bank and sovereign creditworthiness. These shocks, which have thrown the Euro-American economies into a protracted Great Recession, threaten the euro and the European Union, and represent great challenges to US and European governments, financial institutions and their regulators. The German government, based in Berlin is a key decision maker in the efforts to stabilize the euro, the weaker Eurozone member countries and the European banking system, and the European Central Bank, another key player, is not far away in Frankfurt. This course provides a broad ranging exploration of these issues for students with only general knowledge of finance and economics.

This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

While the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. Indeed, the relationship between differentiation (finding a derivative) and integration (determining an integral) is described in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation that provides opportunities for rigorous analysis of proofs and theorems associated with the material. This course is primarily intended for students considering Mathematics as a major. Placement into Calculus is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination. With permission of the program in mathematics, Calculus with Applications may substitute for Calculus.    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.

The class addresses three questions: Why do we want things? How do physical places organize our consumer desires? And how does place become an object of consumption? This class explores how the relationship between consumption and cities has developed by examining three key moments: world fairs and the invention of the department store in the late nineteenth century; the rise of malls in the mid-20th century and the contemporary period of digital commerce and the global commodity city. Readings include Thorstein Veblen&rsquo;s Theory of the Leisure Class, Karl Marx&rsquo;s essay on commodity fetishism, Max Weber&rsquo;s essays on economy and society, Georg Simmel&rsquo;s Metropolis and Mental Life and selections from Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s Arcades project.

The class will focus on major themes and issues such as the determinants of peaceful  cooperation and sustainable peace; the root causes of armed conflict; the determinants of ethnic conflict; the political economy of civil wars; the variables affecting the duration and termination of wars; the phenomenon of different forms of political violence-including protests, riots, military coups, political assassinations, and terrorism; and the politics and economics of peacebuilding. The course is highly interdisciplinary and will cover a wide variety of cases from a comparative perspective.

POLSC-AD 112 Introduction to Game Theory                                                                                                    This course introduces the basic concepts of elementary game theory in a way that allows students to use them in solving simple problems. Topics include: the basics of cooperative and non-cooperative game theory; basic solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and the core; and the extensions of these solutions to dynamic games and situations of incomplete information. Students are exposed to a variety of simple games with varied and useful applications: zero-sum games; the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma; coordination games; the Battle of the Sexes; repeated games; and elementary signaling games. The course relies on a wide array of example applications of game theory in the social sciences.    Students who have a strong mathematical background but who do not have the required Calculus pre-requisite are encouraged to contact Professor Chacon for a possible pre-requisite waiver.

The course is divided into two parts. Part 1 studies non-cooperative game theory: Nash equilibrium in static games; extensions such as subgame perfection for dynamic games of complete information; Bayesian Nash equilibrium for static games with incomplete information; and sequential equilibrium (with refinements) for dynamic games with incomplete information. Applications to the social sciences include strategic choice of electoral platforms, collusion, lobbying, bargaining, and signaling. Part 2 studies cooperative game theory, including common solution concepts such as the core and the stable set, as well as hybrid topics such as coalition and network formation, or mechanism design. Applications include: political party formation; dynamic agenda-setting; the construction and implementation of voting rules; and the study of social networks.

This makes the political economy of development a central area of research. While a student with an introductory background to political economy will have familiarity with theories based on voting, this course stresses a variety of other factors, such as the security of property rights, the creation of market and non-market institutions, lobbying and rent-seeking, collective action, social conflict, corruption, and the political economy of redistribution. Examples from historical experience as well as modern developing countries are used throughout the course.

In John Rawls&rsquo;s words, justice &ldquo;is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient or well-&shy;\u2010arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.&rdquo; To what extent are our contemporary social, political, and economic institutions just? How would we know?  In this course, we explore three fundamental questions about the ideal of a just society and what place the values of liberty and equality occupy in such a society:  1. Which liberties must a just society protect? Liberty of expression? Liberty of religion? Sexual liberty? Economic liberty? Political liberty?  2. What sorts of equality should a just society ensure? Equality of opportunity? Of economic outcome? Political equality? Equality for different religious and cultural groups?  3. Can a society ensure both liberty and equality? Or are these warring political values?

SOCSC-AD 113 Statistics and Probability for the Social Sciences                                                                                                                  The fundamental concepts of probability and the theoretical underpinnings of statistical inference form the foundation for data analysis in the social sciences. To this end, this course is designed to give students a rigorous foundation to both classical/Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to both probability and inference. We begin the semester with the axioms of probability, from which we develop the notions of distributions, random variables, random samples, and large sample theory. After this, we look at both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches to point/interval estimation and hypothesis testing. The course will end with an inference-based look at linear regression.    *Prerequisites: Calculus (MATH-AD 110) or Calculus with Applications (MATH-AD 111) or Mathematics for Social Scientists I (SOCSC-AD 101)    *Required for Economics majors in the theory track; other students with a focus on quantitative analysis are encouraged to take SOCSC-AD 113 instead of Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences (SOCSC-AD 110). This can be used as a substitute for SOCSC-AD 110.

SRPP-AD 115J Social Networks                                                                              Social networks are the subject of some of the most exciting recent advances in the natural and social sciences. This course provides an introduction to the major discoveries in the field of social networks, particularly advances during the last decade. It also provides students with an introduction to the methods and software used to analyze and visualize social networks. Topics include the small-world puzzle (six degrees of separation), the strength of weak ties, centrality, complexity, thresholds (&lsquo;tipping points&rsquo;), and the spread of diseases and fads. Case studies used in the course include topics such as the contagion of suicides, social influence on musical taste, sexual relationships among adolescents, interorganizational networks, and the network structure of the internet. Course readings are an engaging blend of popular social science texts, journal articles, and scientific papers.

The course is practice oriented: we will use a lot of examples, you will create your own survey design, and we will spend more than a quarter of the course learning Stata. At the end of this course you will be able to design and implement your own, high quality survey. Moreover, you will question much of the data that is collected by others because you know all the things that can go wrong in the process. For this course I assume that you are comfortable with basic statistics. This course may be substituted with a Methods Elective course.

relation to the economic tasks of life. It looks at how individuals within larger social groups, including communities, organizations, markets, and economies, make decisions about how much to work and play, spend and save. Economic analyses also consider how the economic decisions made by one group of people affect the decisions made by others. They then study how the aggregated effects of these decisions impact production, distribution, trade, and the consumption of goods and services across local regions, countries, and the world.   The Economics curriculum at NYU Abu Dhabi is designed to introduce students to these fundamental dynamics of human life and, in doing so, is grounded in three basic pedagogical principles:     Undergraduate students must be exposed to the \u201cbig ideas\u201d and pressing social issues of our world and given economic frameworks for thinking about them.   Meaningful study of economics requires being able to think about problems from local, regional, and global perspectives.   Effective economic reasoning increasingly involves a multi- disciplinary approach combining the best economic thinking with the best thinking in psychology, history, and politics.

It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples, and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.

The course begins with a discussion of some basic data used to analyze the relationships between macroeconomic aggregates such as production, inflation, and unemployment. Next, determinants of long run growth in national per capita incomes are discussed followed by a discussion of economic booms and recessions.

We study the manner in which consumers, producers and resource owners, acting through markets, determine the prices and output of goods and the allocation of productive resources. Consumers and producers are viewed as agents with well-defined objectives, choosing optimally under constraints on their resources. The price mechanism is viewed as an institution that disseminates information to decision makers&mdash;firms and consumers&mdash;and coordinates their behavior. We will study circumstances under which markets promote an efficient allocation of resources, as well as sources of market failure where the price mechanism can lead to inefficient outcomes. Students pursuing a specialization in theory must take Advanced Microeconomics (ECON-AD 305), in addition to Intermediate Microeconomics.    *Prerequisites: Principles of Microeconomics (ECON-AD 101), (Calculus (MATH-AD 110) or Calculus with Applications (MATH-AD 111)) and MATH-AD 112    *Students in the NYUNY Economics Dept: This course is equivalent to ECON-UA 10 Intermediate Microeconomics                                                                          Fall 2012 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Kevin Thom                                           -             TR, 8:15-9:30                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2012 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                  Bernard Caillaud, Andrew Schotter                                          -             MTR, 9:55-11:10                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2012 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Kevin Thom                                           -             TR, 10:10-11:25                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Maximilian Mihm                                           -             TR, 1:00-2:15 PM                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Maximilian Mihm                                           -             TR, 1:10-2:25 PM (Section II)                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 1 2014 ;             7 Weeks                                                                                                  Ennio Stacchetti                                          -             MW, 1:00-3:40 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Kevin Thom                                           -             TR, 12:45-2:00 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Maximilian Mihm                                           -             MW, 3:35 - 4:50 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Herv\u00e9 Cr\u00e8s                                           -             TR, 3:35-4:50 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Herv\u00e9 Cr\u00e8s                                           -             TR, 2:10-3:25 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

We place the crisis in historical context of the Great Depression and of the emerging market financial crises such as those that occurred in Latin American and East Asia. We contrast the European and American experiences. The course allows students to develop an analytical framework to understand the interactions of the housing market, the credit system, and the labor market. The policy responses are analyzed within the context of the political-economic environment.

Similarities and differences between the patterns that have occurred in many of the sub-Saharan economies and those of other countries and in other times will be discussed. Emphasis is given to the range of factors involved: history, politics, demographics, urban planning, climate change, and economics. Accra is a particularly interesting location for this course as Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to become independent following World War II, and its leadership was advised by one of the leading development economists, Nobel Prize winner Arthur Lewis, who gave considerable attention to the role of cities in the development process. The course also considers the important roles played by slavery, the structural adjustment programs, and the colonial urban planning policies drawing out their implications for Ghana&#39;s economic development and its urbanization. A number of site visits to other cities will be included.    Note: Students in the NYUNY Metropolitan Studies Dept: This course counts for the major and minor    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

This class will study the various ways that workers and firms interact in labor markets. What factors determine how much labor individuals supply to the market? What determines labor demand by firms? How do firms design contracts to provide the right incentives to their workers? What determines wage inequality in the economy? What can insights from labor economics contribute to debates surrounding policies such as immigration reform, welfare reform, and income taxation?

In 1908 GDP per capita in Argentina was around 80% of GDP per capita in US, where GDP per capita is the value of production divided by the size of the population. One hundred years later, in 2008, GDP per capita in Argentina was around 35% of GDP per capita in US. In the course we aim to understand why the development of Argentina has been so disastrous focussing on economic factors. We will compare Argentina with other countries in order to gain insight into the crucial factors for economic growth and development. We will first study the history of Argentina with emphasis on its economic development. Next we will go into the mechanisms of growth by studying basic economic theory about supply and demand, production, consumer choice and growth. Using our knowledge about the history of Argentina and economics, we will try to understand some of the main causes of the actual economic development of Argentina. The insights we gain from studying the Argentinian experience will help us understand that economic growth and development are sensitive and delicate phenomena, not just for Argentina but for any country. The course includes excursions to see traces of earlier times and their current impact on Buenos Aires and its culture.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

ECON-AD 221 Understanding Financial Crises                                             The purpose of this course is to understand the key facts and basic mechanisms concerning financial crises and some related topics. The course will first lay down some foundations by studying empirical evidence about crises as well as the basic crisis mechanisms (bank runs, sovereign default decision, currency collapse). The empirical facts will provide a long run perspective on the recurrence of different types of financial crises (banking crises, currency crises, and sovereign debt crises), and will study their causes, their resolutions, and their long run consequences. The crisis mechanisms will be introduced through very simple canonical models, putting the emphasis on intuition and insight over model technicalities. Once the foundations are in place, the course will open up to a series of topics mixing themes &ndash; such as crises and long run growth; inequality and crises; crises, stabilization and reforms &ndash; and in-depth study of major crises episodes &ndash; such as the Great Depression, the US Financial Crises of 2007-2008 and the Euro Crisis.

This course revisits some of the most fundamental assumptions concerning human behavior in economics such as selfishness and individual rationality; discuss evidence illustrating systematic violations of them; and provide explanations for them. Further, it discusses some of the important implications of the new behavioral models for economic policy, finance, marketing, management, and industrial economics. Students will participate in classroom experiments to gain a deeper understanding of the issues at hand. The continuous interplay between economic theory and empirical data throughout the course means that this unit will appeal to anyone with an interest in understanding human behavior.

The course starts with a careful study of the functioning of markets, culminating with the first and second theorem of welfare economics. The next topics cover an introduction to strategic behavior and game theory, and subsequently a study of market failures situations in the case of adverse selection and moral hazard. This course involves more formal analysis than the one used in Intermediate Microeconomics.

Modeling the subtle mixture of strategic interactions across those &ldquo;coalitions&rdquo;, and equitable compromises within coalitions, is the difficult task of cooperative game theory. The course introduces the formal models of cooperative behavior, both from the normative viewpoint of sharing the benefits of cooperation, and the positive analysis of coalition formation. Applications include competitive markets, the provision of local public goods and the emergence of federations, cost sharing of joint ventures, routing games on networks, and more.

It emphasizes accounting as the process through which relevant financial information concerning an economic entity is recorded and communicated to different parties, such as stockholders, creditors, tax authorities, investors, etc. The underlying rationale of accounting principles is discussed, aiming to provide students with a clear understanding of accounting concepts. In this course students learn about the relevance and informativeness of financial statement for decision making, as resource allocation, evaluation and contracting activities. In addition to text-oriented materials, the classes also include cases so that students can discuss applications of basic concepts, actual financial reports, and articles from newspapers.

The course considers market failures; the evaluation of public expenditures; and the incidence, efficiency, and effects of various taxes. The primary purpose is to use economic tools (mainly microeconomic) to study the impact of government policy on the distribution of resources. Topics include: welfare economics; public goods and externalities; public choice; important issues of government expenditure, taxation, and activity (e.g., international public goods and institutions, tax competition and coordination, education, social security and health care); fiscal federalism (including European integration); and mechanisms of political influence (e.g. elections and lobbying).

The system has recently suffered two extraordinary shocks - the collapse of the mortgage finance market and the \"vicious downward cycle\" caused by linkages between bank and sovereign creditworthiness. These shocks, which have thrown the Euro-American economies into a protracted Great Recession, threaten the euro and the European Union, and represent great challenges to US and European governments, financial institutions and their regulators. The German government, based in Berlin is a key decision maker in the efforts to stabilize the euro, the weaker Eurozone member countries and the European banking system, and the European Central Bank, another key player, is not far away in Frankfurt. This course provides a broad ranging exploration of these issues for students with only general knowledge of finance and economics.

This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

While the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. Indeed, the relationship between differentiation (finding a derivative) and integration (determining an integral) is described in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation that provides opportunities for rigorous analysis of proofs and theorems associated with the material. This course is primarily intended for students considering Mathematics as a major. Placement into Calculus is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination. With permission of the program in mathematics, Calculus with Applications may substitute for Calculus.    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.    May not be taken if MATH-AD 110 Calculus is completed    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017. This course can be substituted with MATH-AD 110 Calculus.                                   This course has a discussion section .

The class addresses three questions: Why do we want things? How do physical places organize our consumer desires? And how does place become an object of consumption? This class explores how the relationship between consumption and cities has developed by examining three key moments: world fairs and the invention of the department store in the late nineteenth century; the rise of malls in the mid-20th century and the contemporary period of digital commerce and the global commodity city. Readings include Thorstein Veblen&rsquo;s Theory of the Leisure Class, Karl Marx&rsquo;s essay on commodity fetishism, Max Weber&rsquo;s essays on economy and society, Georg Simmel&rsquo;s Metropolis and Mental Life and selections from Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s Arcades project. We relate these texts to changing forms of consumption in different settings, from Argentina to China and the United States.

The class will focus on major themes and issues such as the determinants of peaceful  cooperation and sustainable peace; the root causes of armed conflict; the determinants of ethnic conflict; the political economy of civil wars; the variables affecting the duration and termination of wars; the phenomenon of different forms of political violence-including protests, riots, military coups, political assassinations, and terrorism; and the politics and economics of peacebuilding. The course is highly interdisciplinary and will cover a wide variety of cases from a comparative perspective.

Topics include: the basics of cooperative and non-cooperative game theory; basic solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and the core; and the extensions of these solutions to dynamic games and situations of incomplete information. Students are exposed to a variety of simple games with varied and useful applications: zero-sum games; the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma; coordination games; the Battle of the Sexes; repeated games; and elementary signaling games. The course relies on a wide array of example applications of game theory in the social sciences.    Students who have a strong mathematical background but who do not have the required Calculus pre-requisite are encouraged to contact Professor Chacon for a possible pre-requisite waiver.

The course is divided into two parts. Part 1 studies non-cooperative game theory: Nash equilibrium in static games; extensions such as subgame perfection for dynamic games of complete information; Bayesian Nash equilibrium for static games with incomplete information; and sequential equilibrium (with refinements) for dynamic games with incomplete information. Applications to the social sciences include strategic choice of electoral platforms, collusion, lobbying, bargaining, and signaling. Part 2 studies cooperative game theory, including common solution concepts such as the core and the stable set, as well as hybrid topics such as coalition and network formation, or mechanism design. Applications include: political party formation; dynamic agenda-setting; the construction and implementation of voting rules; and the study of social networks.

This makes the political economy of development a central area of research. While a student with an introductory background to political economy will have familiarity with theories based on voting, this course stresses a variety of other factors, such as the security of property rights, the creation of market and non-market institutions, lobbying and rent-seeking, collective action, social conflict, corruption, and the political economy of redistribution. Examples from historical experience as well as modern developing countries are used throughout the course.

In John Rawls&rsquo;s words, justice &ldquo;is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient or well-&shy;\u2010arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.&rdquo; To what extent are our contemporary social, political, and economic institutions just? How would we know?  In this course, we explore three fundamental questions about the ideal of a just society and what place the values of liberty and equality occupy in such a society:  1. Which liberties must a just society protect? Liberty of expression? Liberty of religion? Sexual liberty? Economic liberty? Political liberty?  2. What sorts of equality should a just society ensure? Equality of opportunity? Of economic outcome? Political equality? Equality for different religious and cultural groups?  3. Can a society ensure both liberty and equality? Or are these warring political values?

SOCSC-AD 113 Statistics and Probability for the Social Sciences                                                                                                                  The fundamental concepts of probability and the theoretical underpinnings of statistical inference form the foundation for data analysis in the social sciences. To this end, this course is designed to give students a rigorous foundation to both classical/Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to both probability and inference. We begin the semester with the axioms of probability, from which we develop the notions of distributions, random variables, random samples, and large sample theory. After this, we look at both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches to point/interval estimation and hypothesis testing. The course will end with an inference-based look at linear regression.    *Prerequisites: Calculus (MATH-AD 110) or Calculus with Applications (MATH-AD 111) or Mathematics for Social Scientists I (SOCSC-AD 101)    *Required for Economics majors in the theory track; other students with a focus on quantitative analysis are encouraged to take SOCSC-AD 113 instead of Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences (SOCSC-AD 110). This can be used as a substitute for SOCSC-AD 110.

SRPP-AD 115J Social Networks                                                                              Social networks are the subject of some of the most exciting recent advances in the natural and social sciences. This course provides an introduction to the major discoveries in the field of social networks, particularly advances during the last decade. It also provides students with an introduction to the methods and software used to analyze and visualize social networks. Topics include the small-world puzzle (six degrees of separation), the strength of weak ties, centrality, complexity, thresholds (&lsquo;tipping points&rsquo;), and the spread of diseases and fads. Case studies used in the course include topics such as the contagion of suicides, social influence on musical taste, sexual relationships among adolescents, interorganizational networks, and the network structure of the internet. Course readings are an engaging blend of popular social science texts, journal articles, and scientific papers.

The course is practice oriented: we will use a lot of examples, you will create your own survey design, and we will spend more than a quarter of the course learning Stata. At the end of this course you will be able to design and implement your own, high quality survey. Moreover, you will question much of the data that is collected by others because you know all the things that can go wrong in the process. For this course I assume that you are comfortable with basic statistics. This course may be substituted with a Methods Elective course.

Students who elect to pursue the concentration are required to take four Economics courses: Principles of Microeconomics; Principles of Macroeconomics; and two additional courses in Economics as electives. Breadth electives do not count towards the Economics concentration.   Students being placed out of Principles of Microeconomics and/or Principles of Macroeconomics must substitute the comparable Intermediate Theory class.

It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples, and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.

The course begins with a discussion of some basic data used to analyze the relationships between macroeconomic aggregates such as production, inflation, and unemployment. Next, determinants of long run growth in national per capita incomes are discussed followed by a discussion of economic booms and recessions. The course concludes with descriptions of the tensions inherent in the formulation of monetary and fiscal macroeconomic policies and the pitfalls and opportunities afforded to nations within the context of an emergent global economy.    *Students NYUNY: This course counts for Societies and Social Sciences (College Core) credit;

We place the crisis in historical context of the Great Depression and of the emerging market financial crises such as those that occurred in Latin American and East Asia. We contrast the European and American experiences. The course allows students to develop an analytical framework to understand the interactions of the housing market, the credit system, and the labor market. The policy responses are analyzed within the context of the political-economic environment.

Similarities and differences between the patterns that have occurred in many of the sub-Saharan economies and those of other countries and in other times will be discussed. Emphasis is given to the range of factors involved: history, politics, demographics, urban planning, climate change, and economics. Accra is a particularly interesting location for this course as Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to become independent following World War II, and its leadership was advised by one of the leading development economists, Nobel Prize winner Arthur Lewis, who gave considerable attention to the role of cities in the development process. The course also considers the important roles played by slavery, the structural adjustment programs, and the colonial urban planning policies drawing out their implications for Ghana&#39;s economic development and its urbanization. A number of site visits to other cities will be included.    Note: Students in the NYUNY Metropolitan Studies Dept: This course counts for the major and minor    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra. Decision will be made by October 15.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

This class will study the various ways that workers and firms interact in labor markets. What factors determine how much labor individuals supply to the market? What determines labor demand by firms? How do firms design contracts to provide the right incentives to their workers? What determines wage inequality in the economy? What can insights from labor economics contribute to debates surrounding policies such as immigration reform, welfare reform, and income taxation? The class will expose students to the basic theoretical models used by economists to tackle these issues. We will also survey evidence from empirical studies on these topics.

In 1908 GDP per capita in Argentina was around 80% of GDP per capita in US, where GDP per capita is the value of production divided by the size of the population. One hundred years later, in 2008, GDP per capita in Argentina was around 35% of GDP per capita in US. In the course we aim to understand why the development of Argentina has been so disastrous focussing on economic factors. We will compare Argentina with other countries in order to gain insight into the crucial factors for economic growth and development. We will first study the history of Argentina with emphasis on its economic development. Next we will go into the mechanisms of growth by studying basic economic theory about supply and demand, production, consumer choice and growth. Using our knowledge about the history of Argentina and economics, we will try to understand some of the main causes of the actual economic development of Argentina. The insights we gain from studying the Argentinian experience will help us understand that economic growth and development are sensitive and delicate phenomena, not just for Argentina but for any country. The course includes excursions to see traces of earlier times and their current impact on Buenos Aires and its culture.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course revisits some of the most fundamental assumptions concerning human behavior in economics such as selfishness and individual rationality; discuss evidence illustrating systematic violations of them; and provide explanations for them. Further, it discusses some of the important implications of the new behavioral models for economic policy, finance, marketing, management, and industrial economics. Students will participate in classroom experiments to gain a deeper understanding of the issues at hand. The continuous interplay between economic theory and empirical data throughout the course means that this unit will appeal to anyone with an interest in understanding human behavior.

Modeling the subtle mixture of strategic interactions across those &ldquo;coalitions&rdquo;, and equitable compromises within coalitions, is the difficult task of cooperative game theory. The course introduces the formal models of cooperative behavior, both from the normative viewpoint of sharing the benefits of cooperation, and the positive analysis of coalition formation. Applications include competitive markets, the provision of local public goods and the emergence of federations, cost sharing of joint ventures, routing games on networks, and more.

The course considers market failures; the evaluation of public expenditures; and the incidence, efficiency, and effects of various taxes. The primary purpose is to use economic tools (mainly microeconomic) to study the impact of government policy on the distribution of resources. Topics include: welfare economics; public goods and externalities; public choice; important issues of government expenditure, taxation, and activity (e.g., international public goods and institutions, tax competition and coordination, education, social security and health care); fiscal federalism (including European integration); and mechanisms of political influence (e.g. elections and lobbying).

This course explores the process of national and global financial intermediation and its key elements involving commercial banking, investment banking, asset management and insurance. Individual classes deal with such topics as project finance, debt and equity new issues, mergers and acquisitions, financial derivatives and institutional funds management. Based on an understanding of the industry, additional classes focus on financial regulation and strategies of financial firms. The course is relatively non-technical and is intended to provide an overview of the global financial sector.

POLSC-AD 179J Political Conflict and Economic Development                                                                               It is now widely acknowledged that political conflicts play a major role in driving economic development trajectories. We will study how political conflicts impact economic development, using examples from Latin America&rsquo;s rich political and economic history to better understand the conflict-development relationship. The course will follow a seminar format and students will be encouraged to compare the conflict-development relationship in Latin America with that of their own country, and come up with explanations for differences between the two. The course will include multiple field trips to significant sites for Argentina&rsquo;s political conflicts.    *Note: Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for Politics in the Comparative Politics Politics field                                                                       January 2014                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                                      January 2015                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                          This course appears in...

Economics Major                                                    Economics is the study of human decision-making considered in relation to the economic tasks of life. It looks at how individuals within larger social groups, including communities, organizations, markets, and economies, make decisions about how much to work and play, spend and save.

relation to the economic tasks of life. It looks at how individuals within larger social groups, including communities, organizations, markets, and economies, make decisions about how much to work and play, spend and save. Economic analyses also consider how the economic decisions made by one group of people affect the decisions made by others. They then study how the aggregated effects of these decisions impact production, distribution, trade, and the consumption of goods and services across local regions, countries, and the world.   The Economics curriculum at NYU Abu Dhabi is designed to introduce students to these fundamental dynamics of human life and, in doing so, is grounded in three basic pedagogical principles:     Undergraduate students must be exposed to the \u201cbig ideas\u201d and pressing social issues of our world and given economic frameworks for thinking about them.   Meaningful study of economics requires being able to think about problems from local, regional, and global perspectives.   Effective economic reasoning increasingly involves a multi- disciplinary approach combining the best economic thinking with the best thinking in psychology, history, and politics.

It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples, and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.

The course begins with a discussion of some basic data used to analyze the relationships between macroeconomic aggregates such as production, inflation, and unemployment. Next, determinants of long run growth in national per capita incomes are discussed followed by a discussion of economic booms and recessions. The course concludes with descriptions of the tensions inherent in the formulation of monetary and fiscal macroeconomic policies and the pitfalls and opportunities afforded to nations within the context of an emergent global economy.    *Students NYUNY: This course counts for Societies and Social Sciences (College Core) credit;

We study the manner in which consumers, producers and resource owners, acting through markets, determine the prices and output of goods and the allocation of productive resources. Consumers and producers are viewed as agents with well-defined objectives, choosing optimally under constraints on their resources. The price mechanism is viewed as an institution that disseminates information to decision makers&mdash;firms and consumers&mdash;and coordinates their behavior. We will study circumstances under which markets promote an efficient allocation of resources, as well as sources of market failure where the price mechanism can lead to inefficient outcomes. Students pursuing a specialization in theory must take Advanced Microeconomics (ECON-AD 305), in addition to Intermediate Microeconomics.    *Prerequisites: Principles of Microeconomics (ECON-AD 101), (Calculus (MATH-AD 110) or Calculus with Applications (MATH-AD 111)) and MATH-AD 112    *Students in the NYUNY Economics Dept: This course is equivalent to ECON-UA 10 Intermediate Microeconomics                                                                          Fall 2012 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Kevin Thom                                           -             TR, 8:15-9:30                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2012 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                  Bernard Caillaud, Andrew Schotter                                          -             MTR, 9:55-11:10                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2012 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Kevin Thom                                           -             TR, 10:10-11:25                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Maximilian Mihm                                           -             TR, 1:00-2:15 PM                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Maximilian Mihm                                           -             TR, 1:10-2:25 PM (Section II)                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 1 2014 ;             7 Weeks                                                                                                  Ennio Stacchetti                                          -             MW, 1:00-3:40 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Kevin Thom                                           -             TR, 12:45-2:00 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Maximilian Mihm                                           -             MW, 3:35 - 4:50 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Herv\u00e9 Cr\u00e8s                                           -             TR, 3:35-4:50 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Herv\u00e9 Cr\u00e8s                                           -             TR, 2:10-3:25 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

We place the crisis in historical context of the Great Depression and of the emerging market financial crises such as those that occurred in Latin American and East Asia. We contrast the European and American experiences. The course allows students to develop an analytical framework to understand the interactions of the housing market, the credit system, and the labor market. The policy responses are analyzed within the context of the political-economic environment.

Similarities and differences between the patterns that have occurred in many of the sub-Saharan economies and those of other countries and in other times will be discussed. Emphasis is given to the range of factors involved: history, politics, demographics, urban planning, climate change, and economics. Accra is a particularly interesting location for this course as Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to become independent following World War II, and its leadership was advised by one of the leading development economists, Nobel Prize winner Arthur Lewis, who gave considerable attention to the role of cities in the development process. The course also considers the important roles played by slavery, the structural adjustment programs, and the colonial urban planning policies drawing out their implications for Ghana&#39;s economic development and its urbanization. A number of site visits to other cities will be included.    Note: Students in the NYUNY Metropolitan Studies Dept: This course counts for the major and minor    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

This class will study the various ways that workers and firms interact in labor markets. What factors determine how much labor individuals supply to the market? What determines labor demand by firms? How do firms design contracts to provide the right incentives to their workers? What determines wage inequality in the economy? What can insights from labor economics contribute to debates surrounding policies such as immigration reform, welfare reform, and income taxation?

In 1908 GDP per capita in Argentina was around 80% of GDP per capita in US, where GDP per capita is the value of production divided by the size of the population. One hundred years later, in 2008, GDP per capita in Argentina was around 35% of GDP per capita in US. In the course we aim to understand why the development of Argentina has been so disastrous focussing on economic factors. We will compare Argentina with other countries in order to gain insight into the crucial factors for economic growth and development. We will first study the history of Argentina with emphasis on its economic development. Next we will go into the mechanisms of growth by studying basic economic theory about supply and demand, production, consumer choice and growth. Using our knowledge about the history of Argentina and economics, we will try to understand some of the main causes of the actual economic development of Argentina. The insights we gain from studying the Argentinian experience will help us understand that economic growth and development are sensitive and delicate phenomena, not just for Argentina but for any country. The course includes excursions to see traces of earlier times and their current impact on Buenos Aires and its culture.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

ECON-AD 221 Understanding Financial Crises                                             The purpose of this course is to understand the key facts and basic mechanisms concerning financial crises and some related topics. The course will first lay down some foundations by studying empirical evidence about crises as well as the basic crisis mechanisms (bank runs, sovereign default decision, currency collapse). The empirical facts will provide a long run perspective on the recurrence of different types of financial crises (banking crises, currency crises, and sovereign debt crises), and will study their causes, their resolutions, and their long run consequences. The crisis mechanisms will be introduced through very simple canonical models, putting the emphasis on intuition and insight over model technicalities. Once the foundations are in place, the course will open up to a series of topics mixing themes &ndash; such as crises and long run growth; inequality and crises; crises, stabilization and reforms &ndash; and in-depth study of major crises episodes &ndash; such as the Great Depression, the US Financial Crises of 2007-2008 and the Euro Crisis.

This course revisits some of the most fundamental assumptions concerning human behavior in economics such as selfishness and individual rationality; discuss evidence illustrating systematic violations of them; and provide explanations for them. Further, it discusses some of the important implications of the new behavioral models for economic policy, finance, marketing, management, and industrial economics. Students will participate in classroom experiments to gain a deeper understanding of the issues at hand. The continuous interplay between economic theory and empirical data throughout the course means that this unit will appeal to anyone with an interest in understanding human behavior.

The course starts with a careful study of the functioning of markets, culminating with the first and second theorem of welfare economics. The next topics cover an introduction to strategic behavior and game theory, and subsequently a study of market failures situations in the case of adverse selection and moral hazard. This course involves more formal analysis than the one used in Intermediate Microeconomics.

Modeling the subtle mixture of strategic interactions across those &ldquo;coalitions&rdquo;, and equitable compromises within coalitions, is the difficult task of cooperative game theory. The course introduces the formal models of cooperative behavior, both from the normative viewpoint of sharing the benefits of cooperation, and the positive analysis of coalition formation. Applications include competitive markets, the provision of local public goods and the emergence of federations, cost sharing of joint ventures, routing games on networks, and more.

It emphasizes accounting as the process through which relevant financial information concerning an economic entity is recorded and communicated to different parties, such as stockholders, creditors, tax authorities, investors, etc. The underlying rationale of accounting principles is discussed, aiming to provide students with a clear understanding of accounting concepts. In this course students learn about the relevance and informativeness of financial statement for decision making, as resource allocation, evaluation and contracting activities. In addition to text-oriented materials, the classes also include cases so that students can discuss applications of basic concepts, actual financial reports, and articles from newspapers.

The course considers market failures; the evaluation of public expenditures; and the incidence, efficiency, and effects of various taxes. The primary purpose is to use economic tools (mainly microeconomic) to study the impact of government policy on the distribution of resources. Topics include: welfare economics; public goods and externalities; public choice; important issues of government expenditure, taxation, and activity (e.g., international public goods and institutions, tax competition and coordination, education, social security and health care); fiscal federalism (including European integration); and mechanisms of political influence (e.g. elections and lobbying).

The system has recently suffered two extraordinary shocks - the collapse of the mortgage finance market and the \"vicious downward cycle\" caused by linkages between bank and sovereign creditworthiness. These shocks, which have thrown the Euro-American economies into a protracted Great Recession, threaten the euro and the European Union, and represent great challenges to US and European governments, financial institutions and their regulators. The German government, based in Berlin is a key decision maker in the efforts to stabilize the euro, the weaker Eurozone member countries and the European banking system, and the European Central Bank, another key player, is not far away in Frankfurt. This course provides a broad ranging exploration of these issues for students with only general knowledge of finance and economics.

This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

While the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. Indeed, the relationship between differentiation (finding a derivative) and integration (determining an integral) is described in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation that provides opportunities for rigorous analysis of proofs and theorems associated with the material. This course is primarily intended for students considering Mathematics as a major. Placement into Calculus is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination. With permission of the program in mathematics, Calculus with Applications may substitute for Calculus.    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.    May not be taken if MATH-AD 110 Calculus is completed    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017. This course can be substituted with MATH-AD 110 Calculus.                                   This course has a discussion section .

The class addresses three questions: Why do we want things? How do physical places organize our consumer desires? And how does place become an object of consumption? This class explores how the relationship between consumption and cities has developed by examining three key moments: world fairs and the invention of the department store in the late nineteenth century; the rise of malls in the mid-20th century and the contemporary period of digital commerce and the global commodity city. Readings include Thorstein Veblen&rsquo;s Theory of the Leisure Class, Karl Marx&rsquo;s essay on commodity fetishism, Max Weber&rsquo;s essays on economy and society, Georg Simmel&rsquo;s Metropolis and Mental Life and selections from Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s Arcades project. We relate these texts to changing forms of consumption in different settings, from Argentina to China and the United States.

The class will focus on major themes and issues such as the determinants of peaceful  cooperation and sustainable peace; the root causes of armed conflict; the determinants of ethnic conflict; the political economy of civil wars; the variables affecting the duration and termination of wars; the phenomenon of different forms of political violence-including protests, riots, military coups, political assassinations, and terrorism; and the politics and economics of peacebuilding. The course is highly interdisciplinary and will cover a wide variety of cases from a comparative perspective.

Topics include: the basics of cooperative and non-cooperative game theory; basic solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and the core; and the extensions of these solutions to dynamic games and situations of incomplete information. Students are exposed to a variety of simple games with varied and useful applications: zero-sum games; the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma; coordination games; the Battle of the Sexes; repeated games; and elementary signaling games. The course relies on a wide array of example applications of game theory in the social sciences.    Students who have a strong mathematical background but who do not have the required Calculus pre-requisite are encouraged to contact Professor Chacon for a possible pre-requisite waiver.

The course is divided into two parts. Part 1 studies non-cooperative game theory: Nash equilibrium in static games; extensions such as subgame perfection for dynamic games of complete information; Bayesian Nash equilibrium for static games with incomplete information; and sequential equilibrium (with refinements) for dynamic games with incomplete information. Applications to the social sciences include strategic choice of electoral platforms, collusion, lobbying, bargaining, and signaling. Part 2 studies cooperative game theory, including common solution concepts such as the core and the stable set, as well as hybrid topics such as coalition and network formation, or mechanism design. Applications include: political party formation; dynamic agenda-setting; the construction and implementation of voting rules; and the study of social networks.

This makes the political economy of development a central area of research. While a student with an introductory background to political economy will have familiarity with theories based on voting, this course stresses a variety of other factors, such as the security of property rights, the creation of market and non-market institutions, lobbying and rent-seeking, collective action, social conflict, corruption, and the political economy of redistribution. Examples from historical experience as well as modern developing countries are used throughout the course.

In John Rawls&rsquo;s words, justice &ldquo;is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient or well-&shy;\u2010arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.&rdquo; To what extent are our contemporary social, political, and economic institutions just? How would we know?  In this course, we explore three fundamental questions about the ideal of a just society and what place the values of liberty and equality occupy in such a society:  1. Which liberties must a just society protect? Liberty of expression? Liberty of religion? Sexual liberty? Economic liberty? Political liberty?  2. What sorts of equality should a just society ensure? Equality of opportunity? Of economic outcome? Political equality? Equality for different religious and cultural groups?  3. Can a society ensure both liberty and equality? Or are these warring political values?

SOCSC-AD 113 Statistics and Probability for the Social Sciences                                                                                                                  The fundamental concepts of probability and the theoretical underpinnings of statistical inference form the foundation for data analysis in the social sciences. To this end, this course is designed to give students a rigorous foundation to both classical/Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to both probability and inference. We begin the semester with the axioms of probability, from which we develop the notions of distributions, random variables, random samples, and large sample theory. After this, we look at both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches to point/interval estimation and hypothesis testing. The course will end with an inference-based look at linear regression.    *Prerequisites: Calculus (MATH-AD 110) or Calculus with Applications (MATH-AD 111) or Mathematics for Social Scientists I (SOCSC-AD 101)    *Required for Economics majors in the theory track; other students with a focus on quantitative analysis are encouraged to take SOCSC-AD 113 instead of Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences (SOCSC-AD 110). This can be used as a substitute for SOCSC-AD 110.

SRPP-AD 115J Social Networks                                                                              Social networks are the subject of some of the most exciting recent advances in the natural and social sciences. This course provides an introduction to the major discoveries in the field of social networks, particularly advances during the last decade. It also provides students with an introduction to the methods and software used to analyze and visualize social networks. Topics include the small-world puzzle (six degrees of separation), the strength of weak ties, centrality, complexity, thresholds (&lsquo;tipping points&rsquo;), and the spread of diseases and fads. Case studies used in the course include topics such as the contagion of suicides, social influence on musical taste, sexual relationships among adolescents, interorganizational networks, and the network structure of the internet. Course readings are an engaging blend of popular social science texts, journal articles, and scientific papers.

The course is practice oriented: we will use a lot of examples, you will create your own survey design, and we will spend more than a quarter of the course learning Stata. At the end of this course you will be able to design and implement your own, high quality survey. Moreover, you will question much of the data that is collected by others because you know all the things that can go wrong in the process. For this course I assume that you are comfortable with basic statistics. This course may be substituted with a Methods Elective course.

Students who elect to pursue the concentration are required to take four Economics courses: Principles of Microeconomics; Principles of Macroeconomics; and two additional courses in Economics as electives. Breadth electives do not count towards the Economics concentration.   Students being placed out of Principles of Microeconomics and/or Principles of Macroeconomics must substitute the comparable Intermediate Theory class.

It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples, and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.

The course begins with a discussion of some basic data used to analyze the relationships between macroeconomic aggregates such as production, inflation, and unemployment. Next, determinants of long run growth in national per capita incomes are discussed followed by a discussion of economic booms and recessions. The course concludes with descriptions of the tensions inherent in the formulation of monetary and fiscal macroeconomic policies and the pitfalls and opportunities afforded to nations within the context of an emergent global economy.    *Students NYUNY: This course counts for Societies and Social Sciences (College Core) credit;

We place the crisis in historical context of the Great Depression and of the emerging market financial crises such as those that occurred in Latin American and East Asia. We contrast the European and American experiences. The course allows students to develop an analytical framework to understand the interactions of the housing market, the credit system, and the labor market. The policy responses are analyzed within the context of the political-economic environment.

Similarities and differences between the patterns that have occurred in many of the sub-Saharan economies and those of other countries and in other times will be discussed. Emphasis is given to the range of factors involved: history, politics, demographics, urban planning, climate change, and economics. Accra is a particularly interesting location for this course as Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to become independent following World War II, and its leadership was advised by one of the leading development economists, Nobel Prize winner Arthur Lewis, who gave considerable attention to the role of cities in the development process. The course also considers the important roles played by slavery, the structural adjustment programs, and the colonial urban planning policies drawing out their implications for Ghana&#39;s economic development and its urbanization. A number of site visits to other cities will be included.    Note: Students in the NYUNY Metropolitan Studies Dept: This course counts for the major and minor    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra. Decision will be made by October 15.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

This class will study the various ways that workers and firms interact in labor markets. What factors determine how much labor individuals supply to the market? What determines labor demand by firms? How do firms design contracts to provide the right incentives to their workers? What determines wage inequality in the economy? What can insights from labor economics contribute to debates surrounding policies such as immigration reform, welfare reform, and income taxation? The class will expose students to the basic theoretical models used by economists to tackle these issues. We will also survey evidence from empirical studies on these topics.

In 1908 GDP per capita in Argentina was around 80% of GDP per capita in US, where GDP per capita is the value of production divided by the size of the population. One hundred years later, in 2008, GDP per capita in Argentina was around 35% of GDP per capita in US. In the course we aim to understand why the development of Argentina has been so disastrous focussing on economic factors. We will compare Argentina with other countries in order to gain insight into the crucial factors for economic growth and development. We will first study the history of Argentina with emphasis on its economic development. Next we will go into the mechanisms of growth by studying basic economic theory about supply and demand, production, consumer choice and growth. Using our knowledge about the history of Argentina and economics, we will try to understand some of the main causes of the actual economic development of Argentina. The insights we gain from studying the Argentinian experience will help us understand that economic growth and development are sensitive and delicate phenomena, not just for Argentina but for any country. The course includes excursions to see traces of earlier times and their current impact on Buenos Aires and its culture.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course revisits some of the most fundamental assumptions concerning human behavior in economics such as selfishness and individual rationality; discuss evidence illustrating systematic violations of them; and provide explanations for them. Further, it discusses some of the important implications of the new behavioral models for economic policy, finance, marketing, management, and industrial economics. Students will participate in classroom experiments to gain a deeper understanding of the issues at hand. The continuous interplay between economic theory and empirical data throughout the course means that this unit will appeal to anyone with an interest in understanding human behavior.

Modeling the subtle mixture of strategic interactions across those &ldquo;coalitions&rdquo;, and equitable compromises within coalitions, is the difficult task of cooperative game theory. The course introduces the formal models of cooperative behavior, both from the normative viewpoint of sharing the benefits of cooperation, and the positive analysis of coalition formation. Applications include competitive markets, the provision of local public goods and the emergence of federations, cost sharing of joint ventures, routing games on networks, and more.

The course considers market failures; the evaluation of public expenditures; and the incidence, efficiency, and effects of various taxes. The primary purpose is to use economic tools (mainly microeconomic) to study the impact of government policy on the distribution of resources. Topics include: welfare economics; public goods and externalities; public choice; important issues of government expenditure, taxation, and activity (e.g., international public goods and institutions, tax competition and coordination, education, social security and health care); fiscal federalism (including European integration); and mechanisms of political influence (e.g. elections and lobbying).

This course explores the process of national and global financial intermediation and its key elements involving commercial banking, investment banking, asset management and insurance. Individual classes deal with such topics as project finance, debt and equity new issues, mergers and acquisitions, financial derivatives and institutional funds management. Based on an understanding of the industry, additional classes focus on financial regulation and strategies of financial firms. The course is relatively non-technical and is intended to provide an overview of the global financial sector.

POLSC-AD 179J Political Conflict and Economic Development                                                                               It is now widely acknowledged that political conflicts play a major role in driving economic development trajectories. We will study how political conflicts impact economic development, using examples from Latin America&rsquo;s rich political and economic history to better understand the conflict-development relationship. The course will follow a seminar format and students will be encouraged to compare the conflict-development relationship in Latin America with that of their own country, and come up with explanations for differences between the two. The course will include multiple field trips to significant sites for Argentina&rsquo;s political conflicts.    *Note: Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for Politics in the Comparative Politics Politics field                                                                       January 2014                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                                      January 2015                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                          This course appears in...

Economics Major                                                    Economics is the study of human decision-making considered in relation to the economic tasks of life. It looks at how individuals within larger social groups, including communities, organizations, markets, and economies, make decisions about how much to work and play, spend and save.

   Economics is the study of human decision-making, considered in relation to the economic tasks of life. It looks at how individuals within larger social groups, including communities, organizations, markets, and economies, make decisions about how much to work and play, spend and save. Economic analyses also consider how the economic decisions made by one group of people affect the decisions made by others. They then study how the aggregated effects of these decisions impact production, distribution, trade, and the consumption of goods and services across local regions, countries, and the world.   The Economics curriculum at NYU Abu Dhabi is designed to introduce students to these fundamental dynamics of human life and, in doing so, is grounded in three basic pedagogical principles:     Undergraduate students must be exposed to the \u201cbig ideas\u201d and pressing social issues of our world and given economic frameworks for thinking about them.   Meaningful study of economics requires being able to think about problems from local, regional, and global perspectives.   Effective economic reasoning increasingly involves a multi- disciplinary approach combining the best economic thinking with the best thinking in psychology, history, and politics.

It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples, and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.

The course begins with a discussion of some basic data used to analyze the relationships between macroeconomic aggregates such as production, inflation, and unemployment. Next, determinants of long run growth in national per capita incomes are discussed followed by a discussion of economic booms and recessions. The course concludes with descriptions of the tensions inherent in the formulation of monetary and fiscal macroeconomic policies and the pitfalls and opportunities afforded to nations within the context of an emergent global economy.    *Students NYUNY: This course counts for Societies and Social Sciences (College Core) credit;

We study the manner in which consumers, producers and resource owners, acting through markets, determine the prices and output of goods and the allocation of productive resources. Consumers and producers are viewed as agents with well-defined objectives, choosing optimally under constraints on their resources. The price mechanism is viewed as an institution that disseminates information to decision makers&mdash;firms and consumers&mdash;and coordinates their behavior. We will study circumstances under which markets promote an efficient allocation of resources, as well as sources of market failure where the price mechanism can lead to inefficient outcomes. Students pursuing a specialization in theory must take Advanced Microeconomics (ECON-AD 305), in addition to Intermediate Microeconomics.    *Prerequisites: Principles of Microeconomics (ECON-AD 101), (Calculus (MATH-AD 110) or Calculus with Applications (MATH-AD 111)) and MATH-AD 112    *Students in the NYUNY Economics Dept: This course is equivalent to ECON-UA 10 Intermediate Microeconomics                                                                          Fall 2012 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Kevin Thom                                           -             TR, 8:15-9:30                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2012 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                  Bernard Caillaud, Andrew Schotter                                          -             MTR, 9:55-11:10                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2012 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Kevin Thom                                           -             TR, 10:10-11:25                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Maximilian Mihm                                           -             TR, 1:00-2:15 PM                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Maximilian Mihm                                           -             TR, 1:10-2:25 PM (Section II)                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 1 2014 ;             7 Weeks                                                                                                  Ennio Stacchetti                                          -             MW, 1:00-3:40 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Kevin Thom                                           -             TR, 12:45-2:00 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Maximilian Mihm                                           -             MW, 3:35 - 4:50 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Herv\u00e9 Cr\u00e8s                                           -             TR, 3:35-4:50 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Herv\u00e9 Cr\u00e8s                                           -             TR, 2:10-3:25 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

We place the crisis in historical context of the Great Depression and of the emerging market financial crises such as those that occurred in Latin American and East Asia. We contrast the European and American experiences. The course allows students to develop an analytical framework to understand the interactions of the housing market, the credit system, and the labor market. The policy responses are analyzed within the context of the political-economic environment.

Similarities and differences between the patterns that have occurred in many of the sub-Saharan economies and those of other countries and in other times will be discussed. Emphasis is given to the range of factors involved: history, politics, demographics, urban planning, climate change, and economics. Accra is a particularly interesting location for this course as Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to become independent following World War II, and its leadership was advised by one of the leading development economists, Nobel Prize winner Arthur Lewis, who gave considerable attention to the role of cities in the development process. The course also considers the important roles played by slavery, the structural adjustment programs, and the colonial urban planning policies drawing out their implications for Ghana&#39;s economic development and its urbanization. A number of site visits to other cities will be included.    Note: Students in the NYUNY Metropolitan Studies Dept: This course counts for the major and minor    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

This class will study the various ways that workers and firms interact in labor markets. What factors determine how much labor individuals supply to the market? What determines labor demand by firms? How do firms design contracts to provide the right incentives to their workers? What determines wage inequality in the economy? What can insights from labor economics contribute to debates surrounding policies such as immigration reform, welfare reform, and income taxation?

In 1908 GDP per capita in Argentina was around 80% of GDP per capita in US, where GDP per capita is the value of production divided by the size of the population. One hundred years later, in 2008, GDP per capita in Argentina was around 35% of GDP per capita in US. In the course we aim to understand why the development of Argentina has been so disastrous focussing on economic factors. We will compare Argentina with other countries in order to gain insight into the crucial factors for economic growth and development. We will first study the history of Argentina with emphasis on its economic development. Next we will go into the mechanisms of growth by studying basic economic theory about supply and demand, production, consumer choice and growth. Using our knowledge about the history of Argentina and economics, we will try to understand some of the main causes of the actual economic development of Argentina. The insights we gain from studying the Argentinian experience will help us understand that economic growth and development are sensitive and delicate phenomena, not just for Argentina but for any country. The course includes excursions to see traces of earlier times and their current impact on Buenos Aires and its culture.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

ECON-AD 221 Understanding Financial Crises                                             The purpose of this course is to understand the key facts and basic mechanisms concerning financial crises and some related topics. The course will first lay down some foundations by studying empirical evidence about crises as well as the basic crisis mechanisms (bank runs, sovereign default decision, currency collapse). The empirical facts will provide a long run perspective on the recurrence of different types of financial crises (banking crises, currency crises, and sovereign debt crises), and will study their causes, their resolutions, and their long run consequences. The crisis mechanisms will be introduced through very simple canonical models, putting the emphasis on intuition and insight over model technicalities. Once the foundations are in place, the course will open up to a series of topics mixing themes &ndash; such as crises and long run growth; inequality and crises; crises, stabilization and reforms &ndash; and in-depth study of major crises episodes &ndash; such as the Great Depression, the US Financial Crises of 2007-2008 and the Euro Crisis.

This course revisits some of the most fundamental assumptions concerning human behavior in economics such as selfishness and individual rationality; discuss evidence illustrating systematic violations of them; and provide explanations for them. Further, it discusses some of the important implications of the new behavioral models for economic policy, finance, marketing, management, and industrial economics. Students will participate in classroom experiments to gain a deeper understanding of the issues at hand. The continuous interplay between economic theory and empirical data throughout the course means that this unit will appeal to anyone with an interest in understanding human behavior.

The course starts with a careful study of the functioning of markets, culminating with the first and second theorem of welfare economics. The next topics cover an introduction to strategic behavior and game theory, and subsequently a study of market failures situations in the case of adverse selection and moral hazard. This course involves more formal analysis than the one used in Intermediate Microeconomics.

Modeling the subtle mixture of strategic interactions across those &ldquo;coalitions&rdquo;, and equitable compromises within coalitions, is the difficult task of cooperative game theory. The course introduces the formal models of cooperative behavior, both from the normative viewpoint of sharing the benefits of cooperation, and the positive analysis of coalition formation. Applications include competitive markets, the provision of local public goods and the emergence of federations, cost sharing of joint ventures, routing games on networks, and more.

It emphasizes accounting as the process through which relevant financial information concerning an economic entity is recorded and communicated to different parties, such as stockholders, creditors, tax authorities, investors, etc. The underlying rationale of accounting principles is discussed, aiming to provide students with a clear understanding of accounting concepts. In this course students learn about the relevance and informativeness of financial statement for decision making, as resource allocation, evaluation and contracting activities. In addition to text-oriented materials, the classes also include cases so that students can discuss applications of basic concepts, actual financial reports, and articles from newspapers.

The course considers market failures; the evaluation of public expenditures; and the incidence, efficiency, and effects of various taxes. The primary purpose is to use economic tools (mainly microeconomic) to study the impact of government policy on the distribution of resources. Topics include: welfare economics; public goods and externalities; public choice; important issues of government expenditure, taxation, and activity (e.g., international public goods and institutions, tax competition and coordination, education, social security and health care); fiscal federalism (including European integration); and mechanisms of political influence (e.g. elections and lobbying).

The system has recently suffered two extraordinary shocks - the collapse of the mortgage finance market and the \"vicious downward cycle\" caused by linkages between bank and sovereign creditworthiness. These shocks, which have thrown the Euro-American economies into a protracted Great Recession, threaten the euro and the European Union, and represent great challenges to US and European governments, financial institutions and their regulators. The German government, based in Berlin is a key decision maker in the efforts to stabilize the euro, the weaker Eurozone member countries and the European banking system, and the European Central Bank, another key player, is not far away in Frankfurt. This course provides a broad ranging exploration of these issues for students with only general knowledge of finance and economics.

This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

While the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. Indeed, the relationship between differentiation (finding a derivative) and integration (determining an integral) is described in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation that provides opportunities for rigorous analysis of proofs and theorems associated with the material. This course is primarily intended for students considering Mathematics as a major. Placement into Calculus is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination. With permission of the program in mathematics, Calculus with Applications may substitute for Calculus.    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.    May not be taken if MATH-AD 110 Calculus is completed    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017. This course can be substituted with MATH-AD 110 Calculus.                                   This course has a discussion section .

The class addresses three questions: Why do we want things? How do physical places organize our consumer desires? And how does place become an object of consumption? This class explores how the relationship between consumption and cities has developed by examining three key moments: world fairs and the invention of the department store in the late nineteenth century; the rise of malls in the mid-20th century and the contemporary period of digital commerce and the global commodity city. Readings include Thorstein Veblen&rsquo;s Theory of the Leisure Class, Karl Marx&rsquo;s essay on commodity fetishism, Max Weber&rsquo;s essays on economy and society, Georg Simmel&rsquo;s Metropolis and Mental Life and selections from Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s Arcades project. We relate these texts to changing forms of consumption in different settings, from Argentina to China and the United States.

The class will focus on major themes and issues such as the determinants of peaceful  cooperation and sustainable peace; the root causes of armed conflict; the determinants of ethnic conflict; the political economy of civil wars; the variables affecting the duration and termination of wars; the phenomenon of different forms of political violence-including protests, riots, military coups, political assassinations, and terrorism; and the politics and economics of peacebuilding. The course is highly interdisciplinary and will cover a wide variety of cases from a comparative perspective.

Topics include: the basics of cooperative and non-cooperative game theory; basic solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and the core; and the extensions of these solutions to dynamic games and situations of incomplete information. Students are exposed to a variety of simple games with varied and useful applications: zero-sum games; the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma; coordination games; the Battle of the Sexes; repeated games; and elementary signaling games. The course relies on a wide array of example applications of game theory in the social sciences.    Students who have a strong mathematical background but who do not have the required Calculus pre-requisite are encouraged to contact Professor Chacon for a possible pre-requisite waiver.

The course is divided into two parts. Part 1 studies non-cooperative game theory: Nash equilibrium in static games; extensions such as subgame perfection for dynamic games of complete information; Bayesian Nash equilibrium for static games with incomplete information; and sequential equilibrium (with refinements) for dynamic games with incomplete information. Applications to the social sciences include strategic choice of electoral platforms, collusion, lobbying, bargaining, and signaling. Part 2 studies cooperative game theory, including common solution concepts such as the core and the stable set, as well as hybrid topics such as coalition and network formation, or mechanism design. Applications include: political party formation; dynamic agenda-setting; the construction and implementation of voting rules; and the study of social networks.

This makes the political economy of development a central area of research. While a student with an introductory background to political economy will have familiarity with theories based on voting, this course stresses a variety of other factors, such as the security of property rights, the creation of market and non-market institutions, lobbying and rent-seeking, collective action, social conflict, corruption, and the political economy of redistribution. Examples from historical experience as well as modern developing countries are used throughout the course.

In John Rawls&rsquo;s words, justice &ldquo;is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient or well-&shy;\u2010arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.&rdquo; To what extent are our contemporary social, political, and economic institutions just? How would we know?  In this course, we explore three fundamental questions about the ideal of a just society and what place the values of liberty and equality occupy in such a society:  1. Which liberties must a just society protect? Liberty of expression? Liberty of religion? Sexual liberty? Economic liberty? Political liberty?  2. What sorts of equality should a just society ensure? Equality of opportunity? Of economic outcome? Political equality? Equality for different religious and cultural groups?  3. Can a society ensure both liberty and equality? Or are these warring political values?

SOCSC-AD 113 Statistics and Probability for the Social Sciences                                                                                                                  The fundamental concepts of probability and the theoretical underpinnings of statistical inference form the foundation for data analysis in the social sciences. To this end, this course is designed to give students a rigorous foundation to both classical/Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to both probability and inference. We begin the semester with the axioms of probability, from which we develop the notions of distributions, random variables, random samples, and large sample theory. After this, we look at both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches to point/interval estimation and hypothesis testing. The course will end with an inference-based look at linear regression.    *Prerequisites: Calculus (MATH-AD 110) or Calculus with Applications (MATH-AD 111) or Mathematics for Social Scientists I (SOCSC-AD 101)    *Required for Economics majors in the theory track; other students with a focus on quantitative analysis are encouraged to take SOCSC-AD 113 instead of Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences (SOCSC-AD 110). This can be used as a substitute for SOCSC-AD 110.

SRPP-AD 115J Social Networks                                                                              Social networks are the subject of some of the most exciting recent advances in the natural and social sciences. This course provides an introduction to the major discoveries in the field of social networks, particularly advances during the last decade. It also provides students with an introduction to the methods and software used to analyze and visualize social networks. Topics include the small-world puzzle (six degrees of separation), the strength of weak ties, centrality, complexity, thresholds (&lsquo;tipping points&rsquo;), and the spread of diseases and fads. Case studies used in the course include topics such as the contagion of suicides, social influence on musical taste, sexual relationships among adolescents, interorganizational networks, and the network structure of the internet. Course readings are an engaging blend of popular social science texts, journal articles, and scientific papers.

The course is practice oriented: we will use a lot of examples, you will create your own survey design, and we will spend more than a quarter of the course learning Stata. At the end of this course you will be able to design and implement your own, high quality survey. Moreover, you will question much of the data that is collected by others because you know all the things that can go wrong in the process. For this course I assume that you are comfortable with basic statistics. This course may be substituted with a Methods Elective course.
