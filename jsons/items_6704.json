By Sharon Shattuck February 14th, 2009                        Print                   When you meet Tasha Ortiz, the first thing that you notice is her smile. It\u2019s huge and perfect, and it wells up often, eclipsing half her face. You see the sparkle in her eyes as she embraces you and gives you a friendly peck on the cheek. And then you notice her Adam\u2019s apple, her square jaw, her makeup \u2014 caked heavy to conceal freshly shaved stubble that strains toward the surface of her skin. Tasha is transgendered and is accustomed to the confusion her appearance causes in others.   \u201cThe 2 train is used to me,\u201d Ortiz said as she and her friend Dada walked to her neighborhood subway stop. \u201cBut, if I get on the Q train, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s a man!\u2019\u201d She and Dada laughed. When you\u2019re Tasha Ortiz, causing confusion in bystanders is a cakewalk compared to what\u2019s come before.   Growing up in Albany, N.Y., she was known as Lordell Quebal, a boy. Her parents drank and fought, and at an early age she was taken from her home and placed into a merry-go-round of foster homes \u2014 first in Albany, then in Brooklyn. She was athletic and dated girls, then boys.   \u201cBut on the inside, I [still] felt very trapped, I felt very isolated,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I came out [as transgendered], there were a lot of doubts, not only in my immediate family, but in my gay family. \u2026 I was so manly-acting that it was a surprise for everyone. It was something that I kept quiet for a very long time.\u201d   The definition of \u201ctransgender\u201d is a thing in flux. Currently, the most agreed-upon representation is, \u201cPeople who were assigned a gender, usually at birth and based on their genitals, but who feel that this is a false or incomplete description of themselves.\u201d The National Transgender Advocacy Coalition website claims that between 2 and 3 percent of the U.S. population is transgendered. Transgendered people can be gay, straight, or bisexual \u2014 \u201ctransgender\u201d is an umbrella term that addresses gender identity, not sexuality. Ortiz happens to be attracted to men, and often, but not always, wishes to express herself as a woman.   \u201cI love being who I am. I love that some days I wake up, and I want to do drag,\u201d she said. \u201cSome days I want to dress as a boy, and I have that option. But for the most part, I\u2019m Tasha.\u201d   Though Western society has begun to accept gay people, acceptance of trans-people is slower to come.   \u201cIn the workplace, I\u2019ve seen people get fired because of their gender identity,\u201d said Asia Lyons, Outreach Coordinator at the Bronx Community Pride Center (BCPC), which offers outreach services to the Bronx LGBT community. \u201cThere are many studies that show that once you disclose your gender identity, or if it\u2019s obvious, violence or discrimination in the workplace increases.\u201d   Richard Juang, a scholar and activist, conducted a non-scientific survey in the San Francisco area in 2006 and found that the unemployment rate for trans-people was 35 percent, as opposed to 4.5 percent in the general U.S. population. Because trans-people find it difficult to keep jobs due to discrimination, 60 percent earn less than $15,300 a year, a poverty rate that is three to five times higher than that of the general U.S. population. If it is hard to maintain legal employment, \u201ca lot of trans-folks end up engaging into sex work,\u201d Lyons said. And with the U.S. recession in full swing and jobs scarce, Lyons predicts that even more trans-people will turn to the streets for income.   Ortiz, 23, is a former prostitute \u2014 she only recently gave up \u201cthe stroll\u201d after three years of it being her sole source of income. \u201cWith the stroll comes a lot,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cComes substance abuse, comes so much. And I was blind to that, at first.\u201d   She sat in the Bronx Community Pride Center reception area with two other former prostitutes, Inkara Jones, Ortiz\u2019 de-facto \u201caunt,\u201d and Ginelle Patterson. \u201cThe outside world, when they perceive us as transgenders, they automatically think, \u2018sex,\u2019 they don\u2019t perceive us as a person,\u201d said Patterson, waving her long-nailed hand through the air in anger. The others nodded in agreement, the curls of their wigs bouncing, earrings clinking. \u201cA good friend once told me, \u2018stop trying to run away from the stroll and know that you are the stroll. \u2026 You remove yourself from the stroll by changing you.\u2019\u201d   That is exactly what Ortiz did. She began volunteering at the Bronx Community Pride Center over a year ago, and found that the kids gravitated toward her: She was a natural leader. A paid position at BCPC recently opened up, and she was offered her first \u201creal\u201d job. And with that reliable paycheck comes the promise of better health care, another issue of particular importance to trans-people.   \u201cHealth care is very different for a trans-person for the simple reason that their insurance may not identify with their gender identity,\u201d said Lyons. \u201cAs a result of that, it is really hard for a person to get services.\u201d   Trans-people take hormones \u2014 estrogen and anti-androgens for male-to-females, and testosterone for female-to-males \u2014 so that their bodies more accurately match their gender identities. Hormones can cause serious internal damage if not monitored properly, but many trans-people refuse to go to a doctor due to lack of funds or out of fear of being stigmatized when their legal names are called out in the waiting room. This leads to black market hormones, shots sold on the streets that are often cut with baby oil or water. Needles are even reused, putting users at high risk for HIV/AIDS.   Ortiz has her first ever doctor\u2019s appointment for legal hormone monitoring next week. She just moved into a Bronx apartment with a friend from BCPC, and received her first paycheck last Friday. She is excited about the future, but appreciates her past.   \u201cIt\u2019s been rocky. But looking back, I wouldn\u2019t change anything. I had experiences that will help me, and I know I\u2019m on a road to greatness. I really do.\u201d                                           Also in South Bronx    New Life For Yankees Super Fan (video)      Budget Cuts Slash Health Services (video)      Overage Middle Schoolers Struggle to Pass      A Life In The Spotlight (video)      Methadone Clinics Help and Hurt the South Bronx      The Buzz at the Hub      Pointing fingers: conflict over Hunts Point jail              In Other Neighborhoods         Garden tackles childhood hunger      Makeup artists raise ovarian cancer awareness      LGBT job fair draws thousands      Small-business owners weigh in on health debate      Remembering 9/11      Protestors speak out against development      In Healthcare Debate, Economics Trumps Race      The Mets Pack Apples For the Poor      City Budget Cuts Hurt After School Programs (with video)      Green Cleaning      Americans Slow to Embrace Soccer      Baby Multiplicity      Free To Sing      Recession Keeps the Dentist&#8217;s Chair Full      Boutique Offers Women Clothing, Training &#038; Hope      It&#8217;s Better Than Organic &#8212; It&#8217;s Biochar (with slideshow)      Apparel In Peril (with audio and slideshow)      Stimulus Boost for AIDS Organizations      No Gluts, No Glory      The Wounds of War Dissolve at the Shrine of Love (with video)                        Home   Neighborhoods   In the City   Contributors   About   Contact Us       A project of the Arthur L.
