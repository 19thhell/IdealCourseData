The Sample of Services (PDF) chart gives examples of the types of SHC services that are provided at no cost as well as those services for which there is a fee.     The NYU-sponsored Student Health Insurance Program has two components     Mandatory Plan (PDF) - The registration fee included on your tuition bill grants access to services at the Student Health Center as well as limited health insurance coverage for certain hospital emergency room services and mental health outpatient visits.   Optional Plans (PDF) - NYU sponsors three levels of student health insurance plans designed to provide reasonably priced healthcare coverage. The Basic, Comprehensive and GSHIP Plans (PDF) cover the same medical and mental health services. However, they have different:     reimbursement levels   out-of-pocket expenses           All plans offer coverage for services rendered by healthcare providers who participate in the MagnaCare and MultiPlan networks. Referrals are required for services in Manhattan (outside SHC) (see Referrals/Authorizations ). Out-of-network providers are also covered but at a lower reimbursement level. Please note: The NYU Student Health Center (SHC) is in-network under the Student Health Insurance Plans but will be considered out of network under all other plans which utilize the MagnaCare &amp; MultiPlan networks.   Students who are studying abroad with NYU programs are also eligible for the Study Abroad Health Insurance Plan (PDF) designed specifically to allow students easy access to care while outside the United States.
