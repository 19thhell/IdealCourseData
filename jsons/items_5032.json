The Center will be directed by David Denoon, an NYU professor of politics and economics, who has served in senior policy-making positions in the U.S. government.   The Center\u2019s web-site is: www.uschinacenter.as.nyu.edu .   The Center\u2019s research will concentrate in two principal areas: the economic interaction between China and the U.S. and foreign policy issues where both states are involved. The Center will sponsor applied research that is designed to provide pragmatic alternatives to current policies.   In addition to its research, the Center will support three other activities: scholarly exchanges between the U.S. and China; fellowships for Chinese and American students to do field research; and presentations and events at NYU where speakers will address current policy questions affecting China and the U.S.   In its first year of operation, the Center\u2019s economic focus will be on recent developments in Chinese capital markets. In this area, the Center\u2019s research will look at a range of issues, including: changing trends in the equity markets and commercial bank lending; developments in private equity and investment trusts; patterns in public debt markets at the national, provincial, and local level; and related trends in private debt issuance. The intent will be to commission a wide range of research by Chinese and American scholars on these topics and to have this work published in academic and policy journals.   The foreign policy research in the first year will concentrate on recent developments in Central Asia. Research in this area will look at such issues as the impact of the pending American drawdown of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and how this will affect relations of the countries in Central Asia and the powers outside the region which have interests there. Particular attention will be devoted to exploring how Chinese, Russian, and U.S. actions will impact Central Asia. The Center intends to publish an edited volume, titled China, The U.S., and Central Asia , presenting the findings of scholars looking at this crucial region.   Public events sponsored by the Center will begin in 2011. Details of the scholarship and exchange programs will be posted in the Fall of 2011when the selection processes are about to be launched.   The Center\u2019s Advisory Board is comprised of Asia and China specialists and includes two former U.S. ambassadors to China, Winston Lord and Stapleton Roy.   The launch grant for the Center came from Rilin Enterprises, Ltd., a global construction and logistics firm based in Dandong, China. Mr. Wenliang Wang serves as chairman of Rilin Enterprises.   Denoon, the Center\u2019s Director, has a B.A. from Harvard, an M.P.A. from Princeton, and a Ph.D. from M.I.T. He has served in three government positions: program economist for USAID / Dept. of State in Jakarta, Indonesia; vice president of the U.S. Export-Import Bank; and deputy assistant secretary of defense. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Asia Society, and the U.S.-Indonesia Society and is chair of the Editorial Board of Great Decisions . Denoon has published widely on issues of Asian political-economy. His two most recent books are China: Contemporary Political, Economic, and International Affairs and The Economic and Strategic Rise of China and India .

The Center will be directed by David Denoon, an NYU professor of politics and economics, who has served in senior policy-making positions in the U.S. government.   The Center\u2019s web-site is: www.uschinacenter.as.nyu.edu .   The Center\u2019s research will concentrate in two principal areas: the economic interaction between China and the U.S. and foreign policy issues where both states are involved. The Center will sponsor applied research that is designed to provide pragmatic alternatives to current policies.   In addition to its research, the Center will support three other activities: scholarly exchanges between the U.S. and China; fellowships for Chinese and American students to do field research; and presentations and events at NYU where speakers will address current policy questions affecting China and the U.S.   In its first year of operation, the Center\u2019s economic focus will be on recent developments in Chinese capital markets. In this area, the Center\u2019s research will look at a range of issues, including: changing trends in the equity markets and commercial bank lending; developments in private equity and investment trusts; patterns in public debt markets at the national, provincial, and local level; and related trends in private debt issuance. The intent will be to commission a wide range of research by Chinese and American scholars on these topics and to have this work published in academic and policy journals.   The foreign policy research in the first year will concentrate on recent developments in Central Asia. Research in this area will look at such issues as the impact of the pending American drawdown of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and how this will affect relations of the countries in Central Asia and the powers outside the region which have interests there. Particular attention will be devoted to exploring how Chinese, Russian, and U.S. actions will impact Central Asia. The Center intends to publish an edited volume, titled China, The U.S., and Central Asia , presenting the findings of scholars looking at this crucial region.   Public events sponsored by the Center will begin in 2011. Details of the scholarship and exchange programs will be posted in the Fall of 2011when the selection processes are about to be launched.   The Center\u2019s Advisory Board is comprised of Asia and China specialists and includes two former U.S. ambassadors to China, Winston Lord and Stapleton Roy.   The launch grant for the Center came from Rilin Enterprises, Ltd., a global construction and logistics firm based in Dandong, China. Mr. Wenliang Wang serves as chairman of Rilin Enterprises.   Denoon, the Center\u2019s Director, has a B.A. from Harvard, an M.P.A. from Princeton, and a Ph.D. from M.I.T. He has served in three government positions: program economist for USAID / Dept. of State in Jakarta, Indonesia; vice president of the U.S. Export-Import Bank; and deputy assistant secretary of defense. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Asia Society, and the U.S.-Indonesia Society and is chair of the Editorial Board of Great Decisions . Denoon has published widely on issues of Asian political-economy. His two most recent books are China: Contemporary Political, Economic, and International Affairs and The Economic and Strategic Rise of China and India .
