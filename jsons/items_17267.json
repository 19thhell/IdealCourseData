As an applicant, you are expected to demonstrate your talents and mastery of subject matter to support your application and marshal your best cases for admission to NYU. As a result, NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university.   To be eligible for admission, applicants are expected to submit results from one of the following testing options:     The SAT Reasoning Test; or     The ACT with Writing Test; or     Three SAT Subject Test scores; or     Three AP exam scores; or     The International Baccalaureate Diploma; or     Three IB higher-level exam scores (if you are not an IB Diploma candidate); or     Results from a nationally accredited exam that is considered locally to signify the completion of secondary education, is administered independently of the student\u2019s school, and has been approved by the NYU Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Click here to review our list of approved national examinations .     Redesigned SAT Scores : NYU will accept current and redesigned SAT scores for admission. Applicants may submit scores from either the current SAT or the redesigned SAT (offered beginning spring 2016).                                                  If I have taken multiple examinations that meet NYU's standardized testing requirements, what does NYU recommend I submit to be eligible for admission?                               In the spirit of presenting your best case for admission, choose the examination you feel positions you more favorably and submit only that examination - as long as the results you submit meet our standardized testing requirements. You should only submit multiple test types if you want us to review additional examination results. All examinations are considered equally and you will not be placed at a disadvantage if you do not send SAT/ACT testing.   With regard to the SAT, NYU participates in Score Choice , enabling you to elect which tests you want to send to NYU. If you take the SAT multiple times, we will only review the highest Critical Reading, Math, and Writing scores you submit, regardless of test dates, creating the highest possible composite score for you in our evaluation process.   For the ACT, we will review the highest composite ACT score with Writing, regardless of test dates.                        Subject Requirements:     Students who submit SAT Subject Test, AP, or IB scores (for students not submitting an IB Diploma) must submit:   One literature or humanities score;   One math or science score;   And a score from one test of the student's choice in any subject. Click here to view the Standardized Testing Categories .       For applicants to the Stern School of Business , one of the exams above must be in mathematics.   For applicants to the Polytechnic School of Engineering , the exams above must include: one literature or humanities score; one math score; and one science score.     NYU Codes:   SAT, SAT Subject Test, AP, and TOEFL: 2562  ACT: 2838                                            Approved National Examinations \u00bb                                               English Language Testing Requirements for Non-Native English Speakers \u00bb                                                           Submitting Predicted Results   SAT, SAT Subject, ACT, and AP scores must be final at the time of application. For other examinations, like IB or A Levels, if final results are unavailable at the time of application, predicted results may be submitted by a school official, via one of the following methods:     Naviance/Common Application website\u2028   Mailed on official school letterhead, in a sealed and signed envelope   Emailed from a clearly identifiable school email address\u2028     You may also ask a school official to submit the NYU Predicted Results Form using the above methods.   NYU reserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission if final results are not within close range of the predicted results.   Submitting Final Scores and Examination Results   Test scores or examination results should be submitted directly from the testing organization by the appropriate application deadline. If results cannot be sent by the testing organization, these should be provided by a school official.

As an applicant, you are expected to demonstrate your talents and mastery of subject matter to support your application and marshal your best cases for admission to NYU. As a result, NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university.   To be eligible for admission, applicants are expected to submit results from one of the following testing options:     The SAT Reasoning Test; or     The ACT with Writing Test; or     Three SAT Subject Test scores; or     Three AP exam scores; or     The International Baccalaureate Diploma; or     Three IB higher-level exam scores (if you are not an IB Diploma candidate); or     Results from a nationally accredited exam that is considered locally to signify the completion of secondary education, is administered independently of the student\u2019s school, and has been approved by the NYU Office of Undergraduate Admissions.

Applicants may submit scores from either the current SAT or the redesigned SAT (offered beginning spring 2016).                                                  If I have taken multiple examinations that meet NYU's standardized testing requirements, what does NYU recommend I submit to be eligible for admission?                               In the spirit of presenting your best case for admission, choose the examination you feel positions you more favorably and submit only that examination - as long as the results you submit meet our standardized testing requirements. You should only submit multiple test types if you want us to review additional examination results. All examinations are considered equally and you will not be placed at a disadvantage if you do not send SAT/ACT testing.   With regard to the SAT, NYU participates in Score Choice , enabling you to elect which tests you want to send to NYU. If you take the SAT multiple times, we will only review the highest Critical Reading, Math, and Writing scores you submit, regardless of test dates, creating the highest possible composite score for you in our evaluation process.   For the ACT, we will review the highest composite ACT score with Writing, regardless of test dates.                        Subject Requirements:     Students who submit SAT Subject Test, AP, or IB scores (for students not submitting an IB Diploma) must submit:   One literature or humanities score;   One math or science score;   And a score from one test of the student's choice in any subject.

For applicants to the Polytechnic School of Engineering , the exams above must include: one literature or humanities score; one math score; and one science score.

For other examinations, like IB or A Levels, if final results are unavailable at the time of application, predicted results may be submitted by a school official, via one of the following methods:     Naviance/Common Application website\u2028   Mailed on official school letterhead, in a sealed and signed envelope   Emailed from a clearly identifiable school email address\u2028     You may also ask a school official to submit the NYU Predicted Results Form using the above methods.   NYU reserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission if final results are not within close range of the predicted results.   Submitting Final Scores and Examination Results   Test scores or examination results should be submitted directly from the testing organization by the appropriate application deadline. If results cannot be sent by the testing organization, these should be provided by a school official.
