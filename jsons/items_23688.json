The report, Pathways to Immigrant Opportunity , can be found here.  The authors of the report include Carola Su\u00e1rez-Orozco and Marcelo Su\u00e1rez-Orozco, co-directors of Immigration Studies @ NYU and members of the School of Social Science, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ; and Carolyn Sattin Bajaj, a Ph.D. candidate at NYU\u2019s Steinhardt School.  Mass migration touches every corner of the earth. There are now between 190 and 200 million transnational migrants working, living, and moving across every region of the world, according to the U.N. Global Commission on International Migration. The report identifies a series of promising strategies provided by a range of service providers (including NGOs, national and local governments, religious organizations, and corporate organizations) that help to facilitate the integration of immigrant families and their children into the fabric of their new lands. The report investigates such questions as: What works best for teaching immigrant children English? What works best for engaging immigrant mothers with the schools of their children? What are the best programs for helping migrants find suitable employment?  Drawing from an intensive, year-long research on best practices from around the world, the report brings together, in a single web-based format, best ideas and examples from a variety of countries facing large scale immigration such as Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, the U.S., and numerous other countries.  The research examines multiple domains of immigrant life including:   Programs developed to support immigrant parents (including language support programs, vocational skills, and literacy development, supports for parenting in a new land, and citizenship programs)  School-based programs for immigrant children and youth (including programs for newcomer immigrant students, programs for heritage language development, and summer enrichment)  After school programs for immigrant children and youth (including academic supports, extra-curricular activities and youth mentoring)  Programs designed to improve the perceptions of immigrants among non-immigrant citizens (including programs to educate local service providers, programs designed to combat negative stereotypes, and programs facilitating contact between native residents and newcomers)  The authors note that at a time of economic crisis, when immigration generates gridlock, anxiety, and concern, it is important to think clearly and disinterestedly about what works best in promoting the successful adaptation of millions of immigrant families already settled in new societies. This web-based version of the report provides multiple stakeholders a wealth of resources and innovative strategies to draw upon.  Reporters interested in speaking with the authors are encouraged to contact Marcelo Su\u00e1rez-Orozco via email at mso3@nyu.edu or by phone at 212.998.5284, 609.734.8270, or 646.329.2125.

While considerable research has focused on how immigrants affect local wages and housing prices, less research has asked how immigrants fare in US urban public schools. Previous studies find that foreign-born students outperform native-born students in their elementary and middle school years, but urban policymakers and practitioners continue to raise concerns about educational outcomes of immigrants arriving in their high school years. The authors use data on a large cohort of New York City (NYC) public high school students to examine how the performance of students who immigrate during high school (teen immigrants) differs from that of students who immigrate during middle school (tween immigrants) or elementary school (child immigrants), relative to otherwise similar native-born students. Contrary to prior studies, their difference-in-difference estimates suggest that, ceteris paribus, teen immigrants do well compared to native-born migrants, and that the foreign-born advantage is relatively large among the teen (im)migrants. That said, their findings provide cause for concern about the performance of limited English proficient students, blacks and Hispanics and, importantly, teen migrants. In particular, switching school districts in the high school years - that is, student mobility across school districts - may be more detrimental than immigration per se. Results are robust to alternative specifications and cohorts, including a cohort of Miami students. Click here for the full text of this publication.

While considerable research has focused on how immigrants affect local wages and housing prices, less research has asked how immigrants fare in US urban public schools. Previous studies find that foreign-born students outperform native-born students in their elementary and middle school years, but urban policymakers and practitioners continue to raise concerns about educational outcomes of immigrants arriving in their high school years. The authors use data on a large cohort of New York City (NYC) public high school students to examine how the performance of students who immigrate during high school (teen immigrants) differs from that of students who immigrate during middle school (tween immigrants) or elementary school (child immigrants), relative to otherwise similar native-born students. Contrary to prior studies, their difference-in-difference estimates suggest that, ceteris paribus, teen immigrants do well compared to native-born migrants, and that the foreign-born advantage is relatively large among the teen (im)migrants. That said, their findings provide cause for concern about the performance of limited English proficient students, blacks and Hispanics and, importantly, teen migrants. In particular, switching school districts in the high school years - that is, student mobility across school districts - may be more detrimental than immigration per se.

The report, Pathways to Immigrant Opportunity , can be found here.  The authors of the report include Carola Su\u00e1rez-Orozco and Marcelo Su\u00e1rez-Orozco, co-directors of Immigration Studies @ NYU and members of the School of Social Science, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ; and Carolyn Sattin Bajaj, a Ph.D. candidate at NYU\u2019s Steinhardt School.  Mass migration touches every corner of the earth. There are now between 190 and 200 million transnational migrants working, living, and moving across every region of the world, according to the U.N. Global Commission on International Migration. The report identifies a series of promising strategies provided by a range of service providers (including NGOs, national and local governments, religious organizations, and corporate organizations) that help to facilitate the integration of immigrant families and their children into the fabric of their new lands. The report investigates such questions as: What works best for teaching immigrant children English? What works best for engaging immigrant mothers with the schools of their children? What are the best programs for helping migrants find suitable employment?  Drawing from an intensive, year-long research on best practices from around the world, the report brings together, in a single web-based format, best ideas and examples from a variety of countries facing large scale immigration such as Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, the U.S., and numerous other countries.  The research examines multiple domains of immigrant life including:   Programs developed to support immigrant parents (including language support programs, vocational skills, and literacy development, supports for parenting in a new land, and citizenship programs)  School-based programs for immigrant children and youth (including programs for newcomer immigrant students, programs for heritage language development, and summer enrichment)  After school programs for immigrant children and youth (including academic supports, extra-curricular activities and youth mentoring)  Programs designed to improve the perceptions of immigrants among non-immigrant citizens (including programs to educate local service providers, programs designed to combat negative stereotypes, and programs facilitating contact between native residents and newcomers)  The authors note that at a time of economic crisis, when immigration generates gridlock, anxiety, and concern, it is important to think clearly and disinterestedly about what works best in promoting the successful adaptation of millions of immigrant families already settled in new societies. This web-based version of the report provides multiple stakeholders a wealth of resources and innovative strategies to draw upon.
