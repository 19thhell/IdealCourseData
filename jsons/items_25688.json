New York University is one of the few universities in the country to offer a graduate degree in the music business field . The skills you develop will serve you well in a fast-paced industry that needs thoroughly trained personnel who can apply business and administration theory to problems that have a strong aesthetic and artistic dimension.    In addition to providing structured courses, the curriculum promotes student autonomy through an interactive classroom atmosphere, internships, and research requirements . Students are encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities such as the Concert Program Board, radio station WNYU and to follow our blog, Velocity , for the latest news and happenings.    Underlying our curriculum is a four-step process of teaching and learning that answers the question: what can you learn at a university that will prepare you to succeed in an industry that is notoriously fluid and capricious?       First, we teach the structure of the industry &ndash; its systems, practices, rules and regulations.          Second, we explore the changes in and reasons behind that structure .          Third, we encourage critical analysis and interpretation of the structure .          The fourth step is up to you &ndash; final Colloquy projects propose changes and innovations to take the industry forward.          Special Concentration in Music Technology    The Music Technology Concentration within the M.A. program in Music Business is intended for students with an academic or professional background in technology who wish to exploit that experience in the commercial arena.

In their final M.A. projects , students in the concentration have:       Developed mobile apps    Started businesses    Proposed business and technology policies and strategies to government agencies    Used technology to promote emerging music trends abroad    Built new IP (intellectual property) assets for start-up firms using recorded music samples       Applicants for this concentration submit details of their prior academic and/or professional music technology experience.    Student Learning Objectives    In this program, students will learn to       Apply business and administration theory to problems that have a strong aesthetic and artistic dimension    Define, critique, and evaluate the structure and operation of the music business    Devise organizational objectives and make strategy decisions to reach goals    Design final Colloquy projects that propose changes and innovations to take the industry forward       When completing the degree, students will attain core competencies in these five areas:       Financial and market development for music goods and services, including strategic analysis and planning    Legal, technological and competitive environment for the music business    Leadership in complex organizational environments for the music business    International environment for the arts and the impact of the global economy    Applications of research methodologies in the field       How to Apply    Successful candidates are expected to be highly motivated and prepared to take advantage of a professional program set in the world's music business capital.
