Mounds of evidence suggest that war exercises a powerful fascination that has its greatest impact on participants but is by no means limited to them. War, in short, is a complex web of affiliations and emotions.

Sociology of Medicine   SOC-UA 414 Offered every two years. Jennings. 4 points   Why do health and illness vary by class and race? Do early life experiences affect one\u2019s chances of having a heart attack as an adult? How large of a role does health care play in influencing health disparities? How has the profession of medicine changed over time? How can we improve the quality of health care that hospitals provide? This course uses a case-based approach to examine these questions and many others.    Immigration   SOC-UA 452 Offered every two years. Jasso. 4 points.
