Tel 998-0332; Fax 995-4233   e-mail ian.giddy@nyu.edu         Goals   Students taking this course should expect to learn the nature and purposes  of financial markets with an emphasis on fixed-income securities. They  will gain skills in modern valuation techniques, including the risk-return  tradeoff and portfolio diversification, asset pricing models, using the  zero-coupon curve, duration and convexity, option-adjusted spreads, and  the technique of asset securitization. They will learn about Treasuries,  corporates and floating-rate notes, about callable bonds and mortgage-backed  securities, about asset pricing and valuation, and about swap valuation  and trading.        Instructor    Ian Giddy has taught  finance at NYU, Columbia, Wharton, Chicago and abroad for the past twenty-one  years. He was Director of International Fixed Income Research at Drexel  Burnham Lambert from 1986 to 1989. The author of more than fifty articles  on international finance, he has served at the International Monetary Fund  and the U.S. Treasury and has been a consultant with numerous financial  institutions and corporations in the U.S. and abroad. He is the author  or co-author of The International Money Market , The Handbook  of International Finance , Cases in International Finance , Global  Financial Markets and The Hudson River Waterway Guide .        Pedagogy   The course employs cases and problems as well as classroom lectures and  discussions and an international investment negotation exercise. We will  make use of international as well as domestic examples. Each student will  be expected to attend all sessions and to participate actively in class  discussion. There will be a final exam.        Textbook   Our primary text is Frank J. Fabozzi, Bond Markets, Analysis and Strategies ,  3rd Ed, (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1995). The supplementary  book is Bodie, Kane and Marcus, Investments , 3rd edition (Homewood,  Il: Irwin, 1996). The latter book can serve as a standard reference source  beyond the course.. For short term fixed income securities, get Instruments  of the Money Marke t, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond;  or Dufey and Giddy, The International Money Market (Prentice-Hall,  1994). Additional readings will be made available.     Students should have read the assignments before coming to class.  Material covered in the assigned textbook readings will generally not be  repeated in class. Rather, class time will be devoted to lecture and case  discussion, applying the material covered in the readings.        Use of the Internet   All participants in this course are expected to have and to use email and  access to the World Wide Web. Updates, bulletins and supplementary resources  will be supplied via email and this Web site (http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~igiddy/fmx.htm).  In addition, you should use the Web to search for information about China.

Tel 998-0332; Fax 995-4233   e-mail ian.giddy@nyu.edu         Goals   Students taking this course should expect to learn the nature and purposes  of financial markets with an emphasis on fixed-income securities. They  will gain skills in modern valuation techniques, including the risk-return  tradeoff and portfolio diversification, asset pricing models, using the  zero-coupon curve, duration and convexity, option-adjusted spreads, and  the technique of asset securitization. They will learn about Treasuries,  corporates and floating-rate notes, about callable bonds and mortgage-backed  securities, about asset pricing and valuation, and about swap valuation  and trading.        Instructor    Ian Giddy has taught  finance at NYU, Columbia, Wharton, Chicago and abroad for the past twenty-one  years. He was Director of International Fixed Income Research at Drexel  Burnham Lambert from 1986 to 1989. The author of more than fifty articles  on international finance, he has served at the International Monetary Fund  and the U.S. Treasury and has been a consultant with numerous financial  institutions and corporations in the U.S. and abroad. He is the author  or co-author of The International Money Market , The Handbook  of International Finance , Cases in International Finance , Global  Financial Markets and The Hudson River Waterway Guide .        Pedagogy   The course employs cases and problems as well as classroom lectures and  discussions and an international investment negotation exercise. We will  make use of international as well as domestic examples. Each student will  be expected to attend all sessions and to participate actively in class  discussion. There will be a final exam.        Textbook   Our primary text is Frank J. Fabozzi, Bond Markets, Analysis and Strategies ,  3rd Ed, (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1995). The supplementary  book is Bodie, Kane and Marcus, Investments , 3rd edition (Homewood,  Il: Irwin, 1996). The latter book can serve as a standard reference source  beyond the course.. For short term fixed income securities, get Instruments  of the Money Marke t, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond;  or Dufey and Giddy, The International Money Market (Prentice-Hall,  1994). Additional readings will be made available.     Students should have read the assignments before coming to class.  Material covered in the assigned textbook readings will generally not be  repeated in class. Rather, class time will be devoted to lecture and case  discussion, applying the material covered in the readings.        Use of the Internet   All participants in this course are expected to have and to use email and  access to the World Wide Web. Updates, bulletins and supplementary resources  will be supplied via email and this Web site (http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~igiddy/fmx.htm).  In addition, you should use the Web to search for information about China.

Microsoft Security Vulnerabilities                          On Tuesday, Microsoft identified two major vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system, in addition to other Microsoft products and non-critical updates. One vulnerability in particular exploits common system components for every major release of Windows since 95 and through Windows 10 (still in development) which can be used to retrieve Windows login credentials (username and password). These credentials can then be cracked in less than a day using moderate resources by an attacker. As of right now, there has been no patch for this vulnerability, identified as \"Redirect to SMB.\" To mitigate the risk posed by this vulnerability, TSS recommends following safe browsing and computing procedures. Do not click on links in unsolicited emails, and note the path of any link you click on while browsing the Internet. The vulnerability will exploit links that begin with \"file://\".    For more on this vulnerability, you can read here: www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2403924/windows-redirect-to-smb-exploit-could-affect-millions-say-security-researchers    As a reminder, Microsoft no longer supports versions of Windows older than Vista (i.e., Windows 95, 98, 2000, ME, and XP). If you are still using a version of Windows that is unsupported by Microsoft, these vulnerabilities, as well as any newly discovered ones going forward will remain unpatched. NYU TSS strongly recommends that you upgrade your operating system immediately by purchasing a new version of Windows or a new computer.

What Does This Mean For Me:  This software may expose web mail, banking, and shopping transactions and information, and more, regardless of which web browser (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc) you are using.   Detailed Description: Adware (software designed to intercept user data for advertising purposes) that was preinstalled by Lenovo, Superfish, is vulnerable to being redirected to a malicious server, used to collect private information. The nature of this vulnerability means that your information is acquired before it is encrypted by your browser, known as a \"Man-in-the-Middle\" attack. Lenovo itself has \"shut off\" the data collection on its own servers, but the software remains vulnerable to malicious third parties. This attack bypasses even secured connections (HTTPS). Follow the directions below under the Solution section to remove Superfish and its supporting software.    For more information on this alert and Lenovo's response, the following CNET article is included for reference:   Lenovo's Superfish security snafu blows up in its face      Technical Details:    Alert (TA15-051A) Lenovo Superfish Adware Vulnerable to HTTPS Spoofing   Solution:  Remove the Superfish adware and its associated components.    Removal Instructions (Automatic):  1) Download the automatic removal tool from Lenovo, located here:   Superfish Automatic Removal Tool  2) Locate the downloaded file, and run the program.  3) Click \"Analyze and Remove Superfish Now.\" You will be prompted to close any open browsers. Wait while the program runs.  4) At the conclusion of the scan, the tool will indicate whether or not Superfish was identified on your system, and what action was taken.   Removal Instructions (Manual):  Lenovo has provided a detailed set of instructions for removal here:   Superfish Uninstall Instructions  Alternatively, Naked Security, a cyber-security blog run by the antivirus firm Sophos, has also provided their own removal instructions if you prefer:   How to Get Rid of the Lenovo \"Superfish\" Adware                             Posted by Technology Security Services at 04:12 PM | Permalink                                                                         February 18, 2015                       *New York University Email Alert [Code: 3141]* phishing scam                          There are new reports about a phishing message that purports to come from \"New York University Technical Service \" The phishing message claims \"Dear User, The following alert has been posted to your webmail account regarding an unauthorized access to your account,\" and instructs the recipient to click on a web link.

And most of the individuals who download these files&mdash;through paid services, file-sharing applications, or peer-to-peer networks&mdash;by now are aware of how prominent the issue of illegal downloading has become.   The University's stance on this issue is simple: using your computer to download or distribute copyrighted material illegally is impermissible, and you should not do it. Be aware: some applications for downloading music, movies and other files actually turn your computer into a server, allowing it to be used for distributing copyrighted material. If you are doing illegal downloads or distributions now or have done so, you should stop.   The music industry thus far has principally targeted those whose computers distribute illegally downloaded music, rather those who simply download. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is using the legal tools provided by the U. S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998. When a copyright complaint is received, the student responsible for the network address listed in the complaint is notified by email and sent a copy of the complaint. The student is asked to review NYU's policies, and to confirm in writing that s/he will abide by them. If the student does not respond, his/her network connection is blocked. If there are repeated incidents, the matter then is referred to the student judicial process. A range of penalties is available within the judicial process; the specific penalty depends upon the result of that process and may include suspension of account privileges. If the RIAA believes you are involved in illegal downloads or distribution of copyrighted materials and submits a valid subpoena to NYU seeking your identity, the University will comply with the subpoena and furnish your name and contact information to the RIAA's lawyers.   Federal copyright law itself includes a range of penalties, from $750-$130,000 per infringed work, or as much as $150,000 per work, if the infringement is deemed \"willful\". See Copyright Law of the United States of America ( www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html ). A claim of \"fair use\" can be used as a defense against a claim of infringement, see Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use ( www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.pdf ), the NYU guide to copyright law as it relates to academic research, teaching, and publication ( library.nyu.edu/copyright/ ), NYU's Copyright and Fair Use resource ( www.nyu.edu/footer/copyright-and-fair-use.html ), and NYU's Statement of Policy and Guidelines on Educational and Research Uses of Copyrighted Materials ( www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/compliance/documents/ CopyrightedMaterials.1.6.14.pdf ). There may also be criminal penalties for willful copying of a work for profit or financial gain, or if the work has a value of more than $1,000. Penalties can include a one-year jail sentence plus fines. If the value is more than $2,500, you may be sentenced to five years in jail plus fines. Criminal penalties generally apply to large-scale commercial piracy.   We know that illegal downloading of music is a widespread practice. It has become an international phenomenon, one that is hardly confined to college campuses. Its allure is clear: why would you pay for something&mdash;a song to load on your MP3 player or a movie to load on your laptop&mdash;when you can get it for free with a little exploration and few keystrokes? And why would you not share something for free with friends?   In answering those questions, the University appeals to what Abraham Lincoln once called \"the better angels\" of your nature and to your commitment to the culture of scholarship.   As communities of scholars and learners, research universities&mdash;such as NYU&mdash;have two primary missions: to educate students and to create knowledge. This latter mission involves the production of original scholarship and research. Accordingly it is accompanied by an enormous respect for proper recognition being given to the creator of those ideas and knowledge. In higher education, it is considered a grave act to take another's work without permission or attribution. At NYU, which also has large and renowned programs in the arts, this respect extends to the creation of new art.   Few in this community would uphold shoplifting CDs from a record store. And few would be content to see their own work&mdash;a paper, for instance, or a journal article, or a term project in a course&mdash;taken by someone else and used without permission.   Yet, in reality, that is what you do when you download copyrighted files illegally. However you may feel about the music or film industry or about their responses to piracy, when you download copyrighted files without permission, you are stealing the work of a director or a producer or an artist. It is not only wrong; it puts you at legal risk.   The Internet has brought unimaginable access to information and extraordinary flexibility and opportunities for exploration and communication. NYU wants you to take advantage of all that. But, just as you abide by certain standards of behavior for scholarship and for University life, so, too, should you abide by high standards when it comes to the intellectual property of others on the Internet.

There is no action for end users at this time.   TSS strongly recommends all system administrators prioritize patching their systems as soon as possible. Patches are available for every major Unix distribution.   DETAILS  There is a vulnerability in Bash, a commonly used Unix shell, which in some cases may allow for remote code execution. It is difficult to reliably identify vulnerable systems so TSS is advising administrators of all Unix systems and Unix-based systems, including Mac OS X, to update their systems immediately.    From the National Vulnerability Database CVE entry:  GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution.  A good summary writeup of the vulnerability can be found here:  http://www.csoonline.com/article/2687265/application-security/remote-exploit-in-bash-cve-2014-6271.html   Technical details can be found here:  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-6271   http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271   http://blog.erratasec.com/2014/09/bash-shellshock-scan-of-internet.html#.VCQlR_ldVuM    NEXT STEPS  As mentioned, all system administrators should update their systems immediately. NYU ITS Technology Security Services will be monitoring the situation for any further developments and update this page as appropriate. As always, questions can be sent to security@nyu.edu.

We have not yet received any indication that NYU was affected, and the company that put out the story has not been forthcoming with specific details to back up the report. That being said, NYU takes all potential breaches seriously, thus we will continue to monitor the situation and will take appropriate responsive action, including notifying any affected members of the NYU Community should we discover their accounts were affected.

The US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) has made the following recommendation regarding this vulnerability:    \"US-CERT recommends that users and administrators review Microsoft Security Advisory 2963983 for mitigation actions and workarounds. Those who cannot follow Microsoft's recommendations, such as Windows XP users, may consider employing an alternate browser.\"    As such we recommend, as an alternative to Internet Explorer, that you consider using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari when visiting websites. If you must use an NYU application that only supports Internet Explorer you should feel free to do so. For browsing sites outside of NYU, however, the use of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari is recommended instead.

UPDATE: Microsoft has issued a security patch for this vulnerability, and it is available via Windows Update. There is more information about the patch at https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms14-021                             Posted by Technology Security Services at 05:27 PM | Permalink                                                                         April 09, 2014                       Important New Web (OpenSSL) Vulnerability                          As many of you may have read or heard, a flaw has been discovered in one of the Internet's security methods&mdash;a flaw that could enable hackers to access user names, passwords, or other sensitive data.    A fix for this flaw, which was announced this week, is available and NYU is now working quickly to patch all of the University's systems that need patching. The flaw is associated with a widely-used technology known as OpenSSL, which is used to secure server transactions, and it is known as the \"Heartbleed\" vulnerability. OpenSSL is used by Internet service providers, system administrators, and universities around the world, including NYU.    What NYU is doing:  Technology Security Services (TSS) at NYU is reviewing our centrally provided systems and servers that need to be patched are being patched. TSS has been in touch with the NYU system administrators group (system administrators across campus) to alert them to the issue and the recommended fix. The CIO Council (IT leads at the schools) has also been alerted to this issue for any locally maintained and housed servers.    What should you do:  First of all, don't panic. Not all systems use OpenSSL, some that do are not vulnerable, and many websites are already installing patches on their systems.    If you are an administrator of any system, you should immediately upgrade your system to the latest version of OpenSSL. For more guidance, NYU system administrators should contact the IT Security Group at security@nyu.edu . Administrators of systems outside of NYU (e.g., cloud services) should contact the service provider or refer to the links below.    For users of NYU systems : ITS and other service owners across NYU are working quickly to patch systems as necessary. As examples, NYU Google Apps, NYU Classes, Albert/SIS, NYUHome, www.nyu.edu, NYU Login, PeopleSync, and all core NYU systems have either been patched, or are not vulnerable to this bug.    For users of non-NYU systems : If you don't know if the server you are connecting to has been patched, the most prudent thing to do is refrain from logging into non-NYU sites that contain sensitive data for a few days while those non-NYU servers are patched. If there is no information from the system owners after that time, you should contact the site to confirm that the patch is in place. If you are curious as to whether a page may be affected by the flaw, you can visit this Heartbleed test site and put in the name of the website you are concerned about to see whether it is vulnerable. However, not all sites can be tested in this way.    What the Internet is doing : Internet providers and server administrators around the world are doing assessments of their systems in order to patch their version of OpenSSL.

You may download it here: Java 7 RU11 . Note that there are unresolved vulnerabilities in Java and it is recommended that you disable it if you do not need it.    Most websites and web applications do not require Java, therefore it is possible to disable it without causing any impact to your web browser's functionality. However, because Java is a well-known computing platform used on some websites, disabling it may cause certain web applications to stop working.    At NYU, certain web applications require Java, so disabling it may prevent access to these sites or cause performance stability issues. If you are unsure if disabling Java will affect access to certain web applications, contact your local IT support.

Upon infection, Confickr will disable firewalls, antivirus/antispyware and Windows Updates. The worm propagates over the network and can even infect connected flash drives. The worm is scheduled to attack various systems across the internet on April 1st, 2009.    The Technology Security Services (TSS) group has been carefully monitoring the situation over the past several weeks. At this time, we do not believe there is a significant threat to NYU network resources. That said, we do recommend that all Windows PC clients do the following:      Make sure you have downloaded and installed the latest Windows Updates .   Update your antivirus and antispyware software with the latest definitions. NYU ITS provides Symantec Antivirus for free to most NYU faculty, staff and students.   If you have not already done so, create a computer account password comprised of 8 alphanumeric characters or longer. Password creation tips can be found here .      If you wish to verify whether or not your computer is infected with Confickr, visit the following sites for removal tools and more information.    Microsoft: Virus alert about the Win32/Conficker.B worm   Microsoft: Malware Removal Tool    If you need further help cleaning up your computer from a possible virus infection, contact the ITS Client Services Center at 212-998-3333 or askits@nyu.edu.

The message requests that the person reply back to the email with the email address & password in order to avoid the email account from being 'shut off'    NYU members should not reply to the fraudulent phishing emails. Instead, forward the messages to our spam filtering system's email address is.spam@nyu.edu . Doing so trains our email filters to prevent such types of spam from arriving into inboxes.    As a reminder of better security practices, always remember that:     No NYU member will ever ask for your account password, especially not over email   Do not reply back to emails from unidentified, untrusted sources.   Forward all spam to is.spam@nyu.edu. This helps train our email filters to block such messages in the future   Messages that request personal information over plaintext email should be regarded as being suspicious. If it is spam, forward it to is.spam@nyu.edu. When in doubt, do not reply and contact security@nyu.edu.   If a message informs you of an impending 'account closure' unless you comply with its demands, it is often a sign that the message is a phishing scam. Do not comply with its requests.      A sample of the phishing message can be found below:     Dear Email Account Owner,   This message is from webmail messaging center to all webmail account owners.

The link points to a site that pretends to be a legitimate BBB website, such as:    http:// w w w . n a t i o n a l - b b b . o r g    That message is a scam and should be ignored. Do not click on any link in the message and do not reply to it.    Simply forward the message to the following addresses and then delete it:     is.spam@nyu.edu (sending spam to this email address will help our email gateways filter it out in the future)   spam@uce.gov (this is a branch of the FTC that tracks these types of phishing scams)      As always, never open emails from unexpected sources & never click on links inside emails asking you to provide personal information or asking you to download software to your computer.

The from address on the email was spoofed using that domain which may make it appear legitimate , but it also contains a few classic phishing characteristics such as:      New York University Federal Credit Union will never ask members to call any number or visit any website for security reasons. Anyone who receives an e-mail that purports to be from New York University Federal Credit Union and asks for any information or action by the member should consider it to be a fraudulent attempt to obtain their personal account data for an illegal purpose and should not follow the instructions in the e-mail.    The link in the message does not point to the domain the message supposedly came from, or any legitimate domain associated with the NYU Federal Credit Union.    The message contains many spelling and grammar errors.    The message implies urgency: \"update your profile as soon as possible\" and \"your access will be continued as normal\". Phishing attacks try to convince victims of the urgency of the \"problem\" in order to steal as much personal information as possible prior to ISPs bringing down the phishing websites.      DO NOT click on any link in that message. At this time, the best thing to do is to:      Forward the spam message to is.spam@nyu.edu   Delete the message   Inform your coworkers of the phishing scam    In the event you or another NYU member may have clicked on the link and provided personal information, contact TSS immediately at security@nyu.edu .

Animated cursors are used on different websites for legitimate reasons. However, this latest vulnerability uses the animated cursor function to install and execute a trojan file on the victim computer. Infected computers may be controlled by a remote attacker, who may install a keylogging tool or other malicious files    The attack does not require any user interaction. Computers can be compromised simply by visiting a website that contains the malicious code. The infection happens in the background and the user may not be aware that the computer is compromised.    This vulnerability affects the following operating systems:     Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4   Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2   Microsoft Windows Server 2003   Microsoft Windows Vista   (See link below for more Operating Systems)      Vista's IE 7 in protected mode shields the computer against drive-by installations.

However, this vulnerability only affects Firefox 1.5.0.9. This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 2.0 which is the latest version of the browser.    When the pop-up blocker feature is disabled, Firefox gives unnecessary access to local files. If a malicious file containing exploit code is already on the computer, then it can be remotely launched.    This is not easy, since the file would have to be planted on the system by tricking a user to click on a link that would download the file. The malicious file could then enable access to other files, which could be transferred to a remote computer belonging to an attacker.    Mozilla, the distributor of Firefox, is currently working on a solution. In the meantime, make sure your pop-up blocker is enabled whenever possible. Alternatively, you can upgrade to the latest version of Firefox, version 2.0 here:    Download Firefox 2.0                             Posted by Christopher Penido at 03:32 PM | Permalink                                                                         December 06, 2006                       Zero-Day Attack for Microsoft Word                          Microsoft issued a security bulletin regarding a recently discovered vulnerability in Microsoft Word. The attack involves a specially crafted Microsoft Word document that contains malicious code.    Once the Word Doc is opened, the code is executed and corrupts the computer's memory. This can lead to an attacker taking control of a user account on the compromised computer.    This attack affects many varieties of Microsoft Word, including those available for the Apple Macintosh platform.     Word 2000   Word 2002   Word 2003   Word Viewer 2003   Word 2004 for Mac   Word 2004 v. X for Mac   Works 2004, 2005, and 2006      There is no patch or fix for this issue as of yet. Microsoft is working on a solution.    It is recommended that you do NOT open any Word Doc's from un-trusted sources. If you do receive Word Doc's from trusted sources, verify that the document was intentionally sent.

Currently, even the most patched versions of Windows XP are completely vulnerable to this attack and there is no projected patch until sometime in October.    This new attack targets Internet Explorer and the HTML component in Outlook and can result in a computer being compromised by an attacker. So in theory, visiting a malicious website or opening an email with the malicious HTML code can leave the computer fully compromised.    Multiple security vendors are labeling this attack as \"high\" because an update is not available, and may not be available until the next monthly patch cycle. As always, we suggest that you avoid any suspicious or \"bad\" websites. If you believe you may have entered one of these sites, it may be prudent to simply quit out of your browser and restart the application again.

Those vulnerabilities put all wireless-capable OS X computers at risk of being compromised by an attacker, including the new Intel-based Macs.    Without the update, an Apple computer connected to a malicious \"WiFi spot\" could potentially be compromised to the degree that an attacker can gain control of the computer and execute arbitrary code.    To get the latest update, simply go on the Apple menu and select \"Software Update\". Download any updates available.

Known as W32.pipeline, this worm transmits itself via AIM, contacting all individuals on the victim's \"Buddylist\".    The worm sends an innocuous IM message to the individuals on the victim's Buddylist with the message \"Hey, would it be okay if I upload this picture of you to my blog?\" If the recipient clicks on the link, an executable file that looks like a JPEG will download into a Windows folder.    Once installed, the file then begins to contact other individuals on the new victim computer to infect their machines as well. Another side effect is that the victim computer acts as a botnet, downloading in the background malicious files and viruses onto the computer, and possibly even sending out large quantities of spam    The best solution to this problem is to:     If you receive the above IM, ignore it and do not respond. If you receive a suspicious variant, or are unsure, reply to the Instant Message and verify that the person really did send it to you. 3-4 IM messages should verify the status of the sender.

This new attack specifically targets Internet Explorer and can result in a computer being compromised by an attacker.    Once an individual visits a specially crafted website, the attack can either force IE to crash or the attacker can use the vulnerability to launch arbitrary commands and compromise the victim computer.    Multiple security vendors are labeling this attack as \"high\" because an update is not available, and may not be available until the next monthly patch cycle. Beyond suggesting that users avoid \"bad websites\", users are also being told to disable \"ActiveX scripting\" in IE or secure it to your trusted security zones as a precaution.

This specially crafted Word document contains an embedded trojan file that can put a computer at risk to a malicious attack.    Once the infected Word file is opened, it loads a trojan file onto the computer. Following the trojan's installation, it then initiates a backdoor command that allows more malicious files to be downloaded onto the infected computer. Those malicious files can include keylogging tools , which can be used to record what you type on your computer.    For the moment, Microsoft does not have an update available. Users are being told to not open untrusted Word document files. Once an update is available, a link will be posted in the alerts page.    Confirmed affected systems for this paritcular attack are computers running both Windows 2000 & Microsoft Word 2000. Although not yet confirmed, it is cautioned that this vulnerability may affect other versions of Microsoft Windows and/or Word.    More information regarding this attack can be found here :    MS Word 0-day attack flaw      Update available 09/12/06      Microsoft has stated that there will be one Office and two Windows updates available on 09/12/06 that will address multiple critical vulnerabilities . It is believed that these updates will fix the current Word vulnerability, amongst other exploits. We will issue an alert when this becomes available.
