Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor. 3.00 Credits Management of Urban Traffic Congestion TR-GY 7123 The purpose of this course is to (1) understand the causes of traffic congestion and to measure how congestion impacts transportation users and communities, (2) set forth a vision for managing congestion and (3) develop and evaluate strategies and policies that achieve the vision. Prerequisite: Graduate Standing 3.00 Credits Design of Parking & Terminal Facilities TR-GY 7323 This course covers design techniques and approaches to a variety of pedestrian and vehicular needs in conjunction with access to land functions. Parking serves as the primary access interface to many land facilities, from shopping centers and sports facilities, to medium- and high-density residential developments. The planning and design of parking facilities, and the planning of access and egress from these facilities, is critical to the economic success of a development. Terminals are inter-modal interface facilities involving the transfer of people and/or goods from one mode of transportation to another. This course covers essential elements of terminal planning and design, including transit stations and terminals, major goods terminals at ports and railheads and others. The design of pedestrian space and ways within terminal structures is also treated Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor.   TR 7333 Measure Theory I, Credits: 3.00    TR-GY 7343 ( Please refer to the bulletin )   Urban Systems Engineering and Management Concentration   Select at least 4 of the following courses:   3.00 Credits Infrastructure Planning, Engineering and Economics CE-GY 7813 This course covers the identification, formulation, preliminary appraisal and detailed analysis of individual civil engineering projects and systems. It also covers different approaches for government agencies, public utilities, industrial firms and private entrepreneurs. Other topics include: Planning, which considers projects that satisfy single and multiple purposes and objectives, meet local and regional needs and take advantage of opportunities for development; financial and economic analyses, including sensitivity and risk analysis; mathematical models for evaluation of alternatives and optimization; and impacts of projects: environmental, social, regional economic growth, legal and institutional and public involvement.  Prerequisite: Graduate Standing 3.00 Credits Concepts and Implementation of Infrastructure Management Systems CE-GY 7853 This course reviews state-of-the-art performance monitoring and system condition assessment methodologies as part of infrastructure management systems. Emphasis is on information technologies as applied to remote sensing and database development for urban systems management. Infrastructure tools, such as GIS and dedicated databases for condition assessment are represented in a laboratory environment. Invited experts participate in such areas as transportation, water distribution and utilities.  Prerequisite: Graduate Standing 3.00 Credits Instrumentation, Monitoring and Condition Assessment of Civil Infrastructure CE-GY 6073 This course covers: A systematic approach to planning and executing instrumentation, monitoring and condition assessment programs; strain measurements; civil engineering sensors (static, dynamic, optical); environmental measurements; mechatronic sensors; signal conditioning, information measurements and error analysis; business aspects; advanced-measurement systems. Prerequisite: Graduate Standing 3.00 Credits Environmental Systems Management CE-GY 7753 This course provides an overview of information technologies as applied to the remote sensing of environmental infrastructure systems, and includes the development of infrastructure system databases to assist complex decision-making on environmental infrastructures.  Prerequisite: Graduate Standing 3.00 Credits Construction and the Law CE-GY 8713 Construction industry executives need not be legal experts, but they must be aware of the legal issues affecting their industry and their bottom line. This course uses the case study method to lead students through the concepts of design and construction law. The course focuses on the interface of legal, business and technical issues and their resolution. It includes the design and organization of construction documents; the legal aspects of bidding, subcontracting, bonds, insurance, mechanic\u2019s liens, etc; and the implication of delays, changes and charged conditions. Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods are introduced. Prerequisite: Admission to the Exec 21 Program or permission of a Construction Management Program Director.   You must meet the requirements for Exec 21 courses to take this:    3.00 Credits Infrastructure Financing: Structuring of A Deal CE-GY 8733 This course examines what it takes to structure a deal from a credit perspective, legally and financially, for domestic and international projects. In the domestic sector, the course focuses on transportation projects, examining the peculiarities and the uniqueness of the capital market. Examples are studied and recent changes are discussed in areas such as financing transportation projects and the dramatically changing nature of financing these projects. In the international sector, the course covers innovative financing techniques. Prerequisite: Admission to the Exec 21 Program or permission of a Construction Management Program Director.    3.00 Credits Intelligent Transportation Systems and Their Applications TR-GY 6223 This course introduces the concepts and applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and its growing role in the management of transportation systems. The course stresses the role of ITS as national policy, as specified in major transportation funding legislation \u2013 ISTEA, TEA21 and SAFETY-LU. A systems engineering approach to overall development of ITS technologies is stressed. Major components of ITS are discussed, and examples of their application treated. Coordination and integration of ITS components are treated. Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor.   Grade Requirements   To earn a MS degree from the School of Engineering, you must maintain a B average (3.0 GPA) or better in (1) all graduate courses taken at the School of Engineering, (2) all graduate courses taken in the Department of Civil Engineering and (3) all graduate guided studies (readings, project, thesis). Poor scholastic performance (under 3.0 GPA) may lead to being placed on graduate probation. If your grades do not improve, you may be disqualified from further graduate study in the department. You may repeat a course with your adviser&rsquo;s approval. When a course is repeated, only the later grade counts toward your GPA. If a course is repeated more than once, only the first grade is dropped from the GPA computation. In the event that you are required to take undergraduate prerequisite courses as a condition of admission, a grade of B- or better is required for every prerequisite course taken, and the cumulative GPA of all required prerequisite courses must be at least 3.0.
