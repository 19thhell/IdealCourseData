Students will be prepared to work on research and evaluation projects drawing on the social and behavioral sciences.        Upon graduation, students will be able to do the following in both local and global settings:      Apply theories,  concepts and models from a range of social and behavioral disciplines that  are used in public health research and practice.   Assess  the causes of social and behavioral factors that affect health of  individuals and populations.   Identify  individual, organizational and community concerns, assets, resources and  deficits for social and behavioral science interventions.   Identify  critical stakeholders for the planning, implementation and evaluation of  public health programs, policies and interventions.   Describe  steps and procedures for the planning, implementation and evaluation of  public health programs, policies and interventions.   Describe  the role of behavioral, social, cultural and structural factors in both  the onset and solution of public health problems.   Apply  evidence-based approaches in the development and evaluation of social and  behavioral science interventions.   Apply  ethical principles to public health research, program planning,  implementation and evaluation.   Specify  multiple targets and levels of intervention for social and behavioral  science programs and/or policies.   Evaluate  the roles of history, power, privilege and structural inequality in  producing health disparities.   Apply  public health research methods to the identification of social and  behavioral influences on health, and to the development of public health interventions,  program evaluations, and policy.

Students will be prepared to work on research and evaluation projects drawing on the social and behavioral sciences.        Upon graduation, students will be able to do the following in both local and global settings:      Apply theories,  concepts and models from a range of social and behavioral disciplines that  are used in public health research and practice.   Assess  the causes of social and behavioral factors that affect health of  individuals and populations.   Identify  individual, organizational and community concerns, assets, resources and  deficits for social and behavioral science interventions.   Identify  critical stakeholders for the planning, implementation and evaluation of  public health programs, policies and interventions.   Describe  steps and procedures for the planning, implementation and evaluation of  public health programs, policies and interventions.   Describe  the role of behavioral, social, cultural and structural factors in both  the onset and solution of public health problems.   Apply  evidence-based approaches in the development and evaluation of social and  behavioral science interventions.   Apply  ethical principles to public health research, program planning,  implementation and evaluation.   Specify  multiple targets and levels of intervention for social and behavioral  science programs and/or policies.   Evaluate  the roles of history, power, privilege and structural inequality in  producing health disparities.   Apply  public health research methods to the identification of social and  behavioral influences on health, and to the development of public health interventions,  program evaluations, and policy.

Comments (0)                                         Welcome!                 Welcome to the Research Guide for Statistics in the Behavioral &amp; Social Sciences! We have compiled a list of resources to facilitate your data search.   Data is a raw material of research in many disciplines. When you collect your own data (with a survey, observations, instruments, or countless other methods), we call that primary data. When you use data that others have collected for a new purpose, this is secondary data. This guide focuses on helping you find that secondary data that you can use for your own projects.   Before you start searching, a few questions to think about:     Who or what am I interested in? People? Commodities? Governments?   What geographical area am I interested in? at what level? Country? Region? City?   What time period(s) am I interested in?    Who would be likely to collect that data? Collecting data is expensive and time consuming!

If you want to look at a single variable across several countries/regions/cities , take a look at International Comparative Sources . Stick to one source for your comparison so that you can be sure the data was collected consistently (or normalized).   If you want to look at many variables or want to find very specific data within a country or region , use National Statistical Agencies or Country- or Region-Specific Sources .   If you're looking for data from surveys, public opinion polls, research studies, and more try Data Archives &amp; Public Opinion Sources .

All scholarly or academic work requires  that you cite your sources, whether you are writing a long paper or a quick report. Why is citing your research so important?   Researching and writing a paper ideally involves a process of exploring and learning. By citing your sources, you are showing your reader how you came to your conclusions and acknowledging the other people's work that brought you to your conclusions. Citing your sources:      Documents your research and   scholarship    Acknowledges the work of others   whose scholarship contributed to your work    Helps your reader understand   the context of your argument    Provides information for your   reader to use to locate additional information on your topic    Establishes the credibility of   your scholarship   Provides you with an opportunity to demonstrate your own integrity and understanding of academic ethics        Partially adapted from \"When and Why to Cite Sources.\" SUNY Albany. 2008.
