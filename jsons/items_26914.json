The event will be moderated by Christine Landfried and is part of the Max Weber Guest Lectures 2015. Nil\u00fcfer G\u00f6le is Professor of Sociology at the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) in Paris. She works on Islamic visibility, secularism and intercultural controversies in European public spheres. Her sociological approach aims to open up a new reading of modernity from a non-western perspective and a broader critique of Eurocentrism in the definitions of secular modernity. Her books have been published in many languages. She is the author of Islam in Europe: The Lure of Fundamentalism and the Allure of Cosmopolitanism (2010) and The Forbidden Modern: Civilization and Veiling (1997). Nil\u00fcfer G\u00f6le directed the research project, EuroPublicIslam: Islam in the Making of a European Public Sphere , which received funding from the European Research Council. Based on the research results, she edited a book On Islam and Public Controversy in Europe (2014) and wrote a manuscript book, Musulmans au quotidien: une enqu\u00eate internationale sur les r\u00e9alit\u00e9s de l\u2019islam europ\u00e9en , that gives voice to ordinary Muslims of Europe creating an alternative public culture and new intercultural connections.
