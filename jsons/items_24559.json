The NYU Steinhardt Department of Occupational Therapy is pleased to announce the 2009 Frieda J. Behlen Occupational Therapy scholarship recipients - Susan Braham, Janelle Carbo, and Razia Khan . These three outstanding students have each been selected to receive a $3,000 tuition award for the summer 2009 semester. Funding for the award is derived from interest earned on the Department's endowed Frieda J. Behlen scholarship fund and also from funds raised by NYU OT alumni.    Gwen Weinstock, a Ph.D. candidate in occupational therapy, received the American Occupational Therapy Foundation Dissertation Research Grant award for 2008. This prestigious award provides financial support for data collection and analysis.

Tien-Ni is currently collecting data for her dissertation in Taiwan.    Shu-Yuan Hu and Rita Fleming-Castaldy both successfully defended their dissertations in November of 2007. Hu defended &ldquo;The Sensory Balance Test as a Screening for Possible Sensory Integration Deficits.&rdquo; In this study, she investigated the relationship between upper extremity stability and motor accuracy in young children.    Fleming-Castaldy also defended her project, &ldquo;Consumer-Directed Personal Care Assistance (PCA) and Quality of Life for Persons with Disabilities.&rdquo; Using a survey design, this study compared the perspectives of persons who use a consumer-directed PCA model to those who use an agency-directed one. The relationships found between self-management and satisfaction with PCA and quality of life support the value of consumer-directed PCA programs for disabled persons.    Students Biked for MS on Sunday, October 14, 2007. NYU OT students participated in a charity bike ride benefiting the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS). The MS Bike Tour took riders of all skill levels on routes around the island of Manhattan, with courses ranging between 30 to 100 miles.

OT students, faculty, and staff donated food items to help those affected by the crisis; five packages containing an assortment of non perishable food items were assembled and will be shipped to Pakistani families in need. The effort was led by 2nd year Occupational Therapy Professional Program student Salma Malik , with the aid Department Administrator Ayanna Lee; Salma would like to extend her thanks to all of the participants who made the effort a success.    In response to the earthquake in Haiti, Steinhardt OT students organized a donation drive this semester to provide self-care products to those in need. The drive was organized under the leadership of Joanna Dritsas and Michelle Carrol , as part of the 2nd-year professional program's class gift, and completed with the help of Department members Ayanna Lee, Karen Buckley, and Sally Poole. For Dritsas and Carrol, it offered a chance to integrate occupational therapy theory into their aid to the Haiti relief effort. They solicited the involvement of OT students, faculty and staff in assembling self-care packages, including toothpaste, soap, and shampoo, to be sent to families affected by the earthquake. A total of 125 supply packages were sent to Haiti through the AFYA Foundation, a humanitarian aid organization founded by Steinhardt OT alumna Danielle Butin ('85).    The NYU Steinhardt Department of Occupational Therapy is pleased to announce the 2010 Frieda J. Behlen Occupational Therapy scholarship recipients- Stacey Suplizio, Jessica Sibley, and Rachel Turner . These three outstanding students have each been selected to receive a $2,000 tuition award for the summer 2010 semester.    Siaw Chui Chai , NYU OT PhD candidate, will be presenting \"Study of Hand Span and Active Hand Mobility in Healthy Adults,\" Co-authored by Professor Jane Bear-Lehman, and Professional Program students Mary Ford, Rachelle Schwartz and Yael Weichselbaum at the 8th Triennial Congress of the International Federation of Societies for Hand Therapy (IFSHT) in Orlando, FL. The presentation is scheduled for Thursday, June 24th during session CS.1.1.    Congratulations to Tien-Ni Wang on the successful defense of her dissertation in the March of 2010. Wang defended \"The Relationship Between Postural Control and Fine Motor Skills in Preterm Infants.\"    The NYU OT Professional Program's second year class has donated $320 to GHESKIO to assist with Haitian relief efforts . GHESKIO is an independent Haitian organization in Port-au-Prince affiliated with Weil Cornell Medical Center, that provides free care to individuals with HIV/AIDs. Since the January 12th earthquake GHESKIO is providing humanitarian assistance and emergency care to those affected by the disaster and continues to provide life-saving medications to people with HIV/AIDS.

OT Class of 2010 Donated $300 to the Adaptive Design Association The OT Class of 2010 recently donated $300 to the Adaptive Design Association ( www.adaptivedesign.org ). This association does wonderful work to assist people in need. They make adaptive equipment and positioning devices, mainly for children with disabilities. OT students had previously spent time at ADA working on creative solutions and building appropriate equipment for kids. Our students gained a memorable experience during their project at the ADA facility, and the Class of 2010 has called attention to this valuable organization through a generous donation.    Congratulations to Shalini D'Souza and So Yeon Ahn (OT Post-Professional program) and their Developing Assistive Technology (E40.2900) classmate, Amanda Bernsohn (Tisch ITP) on their selection as one of nine finalist groups at this year's National Science Foundation sponsored RESNA Student Design Competition. As finalists, the group was invited to present its battery driven, reverse gravity leg bag emptier project at this year's 2009 RESNA conference in New Orleans. Travel was funded by NSF with additional support given by the NYU Tisch ITP program. At the conference, Holly Cohen (Rusk Institute for Rehabilitation Medicine), who currently serves as a Clinical Mentor for the Developing Assistive Technology class also presented a poster highlighting an earlier collaborative Steinhardt OT /Tisch ITP project.    NYU OT Participates in the 2009 NAMI NYC-Metro Walk. On Saturday, May 9, 2009, over a dozen NYU Occupational Therapy students and several NYU OT Alumni joined the NYC team of OT's Walk with NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) to fight the stigma of mental illness, and to raise money for educational and support programs of NYC NAMI ( http://www.nami.org/ ). Clad in their student designed purple NYU OT NAMI Walks T-shirts, the group left from the South Street Seaport and walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and back again, joining the ranks of OT's from Beth Israel, St. Luke's, Columbia Presbyterian, St. Vincent's, SUNY Downstate, York College, LIU, Stony Brook, and Columbia U. MNYD supplied the banner leading the team of OT's Walk with NAMI. This year's walk netted over $300,000 which was raised by consumers, family, friends, medical professionals, faculty, and students.    Francine Seruya , Gwen Weinstock-Zlotnick , and Mara Cohen Podvey all successfully defended their dissertations in Spring of 2009. Seruya defended \"Does Practice Setting Influence the Professional and Organizational Commitment of Pediatric Occupational Therapists,\" Weinstock-Zlotnick defended \"How Occupational Therapists Specializing in Hand Therapy Consider Participation During Initial Evaluation: A Look at Diagnostic Reasoning,\" and Cohen Podvey defended, \"Experiences of Families Who Receive Related Therapy Services as They Transition From Early Intervention to Preschool Special Education.    Tzu-Ying Yu , a Ph.D. candidate in occupational therapy, was awarded the NYU Steinhardt 2009 Dean's Grant for Student Research. This grant will enable Yu to test and confirm the methodology she will use in her final dissertation study, and will ensure that all five measures in her study can be appropriately used. Yu's dissertation will examine the contribution of haptic and kinesthetic perceptions in predicting handwriting legibility and speed in typically developing 6-8 year old children.    Peggy Swarbrick, PhD, OTR, CPRP, received the first-ever Karen Stern Award at the New Jersey Mental Health Partnership conference. She received the award for excellence in research and advocacy relating to mental health issues. Swarbrick is the director of the Institute for Wellness and Recovery Initiatives, Collaborative Support Services of New Jersey, and is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Psychiatry Rehabilitation and Counseling, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-School of Health Related Professions.    The NYU Steinhardt Department of Occupational Therapy is pleased to announce the 2009 Frieda J. Behlen Occupational Therapy scholarship recipients - Susan Braham, Janelle Carbo, and Razia Khan . These three outstanding students have each been selected to receive a $3,000 tuition award for the summer 2009 semester. Funding for the award is derived from interest earned on the Department's endowed Frieda J. Behlen scholarship fund and also from funds raised by NYU OT alumni.    Gwen Weinstock, a Ph.D. candidate in occupational therapy, received the American Occupational Therapy Foundation Dissertation Research Grant award for 2008. This prestigious award provides financial support for data collection and analysis. Gwen plans to defend her dissertation in the spring of 2009, with Jane Bear Lehman as the Dissertation Chair, and Jim Hinojosa and Sherri Weiser as committee members .    Tien-Ni Wang, a Ph.D. candidate in occupational therapy, earned second prize for her oral presentation at the 27 th Annual Conference of the Taiwan Occupational Therapy Association. The paper that Tien-Ni presented was based on a course taken during the winter session of 2008 at NYU Steinhardt on structure equation modeling and factor analysis. Tien-Ni is currently collecting data for her dissertation in Taiwan.    Shu-Yuan Hu and Rita Fleming-Castaldy both successfully defended their dissertations in November of 2007. Hu defended &ldquo;The Sensory Balance Test as a Screening for Possible Sensory Integration Deficits.&rdquo; In this study, she investigated the relationship between upper extremity stability and motor accuracy in young children.    Fleming-Castaldy also defended her project, &ldquo;Consumer-Directed Personal Care Assistance (PCA) and Quality of Life for Persons with Disabilities.&rdquo; Using a survey design, this study compared the perspectives of persons who use a consumer-directed PCA model to those who use an agency-directed one. The relationships found between self-management and satisfaction with PCA and quality of life support the value of consumer-directed PCA programs for disabled persons.    Students Biked for MS on Sunday, October 14, 2007. NYU OT students participated in a charity bike ride benefiting the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS). The MS Bike Tour took riders of all skill levels on routes around the island of Manhattan, with courses ranging between 30 to 100 miles. The NYU team (captained by second-year student Maia Watkins) raised more than $1,300 to support NMSS's educational programs, services, and a national research initiative. Said Assistant Professor Yael Goverover (who also biked in the event), \"We would like to thank all the people who supported us by joining our team or donating to this important cause. It is great to know that our students and faculty are involved in community outreach projects.\"    Joselyn B. Goldstein and Andrea Johnston , students in the Professional M.S.

Congratulations to Tzu-Ying Yu , on the successful November 2010 defense of her dissertation, \"The contribution of haptic and kinesthetic perceptions to handwriting in children ages 6 to 8 years.\" Yu was the recipient of a prestigious Dean's grant to support a pilot study for her dissertation and presented her work at the Dean's Grant for Student Research Colloquium in October of 2010.    In cooperation with the Islamic Center at NYU, students, faculty, and staff of the Department of Occupational Therapy contributed to the relief effort for victims of the recent floods in Pakistan. According to the United Nations, this is the most severe incident of flooding in eighty years, with six million Pakistanis in need of lifesaving assistance. OT students, faculty, and staff donated food items to help those affected by the crisis; five packages containing an assortment of non perishable food items were assembled and will be shipped to Pakistani families in need. The effort was led by 2nd year Occupational Therapy Professional Program student Salma Malik , with the aid Department Administrator Ayanna Lee; Salma would like to extend her thanks to all of the participants who made the effort a success.    In response to the earthquake in Haiti, Steinhardt OT students organized a donation drive this semester to provide self-care products to those in need. The drive was organized under the leadership of Joanna Dritsas and Michelle Carrol , as part of the 2nd-year professional program's class gift, and completed with the help of Department members Ayanna Lee, Karen Buckley, and Sally Poole. For Dritsas and Carrol, it offered a chance to integrate occupational therapy theory into their aid to the Haiti relief effort. They solicited the involvement of OT students, faculty and staff in assembling self-care packages, including toothpaste, soap, and shampoo, to be sent to families affected by the earthquake. A total of 125 supply packages were sent to Haiti through the AFYA Foundation, a humanitarian aid organization founded by Steinhardt OT alumna Danielle Butin ('85).    The NYU Steinhardt Department of Occupational Therapy is pleased to announce the 2010 Frieda J. Behlen Occupational Therapy scholarship recipients- Stacey Suplizio, Jessica Sibley, and Rachel Turner .

This association does wonderful work to assist people in need. They make adaptive equipment and positioning devices, mainly for children with disabilities. OT students had previously spent time at ADA working on creative solutions and building appropriate equipment for kids. Our students gained a memorable experience during their project at the ADA facility, and the Class of 2010 has called attention to this valuable organization through a generous donation.    Congratulations to Shalini D'Souza and So Yeon Ahn (OT Post-Professional program) and their Developing Assistive Technology (E40.2900) classmate, Amanda Bernsohn (Tisch ITP) on their selection as one of nine finalist groups at this year's National Science Foundation sponsored RESNA Student Design Competition. As finalists, the group was invited to present its battery driven, reverse gravity leg bag emptier project at this year's 2009 RESNA conference in New Orleans. Travel was funded by NSF with additional support given by the NYU Tisch ITP program. At the conference, Holly Cohen (Rusk Institute for Rehabilitation Medicine), who currently serves as a Clinical Mentor for the Developing Assistive Technology class also presented a poster highlighting an earlier collaborative Steinhardt OT /Tisch ITP project.    NYU OT Participates in the 2009 NAMI NYC-Metro Walk. On Saturday, May 9, 2009, over a dozen NYU Occupational Therapy students and several NYU OT Alumni joined the NYC team of OT's Walk with NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) to fight the stigma of mental illness, and to raise money for educational and support programs of NYC NAMI ( http://www.nami.org/ ). Clad in their student designed purple NYU OT NAMI Walks T-shirts, the group left from the South Street Seaport and walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and back again, joining the ranks of OT's from Beth Israel, St. Luke's, Columbia Presbyterian, St. Vincent's, SUNY Downstate, York College, LIU, Stony Brook, and Columbia U. MNYD supplied the banner leading the team of OT's Walk with NAMI. This year's walk netted over $300,000 which was raised by consumers, family, friends, medical professionals, faculty, and students.    Francine Seruya , Gwen Weinstock-Zlotnick , and Mara Cohen Podvey all successfully defended their dissertations in Spring of 2009. Seruya defended \"Does Practice Setting Influence the Professional and Organizational Commitment of Pediatric Occupational Therapists,\" Weinstock-Zlotnick defended \"How Occupational Therapists Specializing in Hand Therapy Consider Participation During Initial Evaluation: A Look at Diagnostic Reasoning,\" and Cohen Podvey defended, \"Experiences of Families Who Receive Related Therapy Services as They Transition From Early Intervention to Preschool Special Education.    Tzu-Ying Yu , a Ph.D. candidate in occupational therapy, was awarded the NYU Steinhardt 2009 Dean's Grant for Student Research. This grant will enable Yu to test and confirm the methodology she will use in her final dissertation study, and will ensure that all five measures in her study can be appropriately used. Yu's dissertation will examine the contribution of haptic and kinesthetic perceptions in predicting handwriting legibility and speed in typically developing 6-8 year old children.    Peggy Swarbrick, PhD, OTR, CPRP, received the first-ever Karen Stern Award at the New Jersey Mental Health Partnership conference. She received the award for excellence in research and advocacy relating to mental health issues. Swarbrick is the director of the Institute for Wellness and Recovery Initiatives, Collaborative Support Services of New Jersey, and is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Psychiatry Rehabilitation and Counseling, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-School of Health Related Professions.    The NYU Steinhardt Department of Occupational Therapy is pleased to announce the 2009 Frieda J. Behlen Occupational Therapy scholarship recipients - Susan Braham, Janelle Carbo, and Razia Khan . These three outstanding students have each been selected to receive a $3,000 tuition award for the summer 2009 semester. Funding for the award is derived from interest earned on the Department's endowed Frieda J. Behlen scholarship fund and also from funds raised by NYU OT alumni.    Gwen Weinstock, a Ph.D. candidate in occupational therapy, received the American Occupational Therapy Foundation Dissertation Research Grant award for 2008. This prestigious award provides financial support for data collection and analysis. Gwen plans to defend her dissertation in the spring of 2009, with Jane Bear Lehman as the Dissertation Chair, and Jim Hinojosa and Sherri Weiser as committee members .    Tien-Ni Wang, a Ph.D. candidate in occupational therapy, earned second prize for her oral presentation at the 27 th Annual Conference of the Taiwan Occupational Therapy Association. The paper that Tien-Ni presented was based on a course taken during the winter session of 2008 at NYU Steinhardt on structure equation modeling and factor analysis. Tien-Ni is currently collecting data for her dissertation in Taiwan.    Shu-Yuan Hu and Rita Fleming-Castaldy both successfully defended their dissertations in November of 2007. Hu defended &ldquo;The Sensory Balance Test as a Screening for Possible Sensory Integration Deficits.&rdquo; In this study, she investigated the relationship between upper extremity stability and motor accuracy in young children.    Fleming-Castaldy also defended her project, &ldquo;Consumer-Directed Personal Care Assistance (PCA) and Quality of Life for Persons with Disabilities.&rdquo; Using a survey design, this study compared the perspectives of persons who use a consumer-directed PCA model to those who use an agency-directed one. The relationships found between self-management and satisfaction with PCA and quality of life support the value of consumer-directed PCA programs for disabled persons.    Students Biked for MS on Sunday, October 14, 2007. NYU OT students participated in a charity bike ride benefiting the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS). The MS Bike Tour took riders of all skill levels on routes around the island of Manhattan, with courses ranging between 30 to 100 miles. The NYU team (captained by second-year student Maia Watkins) raised more than $1,300 to support NMSS's educational programs, services, and a national research initiative. Said Assistant Professor Yael Goverover (who also biked in the event), \"We would like to thank all the people who supported us by joining our team or donating to this important cause. It is great to know that our students and faculty are involved in community outreach projects.\"    Joselyn B. Goldstein and Andrea Johnston , students in the Professional M.S.

Behlen Scholarship Awardees for 2015 Announced               (From left to right) Precious Herrera, Charlene Woo, Callah Kimble   The NYU Steinhardt Department of Occupational Therapy is pleased to announce the recipients of the 2015 Frieda J. Behlen Occupational Therapy Scholarships. This year\u2019s awardees are Precious Herrera, Callah Kimble and Charlene Woo. These three exceptional students will each receive a $3500 tuition award for their summer 2015 semester.         Precious Herrera is interested in pursuing a career in the areas of mental health, pediatrics and neuroscience. Beyond that, she hopes to do work with women education and empowerment, as well as take her career abroad in developing countries. As an officer for the Class of 2016, she helps in the planning of social events and fundraiser opportunities for the department and her classmates, as well as supporting her fellow class officers in establishing connections with other NYU programs such as physical therapy and speech-language pathology (Communicative Sciences and Disorders). By volunteering for a non-profit in the Bronx, she has educated youth on occupational therapy and her experiences in NYU\u2019s program. She hopes to someday be able to establish an OT curriculum at her undergraduate alma mater and eventually return to NYU as an adjunct professor.   Callah Kimble is interested in the emerging practice of sensory integration rooms in psychiatry. Originally from California, she chose to enroll in NYU\u2019s OT program 3,000 miles away from home and has been inspired by the passion and commitment of the NYU OT faculty. She has made a priority out of attending the annual AOTA conference and is her class\u2019 AOTA co-representative, a position that involves helping organize the trip and urging others to attend. Eventually, she wants to work as an OT in an inpatient psychiatric unit and, more specifically, practice as a clinician in an inpatient eating disorder unit/clinic. She also places a strong emphasis on community involvement and, as a result, is a member of the New York State Occupational Therapy Association, the Occupational Therapy Association of California and the National Alliance on Mental Illness.   Charlene Woo has watched her passion for occupational therapy evolve during her time at NYU. Coming into the program, she wanted to work in outpatient pediatrics, but her fieldwork experiences have led her to develop a connection to geriatrics and palliative care. She is her class\u2019 co-chair, writes for the department\u2019s SpOTlight blog and attends NYU\u2019s Therapy Collective events, where speech language pathologists and physical therapists discuss their respective professions. She represents NYU at events for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, including NAMI Walks, and helps bring participants to their events as well. Whether she establishes a career by opening a private practice or by advocating for additional end-of-life care, she hopes to make a difference in occupational therapy.   The Frieda J. Behlen Occupational Therapy Scholarship is an endowed fund created principally by gifts from alumni of the occupational therapy programs at New York University. \u00a0Income generated by the endowment is awarded annually to students who demonstrate superior academic achievement as well as financial need. \u00a0With growth in the fund\u2019s balance from new gifts, the amount given out has been able to increase and will continue to do so. \u00a0The award takes the form of a tuition aid applied towards summer courses. \u00a0Professional Program second year students are eligible to apply.

An NYU Department of Occupational Therapy alum, Sanchez&#8217;s work centers around policy development related to occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy and assisted technology services within the public school system, which serves almost 35,000 students that require occupational therapy and about 15,000 who need physical therapy services. In an interview with SpOTlight , Sanchez talks about her journey to an administrative role at the Department of Education and the diverse and challenging roles of occupational therapists in the public school system.   Could you give an example of how you have shaped policy that connects students to occupational or physical therapy services? How do you know that a public school student might need them?   One of the things we do is determine what services should be provided to support the students that need them and decide which is the best service, whether it is occupational therapy, physical therapy or speech therapy. We develop an Individualized Teaching Program for the student and guidelines around the criteria for providing these services. We assign a therapist to work with the student and they, along with supervisors, determine an intervention plan for each case. We have a staff of more than 1,200 OTs and PTs and over 2,000 speech therapists, and we provide professional development to them on school-based practice interventions.   How is the therapy administered? Is it tied to the school curriculum and given in the school itself?   Yes. The majority of the services are administered in schools themselves. We do have some kids who may receive services at home if they are homeschooled or are in a homeschool situation because of an injury. But more than 90 percent of our services are provided in school and they are provided in a therapy room or directly in the classroom, which we call the natural environment so the therapist can work to support the student exactly where their disability is impacting them.   Could you give an example of the kind of OT services a student may need or receive in a classroom setting?   Let&#8217;s say a student has cerebral palsy and has a physical disability where they have what we call hemiparesis, that student may need support while typing on a keyboard, holding a pen or a pencil, sitting upright in a chair or moving around the school environment and participating in gym or lunch room with their peers. An OT, PT or speech therapist would go and assess the student\u2019s level of functioning and evaluate where the student might need support and how the support can be provided. Much of our work is focused on ensuring that students with disabilities participate with their non-disabled peers so that they are not separate or segregated. A therapist can help the student by either using adaptive equipment to increase mobility or work on speech and language production so they are able to communicate with their peers, or use an assisted technology device so that a student can communicate and socialize with their peers if they have limited communication skills.   What makes working in a school system unique or different from other occupational therapy settings?   I think one of the things working in the school system offers is exposure and the opportunity to work with children with all kinds of disabilities. I have worked with children who have neurological or physical and cognitive impairments, autism, spina bifida and those with intellectual disabilities \u2013 pretty much anything you can think of. I think that working in the school system poses a unique set of challenges and there are a wide variety of disabilities that a therapist is expected to support. It&#8217;s not like an outpatient setting where you&#8217;re working with primarily hip and knee replacements or an in-patient facility where you will see patients who have had a stroke or neurological injury. A school-based service is much more subjective and encompasses a much wider of range of disabilities in a broad age range. A therapist here works with students ranging from preschool to 12th grade.   Today, there are many career tracks for occupational therapy students, especially therapists who want to work with children. There&#8217;s pre-school setting, clinical setting, sensory integration specialties, certainly now needs that are related to autism. There are tremendous opportunities out there for therapists interested in OT and assisted technologies.   What drew you to occupational therapy and the program at NYU?   I had worked in a group home for young adults with autism during undergraduate school and it was there that I was first exposed to occupational therapy. Before that, I did my undergraduate degree in Miami and was considering PT school actually. I spent some time exploring schools of OT and PT and being a native New Yorker, I immediately looked at NYU. I went to an open house at the OT department and fell in love with the program. It was really that psychosocial component that drew me to OT and to NYU, and I thought that was something that was very valuable and lacking in some other programs.   Could you tell us a bit about your journey to your current position? How was the transition from playing the role of a therapist to more of an administrative side of things?   I have been in this position for a year and half and with the Department of Education, and I graduated from NYU in 1996. I worked as a school-based OT for about 10 years and then I worked as an OT supervisor, after which I became the director of occupational therapy services. I took this job as senior director of all services about a year and a half ago. At first, it was definitely difficult but a lot of skills are skills that you use in occupational therapy are problem solving and people skills, and I think I was fortunate to be successful at transferring those skills into management.   How has being a part of the NYU alumni network helped you?   There are other NYU alumni, specifically from the OT program, who are my colleagues in and out of the school system and I work with them on a continual basis. Some of them are also colleagues who own private practices and work with students\u2019 families, as therapists and supervisors. Because I\u2019m a lifelong learner, the current faculty at NYU also serve as a great resource for me.   What would you say is the best part of your job?   I think the best part of my job is being able to work with different types of children and their families and make an impact daily on the lives of students with disabilities. I&#8217;m very fortunate to be able to do that.

Located at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering\u2018s Metrotech Center in Brooklyn, the Lab offers students a place to explore and enhance technologies that can address the needs of people with disabilities. In an interview with SpOTlight, Anita Perr , Clinical Associate Professor at the Department of Occupational Therapy talks about the Ability Lab\u2019s current projects and its future plans.   What is the Ability Lab and how was it started?   The Ability lab is a place to learn about, explore, and research assistive technology used by people with disabilities. Faculty, students, and researchers can connect with each other, and work on their own projects or on ongoing Ability Lab projects. The Ability Lab started officially last year, but we&#8217;ve been running courses and working on assistive technology grants for about 10 years.\u00a0 It started with a relationship with Marianne Petit , Associate Arts professor at the NYU Tisch School of the Arts in the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) where artists and designers learn about and create interactive art and technology. Marianne was interested in how people with disabilities function and interact with technology, so we offered a one-time course on assisted technology. That course has been running ever since. When the NYU Poly School of Engineering came on board, we expanded the course and applied for and received funding for the Ability Lab.   Could you tell us a bit about the current projects in place?   We conduct courses at the Ability Lab, one of which is called &#8216;Developing Assistive Technology&#8217; which is open to students across all of the Schools at NYU. Groups of students collaborate with outside organizations to develop technologies for people with disabilities. Each of the groups that are set up are a mix of those students who have different professional backgrounds and different areas of interest and expertise. While they work on their projects, the course covers a variety of AT-related topics. We have five groups in the class right now. One of the groups is developing a device called Gyrocafe that will help people who use walkers to carry things without spilling them. Another group is working with the Strivright School in Brooklyn- a preschool for children who are deaf or hearing impaired where they are developing a sensory room. The group in our class is developing an interactive device that will be used for practicing balance, reaching and other motor skills. Other projects include apps for children who have difficulty producing the &#8216;R&#8217; sound, a portable easy-to-carry ramp for places that don\u2019t have curb-cuts and a game app to improve memory and planning.   Could you tell us a bit about other activities at the Lab, like the project with autistic children?   TechKids Unlimited, a not-for-profit tech-based educational organization runs a program in the Ability Lab on Sundays where kids ages 7-18, many of whom are diagnosed with autism, learn to use technology to make media, games, video, models, etc. NYU Faculty and students help facilitate the classes as counselors and instructors.\u00a0 Using a strength-based approach, the kids learn skills that may develop into career interests and expertise. They also work on other skills like socialization and communication while they work and have lunch together.      What are the future goals for the Ability Lab?   This Spring, students from NYU Tisch\u2019s ITP and NYU Poly\u2019s IDM will continue to work with the Ability Lab on projects related to their own Master\u2019s theses. We also plan to have a competition to offer seed money to students interested in developing a new project or working on an existing project. Our Occupational Therapy students will have the opportunity to receive small grants to act as clinical resources to the students working on projects. We will be using this year to apply for grants and continue to build the program.   Now that the Ability Lab is here and we are building an institutional history, we look forward to continuing projects from semester from semester. The information that students learn and their projects in class will be shared on our website so that other people can take a look at what we have done, and use that to do their own work. We really want to foster the relationship between people in different schools in our own university along with the people with disabilities and researchers in the broader community to we can push the field forward.

My career in occupational therapy began in my late thirties, but when I retired at almost 70, I had not \u2018finished\u2019 my OT pursuit of knowledge.   After I retired, I was ready to sit down and co-author a book about social participation with Marli Cole, and to write a manual for the Social Profile assessment tool. Writing the book was a dream come true. Previously, I had not had time to focus on writing and publishing extensive works , but I had always had an interest in the role sociability, social presence and socialization play in our lives.   Working with the Social Profile Assessment tool gave me the opportunity to develop presentations illustrating the measurement capacity of this calibrated instrument and I have spoken about this program in guest lectures and posters over the past seven years at different conferences.   Since my retirement I have also found the time to focus on volunteering for occupational therapy committees and boards that I like to support. I have been a co-chair of the metro MNYD Research Committee for 30 years where I am now working with Nancy Finklestein Klein as my co-chair, to present a Research Forum of local OT studies annually. We also coach occupational therapists that need guidance in putting together studies.   For me, being on the high seas is both challenging and relaxing at the same time. I love being on the water. I\u2019ve been a member of New York Sailing Club since 1980. It&#8217;s a great social club. After I retired, I had time to serve as Commodore for two years and I often provided galley gourmet meals on board for boat owners and hospitality at my house after seal watches on the Bay near Jones Beach. Our club is a &#8216;mature,&#8217; generous group of boat owners and crew who share life on board, and lending a hand as a sailor. They rank high on the Social Profile scale of service and sharing. They are like family to me.   What drives me to continue to work in occupational therapy is two-fold: the energy that occupation provides to people to enrich their lives and live a healthy life-style, as well as the opportunity to keep in touch with inspiring colleagues in the field. For future OTs I encourage them to find what motivates their children, clients and community to help them to fulfill their lives&#8217; dreams.

Marjie is currently a second year student in the MS OT program. Congratulations to Marjie!!    OT Class of 2010 Donated $300 to the Adaptive Design Association The OT Class of 2010 recently donated $300 to the Adaptive Design Association ( www.adaptivedesign.org ). This association does wonderful work to assist people in need. They make adaptive equipment and positioning devices, mainly for children with disabilities. OT students had previously spent time at ADA working on creative solutions and building appropriate equipment for kids. Our students gained a memorable experience during their project at the ADA facility, and the Class of 2010 has called attention to this valuable organization through a generous donation.    Congratulations to Shalini D'Souza and So Yeon Ahn (OT Post-Professional program) and their Developing Assistive Technology (E40.2900) classmate, Amanda Bernsohn (Tisch ITP) on their selection as one of nine finalist groups at this year's National Science Foundation sponsored RESNA Student Design Competition. As finalists, the group was invited to present its battery driven, reverse gravity leg bag emptier project at this year's 2009 RESNA conference in New Orleans. Travel was funded by NSF with additional support given by the NYU Tisch ITP program. At the conference, Holly Cohen (Rusk Institute for Rehabilitation Medicine), who currently serves as a Clinical Mentor for the Developing Assistive Technology class also presented a poster highlighting an earlier collaborative Steinhardt OT /Tisch ITP project.    NYU OT Participates in the 2009 NAMI NYC-Metro Walk. On Saturday, May 9, 2009, over a dozen NYU Occupational Therapy students and several NYU OT Alumni joined the NYC team of OT's Walk with NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) to fight the stigma of mental illness, and to raise money for educational and support programs of NYC NAMI ( http://www.nami.org/ ). Clad in their student designed purple NYU OT NAMI Walks T-shirts, the group left from the South Street Seaport and walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and back again, joining the ranks of OT's from Beth Israel, St. Luke's, Columbia Presbyterian, St. Vincent's, SUNY Downstate, York College, LIU, Stony Brook, and Columbia U. MNYD supplied the banner leading the team of OT's Walk with NAMI. This year's walk netted over $300,000 which was raised by consumers, family, friends, medical professionals, faculty, and students.    Francine Seruya , Gwen Weinstock-Zlotnick , and Mara Cohen Podvey all successfully defended their dissertations in Spring of 2009. Seruya defended \"Does Practice Setting Influence the Professional and Organizational Commitment of Pediatric Occupational Therapists,\" Weinstock-Zlotnick defended \"How Occupational Therapists Specializing in Hand Therapy Consider Participation During Initial Evaluation: A Look at Diagnostic Reasoning,\" and Cohen Podvey defended, \"Experiences of Families Who Receive Related Therapy Services as They Transition From Early Intervention to Preschool Special Education.    Tzu-Ying Yu , a Ph.D. candidate in occupational therapy, was awarded the NYU Steinhardt 2009 Dean's Grant for Student Research. This grant will enable Yu to test and confirm the methodology she will use in her final dissertation study, and will ensure that all five measures in her study can be appropriately used. Yu's dissertation will examine the contribution of haptic and kinesthetic perceptions in predicting handwriting legibility and speed in typically developing 6-8 year old children.    Peggy Swarbrick, PhD, OTR, CPRP, received the first-ever Karen Stern Award at the New Jersey Mental Health Partnership conference. She received the award for excellence in research and advocacy relating to mental health issues. Swarbrick is the director of the Institute for Wellness and Recovery Initiatives, Collaborative Support Services of New Jersey, and is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Psychiatry Rehabilitation and Counseling, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-School of Health Related Professions.    The NYU Steinhardt Department of Occupational Therapy is pleased to announce the 2009 Frieda J. Behlen Occupational Therapy scholarship recipients - Susan Braham, Janelle Carbo, and Razia Khan . These three outstanding students have each been selected to receive a $3,000 tuition award for the summer 2009 semester. Funding for the award is derived from interest earned on the Department's endowed Frieda J. Behlen scholarship fund and also from funds raised by NYU OT alumni.    Gwen Weinstock, a Ph.D. candidate in occupational therapy, received the American Occupational Therapy Foundation Dissertation Research Grant award for 2008. This prestigious award provides financial support for data collection and analysis. Gwen plans to defend her dissertation in the spring of 2009, with Jane Bear Lehman as the Dissertation Chair, and Jim Hinojosa and Sherri Weiser as committee members .    Tien-Ni Wang, a Ph.D. candidate in occupational therapy, earned second prize for her oral presentation at the 27 th Annual Conference of the Taiwan Occupational Therapy Association. The paper that Tien-Ni presented was based on a course taken during the winter session of 2008 at NYU Steinhardt on structure equation modeling and factor analysis. Tien-Ni is currently collecting data for her dissertation in Taiwan.    Shu-Yuan Hu and Rita Fleming-Castaldy both successfully defended their dissertations in November of 2007. Hu defended &ldquo;The Sensory Balance Test as a Screening for Possible Sensory Integration Deficits.&rdquo; In this study, she investigated the relationship between upper extremity stability and motor accuracy in young children.    Fleming-Castaldy also defended her project, &ldquo;Consumer-Directed Personal Care Assistance (PCA) and Quality of Life for Persons with Disabilities.&rdquo; Using a survey design, this study compared the perspectives of persons who use a consumer-directed PCA model to those who use an agency-directed one. The relationships found between self-management and satisfaction with PCA and quality of life support the value of consumer-directed PCA programs for disabled persons.    Students Biked for MS on Sunday, October 14, 2007. NYU OT students participated in a charity bike ride benefiting the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS). The MS Bike Tour took riders of all skill levels on routes around the island of Manhattan, with courses ranging between 30 to 100 miles. The NYU team (captained by second-year student Maia Watkins) raised more than $1,300 to support NMSS's educational programs, services, and a national research initiative. Said Assistant Professor Yael Goverover (who also biked in the event), \"We would like to thank all the people who supported us by joining our team or donating to this important cause. It is great to know that our students and faculty are involved in community outreach projects.\"    Joselyn B. Goldstein and Andrea Johnston , students in the Professional M.S.
