In addition to voice, acting and dance, as well as courses in music theatre repertoire and history, the core of our program's music theatre specialization training takes place through an intensive series of music theatre workshops.

In addition to the work in classrooms and studios, the program offers performance opportunities in fully-staged productions under the guidance of professional directors, choreographers, conductors, musical directors, and designers. Our guest artists and faculty are drawn from New York's vibrant community of professional artists who count Broadway, off-Broadway, regional theatre and national tours among their credits.

Students have up to 6 years to complete the degree program.    The following concentration is available: Classical Voice    APPLICATION DEADLINES             SPRING    N/A                SUMMER    N/A                                      FALL    January 6                   Deadlines are \"in-office\" deadlines not postmark deadlines. Failure to meet the deadlines will cause significant delays in processing your application and may exclude your application from consideration.    APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS       Application (online only)    Application Fee (payable by Major Credit card only)    Statement of Purpose    Resume/Curriculum Vitae    Letters of Recommendation are not required    One official copy of transcripts from all institutions attended or attending (see transcript information below)    NEW: Pre-screening artistic materials . Please see below instructions on how to submit your pre-screening video and other artistic materials    Audition is NOT required    GRE is NOT required    See TOEFL requirements information below       NOTE(S)          The deadline for submission of the prescreening materials is the same as the application deadline.                Upload Pre-screening Materials: All prospective students are required to submit a video pre-screening submission. In this process, you will make short videos and upload them to GetAcceptd, a company created for this purpose. You may begin this process at:             Rather than a single long video, we would like three separate clips: the introduction, the first song, and the second song. It&rsquo;s easier for us to review and easier for you to shoot. We will not be influenced by the professional quality of the video. Please do not worry about any elaborate lighting or studio conditions. Below are the requirements and suggestions for your material.       Introduction: Please say your name clearly, the date, the city you are from, and the pieces that you are going to do. Say also the Specialization for which you are auditioning (music theatre) and the degree level you would be entering (masters, advanced certificate). Also say your NYU &ldquo;N&rdquo; number, if applicable (received from Admissions after you apply).       Two songs: Your two selections should be complete and contrasting songs. Each selection should be no longer than four minutes. Choose material from music theatre repertoire &ndash; but please avoid rock, pop, country, and jazz. Piano must accompany you (no a capella singing). Please make sure your voice can be heard above the accompaniment &ndash; try different distances from the sound source until you find the right &ldquo;balance&rdquo; between piano and voice.        Upload a resume. This is in addition to the resume/ curriculum vitae you will submit to the Admissions Office &ndash; and should reflect a more theatrical focus to your body of experience. Think &ldquo;theatre resume&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;academic resume&rdquo; for this upload.       Upload a headshot or photograph.    After uploading the pre-screening submission, you will immediately be notified that we have received your materials. After those materials have been reviewed you will be contacted with more information.                All fall semester performance applicants who wish to be considered for talent-based scholoarships awards must (1) submit their application materials by January 6 and (2) complete the entire process by March 1. U.S. students should also file for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by February 1 to be considered for student loans and other school-based scholarships.             Basic competence in music history and theory is a prerequisite for all graduate degree programs in music. Entering graduate students are required to take advisory exams in both areas prior to arrival; placements will be determined by interpreting the exam results in light of a student's educational background and the degree program for which she or he is enrolled. Remedial courses cannot be used to meet degree requirements within any of the graduate programs .

Our curriculum is designed for the serious young musician who is seeking a program that fully integrates the study of voice with the study of acting. We are committed to the traditions of classically-based vocal training while at the same time allowing students to explore the demanding repertoire that is expected of professional singers in today's ever-expanding world of music theatre performance.    In addition to voice, acting and dance, as well as courses in music theatre repertoire and history, the core of our program's music theatre specialization training takes place through an intensive series of music theatre workshops. These workshops explore such critical areas as movement, speech, diction, song study, scene study, audition skills, and business skills - the essential \"tools of the trade\" that a young artist needs in order to pursue a professional career.    In addition to the work in classrooms and studios, the program offers performance opportunities in fully-staged productions under the guidance of professional directors, choreographers, conductors, musical directors, and designers. Our guest artists and faculty are drawn from New York's vibrant community of professional artists who count Broadway, off-Broadway, regional theatre and national tours among their credits.    Students specializing in Music Theatre make their New York \"debut\" in their final semester as they are presented to New York's agents, casting directors, directors, and producers in their graduation showcase - a revue designed to feature the work of each student and help them make their first professional contacts in the industry.    The Department's acclaimed programs of study in Music Business (B.M., M.A.), Music Technology (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Jazz (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Music Composition (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), and Music Education (B.M., M.A., Ph.D.) provide a rich and valuable array of elective courses for music performance majors that prepare them for an ever-changing music industry and musical climate. Undergraduate and graduate students also benefit from the extraordinary opportunities available through the diverse offerings of a major university in the cultural capital of the world, New York City.

Failure to meet the deadlines will cause significant delays in processing your application and may exclude your application from consideration.    APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS       Application (online only)    Application Fee (payable by Major Credit card only)    Statement of Purpose    Resume/Curriculum Vitae    Letters of Recommendation are not required    One official copy of transcripts from all institutions attended or attending (see transcript information below)    NEW: Pre-screening artistic materials . Please see below instructions on how to submit your pre-screening video and other artistic materials    Audition is NOT required    GRE is NOT required    See TOEFL requirements information below       NOTE(S)          The deadline for submission of the prescreening materials is the same as the application deadline.                Upload Pre-screening Materials: All prospective students are required to submit a video pre-screening submission. In this process, you will make short videos and upload them to GetAcceptd, a company created for this purpose. You may begin this process at:             Rather than a single long video, we would like three separate clips: the introduction, the first song, and the second song. It&rsquo;s easier for us to review and easier for you to shoot. We will not be influenced by the professional quality of the video. Please do not worry about any elaborate lighting or studio conditions. Below are the requirements and suggestions for your material.       Introduction: Please say your name clearly, the date, the city you are from, and the pieces that you are going to do. Say also the Specialization for which you are auditioning (music theatre) and the degree level you would be entering (masters, advanced certificate). Also say your NYU &ldquo;N&rdquo; number, if applicable (received from Admissions after you apply).       Two songs: Your two selections should be complete and contrasting songs. Each selection should be no longer than four minutes. Choose material from music theatre repertoire &ndash; but please avoid rock, pop, country, and jazz. Piano must accompany you (no a capella singing). Please make sure your voice can be heard above the accompaniment &ndash; try different distances from the sound source until you find the right &ldquo;balance&rdquo; between piano and voice.        Upload a resume. This is in addition to the resume/ curriculum vitae you will submit to the Admissions Office &ndash; and should reflect a more theatrical focus to your body of experience. Think &ldquo;theatre resume&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;academic resume&rdquo; for this upload.       Upload a headshot or photograph.    After uploading the pre-screening submission, you will immediately be notified that we have received your materials. After those materials have been reviewed you will be contacted with more information.                All fall semester performance applicants who wish to be considered for talent-based scholoarships awards must (1) submit their application materials by January 6 and (2) complete the entire process by March 1.

Basic competence in music history and theory is a prerequisite for all graduate degree programs in music. Entering graduate students are required to take advisory exams in both areas prior to arrival; placements will be determined by interpreting the exam results in light of a student's educational background and the degree program for which she or he is enrolled.

Our curriculum is designed for the serious young musician who is seeking a program that fully integrates the study of voice with the study of acting. We are committed to the traditions of classically-based vocal training while at the same time allowing students to explore the demanding repertoire that is expected of professional singers in today's ever-expanding world of music theatre performance.    In addition to voice, acting and dance, as well as courses in music theatre repertoire and history, the core of our program's music theatre specialization training takes place through an intensive series of music theatre workshops. These workshops explore such critical areas as movement, speech, diction, song study, scene study, audition skills, and business skills - the essential \"tools of the trade\" that a young artist needs in order to pursue a professional career.    In addition to the work in classrooms and studios, the program offers performance opportunities in fully-staged productions under the guidance of professional directors, choreographers, conductors, musical directors, and designers. Our guest artists and faculty are drawn from New York's vibrant community of professional artists who count Broadway, off-Broadway, regional theatre and national tours among their credits.    Students specializing in Music Theatre make their New York \"debut\" in their final semester as they are presented to New York's agents, casting directors, directors, and producers in their graduation showcase - a revue designed to feature the work of each student and help them make their first professional contacts in the industry.
