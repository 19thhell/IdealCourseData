Participants will engage in service work throughout New York City, reflect on their experiences, explore issues of ethical leadership development, and connect with ongoing civic engagement opportunities at NYU.

Are you excited about getting involved at NYU and looking forward to making a difference in New York City? Make a commitment to serve the community around you by applying to Project OutReach!    Project OutReach brings together service-minded first-year and transfer students for leadership training, service, and reflection in a week-long, intensive program prior to NYU's Welcome Week . Participants will work with community partner agencies throughout the city each day, learning about a variety of social issues and gathering socially responsible leadership skills.   Project OutReach is limited to 100 participants, and the selection process is highly competitive.              2015 Application   The 2015 Project OutReach Application will be available as of Friday May 1, 2015. The deadline to apply is Monday, June 15, at 11:45PM.   Apply to Project OutReach 2015        Key Dates   Project OutReach 2015 will run from Monday, August 24 through Friday, August 28 . The application deadline is June 15, 2015 at 11:45 PM EST . Applicants will be notified of selection to the program by Monday, June 29th. Participants must arrive on campus, move in to their residence halls, and be ready to begin Project OutReach activities by Monday, August 24th at 2:00 PM.   Students who will be living on campus for the 2015-2016 academic year will gain access to NYU housing prior to the start of Project OutReach. OutReach is a program that requires a full commitment from participants, with activities scheduled each day from the early morning through evening hours. Participants will be unable to hold external commitments, including jobs or external social engagements, during that week.         Program Offerings and Schedule   Participants in Project OutReach will be divided into small groups and will spend each day volunteering with a local community organization throughout New York City's five boroughs. Groups will work on a diversity of projects throughout the week: from rebuilding homes damaged during Hurricane Sandy in Staten Island, to sorting donations at The Food Bank in the Bronx, to working with a tutoring program in Brooklyn. On Friday, the entire team will work together on a large scale project.   Throughout the week there will also be a wide range of educational programs, including social justice trainings, films, guest speakers, and a mini-conference aimed at connecting participants with service initiatives at NYU and beyond.   Participation Fee   Project OutReach requires a non-refundable fee of $100, paid to NYU in full by Friday, July 10th. This fee goes towards supporting program expenses including daily meals, a weekly unlimited MetroCard for travel during the program, service site supplies, and t-shirts. More information about how to make this payment will be provided to accepted participants.   The cost of OutReach should not prohibit anyone from applying to the program.
