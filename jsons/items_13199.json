The core curriculum includes laboratory rotations, ordinarily in two or three of   the Center's laboratories . By the end of the first year, students   have usually selected an area and laboratory in which they wish to pursue their dissertation research.   A three-member faculty committee, including the chosen research sponsor oversees the conduct of   students' research. This committee is typically supplemented by two additional members to form   the examining committee for the doctoral dissertation.        NYU Shanghai track in Neural Science  NYU's portal campus in Shanghai is recruiting doctoral students through  the Shanghai track of the Doctoral Program in Neural Science. NYU Shanghai  and its partner East China Normal University jointly operate an  Institute of Brain and Cognitive Science. IBCS has a broad vision, the  areas of research include neural circuit mechanisms of cognitive  function (such as decision-making and human language), and  inter-disciplinary computational neuroscience. For more information  about IBCS and its faculty, see   the NYU Shanghai page .     Students in the Shanghai track will spend one and half years at  NYU in New York for course work and laboratory rotations, before  joining a laboratory in Shanghai for thesis research. They will  maintain a close tie with New York, and they will receive an NYU Ph.D.         New Admission Process - See Below        Academic Requirements    Overall Requirements  Students in the Doctoral Program in Neural Science normally register for 9-12 credits of course work each semester; a minimum of 72 course credits is required for the Ph.D.    Core Curriculum  All students are required to take the 28-credit core curriculum, normally in the two semesters of the first year. This curriculum consists of lecture and laboratory courses taught by a team of Center faculty members who provide in-depth treatment of all major areas in neuroscience.   Laboratory  The laboratory component of the curriculum includes both hands-on experience with a variety of neurobiological methods in a weekly six-hour instructional laboratory and also two or three rotations in laboratories of members of the Center. The rotations are of particular importance for students joining the program, because they provide experience in the variety of research topics and methods used in the Center. The rotations also allow students to investigate possible laboratories for thesis work. In addition, students attend a weekly one-hour colloquium at which outside speakers discuss their research. Several journal clubs provide forums for student discussion of the current research literature.    Research  Pre- and postdoctoral trainees formally present their current research at the Center's semi-monthly Fellows' Seminar . An advisor and two other faculty members guide the student in selection of courses and laboratory rotations. Students are encouraged to interact with all other members of the Center, who are also available for advice and guidance.   Further Study  After completing the core curriculum, each student's program is individually tailored to take maximum advantage of course offerings in areas relevant to his or her selected areas of interest.    Advanced Curriculum  Extensive doctoral course offerings available in the Center for Neural Science, the Programs in Basic Medical Sciences, and the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology provide a rich and advanced curriculum in all areas of neuroscience and related sciences. In addition, members of the Center offer advanced seminars in areas of their own research.    General Requirements for the doctorate at NYU  The Graduate School of Arts and Science home page provides listings of these offerings as well as information on transfer credits and other general requirements for the doctorate at New York University. It is expected that the student will fulfill the course requirements, complete the doctoral research, and defend the thesis within five years.           Ph.D. Course Requirements and Sample Ph.D. Curriculum      A minimum of 72 points is required, at least 32 of which must be taken in residence at New York University.      For students who began the program in September 2000 or later , at least 37 points must be    taken in graded courses. The first year core curriculum, required of all    students, includes the following graded courses: Cellular, Molecular    &amp; Developmental Neural Science, G80.2201 (4 points); Sensory &amp;    Motor Systems, G80.2202 (4 points); Cognitive &amp; Behavioral Neural    Science, G80.2205 (4 points); Mathematical Tools for Neural Science,    G80.2207 (4 points); Laboratory in Neural Science I &amp; II G80.2203    &amp; 2204 (3 points each); and Introduction to Research in Neural    Science I, II G80.2210, 2211 (3 points each). These are all graded    courses. In addition, students attend the   Seminar in    Current Topics , the  Fellows' Seminar , and a series of Workshops for Emerging Scientists .   Note that second and third year students ordinarily register for 9 points per semester.  Students in the fourth year and beyond ordinarily register only for the courses needed to  meet the 72 points required for graduation.   Students who have earned 72 points \"maintain matriculation.  That is, they maintain registration as full-time students without registering for courses.   CNS students may maintain matriculation without charge for six semesters.   \"Introduction to Research\" course should be taken only by students who are doing  rotations. Once you are attached to a laboratory, these courses are inappropriate.   The courses \"Readings in Neural Science\" and \"Research Problems in Neural Science\"  are intended to provide appropriate course credits for the faculty-guided readings and research necessary for preparation of the PhD thesis. These courses can be taken more than once for credit.      \"Dissertation Research\" courses should be taken only by students who have completed  about 66 points and the required number of points in graded courses. These courses are  ordinarily taken by students who are preparing the thesis document.

The main research facilities of the Center comprise 26,000 square feet of newly renovated laboratory and office space at 4 Washington Place, adjacent to the Departments of Physics and Psychology. Facilities include laboratories for the 16 core faculty, and shared laboratories for histology, microscopy, cell and molecular biology, photography, digital imaging, and computing. Associates of the Center with adjacent laboratories in the Departments of Physics and Psychology have an additional 12,000 square feet of laboratory space; associates with laboratories in other departments have use of a further 19,000 square feet. The Center incorporates modern vivarium facilities operated by the University's Office of Laboratory Animal Services, which provides suitable support personnel to assist researchers and students in animal research, including work with nonhuman primates. The Center jointly operates an electronic and machine shop with the Department of Psychology; the shop provides modern facilities for the development of specialized electronic and mechanical devices.       The Center's research laboratories contain an unusually comprehensive array of modern research instrumentation. A centrally supported network of superminicomputers and microcomputers guarantees the availability of the most modern computing facilities for experimental work, data analysis, and modeling. Individual laboratories are fully equipped with modern instrumentation and computers and provide facilities for advanced research in neurochemistry, neurophysiology, biophysics, behavioral neuroscience, visual science, auditory science, mathematical biology, computational neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. In addition, the Center stresses the shared use of advanced facilities in areas such as computer-aided neuroanatomy, molecular and cellular neurobiology, and computer graphics and image processing, thereby making available research tools of a caliber not usually encountered in individual research laboratories.      A 1,500-square-foot teaching laboratory, used for  laboratory courses in both the doctoral and undergraduate programs,  provides a high-quality environment for hands-on training in the  techniques of modern neuroscience. The laboratory provides outstanding  facilities for topical experimentation in neurophysiology and biophysics,  neurochemistry, experimental neuroanatomy, and behavioral neuroscience. A  separate computer laboratory provides modern facilities for laboratory  instruction in computational and theoretical neuroscience.             Admissions, Financial Aid & Housing    Admissions     The Doctoral Program in Neural Science (Faculty of Arts and Science) and the  Doctoral Program in Neuroscience & Physiology (Sackler Institute, School  of Medicine) have harmonized their academic and research requirements and  will process applications jointly. Details of the shared neuroscience  curriculum and combined pool of neuroscience faculty mentors can be found  at neuroscience.nyu.edu .  Your application will therefore be  considered by a joint admissions committee, and you will be eligible  for admission to either program. Our goal is to help you match with  the program that best fits your interests.    Admission to the Doctoral Program in Neural Science is limited to qualified students, as documented by high scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), superior undergraduate grades, and excellent letters of recommendation.   Students seeking admission should have a strong background in one or more of the academic areas involved in neuroscience, such as biology, experimental psychology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science, or engineering science.   Students with foreign qualifications must demonstrate their command of written and spoken English before admission to the Center. Qualified women and minority students are especially encouraged to apply.    Applications are due by December 1 for admission the following fall.   For more information (including instructions, forms, and FAQs) and to complete an application, please visit the GSAS Application ResourceCenter.      Financial Aid  The Center provides support for students in the neural science program through fellowships, traineeships and assistantships so that students can devote themselves full time to their studies. Stipend levels equal or exceed those at other major research universities. Support for the first year is normally in the form of a University fellowship or NIH traineeship; in subsequent years, support is available in the form of traineeships, teaching assistantships and research assistantships.   Students are also actively encouraged to seek fellowship support from such outside sources as NSF and NIH, but the availability of multiple support mechanisms assures for each student in good standing the continuation of support for at least the five years normally required for completion of the doctorate.    Housing     Doctoral students in the Neural Science program are eligible to receive housing benefits while they are enrolled full time and in good standing:      1) First year students are guaranteed subsidized, furnished housing,  through the MacCracken program, located in Stuyvesant Town, which is  approximately 1 mile from the Center and served by a free campus shuttle bus.  More information on the MacCracken Housing Program can be found at   http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.financialaid.mhp        2) Students in non-University, off-campus apartments will receive  an allowance specifically to help offset the cost of market-rate,  New York City housing. Students in good standing in the program will  receive an allowance for every month they reside off-campus, including  during the first year if they do not elect the MacCracken option described  above. The NYU Off-Campus Housing Office can assist students to find  housing: http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/off-campus-living.html .       NYU has limited on-campus graduate housing for students after their  first year. Interested students can apply to the Housing Office to be  placed on a waitlist. When selecting students from the waitlist, GSAS  gives priority to international students and to students who have a  permanent United States address that is more than 35 miles from NYU.  More information about on-campus housing options can be found at:   http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living.html.

Support for the first year is normally in the form of a University fellowship or NIH traineeship; in subsequent years, support is available in the form of traineeships, teaching assistantships and research assistantships.   Students are also actively encouraged to seek fellowship support from such outside sources as NSF and NIH, but the availability of multiple support mechanisms assures for each student in good standing the continuation of support for at least the five years normally required for completion of the doctorate.    Housing     Doctoral students in the Neural Science program are eligible to receive housing benefits while they are enrolled full time and in good standing:      1) First year students are guaranteed subsidized, furnished housing,  through the MacCracken program, located in Stuyvesant Town, which is  approximately 1 mile from the Center and served by a free campus shuttle bus.  More information on the MacCracken Housing Program can be found at   http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.financialaid.mhp        2) Students in non-University, off-campus apartments will receive  an allowance specifically to help offset the cost of market-rate,  New York City housing. Students in good standing in the program will  receive an allowance for every month they reside off-campus, including  during the first year if they do not elect the MacCracken option described  above. The NYU Off-Campus Housing Office can assist students to find  housing: http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/off-campus-living.html .       NYU has limited on-campus graduate housing for students after their  first year. Interested students can apply to the Housing Office to be  placed on a waitlist. When selecting students from the waitlist, GSAS  gives priority to international students and to students who have a  permanent United States address that is more than 35 miles from NYU.

Research is central in our graduate training. Students are exposed to a broad range of knowledge in cognition and perception and they are trained to think creatively and to develop independent research careers.                   Our program spans cognition and perception, examining mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, categorization, language, emotion, development, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience. How do we identify the letter &quot;a&quot;? How do we perceive depth and shape? What representational resources are innate? How do human cultures, and individual children, go beyond innate representational capacities? How do toddlers make decisions about their world? How are explicit and implicit memories coded in the brain? How do we inhibit inappropriate responses? How are sentences understood? How are new concepts acquired? How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

The core curriculum includes laboratory rotations, ordinarily in two or three of   the Center's laboratories . By the end of the first year, students   have usually selected an area and laboratory in which they wish to pursue their dissertation research.   A three-member faculty committee, including the chosen research sponsor oversees the conduct of   students' research. This committee is typically supplemented by two additional members to form   the examining committee for the doctoral dissertation.        NYU Shanghai track in Neural Science  NYU's portal campus in Shanghai is recruiting doctoral students through  the Shanghai track of the Doctoral Program in Neural Science. NYU Shanghai  and its partner East China Normal University jointly operate an  Institute of Brain and Cognitive Science. IBCS has a broad vision, the  areas of research include neural circuit mechanisms of cognitive  function (such as decision-making and human language), and  inter-disciplinary computational neuroscience. For more information  about IBCS and its faculty, see   the NYU Shanghai page .     Students in the Shanghai track will spend one and half years at  NYU in New York for course work and laboratory rotations, before  joining a laboratory in Shanghai for thesis research. They will  maintain a close tie with New York, and they will receive an NYU Ph.D.         New Admission Process - See Below        Academic Requirements    Overall Requirements  Students in the Doctoral Program in Neural Science normally register for 9-12 credits of course work each semester; a minimum of 72 course credits is required for the Ph.D.    Core Curriculum  All students are required to take the 28-credit core curriculum, normally in the two semesters of the first year. This curriculum consists of lecture and laboratory courses taught by a team of Center faculty members who provide in-depth treatment of all major areas in neuroscience.   Laboratory  The laboratory component of the curriculum includes both hands-on experience with a variety of neurobiological methods in a weekly six-hour instructional laboratory and also two or three rotations in laboratories of members of the Center. The rotations are of particular importance for students joining the program, because they provide experience in the variety of research topics and methods used in the Center. The rotations also allow students to investigate possible laboratories for thesis work. In addition, students attend a weekly one-hour colloquium at which outside speakers discuss their research. Several journal clubs provide forums for student discussion of the current research literature.    Research  Pre- and postdoctoral trainees formally present their current research at the Center's semi-monthly Fellows' Seminar . An advisor and two other faculty members guide the student in selection of courses and laboratory rotations. Students are encouraged to interact with all other members of the Center, who are also available for advice and guidance.   Further Study  After completing the core curriculum, each student's program is individually tailored to take maximum advantage of course offerings in areas relevant to his or her selected areas of interest.    Advanced Curriculum  Extensive doctoral course offerings available in the Center for Neural Science, the Programs in Basic Medical Sciences, and the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology provide a rich and advanced curriculum in all areas of neuroscience and related sciences. In addition, members of the Center offer advanced seminars in areas of their own research.    General Requirements for the doctorate at NYU  The Graduate School of Arts and Science home page provides listings of these offerings as well as information on transfer credits and other general requirements for the doctorate at New York University. It is expected that the student will fulfill the course requirements, complete the doctoral research, and defend the thesis within five years.           Ph.D. Course Requirements and Sample Ph.D. Curriculum      A minimum of 72 points is required, at least 32 of which must be taken in residence at New York University.      For students who began the program in September 2000 or later , at least 37 points must be    taken in graded courses. The first year core curriculum, required of all    students, includes the following graded courses: Cellular, Molecular    &amp; Developmental Neural Science, G80.2201 (4 points); Sensory &amp;    Motor Systems, G80.2202 (4 points); Cognitive &amp; Behavioral Neural    Science, G80.2205 (4 points); Mathematical Tools for Neural Science,    G80.2207 (4 points); Laboratory in Neural Science I &amp; II G80.2203    &amp; 2204 (3 points each); and Introduction to Research in Neural    Science I, II G80.2210, 2211 (3 points each). These are all graded    courses. In addition, students attend the   Seminar in    Current Topics , the  Fellows' Seminar , and a series of Workshops for Emerging Scientists .   Note that second and third year students ordinarily register for 9 points per semester.  Students in the fourth year and beyond ordinarily register only for the courses needed to  meet the 72 points required for graduation.   Students who have earned 72 points \"maintain matriculation.  That is, they maintain registration as full-time students without registering for courses.   CNS students may maintain matriculation without charge for six semesters.   \"Introduction to Research\" course should be taken only by students who are doing  rotations. Once you are attached to a laboratory, these courses are inappropriate.   The courses \"Readings in Neural Science\" and \"Research Problems in Neural Science\"  are intended to provide appropriate course credits for the faculty-guided readings and research necessary for preparation of the PhD thesis. These courses can be taken more than once for credit.      \"Dissertation Research\" courses should be taken only by students who have completed  about 66 points and the required number of points in graded courses. These courses are  ordinarily taken by students who are preparing the thesis document.

The main research facilities of the Center comprise 26,000 square feet of newly renovated laboratory and office space at 4 Washington Place, adjacent to the Departments of Physics and Psychology. Facilities include laboratories for the 16 core faculty, and shared laboratories for histology, microscopy, cell and molecular biology, photography, digital imaging, and computing. Associates of the Center with adjacent laboratories in the Departments of Physics and Psychology have an additional 12,000 square feet of laboratory space; associates with laboratories in other departments have use of a further 19,000 square feet. The Center incorporates modern vivarium facilities operated by the University's Office of Laboratory Animal Services, which provides suitable support personnel to assist researchers and students in animal research, including work with nonhuman primates. The Center jointly operates an electronic and machine shop with the Department of Psychology; the shop provides modern facilities for the development of specialized electronic and mechanical devices.       The Center's research laboratories contain an unusually comprehensive array of modern research instrumentation. A centrally supported network of superminicomputers and microcomputers guarantees the availability of the most modern computing facilities for experimental work, data analysis, and modeling. Individual laboratories are fully equipped with modern instrumentation and computers and provide facilities for advanced research in neurochemistry, neurophysiology, biophysics, behavioral neuroscience, visual science, auditory science, mathematical biology, computational neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. In addition, the Center stresses the shared use of advanced facilities in areas such as computer-aided neuroanatomy, molecular and cellular neurobiology, and computer graphics and image processing, thereby making available research tools of a caliber not usually encountered in individual research laboratories.      A 1,500-square-foot teaching laboratory, used for  laboratory courses in both the doctoral and undergraduate programs,  provides a high-quality environment for hands-on training in the  techniques of modern neuroscience. The laboratory provides outstanding  facilities for topical experimentation in neurophysiology and biophysics,  neurochemistry, experimental neuroanatomy, and behavioral neuroscience. A  separate computer laboratory provides modern facilities for laboratory  instruction in computational and theoretical neuroscience.             Admissions, Financial Aid & Housing    Admissions     The Doctoral Program in Neural Science (Faculty of Arts and Science) and the  Doctoral Program in Neuroscience & Physiology (Sackler Institute, School  of Medicine) have harmonized their academic and research requirements and  will process applications jointly. Details of the shared neuroscience  curriculum and combined pool of neuroscience faculty mentors can be found  at neuroscience.nyu.edu .  Your application will therefore be  considered by a joint admissions committee, and you will be eligible  for admission to either program. Our goal is to help you match with  the program that best fits your interests.    Admission to the Doctoral Program in Neural Science is limited to qualified students, as documented by high scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), superior undergraduate grades, and excellent letters of recommendation.   Students seeking admission should have a strong background in one or more of the academic areas involved in neuroscience, such as biology, experimental psychology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science, or engineering science.   Students with foreign qualifications must demonstrate their command of written and spoken English before admission to the Center. Qualified women and minority students are especially encouraged to apply.    Applications are due by December 1 for admission the following fall.

Research is central in our graduate training. Students are exposed to a broad range of knowledge in cognition and perception and they are trained to think creatively and to develop independent research careers.                   Our program spans cognition and perception, examining mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, categorization, language, emotion, development, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience. How do we identify the letter &quot;a&quot;? How do we perceive depth and shape? What representational resources are innate? How do human cultures, and individual children, go beyond innate representational capacities? How do toddlers make decisions about their world? How are explicit and implicit memories coded in the brain? How do we inhibit inappropriate responses? How are sentences understood? How are new concepts acquired? How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

The primary goal of the Institute is to understand the mechanisms by which neural circuits in the brain generate higher cognition and \ufb02exible behavior, and their impairments associated with brain diseases such as autism, schizophrenia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.   The Institute leverages the existing signi\ufb01cant strength of neuroscience research at NYU and ECNU: systems and cognitive neuroscience broadly de\ufb01ned, using a range of tools including the development of transgenic primates, molecular and physiological studies of neural circuits, experimental analysis of behavior, microcircuit and large-scale neural circuit modeling, and human brain imaging.   A focus is on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) which plays a central role in many cognitive functions. The core institute research areas include studies of the neural basis of working memory and choice behavior using single-neuron recordings from the PFC of behaving monkeys and rodents; computational modeling of the PFC and its interplay with the rest of the brain in decision-making, memory, selective attention and executive control; and imaging research on human language. The Institute will grow to have more than twenty research groups, as well as many collaborating faculty from NYU in New York and elsewhere.
