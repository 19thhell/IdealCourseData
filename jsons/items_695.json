The faculty at New York University is particularly strong in Economic Theory, Macroeconomics, International Economics, and Economic Growth and Development. Although Economics is a large Department, its students enjoy an excellent student-faculty rapport. Many of the faculty members are associated with distinguished research institutions. By being able to study with faculty who are actively engaged in research, students learn not only about the fundamentals of economic theory but also about how such theory is utilized. They have the opportunity to conduct research on their own. Honors students are required to write a research paper as an Honors Thesis under direct faculty supervision.    Academic Programs    The Department offers a major in Economics and joint majors in Economics and Mathematics and in Economics and Computer Science. The details are set forth in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin.    The Department's major can be taken in either one of two concentrations, a Theory concentration or, a Policy concentration. The former is for students who desire a more formal approach to economic analysis. The latter is for students who prefer an approach less formal and that emphasize the role of economic institutions and the interplay between policy and theory. Highly motivated students may wish to explore the possibilities of participation in the Department's honors programs, which gives students access to excellent professors in small classes and culminates in the writing of a senior thesis under faculty supervision. Students who plan to go on to advanced degrees in Economics or to law school are strongly encouraged to pursue the Theory concentration, but should consider taking Honors as well. Honors may also be taken in the Policy concentration and eligible students are urged to do so.    Activities and Awards    All students interested in Economics are welcome to join the student-run Undergraduate Economics Society. In the past, the Society has organized a series of guest speakers, visits to local economic institutions, and social activities. The Department also has chapters of two national academic honor societies, Omicron Delta Epsilon and the Honorary Economics Society. The Murray Altman Prize is given to a junior with an outstanding record in Economics and related fields. The Emanuel Stein Memorial Award in Economics goes to a senior for outstanding scholarship in economics.    Career Options    Students majoring in Economics have many options open to them after graduation. The major prepares them for graduate school in Economics, business management, or public administration. Pre-professional students will find that an Economics major not only fosters the discipline medical or law school demands, but provides a solid foundation for these and other careers. Studying Economics at New York University is especially rewarding because of the urban environment. Students often find internships and eventually career opportunities on Wall Street, at the United Nations, or in various corporate, financial, governmental, agency, and nonprofit institutional settings.    Admission and Financial Aid    Students seeking admission should apply to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York University, 22 Washington Square North, New York, NY 10011. The University sponsors and administers a wide variety of financial aid programs. Awards are based on the student's record of academic achievement and test scores as well as on financial need.

The M.A. program in economics at New York University is one of the most rigorous in the country. It will give you a solid background in advanced economics and enable you to upgrade your skills in applied economic analysis and public policy. It can also serve as an excellent preparatory degree for those students wishing to go on to a Ph.D. program elsewhere in the U.S. Some of our MA Economic graduates have gone on to pursue a PhD at the following universities: University of Chicago, University of Minnesota, UCLA, University of Oxford, Ohio State, Georgetown and NYU.    Job Opportunities    Candidates who hold a master\u2019s degree in economics have much better employment prospects than those of bachelor\u2019s degree holders, and they also obtain a higher median base salary than candidates with bachelor\u2019s degrees (from Occupational Outlook Handbook, Bureau of Labor Statistics). Opportunities for economists range from positions in the business world in banking, insurance, investment and communications firms to those in academic settings, government agencies, trade associations and consulting organizations. Our students are employed at such companies and organizations as: American Express, Credit Suisse, Goldman/Sachs/&amp; Co., Smart Money Magazine, Time Magazine, Citigroup, Deutsches Bank, Bloomberg Communications, AIG Insurance Company, Moody\u2019s Economy.Com, The IMF, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Royal Bank of Canada    NYU Economics Alumni Club    A degree is more than a paper diploma; it is experiences, friendships and opportunities that never graduate. NYU M.A. Economics Alumni Club is an independent student and alumni volunteer coordinated club for our M.A. Economics Family. Please check out the website for alumni news, upcoming events, job postings, career discussions, alumni marketplace and more. Join us to receive exclusive invitations to both NYU Department of Economic sponsored events as well as private social networking parties.    http://www.nyueconalumni.com    Program Requirements    The M.A. degree in economics requires a minimum of three semesters of full-time study. The time limit for completion of the degree is five years for both full- and part-time students.    Course of Study: Formal requirements for the Master of Arts degree in economics are the satisfactory completion of graduate studies totaling at least 32 points and the writing of a special project report. In order to graduate, students must complete at least 24 points within the Department of Economics at New York University (i.e., courses with a G31 prefix). (Transfer credits do not count toward this requirement.) Most courses carry 3 points; the special project carries 2 points. Students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 (B) with 18 points of B (3.0) or better. Students may take 8 points outside the Department of Economics.    The M.A. degree requires five core courses, five elective courses, and a special project in economic research.    The five core courses are Mathematics for Economists (G31.1001), Microeconomic Theory (G31.1003), Macroeconomic Theory I (G31.1005), Applied Statistics and Econometrics I (G31.1101), and Applied Statistics and Econometrics II (G31.1102).    Special Project in Economic Research (G31.3200) is taken in the final or penultimate semester. The aim of the course is to integrate material and tools that have been taught throughout the M.A. program in addressing applied economic and policy problems. Students are encouraged to approach research questions from outside a narrow specialization and to consider linkages between different fields.    Elective courses are selected from the department\u2019s regular course offerings. Students may also select relevant courses at the NYU Leonard N. Stern School of Business. This strategy is designed to give students a well-rounded education that will be useful after graduation in the nonacademic world. In addition to regular courses in economics, students take courses in finance, accounting, international business, and operations research at Stern. Highly qualified M.A. students preparing for a Ph.D. program may also take courses in the graduate division of the Department of Mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, which offers balanced training in mathematics and its applications in the broadest sense.    MASTER OF ARTS AND ADVANCED CERTIFICATE PROGRAM IN APPLIED ECONOMIC ANALYSIS    The department offers an advanced certificate program in applied economic analysis with areas of study in economic development and international economics. Participating students must take the required core courses (listed above) and complete the M.A. special project report. After receiving the M.A. degree, students may continue their studies to earn an advanced certificate with the opportunity to focus on one of the areas of study. A minimum of six specialized courses is required. When certain required courses are not offered, the department may substitute other appropriate courses to satisfy the requirements for the advanced certificate.    Economic Development: This area of study is designed for those concerned with economic study of development policies in the less developed countries. It is geared to those planning careers with governments of developing countries, the United Nations and other international institutions, U.S. government agencies concerned with development and foreign assistance, and corporations doing business in the less developed countries as well as other private organizations.    Requirements include the core courses; G31.1603; where appropriate, G31.3001, 3002; additional elective points to complete 32 points; and a special project report.    For the advanced certificate, three additional courses must be selected from G31.1505; G31.1506; G31.1605; G31.1608; and, where appropriate, G31.3001, 3002. A total of 41 points at minimum is required for the M.A. and the advanced certificate.    International Economics: The objective of the international economics area of study is to train economists to function effectively in international organizations such as the United Nations and its related agencies, regional economic groups such as the European Union or the Latin American Free Trade Association, national government bodies such as central banks and trade ministries, and companies in the private sector.    Requirements include the core courses; G31.1505; G31.1506; G31.1402; and, where appropriate, G31.3001, 3002. A total of 32 points and a special project report complete the requirements for the M.A.    For the advanced certificate, three additional courses must be selected from G31.1603; where appropriate, G31.3001, 3002; International Competition and the Multinational Enterprise (B30.2385); Global Banking and Capital Markets (B40.3387); and International Financial Management (B40.3388). A total of 41 points at minimum is required for the M.A. and the advanced certificate.    Note: Courses designated by numbers beginning with the letter B are offered by the Leonard N.

Topics covered include, but are not restricted to, prospect theory, mental accounting, other-regarding preferences, and hyperbolic discounting. We usually approach a topic by examining evidence of some departure from the assumptions made in the canonical economic model. We then ask how such departures can be formalized theoretically and how the resulting models can be tested empirically.    Political Economy (T)   ECON-UA 345 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduces the emerging field of formal political economy. The variety of ways in which economists and political scientists think about political science and the interplay of political science and economics are analyzed. The first part of the course focuses on the formal modeling of political behavior and political institutions; the theory of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action) are analyzed. The second part of the course discusses the connection between politics and economics and investigates the effect of political variables on the determination of economic outcomes. Some questions that are answered: How can special groups of individuals enhance their well-being by political action? What is lobbying? What is the effect of contributions on political outcomes?

Experimental Economics (P, T)   ECON-UA 360 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.    Experimental economics is predicated on the belief that economics, like other sciences, can be a laboratory science where economic theories are tested, rejected, and revised. This course reviews the methodology of doing such laboratory experiments and investigates the use of experiments in a wide variety of fields. These include competitive markets, auctions, public goods theory, labor economics, game theory, and individual choice theory. The course functions as a research seminar in which students present their work as it progresses during the semester. Students also get exposure to the experimental laboratory in the Department of Economics and the research performed there.
