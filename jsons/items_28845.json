The program consists of three semesters of full-time course work, beginning with an exciting Summer Institute.    The curriculum includes two required courses--Introduction to Performance Studies and Projects in Performance Studies--which are complemented by seven courses chosen in consultation with the student\u2019s faculty adviser according to individual interests and needs. Students in the program are also encouraged to apply for internships in dramaturgy, museum curating, and other programs with which the department maintains contact.
