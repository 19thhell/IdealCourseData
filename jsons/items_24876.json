For further information, please go to the GSAS admissions         web site to apply on-line.          International students applying on a non-degree basis    cannot apply on line, but must submit a paper application.    Instructions on non-degree applications are available online    from the GSAS       web site . The GSAS web site also has instructions and    links to the most frequently asked questions and verification    about receipt of applications.          The rules and regulations governing admissions to NYUs Graduate    School of Arts and Science must be met by all applicants seeking    admission to graduate study in mathematics.           All applicants must have an accredited baccalaureate degree     or its equivalent. Applicants in their last semester of     undergraduate study must graduate before they begin their     graduate work at NYU.      An official transcript from all previously attended     institutions (undergraduate, graduate, and continuing     educational programs) must be uploaded using the online     application system.      A student must provide three letters of recommendation     (except non-degree). It is strongly recommended that at     least two of these letters be from faculty with whom the     applicant took a mathematics or other science course.     Letters must be submitted using the online application system.      General GRE (Graduate Record Examination) scores are     required of all applicants (except non-degree); applicants for     the Ph.D. program must also provide the subject GRE score,     preferably in mathematics, but accepted in other relevant     sciences.      Applicants whose native language is not English must submit     a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score; scores     of less than 600 (250 for the computer-based test; 100     for the internet-based test) are generally not recommended for     admission. This requirement may be waived for an     applicant with an accredited degree from an institution where     English was the language of instruction. IELTS scores are not     accepted by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in place     of the TOEFL.           List code 2596 for the NYU Graduate School of Arts and     Science in your request to the Educational Testing Service for     forwarding official GRE and TOEFL scores. The departmental     code for the GRE is 0703; for the TOEFL it is 72.      Application         Deadlines           The following application deadlines apply for both American     and foreign students:           Admission to the Ph.D. program - January 4.      Admission to M.S. programs except Mathematics in     Finance - April 1 (Fall), November 1 (Spring), April 15     (Summer).      Admission to M.S. program in Mathematics in Finance -     February 8 (Fall, full-time only), August 1 (Fall, part-time     only), December 1 (Spring, part-time only).           Admission on a non-degree basis in Mathematics (to take     up to four courses) - August 1 (Fall), December 1 (Spring).      Admission on a non-degree basis in Financial Mathematics     (to take up to four courses) or to a Certificate in     Financial Mathematics (to take up to eight courses) - August     1 (Fall), December 1 (Spring).          Ph.D. applicants who missed the January deadline may apply to    the M.S. program (without support).     Degree     Programs      The following degree programs are offered by the Department     of Mathematics:           Ph.D. in Mathematics;      Ph.D. in Ocean-Atmosphere Science and Mathematics;      M.S. in Mathematics;      M.S. in Scientific Computing;      M.S. in Mathematics in Finance.      Certificate in Mathematics in Finance.          The Graduate School of Arts and Science now offers a doctoral    program in Computational Biology. Students may apply to    this program through the Departments of Mathematics, Computer    Science, Biology, Chemistry, or the Center for Neural Sciences.          The department also admits students on a non-degree basis,    permitting them to take up to four courses. These    applicants do not need to submit test scores or recommendation    letters (but will later be required to do so if they apply to    any degree program). They are expected to meet the same academic    standards as matriculated students.     Admission         on a Non-Degree Basis      Many students are interested in just a few courses, have     considered the M.S. programs too late to apply, or were not     accepted. It is possible to apply as a non-degree, or     non-matriculated student. Generally the non-degree option is     used only by students who plan to study part-time and cannot     be used by international students to obtain a student visa.     International non-degree applicants cannot apply on line and    must request an application from the Graduate School of Arts and    Science (please visit the GSAS web site ).       Recommendation letters and GRE scores are not required for    admission on a non-degree basis. The academic background    required for non-degree admission is the same as the requirement    for the masters degrees, as these students will be taking the    same courses as masters degree students. Non-degree students    are allowed to take up to four courses.          After completing four courses, students can apply for admission    to the M.S. program in Mathematics, Math Finance or Scientific    Computing. Students will need to formally apply through GSAS online .     Students should note that due to limited resources, admission to    an M.S. program is not automatic or guaranteed after    completing four courses with good grades.           Admission         Criteria      Admission decisions are based on a careful review of the     applicant's previous academic record, letters of     recommendation, TOEFL (if applicable) and GRE scores, as well     as other credentials, such as work experience or previous     research projects. In the evaluation of applications,     applicants should note the following:           Students with B.A./B.S. degrees may apply directly     to the Ph.D. program.      The Department accepts Ph.D. applications only for     full-time study.      Students applying for the Ph.D. program who do not     qualify for it will automatically be considered for the M.S.     program.      Applicants who were accepted into the M.S. program will     be favorably considered for the Ph.D. program when they earn     the grade of A on the Written Comprehensive Examination.           Undergraduate Background      All applicants must have earned (or be about to complete) a     B.A. or B.S. or the equivalent. They must have taken     three semesters of college-level calculus, including one     semester of advanced calculus or linear algebra or the     equivalent. Students who do not have the advanced     calculus course may be required to take the course G63.1002     Multivariable Calculus.      As previously emphasized, these are the very minimum     requirements; additional undergraduate coursework in     mathematics is desirable. Courses in analysis, linear     algebra, complex variables, partial and ordinary differential     equations, and probability theory are especially helpful.      Students who do not have some necessary mathematical     preparation may be able to compensate by taking courses at     Courant on a non-degree basis.

All non-degree students must contact their academic department each term for registration.     Some departments only permit non-degree students to audit courses. Auditors pay full tuition and fees for courses; no academic credit is awarded, and the work can never be applied toward a degree.     A visiting student conducting research must contact their academic department as soon as arriving on campus to process your registration.     All F1 and J1 visa holders are required to register and maintain full-time equivalency to comply with Homeland Security. Please contact your academic department for guidance.     If you plan to arrive after the first day of classes (please check our academic calendar ), then you must notify your department administrator so your registration can be completed as soon as possible; otherwise you risk being out of status / compliance with U.S. visa regulations. Please note that if your registration takes place after the payment deadline, you will have six business days to pay your bill from the date of your registration.           Tuition, Fees and Health Insurance   Note: non-degree students are not eligible for any form of University financial aid.         Tuition and Fees           All non-degree students are charged tuition and fees. Please visit the Bursar website to review the fee schedule if you are registering for or auditing courses (up to 12 credits permitted).      If you are not taking courses, then visiting students must pay the visiting student researcher course fees ($952 or $1,042 per semester for academic year 2014-2015, U.S. and international students, respectively).      Visiting students accepted into the Economics or Politics department are charged a higher rate ($3,452 or $3,542 per semester for academic year 2014-2015, U.S. and international students, respectively) for the visiting student researcher course.          Health Insurance    All international non-degree students on an F1 or J1 visa are required to maintain health insurance (approximately $3,300 for the year).

For further information, please go to the GSAS admissions         web site to apply on-line.          International students applying on a non-degree basis    cannot apply on line, but must submit a paper application.    Instructions on non-degree applications are available online    from the GSAS       web site . The GSAS web site also has instructions and    links to the most frequently asked questions and verification    about receipt of applications.          The rules and regulations governing admissions to NYUs Graduate    School of Arts and Science must be met by all applicants seeking    admission to graduate study in mathematics.           All applicants must have an accredited baccalaureate degree     or its equivalent. Applicants in their last semester of     undergraduate study must graduate before they begin their     graduate work at NYU.      An official transcript from all previously attended     institutions (undergraduate, graduate, and continuing     educational programs) must be uploaded using the online     application system.      A student must provide three letters of recommendation     (except non-degree). It is strongly recommended that at     least two of these letters be from faculty with whom the     applicant took a mathematics or other science course.     Letters must be submitted using the online application system.      General GRE (Graduate Record Examination) scores are     required of all applicants (except non-degree); applicants for     the Ph.D. program must also provide the subject GRE score,     preferably in mathematics, but accepted in other relevant     sciences.      Applicants whose native language is not English must submit     a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score; scores     of less than 600 (250 for the computer-based test; 100     for the internet-based test) are generally not recommended for     admission. This requirement may be waived for an     applicant with an accredited degree from an institution where     English was the language of instruction. IELTS scores are not     accepted by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in place     of the TOEFL.           List code 2596 for the NYU Graduate School of Arts and     Science in your request to the Educational Testing Service for     forwarding official GRE and TOEFL scores. The departmental     code for the GRE is 0703; for the TOEFL it is 72.      Application         Deadlines           The following application deadlines apply for both American     and foreign students:           Admission to the Ph.D. program - January 4.      Admission to M.S. programs except Mathematics in     Finance - April 1 (Fall), November 1 (Spring), April 15     (Summer).      Admission to M.S. program in Mathematics in Finance -     February 8 (Fall, full-time only), August 1 (Fall, part-time     only), December 1 (Spring, part-time only).           Admission on a non-degree basis in Mathematics (to take     up to four courses) - August 1 (Fall), December 1 (Spring).      Admission on a non-degree basis in Financial Mathematics     (to take up to four courses) or to a Certificate in     Financial Mathematics (to take up to eight courses) - August     1 (Fall), December 1 (Spring).          Ph.D. applicants who missed the January deadline may apply to    the M.S. program (without support).     Degree     Programs      The following degree programs are offered by the Department     of Mathematics:           Ph.D. in Mathematics;      Ph.D. in Ocean-Atmosphere Science and Mathematics;      M.S. in Mathematics;      M.S. in Scientific Computing;      M.S. in Mathematics in Finance.      Certificate in Mathematics in Finance.          The Graduate School of Arts and Science now offers a doctoral    program in Computational Biology. Students may apply to    this program through the Departments of Mathematics, Computer    Science, Biology, Chemistry, or the Center for Neural Sciences.          The department also admits students on a non-degree basis,    permitting them to take up to four courses. These    applicants do not need to submit test scores or recommendation    letters (but will later be required to do so if they apply to    any degree program). They are expected to meet the same academic    standards as matriculated students.     Admission         on a Non-Degree Basis      Many students are interested in just a few courses, have     considered the M.S. programs too late to apply, or were not     accepted. It is possible to apply as a non-degree, or     non-matriculated student. Generally the non-degree option is     used only by students who plan to study part-time and cannot     be used by international students to obtain a student visa.     International non-degree applicants cannot apply on line and    must request an application from the Graduate School of Arts and    Science (please visit the GSAS web site ).       Recommendation letters and GRE scores are not required for    admission on a non-degree basis. The academic background    required for non-degree admission is the same as the requirement    for the masters degrees, as these students will be taking the    same courses as masters degree students. Non-degree students    are allowed to take up to four courses.          After completing four courses, students can apply for admission    to the M.S. program in Mathematics, Math Finance or Scientific    Computing. Students will need to formally apply through GSAS online .     Students should note that due to limited resources, admission to    an M.S. program is not automatic or guaranteed after    completing four courses with good grades.           Admission         Criteria      Admission decisions are based on a careful review of the     applicant's previous academic record, letters of     recommendation, TOEFL (if applicable) and GRE scores, as well     as other credentials, such as work experience or previous     research projects. In the evaluation of applications,     applicants should note the following:           Students with B.A./B.S. degrees may apply directly     to the Ph.D. program.      The Department accepts Ph.D. applications only for     full-time study.      Students applying for the Ph.D. program who do not     qualify for it will automatically be considered for the M.S.     program.      Applicants who were accepted into the M.S. program will     be favorably considered for the Ph.D. program when they earn     the grade of A on the Written Comprehensive Examination.           Undergraduate Background      All applicants must have earned (or be about to complete) a     B.A. or B.S. or the equivalent. They must have taken     three semesters of college-level calculus, including one     semester of advanced calculus or linear algebra or the     equivalent. Students who do not have the advanced     calculus course may be required to take the course G63.1002     Multivariable Calculus.      As previously emphasized, these are the very minimum     requirements; additional undergraduate coursework in     mathematics is desirable. Courses in analysis, linear     algebra, complex variables, partial and ordinary differential     equations, and probability theory are especially helpful.      Students who do not have some necessary mathematical     preparation may be able to compensate by taking courses at     Courant on a non-degree basis.

Graduate          Enrollment Services will correspond with          you about your eligibility for non-degree          study. If appropriate, they will send you          a paper application.           Please refer to the \"Non-degree          application instructions\" in the          Application Resource Center at          gsas.nyu.edu for more information                             A statement of purpose          Official transcripts from all colleges or         universities you attended          A resume                                      Application deadlines                            All application materials and credentials         must have arrived at the Graduate School by         the deadline. Take the GRE test early. It         generally takes 4 weeks for your official test         results to be made available. You should list         code 2596 for the NYU Graduate School in your         request to Educational Testing Service for         forwarding official scores for TOEFL and GRE.         To expedite the processing of your         application, you may also include copies of         your results. In some cases we may be able to         start evaluating an application with only         unofficial transcripts or GRE scores. Official         transcripts and GRE scores are required         eventually.          Full-Time Masters in Mathematics in         Finance: February 8. Applicants are         encouraged to submit their applications before         the deadline. Full time students are accepted         only for a Fall start date.          Part-Time Masters in Mathematics in         Finance: August 1 for Fall,         December 1 for Spring.          Non Degree and Certificate program:          August 1 for Fall, December 1 for Spring.            Notification               of Acceptance Status          Official notification is made only by         Graduate Enrollment Services by email         notification of admission or of         rejection. We request that applicants not          email the Program Administrator to ask if they         have been admitted unless they are faced with         a deadline from another university to which         they must respond. Due to the large number of         applications processed during March, it can         take several weeks from the time of our         decision until applicants receive their         official notification letters. For this         reason, we usually send an unofficial         congratulatory email to successful applicants         when decisions have been reached.          Part-time acceptances for Fall are usually         not made until after the full-time class has         been assembled, which is mid to late April.         Part-time acceptances for spring are made on a         rolling basis.                    Application guidelines                            Careful attention to these guidelines will         make your application stronger.          The application itself          Fill in the application completely. Answer all         the questions.          Statement of purpose          Explain your view of the finance industry, why         you are attracted to it, and what aspects of         it you are most interested in. Explain why you         have chosen quantitative finance in general         and our program in particular. Describe your         career plans and goals as clearly as you have         them. This can range from: ``a career         somewhere in the finance industry'' to:         ``running a desk trading exotic emerging         market credit derivatives at BNP in London         leveraging my language skills and knowledge of         Latin American markets''. Describe your         background and how it relates to your career         plans. What motivated you to choose         quantitative finance and why do you feel it is         a good choice for you? Describe what you have         done to learn about the finance industry and         prepare yourself for our program. If         quantitative finance represents a change in         your career path, explain your decision to         switch. Feel free to give other information         that will help us understand your application         better. Be concise.          Recommendation letters          The most important consideration in admissions         decisions is your talent for and preparation         in mathematics. This could come from         mathematics classes or highly mathematical         classes in the sciences or engineering. The         most helpful letters are from people who have         seen your performance in the most challenging         situations and can compare it to others. This         generally means instructors in advanced         classes that are heavily quantitative or         mathematical. If you have significant work         experience, we appreciate a letter from a         manager who can describe your technical         accomplishments. You may submit more than         three letters, but please do not do so unless         the extra letter adds significant new         information. Please avoid the following mistakes:                   The recommendation letter is not a         character reference. Avoid writers who do         not have first hand knowledge of your         technical abilities. This includes deans or         officials who have not had you in class,         instructors in low level or nontechnical         classes such as calculus, literature,         accounting, etc., friends, relatives, and         colleagues.          If someone asks you to write the letter         yourself, refuse . The         recommender may ask you for a resume or a         transcript or even some things about         yourself you would like to be in the letter.         Feel free to provide such information, but         under no circumstances should you suggest         the actual wording of the letter. We         disregard any letter that we feel was         written by the applicant. A professional         understands better than a student what         information a recommendation letter should         convey.                   The GRE and TOEFL          The general GRE test is required, but we         encourage applicants to also submit scores         from Subject GRE Tests in mathematics, physics         or another highly quantitative         discipline. We may waive the GRE         requirement for an applicant with a technical         PhD. Please contact us (email: mathfinapp@cims.nyu.edu )         to request PhD waiver instructions.          The GRE and TOEFL institution         code number for NYU GSAS is 2596. The         GRE does not require a department code.          The TOEFL requires a department code;          please list code 99 if you did not list a code         already (the only code that          cannot be used is 00).                                      Department and Field of Study         Codes                            The paper application for non-degree study        requires department and field of study        codes.

You can         find suggested formats online. For         professional or technical jobs, give the dates         worked, the division of the firm and the city         where you worked. Describe your activities in         a few words or bullet points. Please list all         major activities even if they are not academic         or technical, such as military service,         performing arts, religious study, etc., with         places and dates if possible.

For further information, please go to the GSAS admissions         web site to apply on-line.          International students applying on a non-degree basis    cannot apply on line, but must submit a paper application.    Instructions on non-degree applications are available online    from the GSAS       web site . The GSAS web site also has instructions and    links to the most frequently asked questions and verification    about receipt of applications.          The rules and regulations governing admissions to NYUs Graduate    School of Arts and Science must be met by all applicants seeking    admission to graduate study in mathematics.           All applicants must have an accredited baccalaureate degree     or its equivalent. Applicants in their last semester of     undergraduate study must graduate before they begin their     graduate work at NYU.      An official transcript from all previously attended     institutions (undergraduate, graduate, and continuing     educational programs) must be uploaded using the online     application system.      A student must provide three letters of recommendation     (except non-degree). It is strongly recommended that at     least two of these letters be from faculty with whom the     applicant took a mathematics or other science course.     Letters must be submitted using the online application system.      General GRE (Graduate Record Examination) scores are     required of all applicants (except non-degree); applicants for     the Ph.D. program must also provide the subject GRE score,     preferably in mathematics, but accepted in other relevant     sciences.      Applicants whose native language is not English must submit     a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score; scores     of less than 600 (250 for the computer-based test; 100     for the internet-based test) are generally not recommended for     admission. This requirement may be waived for an     applicant with an accredited degree from an institution where     English was the language of instruction. IELTS scores are not     accepted by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in place     of the TOEFL.           List code 2596 for the NYU Graduate School of Arts and     Science in your request to the Educational Testing Service for     forwarding official GRE and TOEFL scores. The departmental     code for the GRE is 0703; for the TOEFL it is 72.      Application         Deadlines           The following application deadlines apply for both American     and foreign students:           Admission to the Ph.D. program - January 4.      Admission to M.S. programs except Mathematics in     Finance - April 1 (Fall), November 1 (Spring), April 15     (Summer).      Admission to M.S. program in Mathematics in Finance -     February 8 (Fall, full-time only), August 1 (Fall, part-time     only), December 1 (Spring, part-time only).           Admission on a non-degree basis in Mathematics (to take     up to four courses) - August 1 (Fall), December 1 (Spring).      Admission on a non-degree basis in Financial Mathematics     (to take up to four courses) or to a Certificate in     Financial Mathematics (to take up to eight courses) - August     1 (Fall), December 1 (Spring).          Ph.D. applicants who missed the January deadline may apply to    the M.S. program (without support).     Degree     Programs      The following degree programs are offered by the Department     of Mathematics:           Ph.D. in Mathematics;      Ph.D. in Ocean-Atmosphere Science and Mathematics;      M.S. in Mathematics;      M.S. in Scientific Computing;      M.S. in Mathematics in Finance.      Certificate in Mathematics in Finance.          The Graduate School of Arts and Science now offers a doctoral    program in Computational Biology. Students may apply to    this program through the Departments of Mathematics, Computer    Science, Biology, Chemistry, or the Center for Neural Sciences.          The department also admits students on a non-degree basis,    permitting them to take up to four courses. These    applicants do not need to submit test scores or recommendation    letters (but will later be required to do so if they apply to    any degree program). They are expected to meet the same academic    standards as matriculated students.     Admission         on a Non-Degree Basis      Many students are interested in just a few courses, have     considered the M.S. programs too late to apply, or were not     accepted. It is possible to apply as a non-degree, or     non-matriculated student. Generally the non-degree option is     used only by students who plan to study part-time and cannot     be used by international students to obtain a student visa.     International non-degree applicants cannot apply on line and    must request an application from the Graduate School of Arts and    Science (please visit the GSAS web site ).       Recommendation letters and GRE scores are not required for    admission on a non-degree basis. The academic background    required for non-degree admission is the same as the requirement    for the masters degrees, as these students will be taking the    same courses as masters degree students. Non-degree students    are allowed to take up to four courses.          After completing four courses, students can apply for admission    to the M.S. program in Mathematics, Math Finance or Scientific    Computing. Students will need to formally apply through GSAS online .     Students should note that due to limited resources, admission to    an M.S. program is not automatic or guaranteed after    completing four courses with good grades.           Admission         Criteria      Admission decisions are based on a careful review of the     applicant's previous academic record, letters of     recommendation, TOEFL (if applicable) and GRE scores, as well     as other credentials, such as work experience or previous     research projects. In the evaluation of applications,     applicants should note the following:           Students with B.A./B.S. degrees may apply directly     to the Ph.D. program.      The Department accepts Ph.D. applications only for     full-time study.      Students applying for the Ph.D. program who do not     qualify for it will automatically be considered for the M.S.     program.      Applicants who were accepted into the M.S. program will     be favorably considered for the Ph.D. program when they earn     the grade of A on the Written Comprehensive Examination.           Undergraduate Background      All applicants must have earned (or be about to complete) a     B.A. or B.S. or the equivalent. They must have taken     three semesters of college-level calculus, including one     semester of advanced calculus or linear algebra or the     equivalent. Students who do not have the advanced     calculus course may be required to take the course G63.1002     Multivariable Calculus.      As previously emphasized, these are the very minimum     requirements; additional undergraduate coursework in     mathematics is desirable. Courses in analysis, linear     algebra, complex variables, partial and ordinary differential     equations, and probability theory are especially helpful.      Students who do not have some necessary mathematical     preparation may be able to compensate by taking courses at     Courant on a non-degree basis.

Admission         on a Non-Degree Basis      Many students are interested in just a few courses, have     considered the M.S. programs too late to apply, or were not     accepted. It is possible to apply as a non-degree, or     non-matriculated student. Generally the non-degree option is     used only by students who plan to study part-time and cannot     be used by international students to obtain a student visa.     International non-degree applicants cannot apply on line and    must request an application from the Graduate School of Arts and    Science (please visit the GSAS web site ).       Recommendation letters and GRE scores are not required for    admission on a non-degree basis. The academic background    required for non-degree admission is the same as the requirement    for the masters degrees, as these students will be taking the    same courses as masters degree students. Non-degree students    are allowed to take up to four courses.          After completing four courses, students can apply for admission    to the M.S. program in Mathematics, Math Finance or Scientific    Computing. Students will need to formally apply through GSAS online .     Students should note that due to limited resources, admission to    an M.S. program is not automatic or guaranteed after    completing four courses with good grades.           Admission         Criteria      Admission decisions are based on a careful review of the     applicant's previous academic record, letters of     recommendation, TOEFL (if applicable) and GRE scores, as well     as other credentials, such as work experience or previous     research projects. In the evaluation of applications,     applicants should note the following:           Students with B.A./B.S. degrees may apply directly     to the Ph.D. program.      The Department accepts Ph.D. applications only for     full-time study.      Students applying for the Ph.D. program who do not     qualify for it will automatically be considered for the M.S.     program.      Applicants who were accepted into the M.S. program will     be favorably considered for the Ph.D. program when they earn     the grade of A on the Written Comprehensive Examination.           Undergraduate Background      All applicants must have earned (or be about to complete) a     B.A. or B.S. or the equivalent. They must have taken     three semesters of college-level calculus, including one     semester of advanced calculus or linear algebra or the     equivalent. Students who do not have the advanced     calculus course may be required to take the course G63.1002     Multivariable Calculus.      As previously emphasized, these are the very minimum     requirements; additional undergraduate coursework in     mathematics is desirable. Courses in analysis, linear     algebra, complex variables, partial and ordinary differential     equations, and probability theory are especially helpful.      Students who do not have some necessary mathematical     preparation may be able to compensate by taking courses at     Courant on a non-degree basis.

For further information, please go to the GSAS admissions         web site to apply on-line.          International students applying on a non-degree basis    cannot apply on line, but must submit a paper application.    Instructions on non-degree applications are available online    from the GSAS       web site . The GSAS web site also has instructions and    links to the most frequently asked questions and verification    about receipt of applications.          The rules and regulations governing admissions to NYUs Graduate    School of Arts and Science must be met by all applicants seeking    admission to graduate study in mathematics.           All applicants must have an accredited baccalaureate degree     or its equivalent. Applicants in their last semester of     undergraduate study must graduate before they begin their     graduate work at NYU.      An official transcript from all previously attended     institutions (undergraduate, graduate, and continuing     educational programs) must be uploaded using the online     application system.      A student must provide three letters of recommendation     (except non-degree). It is strongly recommended that at     least two of these letters be from faculty with whom the     applicant took a mathematics or other science course.     Letters must be submitted using the online application system.      General GRE (Graduate Record Examination) scores are     required of all applicants (except non-degree); applicants for     the Ph.D. program must also provide the subject GRE score,     preferably in mathematics, but accepted in other relevant     sciences.      Applicants whose native language is not English must submit     a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score; scores     of less than 600 (250 for the computer-based test; 100     for the internet-based test) are generally not recommended for     admission. This requirement may be waived for an     applicant with an accredited degree from an institution where     English was the language of instruction. IELTS scores are not     accepted by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in place     of the TOEFL.           List code 2596 for the NYU Graduate School of Arts and     Science in your request to the Educational Testing Service for     forwarding official GRE and TOEFL scores.

Admission is very competitive for all         Mathematics in Finance programs. The classes         require a high level of mathematical talent         and specific preparation. It is vital that         your application give an accurate and complete         picture of your background, talents, and         interests. Please follow the detailed         guidelines below as well as those of the Graduate               School to maximize your chance of         admission and prevent misunderstandings.          The application for the full-time MS         program , the part-time MS         program , or the part-time         Certificate program consists of the         following parts:                   The application itself (online application         required)                   A statement of purpose          3 recommendation letters (submitted         online)                   One official academic transcript from each              institution attended (uploaded as part         of the online application)                   GRE score (note: we do not          accept GMAT)          TOEFL score for international students         (this is not required if you have an         undergraduate or more advanced degree from         an English-speaking university; IELTS scores         are not accepted)          A CV/ resume                   Applicants for non-degree study          are required to submit only:                   The application itself                             If you are a U.S. citizen or permanent          resident or international student with an          H1B Visa, you should apply for non-degree          study by using the online application. If          you are not a U.S. citizen or permanent          resident or do not hold an H1B Visa,          please write gsas.admissions@nyu.edu .          In that message, (1) confirm you have read          the instruction materials, (2) indicate          the program of study in which you are          interested and the term for which you will          apply, and (3) indicate the visa type you          already have or will request. Graduate          Enrollment Services will correspond with          you about your eligibility for non-degree          study. If appropriate, they will send you          a paper application.           Please refer to the \"Non-degree          application instructions\" in the          Application Resource Center at          gsas.nyu.edu for more information                             A statement of purpose          Official transcripts from all colleges or         universities you attended          A resume                                      Application deadlines                            All application materials and credentials         must have arrived at the Graduate School by         the deadline. Take the GRE test early. It         generally takes 4 weeks for your official test         results to be made available. You should list         code 2596 for the NYU Graduate School in your         request to Educational Testing Service for         forwarding official scores for TOEFL and GRE.         To expedite the processing of your         application, you may also include copies of         your results. In some cases we may be able to         start evaluating an application with only         unofficial transcripts or GRE scores. Official         transcripts and GRE scores are required         eventually.          Full-Time Masters in Mathematics in         Finance: February 8. Applicants are         encouraged to submit their applications before         the deadline. Full time students are accepted         only for a Fall start date.          Part-Time Masters in Mathematics in         Finance: August 1 for Fall,         December 1 for Spring.          Non Degree and Certificate program:          August 1 for Fall, December 1 for Spring.            Notification               of Acceptance Status          Official notification is made only by         Graduate Enrollment Services by email         notification of admission or of         rejection. We request that applicants not          email the Program Administrator to ask if they         have been admitted unless they are faced with         a deadline from another university to which         they must respond. Due to the large number of         applications processed during March, it can         take several weeks from the time of our         decision until applicants receive their         official notification letters. For this         reason, we usually send an unofficial         congratulatory email to successful applicants         when decisions have been reached.          Part-time acceptances for Fall are usually         not made until after the full-time class has         been assembled, which is mid to late April.         Part-time acceptances for spring are made on a         rolling basis.                    Application guidelines                            Careful attention to these guidelines will         make your application stronger.          The application itself          Fill in the application completely. Answer all         the questions.          Statement of purpose          Explain your view of the finance industry, why         you are attracted to it, and what aspects of         it you are most interested in. Explain why you         have chosen quantitative finance in general         and our program in particular. Describe your         career plans and goals as clearly as you have         them. This can range from: ``a career         somewhere in the finance industry'' to:         ``running a desk trading exotic emerging         market credit derivatives at BNP in London         leveraging my language skills and knowledge of         Latin American markets''. Describe your         background and how it relates to your career         plans. What motivated you to choose         quantitative finance and why do you feel it is         a good choice for you? Describe what you have         done to learn about the finance industry and         prepare yourself for our program. If         quantitative finance represents a change in         your career path, explain your decision to         switch. Feel free to give other information         that will help us understand your application         better. Be concise.          Recommendation letters          The most important consideration in admissions         decisions is your talent for and preparation         in mathematics. This could come from         mathematics classes or highly mathematical         classes in the sciences or engineering. The         most helpful letters are from people who have         seen your performance in the most challenging         situations and can compare it to others. This         generally means instructors in advanced         classes that are heavily quantitative or         mathematical. If you have significant work         experience, we appreciate a letter from a         manager who can describe your technical         accomplishments. You may submit more than         three letters, but please do not do so unless         the extra letter adds significant new         information. Please avoid the following mistakes:                   The recommendation letter is not a         character reference. Avoid writers who do         not have first hand knowledge of your         technical abilities. This includes deans or         officials who have not had you in class,         instructors in low level or nontechnical         classes such as calculus, literature,         accounting, etc., friends, relatives, and         colleagues.          If someone asks you to write the letter         yourself, refuse . The         recommender may ask you for a resume or a         transcript or even some things about         yourself you would like to be in the letter.         Feel free to provide such information, but         under no circumstances should you suggest         the actual wording of the letter. We         disregard any letter that we feel was         written by the applicant. A professional         understands better than a student what         information a recommendation letter should         convey.                   The GRE and TOEFL          The general GRE test is required, but we         encourage applicants to also submit scores         from Subject GRE Tests in mathematics, physics         or another highly quantitative         discipline. We may waive the GRE         requirement for an applicant with a technical         PhD. Please contact us (email: mathfinapp@cims.nyu.edu )         to request PhD waiver instructions.          The GRE and TOEFL institution         code number for NYU GSAS is 2596. The         GRE does not require a department code.          The TOEFL requires a department code;          please list code 99 if you did not list a code         already (the only code that          cannot be used is 00).                                      Department and Field of Study         Codes                            The paper application for non-degree study        requires department and field of study        codes. Please enter the following        corresponding code: Non-Degree Study: MATF MAF.                            The resume          Submit a professional quality resume. You can         find suggested formats online. For         professional or technical jobs, give the dates         worked, the division of the firm and the city         where you worked. Describe your activities in         a few words or bullet points. Please list all         major activities even if they are not academic         or technical, such as military service,         performing arts, religious study, etc., with         places and dates if possible. List your         educational history with places, dates, and a         few details such as areas of concentration,         thesis title, awards, GPA, etc.                                                                                                                   New York University | Courant Institute | Contact | Site Map"}]}]
