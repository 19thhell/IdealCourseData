RiskEcon\u00ae Lab applies a range of computational methods to analyze commercial, consumer and population-related societal trends. Recent events demonstrate that many large-scale geopolitical and socioeconomic questions are particularly related to the implications and effects of interrelated changes in demographics, technology adoption, and lifestyle choices on the economy. Understanding these patterns is crucial for decision-making in both industry and government. The most critical are the emerging effects of changes in technology and consumer behavior on finance, labor, and housing, and on trends in income and wealth distribution, immigration, aging, health and the environment.    RiskEcon\u00ae Lab primarily focuses upon research and development of applied statistics in the context of robust and scalable data analytic solutions, integrating web-enabled crowdsourcing with machine learning, data-mining, and text-mining, in order to provide solutions and answer large-scale, real world questions with three fundamental objectives:         \u2022 Foster, promote, and coordinate public-private-academic research partnerships        \u2022 Sponsor, fund, organize and manage \u201cbig data\u201d libraries        \u2022 Advance NYU\u2019s competency within applied computational statistics                RiskEcon\u00ae Lab\u2019s primary role is to enable, facilitate and coordinate academic research in the development of commercially-viable, analytic applications employing computational statistical tools in conjunction with innovative and non-traditional data structures. In addition, other activities of RiskEcon\u00ae Lab involve the advancement of the fields of applied mathematical statistics and computational economics, via interdisciplinary post-doctoral, postgraduate, graduate research and education in data sciences and social computing.    RiskEcon\u00ae Lab is the cornerstone of the Computational Economics and Algorithmic Data Analytics (CEcADA) cooperative at New York University, established concurrently in 2011.      Press releases on the establishment of RiskEcon\u00ae Lab:     NYU Press Release: August 18th, 2011   Courant Newsletter Article, Fall 2011 Issue           Selected Research Themes and Workstreams:                 Adaptive learning processes, activity-recognition and social computing applications of statistical inference and stochastic control mechanisms to agent-based cyber-physical networks.     Applications of generative agent-based modeling,  spatio-temporal mapping and social computing to forensic, geopolitical,  socioeconomic, psychometric, sociometric, demographic, syndromic, and  environmental surveillance, inference and analytics.     Market-consistent enterprise risk and liability  management applications of scalable, robust cyber-physical adaptive  learning and pervasive, embedded computing systems.         Institutional and industry configuration, market  microstructure, and commercial process engineering applications of  computational linguistics, law and economics.         General methodological interests and experience  include: applications of high-dimensional computational and graphical statistics to Bayesian  experimental design, simulation and statistical inference; applied principal  components and dimension reduction methods; applied information  geometry, graphical statistical modeling and network analysis; applied functional data  analysis, nonparametric hierarchical mixture and kernel models; latent  variable analysis; applied generalized linear and logistic regression  models and discrete choice methods, algorithmic natural and social  computing frameworks; robust market-based predictive estimation, pricing  and valuation applications of auctions and parimutuel exchange mechanisms.         The socioeconomic and socio-demographic determinants of communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and their impact on health capital in the labor market via the dependency ratio; structural changes in labor force growth relating to emerging health trends; time-series properties of socioeconomic and socio-demographic risk factors relating to obesity; the relationship of cross-country differentials in the dependency ratio and relative growth.       Income elasticity of consumption spending on healthcare goods and service; co-evolution of healthcare spending and selected socioeconomic and socio-demographic indicators; regional and socio-demographic variation of income elasticity in healthcare spending.       Effects of population aging on aggregate consumer demand; structural changes in the composition of consumption spending patterns across generations.       Methodological interests: time series and longitudinal applications to event history and duration analysis; surveillance and monitoring of NCDs; discrete choice, latent variable and social network analysis of behavioral (sociometric and psychometric) influences on discretionary consumption decisions related to health."}]}]
