It provides essential tools to allow Ph.D.'s to function effectively in translational research endeavors. Furthermore, the knowledge of basic medical concepts and the holistic approach imparted by the program prepares students to be more effective careers as \"traditional\" basic scientists. The program provides students with experience in team-oriented research using a basic/clinical co-mentoring paradigm.   It is also designed to promote interactions between basic scientists and clinical practitioners within and between departments, with a major emphasis on collaborative science.   The curriculum is carefully designed to seamlessly integrate key basic medical concepts (including basic anatomy, histology, pathology, and pathophysiology) into a modern, molecularly oriented curriculum using courses specifically designed for Pathobiology graduate students. It includes exposure to many clinical areas, including surgical and autopsy pathology, and laboratory medicine.   Co-mentored thesis projects provide an opportunity for students to interact with clinical practitioners and provide a meaningful working experience of biological research in a team context. Translational opportunities for observation of clinical practice form an integral component of the program. Hence, the program's setting at the interface between clinical medicine and basic science is a critical feature to allow integration of the two disciplines.

Work in progress with a translational interest in the laboratories of investigators in the Department of Medicine, other Clinical Departments, and interested Basic Scientists will be presented.
