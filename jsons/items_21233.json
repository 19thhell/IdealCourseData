[{"detail": [{"content": "Country Default Spreads and Risk Premiums     Last updated: January 2015     This table summarizes the latest bond ratings and appropriate default spreads    for different countries. While you can use these numbers as rough estimates    of country risk premiums, you may want to modify the premia to reflect    the additonal risk of equity markets. To estimate the long term country equity    risk premium, I start with a default spread, which I obtain in one of two ways:     (1) I use     the local currency sovereign rating (from Moody's: www.moodys.com)    and estimate the default spread for that rating (based upon traded    country bonds) over a default free government bond rate. For countries without a Moody's rating but with an S&amp;P rating, I use the Moody's equivalent of the S&amp;P rating. To get the default spreads by sovereign rating, I use the CDS spreads and compute the average CDS spread by rating. Using that number as a basis, I extrapolate for those ratings for which I have no CDS spreads.     (2) I start with the CDS spread for the country, if one is available and subtract out the US CDS spread, since my mature market premium is derived from the US market. That difference becomes the country spread. For the few countries that have CDS spreads that are lower than the US, I will get a negative number.     You can add just this default spread to the mature market premium to arrive at the total equity risk premium.     I add an additional step. In the short term especially, the equity country risk premium    is likely to be greater than the country's default spread. You can    estimate an adjusted country risk premium by multiplying the default    spread by the relative equity market volatility for that market (Std    dev in country equity market/Std dev in country bond). I have used    the emerging market average of 1.5 (equity markets are about 1.5 times    more volatile than bond markets) to estimate country risk premium.I    have added this to my estimated risk premium of 5.0% for mature markets (obtained    by looking at the implied premium for the S&amp;P 500) to get the total risk    premium.

Yes                             If yes,     enter the multiplier to use on the default spread (See worksheet for     volatility numbers for selected emerging markets)      1.5                                                              Country      Africa      Moody's rating      Rating-based Default Spread      Total Equity Risk Premium      Country Risk Premium      CDS Default Spread (net of US)      Total Equity Risk Premium      Country Risk Premium              Abu Dhabi      Middle East      Aa2      0.50%      6.50%      0.75%      1.12%      7.43%      1.68%              Albania      Eastern Europe &amp;

{"detail": [{"content": "Country Default Spreads and Risk Premiums     Last updated: January 2015     This table summarizes the latest bond ratings and appropriate default spreads    for different countries. While you can use these numbers as rough estimates    of country risk premiums, you may want to modify the premia to reflect    the additonal risk of equity markets. To estimate the long term country equity    risk premium, I start with a default spread, which I obtain in one of two ways:     (1) I use     the local currency sovereign rating (from Moody's: www.moodys.com)    and estimate the default spread for that rating (based upon traded    country bonds) over a default free government bond rate. For countries without a Moody's rating but with an S&amp;P rating, I use the Moody's equivalent of the S&amp;P rating. To get the default spreads by sovereign rating, I use the CDS spreads and compute the average CDS spread by rating. Using that number as a basis, I extrapolate for those ratings for which I have no CDS spreads.     (2) I start with the CDS spread for the country, if one is available and subtract out the US CDS spread, since my mature market premium is derived from the US market. That difference becomes the country spread. For the few countries that have CDS spreads that are lower than the US, I will get a negative number.     You can add just this default spread to the mature market premium to arrive at the total equity risk premium.     I add an additional step. In the short term especially, the equity country risk premium    is likely to be greater than the country's default spread. You can    estimate an adjusted country risk premium by multiplying the default    spread by the relative equity market volatility for that market (Std    dev in country equity market/Std dev in country bond). I have used    the emerging market average of 1.5 (equity markets are about 1.5 times    more volatile than bond markets) to estimate country risk premium.I    have added this to my estimated risk premium of 5.0% for mature markets (obtained    by looking at the implied premium for the S&amp;P 500) to get the total risk    premium.

Yes                             If yes,     enter the multiplier to use on the default spread (See worksheet for     volatility numbers for selected emerging markets)      1.5                                                              Country      Africa      Moody's rating      Rating-based Default Spread      Total Equity Risk Premium      Country Risk Premium      CDS Default Spread (net of US)      Total Equity Risk Premium      Country Risk Premium              Abu Dhabi      Middle East      Aa2      0.50%      6.50%      0.75%      1.12%      7.43%      1.68%              Albania      Eastern Europe &amp;

The intellectual enterprise at NYU is characterized by a diversity of viewpoints, including voices of affirmation, of dissent, and of protest; at NYU a voice that is silent elsewhere is heard, and the value of the message is tested on its merit.   Although NYU's undergraduates and graduate students are diverse in background, they also have a lot in common. Each freshman class is full of enthusiastic learners whose goal is to become independent and creatives thinkers with the resourcefulness and social awareness necessary to excel in our constantly changing, increasingly global world.                continued below                                        This content requires the Macromedia Flash Player.

{"detail": [{"content": "Country Default Spreads and Risk Premiums     Last updated: January 2015     This table summarizes the latest bond ratings and appropriate default spreads    for different countries. While you can use these numbers as rough estimates    of country risk premiums, you may want to modify the premia to reflect    the additonal risk of equity markets. To estimate the long term country equity    risk premium, I start with a default spread, which I obtain in one of two ways:     (1) I use     the local currency sovereign rating (from Moody's: www.moodys.com)    and estimate the default spread for that rating (based upon traded    country bonds) over a default free government bond rate. For countries without a Moody's rating but with an S&amp;P rating, I use the Moody's equivalent of the S&amp;P rating. To get the default spreads by sovereign rating, I use the CDS spreads and compute the average CDS spread by rating. Using that number as a basis, I extrapolate for those ratings for which I have no CDS spreads.     (2) I start with the CDS spread for the country, if one is available and subtract out the US CDS spread, since my mature market premium is derived from the US market. That difference becomes the country spread. For the few countries that have CDS spreads that are lower than the US, I will get a negative number.     You can add just this default spread to the mature market premium to arrive at the total equity risk premium.     I add an additional step. In the short term especially, the equity country risk premium    is likely to be greater than the country's default spread. You can    estimate an adjusted country risk premium by multiplying the default    spread by the relative equity market volatility for that market (Std    dev in country equity market/Std dev in country bond). I have used    the emerging market average of 1.5 (equity markets are about 1.5 times    more volatile than bond markets) to estimate country risk premium.I    have added this to my estimated risk premium of 5.0% for mature markets (obtained    by looking at the implied premium for the S&amp;P 500) to get the total risk    premium.

The intellectual enterprise at NYU is characterized by a diversity of viewpoints, including voices of affirmation, of dissent, and of protest; at NYU a voice that is silent elsewhere is heard, and the value of the message is tested on its merit.   Although NYU's undergraduates and graduate students are diverse in background, they also have a lot in common.
