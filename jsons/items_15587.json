Details on dates each part is due will be provided later.              SYLLABUS     (1)    Week 1 &amp; 2: Graph Theory and Social Networks     This section will provide the basic language and tools used in describing and analyzing networks &#8211; graph theory.   Examples will be provided to illustrate the basic power of network theory ideas. As an illustration the small worlds ideas (Six Degrees of Separation) will be presented. Other initial examples from todays social media online networks and the internet will be provided. The Twitter network will be used as an illustration.  Simple computer based methods of analysis will also be provided.         An introduction to Social graphs: Internet, Web, Social Networks, Facebook and Search       Graph structure and formation       How to analyze basic properties of graphs: degree sequence, connectedness, directed vs undirected graphs, cycles, trees, connected components, cut, strongly and weakly connected components       Strong ties and Weak ties       Facebook network and Facebook API       The Twitter Network - The Twitter API &#8211; getting data from Twitter; Information flow in Twitter (Retweet networks); Rumor spreading on Twitter         Readings NCM Chapters 1- 5.       (2) Game Theory          Most social networks have people acting strategically and taking actions as a function of what they perceive others to be doing and so as to get the best out of the network. This is the realm of Game Theory.  This section will go through basic game theory &#8211; the terminology and key concepts. Auctions and the theory behind them will be studied in this context.  Behavior in networks often result in very unintuitive outcomes, as will be illustrated in the context of traffic networks.     Readings:  NCM Chapters 6, 8, and 9.          Basics of Game Theory          Traffic         Auctions &#8211; first price, second price, Nash equilibria; Common Values and the Winner's Curse.          Mobile Apps and computer networks for trading; Weather Index Insurance on the Mobile phone            (3) Markets and Strategic Interaction on Networks     Many networks often involve the matching of different types of players into pairs &#8211; buyers and sellers in a market for example.   This section will describe the network theory in analyzing such networks, particularly real life trading networks. The concepts of bargaining and power in such networks will be presented.   Examples in real life trading networks will be presented.  The role of intermediaries will also be presented within the context of the network theory.     Illustrations of these models will be taken from on-going field research by the Center for Technology and Economic Development researchers, primarily in the area of food and agricultural networks and commodities exchanges.        Farmer-Trader Networks        Commodities Exchanges        Food Transport Networks    Readings NCM Chapters 10-12.        (4) Information Networks and the World-Wide Web     This section will apply material from early sections in a discussion on the web and other social networks. We will explain why these are best studied within the context of networks.  We will indicate how modern internet search engines use algorithms involving classic models of network analysis, bringing in earlier studied concepts of power, centrality, etc , in web page ranking methods.  We will study how search engine and other internet based sites derive revenues from advertising sales which in turn require the analysis of matching markets within a network discussed in earlier sections.     Readings: Chapters 13-15.         (5) Network Dynamics: Population Models     In this section we use the tools of network theory to study network dynamics &#8211; how things like ideas, rumors and disease propagate within a network.  We will also discuss some classic models of the evolution of the ethnic composition of a housing neighborhood.  We will also introduce the concepts of information cascading and also celebrated ideas on tipping points in a network, and what makes for successful commercial products or ideas.      Applications to mobile phone based weather insurance and other trading markets will be used as illustrations.      Readings: Chapter 7, Chapters 16-18, and Chapter 22.    Inference from Web Data and Twitter       Google Flu Trends       Extracting and Analyzing News Data: Detailed description       News analysis for Drought and Food Security Problems       News analysis for Disease Surveillance       Twitter based Opinion mining       Twitter based Disease Surveillance       Social Interaction Patterns and Spread Models    Markets        Markets with Exogenous Events         Horse Races, Betting, and Beliefs         Aggregate Beliefs and the ``Wisdom of Crowds''         Prediction Markets and Stock Markets          The Market for Lemons         Signaling Quality         Quality Uncertainty On-Line: Reputation Systems and Other Mechanisms                   (6) Network Dynamics: Structural Models        This section continues the discussion in the previous section and further analyses flows through a network. Interesting phenomena like the earlier mentioned Six Degrees of Separation effect are studied within the context of an analysis of the network structure.      Readings:   Chapters 19-21.     (7) Institutions and Aggregate Behavior     This section will continue the discussion of social institutions.   We will look at voting procedures&#8211; and its many interesting paradoxes, as well as issues around property rights especially in the context of negative externalities. In this context recent developments in crowdsourcing, especially on the mobile phone in  developing   nations will be discussed.   Readings    Illustrations will be taken from the following Mobile Apps for Crowdsourcing and Voting       Mechanical Turk, Crowdflower , etc.         mobile crowdsourcing enabled new markets and services in different settings, including market information systems, cascades, network effects.         Mobile crowdsourcing and Politics &#8211; Elections;  Ushahidi         Readings: Chapters 23-24.

SYLLABUS     (1)    Week 1 &amp; 2: Graph Theory and Social Networks     This section will provide the basic language and tools used in describing and analyzing networks &#8211; graph theory.   Examples will be provided to illustrate the basic power of network theory ideas. As an illustration the small worlds ideas (Six Degrees of Separation) will be presented. Other initial examples from todays social media online networks and the internet will be provided. The Twitter network will be used as an illustration.  Simple computer based methods of analysis will also be provided.         An introduction to Social graphs: Internet, Web, Social Networks, Facebook and Search       Graph structure and formation       How to analyze basic properties of graphs: degree sequence, connectedness, directed vs undirected graphs, cycles, trees, connected components, cut, strongly and weakly connected components       Strong ties and Weak ties       Facebook network and Facebook API       The Twitter Network - The Twitter API &#8211; getting data from Twitter; Information flow in Twitter (Retweet networks); Rumor spreading on Twitter         Readings NCM Chapters 1- 5.       (2) Game Theory          Most social networks have people acting strategically and taking actions as a function of what they perceive others to be doing and so as to get the best out of the network. This is the realm of Game Theory.  This section will go through basic game theory &#8211; the terminology and key concepts. Auctions and the theory behind them will be studied in this context.  Behavior in networks often result in very unintuitive outcomes, as will be illustrated in the context of traffic networks.     Readings:  NCM Chapters 6, 8, and 9.          Basics of Game Theory          Traffic         Auctions &#8211; first price, second price, Nash equilibria; Common Values and the Winner's Curse.          Mobile Apps and computer networks for trading; Weather Index Insurance on the Mobile phone            (3) Markets and Strategic Interaction on Networks     Many networks often involve the matching of different types of players into pairs &#8211; buyers and sellers in a market for example.   This section will describe the network theory in analyzing such networks, particularly real life trading networks. The concepts of bargaining and power in such networks will be presented.   Examples in real life trading networks will be presented.  The role of intermediaries will also be presented within the context of the network theory.     Illustrations of these models will be taken from on-going field research by the Center for Technology and Economic Development researchers, primarily in the area of food and agricultural networks and commodities exchanges.        Farmer-Trader Networks        Commodities Exchanges        Food Transport Networks    Readings NCM Chapters 10-12.        (4) Information Networks and the World-Wide Web     This section will apply material from early sections in a discussion on the web and other social networks. We will explain why these are best studied within the context of networks.  We will indicate how modern internet search engines use algorithms involving classic models of network analysis, bringing in earlier studied concepts of power, centrality, etc , in web page ranking methods.  We will study how search engine and other internet based sites derive revenues from advertising sales which in turn require the analysis of matching markets within a network discussed in earlier sections.     Readings: Chapters 13-15.         (5) Network Dynamics: Population Models     In this section we use the tools of network theory to study network dynamics &#8211; how things like ideas, rumors and disease propagate within a network.  We will also discuss some classic models of the evolution of the ethnic composition of a housing neighborhood.  We will also introduce the concepts of information cascading and also celebrated ideas on tipping points in a network, and what makes for successful commercial products or ideas.      Applications to mobile phone based weather insurance and other trading markets will be used as illustrations.      Readings: Chapter 7, Chapters 16-18, and Chapter 22.    Inference from Web Data and Twitter       Google Flu Trends       Extracting and Analyzing News Data: Detailed description       News analysis for Drought and Food Security Problems       News analysis for Disease Surveillance       Twitter based Opinion mining       Twitter based Disease Surveillance       Social Interaction Patterns and Spread Models    Markets        Markets with Exogenous Events         Horse Races, Betting, and Beliefs         Aggregate Beliefs and the ``Wisdom of Crowds''         Prediction Markets and Stock Markets          The Market for Lemons         Signaling Quality         Quality Uncertainty On-Line: Reputation Systems and Other Mechanisms                   (6) Network Dynamics: Structural Models        This section continues the discussion in the previous section and further analyses flows through a network. Interesting phenomena like the earlier mentioned Six Degrees of Separation effect are studied within the context of an analysis of the network structure.      Readings:   Chapters 19-21.     (7) Institutions and Aggregate Behavior     This section will continue the discussion of social institutions.   We will look at voting procedures&#8211; and its many interesting paradoxes, as well as issues around property rights especially in the context of negative externalities. In this context recent developments in crowdsourcing, especially on the mobile phone in  developing   nations will be discussed.   Readings    Illustrations will be taken from the following Mobile Apps for Crowdsourcing and Voting       Mechanical Turk, Crowdflower , etc.         mobile crowdsourcing enabled new markets and services in different settings, including market information systems, cascades, network effects.         Mobile crowdsourcing and Politics &#8211; Elections;  Ushahidi         Readings: Chapters 23-24.
