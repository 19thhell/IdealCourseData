Students who matriculated in Spring 2013 or earlier should consult the Degree Requirements For Students Who Started in Spring 2013 and Earlier.               Proseminar (4 units)                                           Students are required to take a Proseminar during the first or, at the latest, the second semester of the program.                                   Each fall and spring semester, Gallatin offers several different Proseminars that focus on theory and methods in the arts, the humanities or the social sciences. The Proseminar introduces students to key concepts and thinkers and emphasizes the reading of classic and contemporary works of theory in the arts, humanities, or the social sciences. Students should choose the Proseminar that aligns most closely with their proposed concentration for the program, keeping in mind that they have the option to take an additional Proseminar to fulfill the additional Gallatin graduate course requirement.     This course performs a number of functions:   1. It introduces students to the nature of individualized and interdisciplinary studies by engaging them in work on a broad theme or problem. Students learn how different kinds of scholars approach a common problem: how they ask questions, gather relevant information, conduct analysis and reach conclusions.     2. The Proseminar helps students think through their own programs of study by broadening their conception of the knowledge and skills they will need to pursue their plans and by encouraging them to clarify their own educational goals.   3. Finally, the Proseminar engages students in some of the academic processes\u2014research, analytic thinking, scholarly communication\u2014that they will need throughout their graduate studies.   The specific course descriptions may vary from semester to semester, but each class will raise issues of approach and method that every student needs to consider. The aim of the Proseminar, then, is to enlarge the student\u2019s scholarship and interdisciplinary inquiry and to suggest ways that the University\u2019s resources can be used to attain the student\u2019s goals.   Offered in the fall and spring semesters.                           Additional Gallatin Graduate Course (4 units)                                           In addition to the Proseminar and Gallatin thesis courses (Thesis Proposal Seminar, Master\u2019s Thesis I, and Master\u2019s Thesis II), students must take another four units in graduate courses offered by Gallatin.                                   This requirement serves several functions: to engage students more fully with the Gallatin community; to give them an opportunity to strengthen and integrate the concentration; and to strengthen their academic and interdisciplinary skills. Students have considerable leeway in choosing how to satisfy this requirement, thus manifesting the individualized character of the program.     Students fulfill this requirement by completing one of the following preexisting Gallatin courses:  1. a graduate elective course;  2. a second Proseminar;  3. an independent study or tutorial (internships and private lessons will not fulfill this requirement);  4. a graduate-level class offered by a Gallatin instructor at, or in conjunction with, another NYU department or program.       Offered in the fall and spring semesters.                           Thesis Proposal Seminar (2 units)                                           This course is taken after the student has completed a Proseminar and generally during the second semester of full-time study, or after completing 12 credits.                                   As the first step in the sequence leading to the thesis, the Thesis Proposal Seminar meets regularly during the semester and moves students toward the completion of an acceptable thesis proposal.   Students learn about the structure and content of the thesis proposal as they:  \u2022 consider ways of integrating their work and articulating a core problem;  \u2022 discuss the conventions of scholarly discourse, documentation, and argumentation; and  \u2022 formulate a plan for the thesis.   Multiple sections of this course will be offered each semester for students in the social sciences and professions, the humanities, and the arts. The course will combine classroom instruction with special events (e.g., guest lectures, library visits, human subjects research instruction). The class will take advantage of student research affinity groups formed before and during the students\u2019 enrollment in this course.   To pass this course, students must submit an advanced draft of the thesis proposal. Gallatin strongly recommends that students submit the adviser-approved thesis proposal to Gallatin using the Thesis Proposal Submission form soon after completing Thesis Proposal Seminar. However, students have the option to take more time to finalize the proposal and to submit it at the beginning of the semester after completing the course. Note that Thesis Proposal Seminar is offered only in the spring term. Students who complete it in the spring term are required to submit the thesis proposal to Gallatin by September 16 .   Offered only in the spring semester.                           Master's Thesis I (2 units)                                           This course is generally taken in the third semester of full-time study, or after completing 24 credits. The faculty adviser supervises and grades Master\u2019s Thesis I. Prerequisite: Thesis Proposal Seminar.                                   In Master\u2019s Thesis I, students will complete the basic research for and begin drafting the thesis. The course, which is a two credit course supervised by the student\u2019s adviser, will entail independent work, supported by the writing resources of the MA Program. Students: (1) must attend a meeting (registered students will be emailed information about place and time at the beginning of the semester) with the MA Program faculty and staff to discuss the overall goals of the course; (2) immerse themselves in the relevant scholarly discourses and literatures and begin drafting the thesis and, in the case of artistic theses, developing the artwork and accompanying research essay ; (3) meet with their advisers, on a regular basis, to consult on the content, logic, organization and methods for the thesis; (4) draw on the resources of the MA Program (e.g. individual consultations, organized peer writing groups, themed writing workshops) led by Gallatin M.A. program staff; (5) and at the end of the semester, present their work in progress by participating in a forum organized by Gallatin and attended by faculty and peers. To pass this course, in addition to fulfilling the presentation requirement, students must demonstrate significant progress toward completing the thesis. For more details, please see the additional information about Master\u2019s Thesis I on the Gallatin website.   To register, submit the Master\u2019s Thesis I Registration form.   Offered in the fall, spring and summer semesters.                           Master's Thesis II (2 units)                                           This course is generally taken in the final semester of study. The faculty adviser supervises Master\u2019s Thesis II. The Gallatin MA program submits grades for students in Master\u2019s Thesis II. Prerequisite: Master's Thesis I.                                   To pass this class, which is a two-credit course supervised by the student\u2019s adviser, the student must submit and defend the thesis. In the first months of the semester, the student continues to work in collaboration with the adviser to complete the thesis paper or, in the case of an artistic thesis, the artwork as well as the related research essay and other required accompanying materials. All students are required to attend one meeting at the start of the semester (registered students will be emailed information about place and time at the beginning of the semester) with MA Program faculty and staff to discuss the overall goals of the course. Finally, students should draw on the resources of the MA Program (individual consultations with writing specialists, peer writing groups, themed writing workshops) during the writing process. As prescribed by the online Thesis and Defense calendar , students must receive approval for all work from their adviser far enough in advance of the defense so that the other panelists will have at least four weeks to read and inspect the submission. For more details, please see the additional information about Master's Thesis II on the Gallatin website as well as the thesis and defense calendar and submission forms.

Designing an independent study is an important part of the project, and together the student and instructor should discuss the aims and content of the study. The independent study proposal should include the study\u2019s title, theme, readings, work to be submitted, and syllabus. While plans for the independent study may be tentative at the time the proposal form is submitted, students should fill out the whole form and not leave parts blank or \u201cto be decided on later.\u201d The Gallatin Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies will not review incomplete forms from students. Projects often change but it is important to put the plan in writing at the beginning of the semester so that the student and professor have a clear understanding of the work involved.   As you begin to work on the Independent Study Proposal, please refer to the Student Checklist to ensure that you do not miss any important steps or deadlines.     Identifying an Appropriate Instructor   An instructor for a Gallatin Independent Study should be an NYU faculty member. In rare cases a professor from another university or college might be approved to instruct an Independent Study.   The Committee on Individualized Studies strongly urges students to locate NYU faculty to direct their independent study. In rare instances a student may seek to work with a professor at another institution. There is no guarantee that a non-NYU faculty member will be approved as an instructor of a Gallatin Independent Study. Students seeking to work with non-NYU faculty members must attach the professor\u2019s curriculum vitae (CV) with the proposal form for review by the Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies.     Number of Credits and Meeting Hours   Generally, independent studies are two, three or four credits. Credit amounts outside that range require explicit justification and special approval. The number of credits is determined by the amount of work to be completed and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course. The number of credits also determine the meeting hours. While the days and times of the student\u2019s meetings with the instructor are \u201cto be arranged,\u201d instructors and students meet for a minimum number of hours per semester: for a 4-credit Independent Study, the minimum number of contact hours is seven (7). In arranging contact hours, instructors and students may choose to meet every week for one-half hour, every other week for one hour, or less frequently, if appropriate, as long as they meet for a minimum of seven hours over the course of the semester. Contact hours for an Independent Study which is less than 4 credits should be prorated accordingly (e.g., a 2-credit independent study should meet for a minimum of 3.5 hours). As in any other course, the student should come prepared for these meetings by completing readings and written work on time.     Credit Limitations   While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with the University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Graduate students are permitted to earn a career maximum of 12 credits in individualized projects (any combination of independent study, internship, tutorial, or private lesson credits.)     Title of the Independent Study   If a student chooses, the title of an independent study will appear on his/her official transcript. Please check the \u201cTitle On Transcript\u201d box to indicate this. It should be a useful, descriptive title that reflects the unifying theme and content of the study. It should not duplicate an existing NYU course. The words \u201cIndependent Study\u201d will appear before the title on the transcript: for example, \u201cIndependent Study (The Plays of Arthur Miller).\u201d The title is limited to 26 characters including spaces and punctuation.     Description of Study   Like the course description in a college catalog, this part of the proposal essay should describe the general theme and scope of the independent study. The theme may be stated as a problem to be investigated, an issue to be explored, or an argument to be defended. The essay might indicate where the student is starting out and where s/he would like to get in terms of answering a question, exploring a phenomenon, understanding a theory, building a skill or other goal. It should articulate the theme and strategy of the study as clearly as possible within 250 words.     Readings   The student must provide a reading list with authors and titles, even if tentative, along with the proposal. The list should be comparable to a similar classroom course list (e.g., interdisciplinary seminars often assign 6 \u2013 10 books, depending on length and complexity.) Readings may change during the semester as the study evolves, but the preliminary list should be appropriate for the number of credits, and should indicate the kind of works to be read. Proposals for creative projects should include readings, as well.     Work to be evaluated by the Instructor   The proposal should indicate the kinds of work (response papers, research essays, creative works, etc.) which will be evaluated by the instructor. Assignments should be comparable in extent to a similar classroom course (e.g., interdisciplinary seminars typically assign about 25 pages of writing over the course of the semester. Provide details about the work, including the number, length and type of work to be submitted (e.g., two research papers, one 10 pages and the other 15; a portfolio of 20 exhibit-quality photographs plus four reading response papers of 2 pages each). Ultimately, it is up to the student and instructor to determine the specific format of the work to be evaluated by the instructor. The work for the study should be submitted according to the schedule of due dates agreed upon at the outset, and as with a classroom course, late work may be penalized.     Syllabus   The student must provide a schedule of meetings which includes the topics, the readings, and assignments to be covered during each session. Students can revise and adopt their syllabus with their instructor once the semester begins.     Approval Signatures   Both the instructor\u2019s and adviser\u2019s approval of the proposal are required. While the instructor may agree to supervise the student\u2019s work, the student\u2019s adviser determines whether it is appropriate for the student to undertake an independent study. After submitting the proposal form, the student should follow up with both their adviser and instructor to make sure their approvals have been sent to Gallatin\u2019s Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies.   Once the independent study proposal has been submitted to and approved by the Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies, the chair/dean indicates final approval with their signature. Please note that submitting a proposal does not guarantee approval.     Proposal Submission and Deadlines   The completed independent study proposal consists of:     adviser\u2019s approval   instructor\u2019s approval   completed proposal form   description of the study   syllabus   booklist     Students must submit all of the above components by the appropriate semester deadlines .

Often the idea for an independent study arises in a course; for example, in a seminar on early 20th-century American history, a student may develop an interest in the Harlem Renaissance and ask the instructor to supervise an independent study focused exclusively on this topic during the next semester. Students may also develop creative projects in areas such as, but not limited to, music composition, filmmaking, or fiction writing.   Below is an outline of the process that students follow to set up an independent study. Because the student and the instructor are designing a course, students must begin this process a full semester in advance. Students can refer to the Student Checklist to investigate the planning timeline for these steps:       Discuss with his or her adviser the possibility of conducting an independent study.     Generate a basic idea: a problem or a question, a time period, a literary genre, a natural phenomenon, a philosophical theme or a creative skill.     Identify an appropriate instructor: the student's academic adviser; a member of the Gallatin faculty or other NYU faculty; and with special approval, a professor from another university or college.     Contact the prospective instructor to propose the study and to discuss the plans for the work.     Complete and submit the Independent Study Proposal form for review by Gallatin's Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies. Please note that submitting a proposal does not guarantee approval.          Policy for Graduate Students     Generally, the work for an independent study should be comparable to a Gallatin classroom course. The specific format of the work will be determined by the student and the instructor who will evaluate it. They may choose several short papers, or a longer paper written in sections as the work progresses and depending on the nature of the study, video productions, paintings or music productions may be appropriate. The work for the study should be submitted according to the schedule of due dates agreed upon at the outset, and as with a classroom course, late work may be penalized.     Independent studies may be taken for two, three or four credits. The number of credits is determined by the amount of work to be completed.     Instructors and students must meet for a minimum number of hours per semester: for a 4-credit Independent Study, the minimum number of contact hours is seven (7). Contact hours for an Independent Study which is less (or more) than 4 credits should be prorated accordingly (e.g., a 2-credit independent study should meet for a minimum of 3.5 hours).     An instructor for a Gallatin Independent Study should be an NYU faculty member. In rare cases a professor from another university or college might be approved to instruct an Independent Study.     While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Graduate students may therefore take a maximum of 12 credits of Individualized Projects. This includes any combination of Independent Study, Tutorial, Internship and Private Lesson credit. If a student receives credit for Course Equivalency, this will decrease his or her allowance of Individualized Project credit and that student should check with the Office of Advising to confirm the number of Individualized Project credits remaining.     While independent study provides students with the opportunity to work one-on-one with an instructor, in general long distance independent studies are not permitted.     Students enrolled in another NYU school are generally not permitted to apply for a Gallatin Independent Study. In rare instances a student from another NYU school might be able to take a Gallatin Independent Study with a Gallatin professor. In all cases, students should contact KatheAnn Joseph for more information.     Students are expected to adhere to the proposal submission deadline .

Each fall and spring semester, Gallatin offers several different Proseminars that focus on theory and methods in the arts, the humanities or the social sciences. The Proseminar introduces students to key concepts and thinkers and emphasizes the reading of classic and contemporary works of theory in the arts, humanities, or the social sciences. Students should choose the Proseminar that aligns most closely with their proposed concentration for the program, keeping in mind that they have the option to take an additional Proseminar to fulfill the additional Gallatin graduate course requirement.     This course performs a number of functions:   1. It introduces students to the nature of individualized and interdisciplinary studies by engaging them in work on a broad theme or problem. Students learn how different kinds of scholars approach a common problem: how they ask questions, gather relevant information, conduct analysis and reach conclusions.     2. The Proseminar helps students think through their own programs of study by broadening their conception of the knowledge and skills they will need to pursue their plans and by encouraging them to clarify their own educational goals.   3. Finally, the Proseminar engages students in some of the academic processes\u2014research, analytic thinking, scholarly communication\u2014that they will need throughout their graduate studies.   The specific course descriptions may vary from semester to semester, but each class will raise issues of approach and method that every student needs to consider. The aim of the Proseminar, then, is to enlarge the student\u2019s scholarship and interdisciplinary inquiry and to suggest ways that the University\u2019s resources can be used to attain the student\u2019s goals.   Offered in the fall and spring semesters.                           Additional Gallatin Graduate Course (4 units)                                           In addition to the Proseminar and Gallatin thesis courses (Thesis Proposal Seminar, Master\u2019s Thesis I, and Master\u2019s Thesis II), students must take another four units in graduate courses offered by Gallatin.                                   This requirement serves several functions: to engage students more fully with the Gallatin community; to give them an opportunity to strengthen and integrate the concentration; and to strengthen their academic and interdisciplinary skills. Students have considerable leeway in choosing how to satisfy this requirement, thus manifesting the individualized character of the program.     Students fulfill this requirement by completing one of the following preexisting Gallatin courses:  1. a graduate elective course;  2. a second Proseminar;  3. an independent study or tutorial (internships and private lessons will not fulfill this requirement);  4. a graduate-level class offered by a Gallatin instructor at, or in conjunction with, another NYU department or program.       Offered in the fall and spring semesters.                           Thesis Proposal Seminar (2 units)                                           This course is taken after the student has completed a Proseminar and generally during the second semester of full-time study, or after completing 12 credits.                                   As the first step in the sequence leading to the thesis, the Thesis Proposal Seminar meets regularly during the semester and moves students toward the completion of an acceptable thesis proposal.   Students learn about the structure and content of the thesis proposal as they:  \u2022 consider ways of integrating their work and articulating a core problem;  \u2022 discuss the conventions of scholarly discourse, documentation, and argumentation; and  \u2022 formulate a plan for the thesis.   Multiple sections of this course will be offered each semester for students in the social sciences and professions, the humanities, and the arts. The course will combine classroom instruction with special events (e.g., guest lectures, library visits, human subjects research instruction). The class will take advantage of student research affinity groups formed before and during the students\u2019 enrollment in this course.   To pass this course, students must submit an advanced draft of the thesis proposal. Gallatin strongly recommends that students submit the adviser-approved thesis proposal to Gallatin using the Thesis Proposal Submission form soon after completing Thesis Proposal Seminar. However, students have the option to take more time to finalize the proposal and to submit it at the beginning of the semester after completing the course. Note that Thesis Proposal Seminar is offered only in the spring term. Students who complete it in the spring term are required to submit the thesis proposal to Gallatin by September 16 .   Offered only in the spring semester.                           Master's Thesis I (2 units)                                           This course is generally taken in the third semester of full-time study, or after completing 24 credits. The faculty adviser supervises and grades Master\u2019s Thesis I. Prerequisite: Thesis Proposal Seminar.                                   In Master\u2019s Thesis I, students will complete the basic research for and begin drafting the thesis. The course, which is a two credit course supervised by the student\u2019s adviser, will entail independent work, supported by the writing resources of the MA Program. Students: (1) must attend a meeting (registered students will be emailed information about place and time at the beginning of the semester) with the MA Program faculty and staff to discuss the overall goals of the course; (2) immerse themselves in the relevant scholarly discourses and literatures and begin drafting the thesis and, in the case of artistic theses, developing the artwork and accompanying research essay ; (3) meet with their advisers, on a regular basis, to consult on the content, logic, organization and methods for the thesis; (4) draw on the resources of the MA Program (e.g. individual consultations, organized peer writing groups, themed writing workshops) led by Gallatin M.A. program staff; (5) and at the end of the semester, present their work in progress by participating in a forum organized by Gallatin and attended by faculty and peers. To pass this course, in addition to fulfilling the presentation requirement, students must demonstrate significant progress toward completing the thesis. For more details, please see the additional information about Master\u2019s Thesis I on the Gallatin website.   To register, submit the Master\u2019s Thesis I Registration form.   Offered in the fall, spring and summer semesters.                           Master's Thesis II (2 units)                                           This course is generally taken in the final semester of study. The faculty adviser supervises Master\u2019s Thesis II. The Gallatin MA program submits grades for students in Master\u2019s Thesis II. Prerequisite: Master's Thesis I.                                   To pass this class, which is a two-credit course supervised by the student\u2019s adviser, the student must submit and defend the thesis. In the first months of the semester, the student continues to work in collaboration with the adviser to complete the thesis paper or, in the case of an artistic thesis, the artwork as well as the related research essay and other required accompanying materials. All students are required to attend one meeting at the start of the semester (registered students will be emailed information about place and time at the beginning of the semester) with MA Program faculty and staff to discuss the overall goals of the course. Finally, students should draw on the resources of the MA Program (individual consultations with writing specialists, peer writing groups, themed writing workshops) during the writing process. As prescribed by the online Thesis and Defense calendar , students must receive approval for all work from their adviser far enough in advance of the defense so that the other panelists will have at least four weeks to read and inspect the submission. For more details, please see the additional information about Master's Thesis II on the Gallatin website as well as the thesis and defense calendar and submission forms.   Offered in the fall, spring and summer semesters.

Designing an independent study is an important part of the project, and together the student and instructor should discuss the aims and content of the study. The independent study proposal should include the study\u2019s title, theme, readings, work to be submitted, and syllabus. While plans for the independent study may be tentative at the time the proposal form is submitted, students should fill out the whole form and not leave parts blank or \u201cto be decided on later.\u201d The Gallatin Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies will not review incomplete forms from students. Projects often change but it is important to put the plan in writing at the beginning of the semester so that the student and professor have a clear understanding of the work involved.   As you begin to work on the Independent Study Proposal, please refer to the Student Checklist to ensure that you do not miss any important steps or deadlines.     Identifying an Appropriate Instructor   An instructor for a Gallatin Independent Study should be an NYU faculty member. In rare cases a professor from another university or college might be approved to instruct an Independent Study.   The Committee on Individualized Studies strongly urges students to locate NYU faculty to direct their independent study. In rare instances a student may seek to work with a professor at another institution. There is no guarantee that a non-NYU faculty member will be approved as an instructor of a Gallatin Independent Study. Students seeking to work with non-NYU faculty members must attach the professor\u2019s curriculum vitae (CV) with the proposal form for review by the Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies.     Number of Credits and Meeting Hours   Generally, independent studies are two, three or four credits. Credit amounts outside that range require explicit justification and special approval. The number of credits is determined by the amount of work to be completed and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course. The number of credits also determine the meeting hours. While the days and times of the student\u2019s meetings with the instructor are \u201cto be arranged,\u201d instructors and students meet for a minimum number of hours per semester: for a 4-credit Independent Study, the minimum number of contact hours is seven (7). In arranging contact hours, instructors and students may choose to meet every week for one-half hour, every other week for one hour, or less frequently, if appropriate, as long as they meet for a minimum of seven hours over the course of the semester. Contact hours for an Independent Study which is less than 4 credits should be prorated accordingly (e.g., a 2-credit independent study should meet for a minimum of 3.5 hours). As in any other course, the student should come prepared for these meetings by completing readings and written work on time.     Credit Limitations   While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with the University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Graduate students are permitted to earn a career maximum of 12 credits in individualized projects (any combination of independent study, internship, tutorial, or private lesson credits.)     Title of the Independent Study   If a student chooses, the title of an independent study will appear on his/her official transcript. Please check the \u201cTitle On Transcript\u201d box to indicate this. It should be a useful, descriptive title that reflects the unifying theme and content of the study. It should not duplicate an existing NYU course. The words \u201cIndependent Study\u201d will appear before the title on the transcript: for example, \u201cIndependent Study (The Plays of Arthur Miller).\u201d The title is limited to 26 characters including spaces and punctuation.     Description of Study   Like the course description in a college catalog, this part of the proposal essay should describe the general theme and scope of the independent study. The theme may be stated as a problem to be investigated, an issue to be explored, or an argument to be defended. The essay might indicate where the student is starting out and where s/he would like to get in terms of answering a question, exploring a phenomenon, understanding a theory, building a skill or other goal. It should articulate the theme and strategy of the study as clearly as possible within 250 words.     Readings   The student must provide a reading list with authors and titles, even if tentative, along with the proposal. The list should be comparable to a similar classroom course list (e.g., interdisciplinary seminars often assign 6 \u2013 10 books, depending on length and complexity.) Readings may change during the semester as the study evolves, but the preliminary list should be appropriate for the number of credits, and should indicate the kind of works to be read. Proposals for creative projects should include readings, as well.     Work to be evaluated by the Instructor   The proposal should indicate the kinds of work (response papers, research essays, creative works, etc.) which will be evaluated by the instructor. Assignments should be comparable in extent to a similar classroom course (e.g., interdisciplinary seminars typically assign about 25 pages of writing over the course of the semester. Provide details about the work, including the number, length and type of work to be submitted (e.g., two research papers, one 10 pages and the other 15; a portfolio of 20 exhibit-quality photographs plus four reading response papers of 2 pages each). Ultimately, it is up to the student and instructor to determine the specific format of the work to be evaluated by the instructor. The work for the study should be submitted according to the schedule of due dates agreed upon at the outset, and as with a classroom course, late work may be penalized.     Syllabus   The student must provide a schedule of meetings which includes the topics, the readings, and assignments to be covered during each session. Students can revise and adopt their syllabus with their instructor once the semester begins.     Approval Signatures   Both the instructor\u2019s and adviser\u2019s approval of the proposal are required. While the instructor may agree to supervise the student\u2019s work, the student\u2019s adviser determines whether it is appropriate for the student to undertake an independent study. After submitting the proposal form, the student should follow up with both their adviser and instructor to make sure their approvals have been sent to Gallatin\u2019s Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies.   Once the independent study proposal has been submitted to and approved by the Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies, the chair/dean indicates final approval with their signature. Please note that submitting a proposal does not guarantee approval.     Proposal Submission and Deadlines   The completed independent study proposal consists of:     adviser\u2019s approval   instructor\u2019s approval   completed proposal form   description of the study   syllabus   booklist     Students must submit all of the above components by the appropriate semester deadlines .     Student Checklist   Students should follow the deadlines listed on the Student Checklist to ensure approval of their proposal.     Instructor Guidelines   Faculty who will be working with and grading a student's independent study should read the Instructor Guidelines .                      top of page                           Quick Links                 Student Checklist Individualized Projects Deadlines Independent Study Proposal Form Instructor Guidelines                                                                                      NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

Often the idea for an independent study arises in a course; for example, in a seminar on early 20th-century American history, a student may develop an interest in the Harlem Renaissance and ask the instructor to supervise an independent study focused exclusively on this topic during the next semester. Students may also develop creative projects in areas such as, but not limited to, music composition, filmmaking, or fiction writing.   Below is an outline of the process that students follow to set up an independent study. Because the student and the instructor are designing a course, students must begin this process a full semester in advance. Students can refer to the Student Checklist to investigate the planning timeline for these steps:       Discuss with his or her adviser the possibility of conducting an independent study.     Generate a basic idea: a problem or a question, a time period, a literary genre, a natural phenomenon, a philosophical theme or a creative skill.     Identify an appropriate instructor: the student's academic adviser; a member of the Gallatin faculty or other NYU faculty; and with special approval, a professor from another university or college.     Contact the prospective instructor to propose the study and to discuss the plans for the work.     Complete and submit the Independent Study Proposal form for review by Gallatin's Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies. Please note that submitting a proposal does not guarantee approval.          Policy for Graduate Students     Generally, the work for an independent study should be comparable to a Gallatin classroom course. The specific format of the work will be determined by the student and the instructor who will evaluate it. They may choose several short papers, or a longer paper written in sections as the work progresses and depending on the nature of the study, video productions, paintings or music productions may be appropriate. The work for the study should be submitted according to the schedule of due dates agreed upon at the outset, and as with a classroom course, late work may be penalized.     Independent studies may be taken for two, three or four credits. The number of credits is determined by the amount of work to be completed.     Instructors and students must meet for a minimum number of hours per semester: for a 4-credit Independent Study, the minimum number of contact hours is seven (7). Contact hours for an Independent Study which is less (or more) than 4 credits should be prorated accordingly (e.g., a 2-credit independent study should meet for a minimum of 3.5 hours).     An instructor for a Gallatin Independent Study should be an NYU faculty member. In rare cases a professor from another university or college might be approved to instruct an Independent Study.     While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Graduate students may therefore take a maximum of 12 credits of Individualized Projects. This includes any combination of Independent Study, Tutorial, Internship and Private Lesson credit. If a student receives credit for Course Equivalency, this will decrease his or her allowance of Individualized Project credit and that student should check with the Office of Advising to confirm the number of Individualized Project credits remaining.     While independent study provides students with the opportunity to work one-on-one with an instructor, in general long distance independent studies are not permitted.     Students enrolled in another NYU school are generally not permitted to apply for a Gallatin Independent Study. In rare instances a student from another NYU school might be able to take a Gallatin Independent Study with a Gallatin professor. In all cases, students should contact KatheAnn Joseph for more information.     Students are expected to adhere to the proposal submission deadline .
