Applicants to NYU's New York Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU New York should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid).   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE (to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid). The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is required for new undergraduate domestic students applying for the 2015-2016 academic year who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. It is not required for transfer applicants, returning undergraduate students, graduate students, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies.     The New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) grant application, for New York State residents only.   Students seeking financial aid for summer courses must also complete a NYU Summer Aid Application (available from February through July, see the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right).     Admission to NYU New York is need-blind for domestic applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the FAFSA, PROFILE and TAP applications.   International Students : NYU offers limited financial support in the form of institutional grants/scholarships to international freshmen admitted to our New York campus beginning with the Fall 2013 term. Grants/scholarships will be based upon a combination of financial need and academic merit. Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for institutional financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU New York campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU New York is need-aware for international applicants; New York University will consider a family's financial need as reported on the PROFILE when evaluating the student's application for admission.   New York Undocumented Students : Individuals applying for admission as an undocumented undergraduate student may be eligible for NYU scholarship funds. To be considered, please submit:     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   The Undocumented Student Financial Aid Application (available beginning in October, see the Applications and Forms menu at right).     Please read more information about New York Undocumented Students .   Applicants to NYU's Abu Dhabi Campus   Domestic and International students : All students, regardless of citizenship status (except Emirati nationals), who are applying for admission ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi (that is, they do not wish to be considered for any other NYU campus) need to complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. (The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.) International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU Abu Dhabi is need-blind for all applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the PROFILE. Students applying ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi are not required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).   For more information please see NYU Abu Dhabi Financial Support .   Applicants to NYU's Shanghai Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU Shanghai should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (to be considered for federal financial aid).

Admission to NYU Shanghai is need-blind, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the FAFSA and PROFILE.     International Students and Chinese Nationals : Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU Shanghai campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. The PROFILE is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test. International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU Shanghai is need-blind, and financial support will be tailored for each indivdual family based upon the results of the PROFILE.     For more information please see Financial Aid at NYU Shanghai .              FAFSA, CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE and TAP     1. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)   Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for any federal financial aid funds. The FAFSA is a confidential fiinancial statement detailing information about your family\u2019s financial circumstances. When you have completed the form, you submit it directly to the U.S. Department of Education. Using a formula mandated by Congress, the U.S. Department of Education makes an evaluation of your family\u2019s financial strength and estimates the amount your family can contribute annually toward your educational expenses. The Department of Education then sends your family\u2019s financial information and its estimate of family contribution to each college you designate to receive the information. (NOTE TO DENTAL STUDENTS: College of Dentistry students seeking certain federal education loans for the health professions (e.g. the Health Professions Student Loan [HPSL] and Loans for Disadvantaged Students [LDS]) must include parents financial data on the FAFSA even if they are financially independent of their parents.)   The FAFSA is available each year beginning January 1, and should be completed as soon as possible, but not later than February 15 (midnight EST) for new freshmen , and not later than May 1 (midnight EDT) for most other students (see Financial Aid Application Priority Deadlines at column upper right for details). Students who miss the FAFSA priority deadline are still encouraged to apply and will be considered for federal student aid, if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited.   Graduate students should refer to their school or department for specific program deadlines.     Click here to begin and submit the FAFSA . Alternatively, you can complete the paper version, which may be found in your high school or college or by calling 1-800-4-FED-AID.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, and adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU Shanghai.     NOT REQUIRED for international students at NYU New York campus.   NOT REQUIRED for students at NYU Abu Dhabi.   NOT REQUIRED for international students and Chinese nationals at NYU Shanghai.   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our federal school code number 002785 when completing your FAFSA.     Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the FAFSA. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the FAFSA. You can make corrections later on the FAFSA website.     YOUR FAFSA PIN:  Students and parents of dependent students may use a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to sign the FAFSA electronically and avoid the need to print and mail a signature page. The PIN can be used each year to apply for federal student aid and to review your record online at the U.S. Department of Education. Get your Federal Student Aid PIN at www.pin.ed.gov .   FAFSA priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early and Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        FAFSA priority deadlines for Transfer applicants:         Fall/Summer Admission: April 1 (midnight EDT)    Spring Admission: November 1 (midnight EDT)           2. College Scholarship Service Financial Aid PROFILE   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application is administered by the College Scholarship Service (the financial aid division of The College Board) and collects information used by many private universities to award institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE can be submitted in the fall as early as October 1 , but not later than February 15 (midnight EST).       Click here to begin and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE .   REQUIRED the first year for new undergraduate U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens applying to NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)   REQUIRED every year for international (not US, not Chinese nationals) students at NYU Shanghai who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our CSS school code number 2785 when completing your CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the PROFILE. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the PROFILE.   NYU does not participate in the CSS IDOC program.   CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE Help: telephone 305-829-9793.     CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early Decision I: November 15 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 15 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        College Scholarship Service Noncustodial PROFILE     The CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is also required, if applicable;     Students who have families with separated, divorced, or single parents must also complete the Non-Custodial Parent form, which complements the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE. NYU requires noncustodial parents to report their income, assets and other information as part of the financial aid application process to assess an applicant\u2019s eligibility for scholarship or other types of aid.   Providing such information does not necessarily mean that the student\u2019s noncustodial parent will be expected or required to contribute to educational costs.   Under certain circumstances NYU will consider waiving the requirement for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE in the event the information cannot be obtained. Please see the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE Waiver Request form available (October to February) on the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right.   If the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is required but not submitted, and NYU does not grant the applicant a waiver of this requirement, the student will not be considered for need-based NYU scholarship or grant funds. Please note that this is important because the amount of scholarship a student receives in their first year at NYU is typically the amount they will continue to receive each year if they remain otherwise eligible. Thus, if a student does not receive any NYU grant or scholarship in their freshman year they will likely not receive any in subsequent years. Failing to submit the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE (or the waiver request) for the first year can therefore affect eligibility in future years.     CSS Noncustodial PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:           Early Decision I: November 20 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 20 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 20 (midnight EST)        Please note that the deadlines for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE application occur 5 days after the corresponding deadlines for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application to allow additional time to provide the information required.             3. NYS Tuition Assistance Program (TAP)   In addition to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), New York State residents must also submit an application for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP grants are available to qualified students attending New York University.    Start the TAP application process by completing the FAFSA at http://www.fafsa.gov/ . New York State will use your FAFSA information as part of your application for TAP; you can link to the online TAP application directly from the FAFSA on the Web confirmation page.    You will be asked to establish a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for TAP. The TAP PIN will allow you complete your application online, keep track of your application information, or make changes later. Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. Follow the instructions provided.       You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our state school code number 0555 when completing your TAP application.     If you choose not to apply online, an Express TAP Application (ETA) will be mailed to you by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-printed on your ETA. Review this information, change any incorrect items, complete any missing items, then SIGN AND MAIL THE FORM USING THE RETURN ENVELOPE.    If you provide an e-mail address on your FAFSA, HESC will use that address to contact you about your TAP application, give you processing updates, or award information. Please respond to any requests or instructions sent by HESC. If you have submitted applications, you can check the status of your TAP at any time.    If you have already received TAP, you must renew your grant each year by returning to TAP on the Web (via the online FAFSA process) to review and confirm your HESC data. You must submit the FAFSA for each academic year to continue your TAP eligibility. Based upon the data reported on your FAFSA, you will receive confirmation from HESC about your grant eligibility and award. Be sure to verify that all information is accurate, and submit any necessary corrections immediately.                                                         Priority Dates and Deadlines   All students should apply for financial aid every year. Students who miss a financial aid priority deadline are still encouraged to file the FAFSA and will be considered for federal student aid if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited. If you have not applied, do so immediately . Remember, to meet the specified deadline your application, with all necessary signatures, must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU by the date shown below for priority consideration.   Freshman Applicants: In order to be considered for NYU scholarship, you must complete all required applications by our deadlines . Please review the Applications and Forms section of this website to find out which applications are relevant to you. Late CSS Profile applications will not be accepted for scholarship consideration.

Applicants to NYU's New York Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU New York should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid).   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE (to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid). The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is required for new undergraduate domestic students applying for the 2015-2016 academic year who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. It is not required for transfer applicants, returning undergraduate students, graduate students, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies.     The New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) grant application, for New York State residents only.   Students seeking financial aid for summer courses must also complete a NYU Summer Aid Application (available from February through July, see the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right).     Admission to NYU New York is need-blind for domestic applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the FAFSA, PROFILE and TAP applications.   International Students : NYU offers limited financial support in the form of institutional grants/scholarships to international freshmen admitted to our New York campus beginning with the Fall 2013 term. Grants/scholarships will be based upon a combination of financial need and academic merit. Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for institutional financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU New York campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU New York is need-aware for international applicants; New York University will consider a family's financial need as reported on the PROFILE when evaluating the student's application for admission.   New York Undocumented Students : Individuals applying for admission as an undocumented undergraduate student may be eligible for NYU scholarship funds. To be considered, please submit:     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.

(The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.) International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted.

For more information please see Financial Aid at NYU Shanghai .              FAFSA, CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE and TAP     1. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)   Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for any federal financial aid funds. The FAFSA is a confidential fiinancial statement detailing information about your family\u2019s financial circumstances. When you have completed the form, you submit it directly to the U.S. Department of Education. Using a formula mandated by Congress, the U.S. Department of Education makes an evaluation of your family\u2019s financial strength and estimates the amount your family can contribute annually toward your educational expenses. The Department of Education then sends your family\u2019s financial information and its estimate of family contribution to each college you designate to receive the information. (NOTE TO DENTAL STUDENTS: College of Dentistry students seeking certain federal education loans for the health professions (e.g. the Health Professions Student Loan [HPSL] and Loans for Disadvantaged Students [LDS]) must include parents financial data on the FAFSA even if they are financially independent of their parents.)   The FAFSA is available each year beginning January 1, and should be completed as soon as possible, but not later than February 15 (midnight EST) for new freshmen , and not later than May 1 (midnight EDT) for most other students (see Financial Aid Application Priority Deadlines at column upper right for details). Students who miss the FAFSA priority deadline are still encouraged to apply and will be considered for federal student aid, if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited.   Graduate students should refer to their school or department for specific program deadlines.     Click here to begin and submit the FAFSA .

YOUR FAFSA PIN:  Students and parents of dependent students may use a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to sign the FAFSA electronically and avoid the need to print and mail a signature page.

College Scholarship Service Financial Aid PROFILE   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application is administered by the College Scholarship Service (the financial aid division of The College Board) and collects information used by many private universities to award institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE can be submitted in the fall as early as October 1 , but not later than February 15 (midnight EST).       Click here to begin and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE .   REQUIRED the first year for new undergraduate U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens applying to NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.

REQUIRED every year for international (not US, not Chinese nationals) students at NYU Shanghai who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our CSS school code number 2785 when completing your CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the PROFILE. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the PROFILE.   NYU does not participate in the CSS IDOC program.   CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE Help: telephone 305-829-9793.     CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early Decision I: November 15 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 15 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        College Scholarship Service Noncustodial PROFILE     The CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is also required, if applicable;     Students who have families with separated, divorced, or single parents must also complete the Non-Custodial Parent form, which complements the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE. NYU requires noncustodial parents to report their income, assets and other information as part of the financial aid application process to assess an applicant\u2019s eligibility for scholarship or other types of aid.   Providing such information does not necessarily mean that the student\u2019s noncustodial parent will be expected or required to contribute to educational costs.   Under certain circumstances NYU will consider waiving the requirement for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE in the event the information cannot be obtained. Please see the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE Waiver Request form available (October to February) on the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right.   If the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is required but not submitted, and NYU does not grant the applicant a waiver of this requirement, the student will not be considered for need-based NYU scholarship or grant funds. Please note that this is important because the amount of scholarship a student receives in their first year at NYU is typically the amount they will continue to receive each year if they remain otherwise eligible. Thus, if a student does not receive any NYU grant or scholarship in their freshman year they will likely not receive any in subsequent years. Failing to submit the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE (or the waiver request) for the first year can therefore affect eligibility in future years.     CSS Noncustodial PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:           Early Decision I: November 20 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 20 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 20 (midnight EST)        Please note that the deadlines for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE application occur 5 days after the corresponding deadlines for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application to allow additional time to provide the information required.             3. NYS Tuition Assistance Program (TAP)   In addition to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), New York State residents must also submit an application for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP grants are available to qualified students attending New York University.    Start the TAP application process by completing the FAFSA at http://www.fafsa.gov/ . New York State will use your FAFSA information as part of your application for TAP; you can link to the online TAP application directly from the FAFSA on the Web confirmation page.    You will be asked to establish a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for TAP. The TAP PIN will allow you complete your application online, keep track of your application information, or make changes later. Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. Follow the instructions provided.       You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our state school code number 0555 when completing your TAP application.     If you choose not to apply online, an Express TAP Application (ETA) will be mailed to you by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-printed on your ETA. Review this information, change any incorrect items, complete any missing items, then SIGN AND MAIL THE FORM USING THE RETURN ENVELOPE.    If you provide an e-mail address on your FAFSA, HESC will use that address to contact you about your TAP application, give you processing updates, or award information. Please respond to any requests or instructions sent by HESC. If you have submitted applications, you can check the status of your TAP at any time.    If you have already received TAP, you must renew your grant each year by returning to TAP on the Web (via the online FAFSA process) to review and confirm your HESC data. You must submit the FAFSA for each academic year to continue your TAP eligibility. Based upon the data reported on your FAFSA, you will receive confirmation from HESC about your grant eligibility and award. Be sure to verify that all information is accurate, and submit any necessary corrections immediately.                                                         Priority Dates and Deadlines   All students should apply for financial aid every year. Students who miss a financial aid priority deadline are still encouraged to file the FAFSA and will be considered for federal student aid if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited. If you have not applied, do so immediately . Remember, to meet the specified deadline your application, with all necessary signatures, must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU by the date shown below for priority consideration.   Freshman Applicants: In order to be considered for NYU scholarship, you must complete all required applications by our deadlines . Please review the Applications and Forms section of this website to find out which applications are relevant to you. Late CSS Profile applications will not be accepted for scholarship consideration. The FAFSA can be filed at any time to be reviewed for federal aid eligibility.

To be eligible for direct deposit, you must have a checking or savings account at a bank that is a member of the Automatic Clearinghouse (most banks are members). Stipend checks will be sent to your local address as it appears on Albert (via NYUHome ) until direct deposit becomes effective for you or if you do not elect the direct deposit option. Be sure to maintain your current local address on Albert at all times.

You may also upload various attachments to your application as outlined in the attachment section of the application. Please do not submit attachments in lieu of completing the requested information in each section of the application.   CAS/Law School Report   All applicants for admission to the JD program are required to take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). All applicants are required to register for the Credential Assembly Service (CAS). After we receive your application, we will request your law school report from the Law School Admissions Council (LSAC). The law school report summarizes undergraduate academic work and includes copies of your transcripts, your LSAT score, and your writing sample. The law school code for NYU School of Law is 2599 .   Note for Foreign-Educated Applicants: Foreign transcripts must be submitted through the LSAC Credential Assembly Service (CAS). Applicants who completed any post-secondary work outside of the United States (including its territories) or Canada, must use this service for the evaluation of foreign transcripts. The one exception to this requirement is foreign work completed through a study abroad, consortium, or exchange program sponsored by a US or Canadian institution, and where the work is clearly indicated as such on the home campus transcript. Please visit www.lsac.org for details.   Recommendation Forms   Two recommendations are required to complete your admissions application. You may also submit one or more evaluations in addition to but not in lieu of a letter of recommendation. We will consider evaluations as part of your application but they are not required for completion.   The Committee on Admissions prefers the use of the LSAC Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Service. Please do NOT submit duplicate letters directly to NYU School of Law.   Note: The Root-Tilden-Kern Scholarship; the Lindermann Family Public Service Scholarship; the Jacobson Public Service Scholarship for Women, Children, and Families; the Sinsheimer Service Scholarship; and the Filomen M. D'Agostino Scholarship applications require at least one additional recommendation that addresses the applicant's commitment to public service (see Scholarship section for details).   Application Fee or Waiver   When you transmit your application electronically, the fee, payable by credit card only, is $85. The application fee is not applied to tuition and is not refundable. Please do not send cash.   Applicants who have received an LSAC-approved LSAT or CAS fee waiver, will have their NYU School of Law $85 application fee automatically waived.   Applicants who are alumni of Teach for America or the Peace Corps are eligible for an $85 application fee waiver. To qualify, applicants must have completed their 2-year commitment to Teach for America or the Peace Corps by the start of the fall 2015 semester. Further, Teach for America alumni must have completed TFA's pre-corps training institute and served as a teacher for two years in a low-income community through their Teach for America placement. Applicants who have completed less than 2 years by the start of law school or those who are just entering Teach for America or the Peace Corps are not eligible. The application fee will also be waived for those who have served or are serving in the United States military. (Participation in a foreign country's military does not qualify an applicant for a fee waiver.)   Teach for America, Peace Corps and US military participants should send their request for a fee waiver to law.moreinfo@nyu.edu . Applicants must have an account with the LSAC . To request an application fee waiver, please include your L number, a verification letter as well as the basis for the waiver (Teach for America, Peace Corps, or US military service).   Personal Statement   While the Committee on Admissions does not use interviews as part of the selection process, we would like to give you the opportunity to include more information about yourself than the application form conveys. Because people and their interests vary, we leave the content and length of your statement to your discretion. You may wish to complete or clarify your responses to items on the application form, bring to our attention additional information you feel should be considered, describe important or unusual aspects of yourself not otherwise apparent in your application, or tell us what led you to apply to NYU School of Law.   Resume   A resume is required to complete your application.   Supplying Additional Information   The Committee on Admissions encourages you to provide any information that may be helpful to us in reaching a thoughtful decision on your application. While the choice as to whether and what information to submit to the committee is entirely yours, any information you provide will be used to give you full credit for your accomplishments, to help the committee reach an informed decision on your application, and to aid the committee in selecting a diverse student body.   Information that has been helpful in the past includes, but is not limited to, descriptions or documentation of disabilities, a detailed history of standardized test results, an explanation for any discrepancies in the case of submission of multiple LSAT scores, unusual circumstances which may have affected academic performance, or personal/family history of educational or socioeconomic disadvantage. This list is not all-inclusive, but we offer it for you to think about as you consider whether such information might be relevant in your case, and to assure you that it is quite appropriate.   If you choose to provide additional information, please upload this information in the attachment section of the application, and clearly identify your submission accordingly.   We would also like to know if a member of your immediate family (parents or grandparents) attended the NYU School of Law.   When you receive additional grades (such as first semester of senior year grades), you should submit an updated transcript to LSAC, which will, in turn, send us an updated law school report .   Any information you submit, including material sent after your application is complete, will be considered by the Committee on Admissions if received before a final decision is reached on your application.   We will notify you by email when your application is complete and ready for review by the Committee on Admissions. Please check your spam mailbox as some servers filter our email messages. Please also note that we will not release decision information via email, telephone, or fax.   In completing this application, be sure that your statements are accurate, you answer all the questions, and you electronically certify the application. Misrepresentation may result in denial of admission, the rescinding of an offer of admission, dismissal from the law school, or any NYU School of Law degrees granted being revoked. The law school may seek to verify any information submitted by contacting recommenders, employers or school officials.   There are character, fitness, and other qualifications for admission to the bar and applicants are encouraged, prior to matriculation, to determine what those requirements are in the state(s) in which they intend to practice.   Questions or Concerns   We will try to notify you if any of the material necessary to complete your application has not arrived in the Office of Admissions, and we will try to keep you informed about the status of your application. Please understand that it takes some time for the committee to give each application thorough consideration.   Please keep a copy of your application and your personal statement. We will not return or give you copies of any part of your application or supporting material, nor will we forward any part of your application or supporting material to a third party.   If you call the Office of Admissions about the status of your application, be sure you have allowed time for materials send to arrive and be processed. Please understand that the volume of applications and phone calls may prevent us from verifying, while you are on the phone, that a particular item has been received and filed in your application.   The Office of Admissions does not release any information except to the applicant and does not give admission decisions by e-mail, telephone, or fax. This policy helps to protect the confidentiality of every applicant.   Application materials and all supporting documents submitted in connection with an application for admitted students who enroll at New York University School of Law become part of the student's record and are subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).   Timing of Decisions   A holistic approach to the review of applications requires an extraordinary amount of care, and thus a significant amount of time. There is no way to predict an exact date on which a candidate will receive a decision.   Candidates who apply under the binding Early Decision option (deadline November 15) will be notified (admit, deny, or hold) by late December.   Candidates who apply by our regular February 15 deadline (must have taken the LSAT by the previous December to qualify) will be notified by late April. Candidates may hear sooner than late April, but we cannot make such a guarantee.   Beyond these parameters, it is not possible to predict an exact date by which a decision will be made on an application.   The Committee on Admissions recognizes that some law schools have deposit deadlines as early as April 1 and will ask a candidate for a commitment before that candidate receives a decision from NYU School of Law. Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to accelerate our process in these circumstances.   Rolling Notification, Not Rolling Admission   Applications are sent to the Committee on Admissions in the order in which they are completed, but decisions are not necessarily made in the order in which applications are first reviewed. Some applicants may receive a decision fairly quickly based on the overall and relative strength of the application.   In an applicant pool of approximately 6,200 applications, many candidates present strong qualifications. The Law School\u2019s admissions process is both objective and comparative. The Committee follows an on-going process of reviewing and rereviewing the vast majority of the applicant pool. Most candidates\u2019 applications require significant comparison with the applicant pool as a whole before a final decision can be reached. For many candidates, the committee is not able to reach a decision until they have a clear picture of that year\u2019s entire applicant pool.   As long as candidates take the LSAT by December and meet the February 15 deadline by having all materials received by the Office of Admissions, they will be given full and complete consideration and will be at no competitive disadvantage in the admissions process.
