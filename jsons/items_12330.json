Focuses on the history of records and record keeping, development of archival theory, appraisal, arrangement and description, reference, legal and ethical issues, and current trends in the profession.                  HIST-GA.1012 Historical Editing Seminar         Introduces students to the theories, practices, and problems involved in editing and publishing historical documents. Students develop their own documentary editions complete with prefatory material, transcriptions, annotations, and calendars. Focuses especially on project leadership and includes an electronic edition component.              HIST-GA.1151 Literature of the Field: Modern Europe        This class introduces graduate students to major debates, problems and categories in European historiography on the period from the mid nineteenth to the late twentieth centuries. The emphasis is on methodological and analytical questions. Topics include nationalism, fascism, capitalism, colonialism, total war, cities, science, and subjectivity.              HIST-GA.1156 What is Europe?        Examines the formation of the European nation-state starting with the French Revolution. Provides an overview of key issues, including citizenship, exclusion, immigration, identity, nationalism, security, and the creation of the European Union and its policy formation.               HIST-GA.1201 Lit of the Field: Colonial Latin America        Surveys major literature and historiographical issues in the colonial Latin American field. Required for PhD students in Latin American and Caribbean History.                  HIST-GA.1209 19th Century France: France and its Empire 1750-1800s    France and Its Empire, 1750-1880s focuses on the revolutionary period of modern France. This was a tumultuous and creative time, a time of revolution and reaction, republics and monarchies, liberalism and centralized power. We will study this period in three principal ways: by learning about the various regimes, politics, ideologies, and social patterns that marked the era; by reading documents written during this time and texts composed by some of its principal figures; and by analyzing selected works of present-day historical scholarship that help us understand modern France.         As we build this understanding, our thinking will be guided by the following questions: Why was it so difficult during the century following the French Revolution for France to develop a stable political regime? Why, in this connection, did France irrupt into revolution in response to the problems it faced? And to what extent did the French Revolution define the nature and meaning of the period that followed it? Finally, what was the role of France\u2019s empire, and how did colonialism square with the effort to build a stable republican regime?        The French Revolution is fundamental not just to French history but to world history. For this reason, we will devote considerable attention to the origins and meaning of this event. We will also consider the subsequent revolutions of the nineteenth century revolutions and examine the extent to which France became a modern society in the second half of the nineteenth century.                     HIST-GA.1326 Russia: Law and Empire, 16th-21st Century     Description forthcoming. In the meantime, please contact the professor directly.             HIST-GA.1416 History of Modern Ireland I     Early-modern Irish history is an epic tale of conflict, subjugation, and the struggle for national identity. In the roughly two and a half centuries covered by this course, Ireland was transformed from a mysterious and remote island on the periphery of Europe to a quasi-autonomous state fully caught up in the sweeping economic, political, and social transformations that defined the late eighteenth century. Among the topics covered in History I are the Tudor conquest and colonization; Gaelic pushback; Ireland under the Stuarts; the Williamite War and formation of the Protestant Ascendancy; the emergence of Irish nationalism; Ireland and the Enlightenment; 18th-century political, economic, and societal transformations; and Ireland in the Age of Revolutions. The struggles and frustrations of this period define the agenda for Ireland\u2019s tumultuous passage through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.             HIST-GA.1421 Debates in Modern Irish History     This course seeks to analyze a selection of the intense debates in Ireland itself and abroad, especially in Britain and the USA, that characterize modern Irish history, concentrating on topics that transcend the specific Irish experience to raise issues of wider human import. It is equally a study of events and of their interpretation from various contested perspectives, and thus requires intense engagement with the historiography, and with the study of history as a mode of thought. The topics to be explored include the issues of Conquest, Collaboration, Assimilation and Resistance, viewed through the prism of Ireland and the British Empire, as reflected in a number of major topics, including: The Act of Union; The Great Irish Famine; Irish Diaspora; Issues of Irish Identity (as seen through Irish and British eyes via historical movements and events); the ethno-religious conflict in Northern Ireland since 1968; Ireland and Globalization.              HIST-GA.1441 History and Historiography of Irish America     The Irish are one of the most significant ethnic groups to ever migrate from Europe to the United States. Their impact has been disproportional to their numbers but this only partially explains our contemporary understanding of \u201cIrish America.\u201d This seminar will explore how the history of Irish immigrants and their descendants in the United States has been written over the past century and a half. Students will evaluate books and documentary films that have been influential in constructing the narrative of the Irish in America, in addition to article literature. The goal is to learn how to separate historical content from historiography and to see how both can influence popular perceptions of an ethnic people.              HIST-GA.1521 Medieval Marriage     This course will explore the practical experience of marriage in the Middle Ages. We will be looking at the lay experience of the stages of married life (from courting and wedding to annulment and death) in all its gendered aspects. For each of the thematic sessions we will explore as much as possible the experience across the whole social range from aristocracy to peasants. Although our focus will be on the Christian Middle Ages of western Europe we will devote ample space to comparative aspects in Islamic and Jewish culture especially for the Mediterranean area. Thematic sessions will centre on exogamy (intermarriage) in mixed faith and ethnic circumstances, polygamy and concubinage, remarriage and step family relationships, male power and female obedience and the memorialisation of married life. We will also explore alternative forms of cohabitation in a sexual or celibate manner. Wherever possible special attention will be paid to the material culture of marriage, such as the domestic arrangement in the houses, living and sleeping quarters and moveable possessions.              HIST-GA.1562 Lit of the Field: Africa     This course introduces students to the major themes, scholarly approaches, and sources for African history.              HIST-GA.1600 Literature of the Field: US to 1877     A reading course covering the earlier period of American history that introduces students to the major themes, interpretations, and methods of inquiry. It is intended to provide a broad command of the field.              HIST-GA.1646 Materializing in the Middle Ages     The theme of the seminar, materiality, is concerned with the tangible stuff of medieval lives, with those materials: animal parts, vegetable fibers, metal, stones, clay, wood, that were used and processed into finished objects: comestibles, clothing, homes and monuments, artifacts and ornaments, images and the media of written and visual communication. As they emerged from raw materials, things affected social relations and cultural perception, enabling action and provoking reaction. We will consider, for example, the effects of pageantry, with its elaborate display of culinary, heraldic, and sartorial splendor, in asserting and maintaining chivalric claims to dominance. We will examine recent archeological findings to understand the ways that, through accessories to their dress, peasants resisted and re-fashioned the identities imposed upon them by medieval elites. Objects, thus, shaped history, yet historians tend to write history based upon texts. Avoiding such an exclusive dependency requires methodological reflection. Stimulated by the work of social scientists such as Jane Bennett, Alfred Gell, Tim Ingold, Bruno Latour, and Bjrnar Olsen, lively debates are currently taking place about the theory, goals, and relevance of material culture studies, and we will develop our own perspectives on the issues at stake. Assessing the participation, meaning, and agency of things in pre-modern lives forces to question boundaries and to put them in a newer historical perspective: the relationships between humans and animals (and nature), between humans and technology, body and soul, images and memory, the animate and the inanimate. Our exploration of the connections between human and non-human environments will consider the appropriation of animal skins in the production of writing; the extension of human personhood via the use of animal power, tools, weapons, images, and memory aids; human involvement with a living landscape of holy trees, sacred groves and springs, and powerful stars; attitudes toward idols and automata; the perception of art as vibrant matter. Though modern theory inspires historians and art historians to seek agency in a network of social and material relationships, medieval intellectuals were more cautious in their belief in the power of matter. In fact, for many, the materiality of the human body was suspicious, as was knowledge that depended upon the mediation of the senses. Such \u2018carnal\u2019 knowledge was ascribed to minorities (Jews) and alleged dissenters (magi, witches). Materiality in the Middle Ages was a philosophical topic fraught with ambivalence, imbued with a potential for violence.              HIST-GA.1750 Intro to Public History     Reviews the history of public history, focusing on historians\u2019 relationships, dialogues, and collaborations with public audiences. Considers issues involving memory, identity, heritage, commemoration, historic preservation, history museums, historic sites, oral history, and digital history. Final project involves a collaborative endeavor with a local public history institution.               HIST-GA.1763 Approaches to History of Women and Gender     This course is intended as an introduction to some of the central methodological and interpretive issues involved in the historical study of women and gender. We consider the development of women\u2019s history as a field from the 1960s, the historiographies that have shaped women\u2019s history (and been influenced by it), the introduction of gender as an analytical category, the interpretive models that have structured writing about women and gender in the past, and the particular challenges involved in researching subjects who have often left little trace in the historic record. This is not a nation-based survey of women\u2019s history. Instead, our approach is comparative. We will read works that have had a significant impact on the development of the field, works that model particular methodological or interpretive approaches, and works by faculty at NYU. We will also consider contemporary reflections on the state of the field, both in the US and internationally .               HIST-GA.1773 Society &amp; Culture: 20th Century America     This is a graduate level research seminar on the social and cultural history of the United States in the twentieth-century. The central project of the course will be each student\u2019s development of an extended, article-length essay based on original research. Considerable class time will be dedicated to preliminary discussions of each research problematic and its relevant historiographies. Research takes time, as does writing and re-writing; papers are NOT written in one sitting or in a single draft. Accordingly, students will be required to develop their research in the first weeks, even as readings and discussion proceed and present finished drafts in class that will be revised for final submission.        Although the seminar is not be readings course or colloquium, the first half of the semester will include readings to introduce some theoretical tools and writing strategies. Introductory readings and wider reading around the relevant historiographies that the various students\u2019 research problematic engages, and shared reading of the research essays of others will also expose students to a broad a range of subjects in the literature in social and cultural history. The subject is cast broadly to allow for diverse student research interests, but will be limited to the long 20th century (from ca. 1890 to the present).              HIST-GA.1782 African American History     Broad exposure to African American history. Begins with a historiographical introduction, describing the growth and development of the field, and moves to a major theme and period treatment ranging from ancient Africa to the civil rights movement. Provides an understanding of the field and a foundation for specialized course work and research.              HIST-GA.1981 Migration History and Theory: The Italian Case as Litmus Test     The course begins with the assumption that mobility is the norm in human history and it will focus on the case of Italy \u2013 a geographically well-defined peninsula, which for centuries has been at the crossroad of demographic movements \u2013 as an ideal example of what kind of socio-cultural transformations can be consequence of population mobility in every society and context. The course will draw on the lessons from the various theories of migration to analyze the way in which Italy's human landscape has been affected by migratory flows and the social, cultural, political impacts these in- and out-flows have originated in the course of history. It will first provide an overview of the state of the art in the field of international migration theories, with a view to clarify any conceptual distinctions between the terms migration, immigration, mobility, diasporas, etc. Then, we will explore some key pathways that will form the focus of the transformations: a) the arts \u2013 literary and visual; b) institutions and laws \u2013 juridical concerns in controlling flows and identifying status and memberships; c) familial/societal structures; d) entrepreneurship and economic culture. Finally, the course will discuss to what extent and in what manner population movements have been forging states and societies and, through the Italian case, will reflect upon the role of mobility as a key dynamic in globalization. The course is addressed to those students with basic knowledge of Italian migration history and/or interest in migration studies, who intend to enhance their knowledge both of international migration theory and the history of Italian global migrations. The main aim of the course is to provide the students with effective tools to develop critical thinking on human mobility.              HIST-GA.2022 MA Proseminar     Introduction to the theoretical and methodological components involved in the research process. Considers historiographical issues; develops an understanding of the archival and library environments, focusing on searching strategies and the use of automated techniques; and emphasizes framing research questions. Students complete a research paper with appropriate documentation and bibliography in their area of interest.              HIST-GA.2031 Advanced Archival Description     Provides an understanding of archival descriptive standards and practices. Focuses on the development and use of bibliographic standards to create and exchange data concerning archival records. Particular emphases include the MARC format; the development, implementation, and evaluation of Encoded Archival Description and Encoded Archival Context; content management systems; digital encoding standards; and digital library development.               HIST-GA.2033 Creating Digital History     Historians who work with the public have a particular need to be confidant with digital tools. The course offers students a hands-on primer in the skills archivist and historians need to create, contribute to, and use web-based historical sites. Students will gain experience digitizing historical materials for preservation and access, creating structured metadata and folksonomies to describe historical objects, conducting online historical research and presenting the results of that research online in the form of blog posts and an online digital exhibit. Projects will center around the history of Greenwich Village and be publicly accessible at htttp://aphdigital.org/GVH. Class discussions will focus on current topics in digital humanities and how they impact the making of digital history sites.               HIST-GA.2122 Empire, Nation, Globalization     Empire and globalization lie at the heart of the spatial turn in academic work during the last several decades. This graduate seminar is designed to enrich student research in various disciplines by exploring empire and globalization as features of modern spatial history. We focus on imperial Britain and the United States and on globalization in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and in most detail, on South Asia. Spatial history begins with the premise that various scalar forms of social space and social power relations are meaningfully connected to one another. Localities weave into regions, continents, and global spaces. Expanding spaces of social power affect everyday life in smaller spaces, right down to New York neighborhoods and mountain hamlets in the Global South. The scale and impact of meaningful spatial interaction pose problems for historical study. Empire and nation do not necessarily form dominant spatial frames. Space is not a stage or container, but rather a permanently ongoing construction project, at all scalar levels. Spatial history entails the study of interactive, changing spaces over time, configured by social power of many kinds at many levels of scale. This course is designed to stimulate, support, and inform student research. Before mid-term, we read and discuss assigned texts. Each week, we focus on one theme, which we develop according to student interest. The bibliography at the end of the syllabus is a work-in-progress, providing resources for further work. After mid-term, we focus on student research. Each student should join the class with a research idea to work with all term. This idea can be very vague to begin with; it can derive from other courses or outside projects. Student work for the course includes weekly reading and one-page weekly essays to prepare for class. Students and instructor meet individually at mid-term to develop research ideas and devise readings for the remainder of the term. Ideas for final week readings also appear at the end of the syllabus. Students present their work in class at the end of the term. A research paper is due on the last day of university classes.                 HIST-GA.2150 Fiction, Historiography &amp; the Event     In this seminar we will examine the construction, disappearance, and persistence of \u201ceventfulness\u201din fiction, historiography, and theory. We will consider narrative theory as it pertains to the writing of fictional and historical texts; the historical novel genre; the problem of collective memory; subjectivity and historical agency; historical time and regimes of figurability; the question of \u201cthe recent past.\u201d Case Study: the Paris Commune. Readings to include Lukacs, Ricoeur, Braudel, Bakhtin, Badiou, Ranci\u00e8re, and Trouillot.              HIST-GA.2162 Twentieth Century Cities      Description forthcoming. In the meantime, please contact the professor directly.                  HIST-GA.2163 European Conceptions of the New Man, 1789-1945     This course concerns a fundamental fantasy of modern European thought, art, and culture, the figure of the \u201cNew Man\u201d in the period 1789-1939\u2014a figure that expressed the idea that human society and even human nature could and should be regenerated through political, philosophical, and aesthetic means. The course is intended as an engagement with a series of further questions: problems of modernity, secularism, humanism and time; methodological questions pertinent to intellectual and conceptual history as well as theory, comparative literature, and political theory: it is thus aimed at once at students with historical but also literary and political-science backgrounds. We will read a mixture of primary and secondary sources.              HIST-GA.2168 Methods and Approaches to World History     Description forthcoming. In the meantime, please contact the professor directly.             HIST-GA.2655 Morning in America: Ronald Reagan, the Nuclear Crisis, and the Cold War of the 1980s          This course seeks to place the final decade of the Cold War in historical perspective by focusing on the intertwinement of domestic and foreign policy during the Reagan administration. It explores the emergence of the neoconservative movement, the \u201cReagan revolution,\u201d the effects of \u201cReaganomics\u201d and the military buildup, and the ascent of Evangelical Christianity as a political factor. It also retraces the debates surrounding the role of government, social responsibility, the welfare state and public health care system, shifting value systems, and technological innovation, as well as their representations in society and popular culture. Merging an \u201cestablishment\u201d perspective with an analysis of protest cultures, the course examines Reagan\u2019s foreign policy of \u201cpeace through strength\u201d with regard to the Soviet Union from a global perspective, analyzing the nuclear threat and the renewed arms race, his policies toward Europe and Central America, Iran-Contra, the question of human rights in East-West diplomacy, and the controversy, widespread opposition, and grassroots activism these issues triggered both at home and abroad. Readings include the most recent and influential scholarship on this period as well as a variety of primary sources.             HIST-GA.2707 The Agrarian Question in History     This course will explore the emergence of what was called the \u201cAgrarian Question\u201d in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as that question was related to the emergence of industrialization and the question of value, problems of domestic and global revolution, and the issues of modernization and development in Europe and the non-Western world. We will trace the evolution of the question from its physiocratic core, through its articulation in Smith, Marx, the Soviet Union, Peru, and into the later twentieth century as part of the 'peasant problem.' The last part of the semester will be devoted to studying how this question has re-emerged in today\u2019s China, as a problem of development, where the peasantry persists. The aim of the class is to familiarize students with some of the basic philosophical and historical texts surrounding problems of development and culture, as they pertain to the agrarian question in China and elsewhere and to assist students in analyzing contemporary problems through a longer historical perspective. A lot of reading and a research paper at the end are basic requirements. Students from all geographical specializations welcome; MA students should write for permission to register.              HIST-GA.2901 Captivity, Displacement, and Migration     This course explores questions of voluntary and involuntary movement across the greater Ottoman and Mediterranean worlds. The emphasis is on the early modern period, especially the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, heyday of corsairs, renegades, captives, and converts. (Participants interested in other periods may write final papers accordingly.) The Ottoman empire, with its particular brand of imperial slavery and its forms of economic and household slavery, is a principal, although not exclusive, focus of the course; the \u201cGrand Turk\u201d looms large even when not a direct protagonist of events. The Eurasian and Mediterranean frontiers of the empire and the peoples who crossed them are emphasized. The majority of the readings are recent monographs; we will also read contemporary narratives. Occasional guest speakers will share their expertise in the themes of the course.            HIST-GA.3013 Research in Archives and Public History     This course is an independent study within the Archives and Public History Program.              HIST-GA.3021 Research in History     This course is an independent study.              HIST-GA.3022 Readings in History     This course is an independent study.              HIST-GA.3213 Eastern Europe Workshop     This 2-credit course involves discussion of selected readings concerning Eastern Europe, discussion of graduate student papers and current research concerning Eastern Europe, attendance at guest lectures concerning Eastern Europe, and independent research on Eastern Europe guided by the instructor.            HIST-GA.3330 Guantanamo Public Memory Project at NYU     This class will bring together Museum Studies, Public History and CLACS students into a nationwide collaboration facilitated by the Guantanamo Public Memory Project. The class will seek to trace the complex history of Guantanomo Bay via the project\u2019s collation of oral history, documentary and photographic, and material culture pertaining to the facility. This history will be framed within a broader set of questions about the politics of archives, the ethics of historical narratives, the techniques and technologies that make history present for the public and the constitution of public consciousness via engagement with images, text and testimony. The class will coordinate, create and curate an exhibition that will draw content from 8 similar classes held in graduate programs across the country (the exhibition itself will travel subsequently to each of the venues). The exhibition will be held at NYU in the Kimmel Windows gallery space \u2013 a 24 hour accessible series of vitrines on the intersection of West 3 rd street and LaGuardia Place. NYU students will curate this exhibition, create digital and other content and coordinate a large international symposium to be held at the exhibition\u2019s opening.              HIST-GA.3603 Approaches to Historical Research and Writing     This course is designed to introduce students to some of the basic methodological and interpretive issues involved in historical research. Based around a core set of readings, the course covers important books and articles that explicitly deal with questions of method, as well as examples of certain methodologies or schools of historiography in action. The goal of this course is to help the student produce a research paper that is of potentially publishable quality and to reveal that the student is capable of doing graduate level research and writing.              HIST-GA.3701 Creation of the Constitution     The course begins with readings setting forth the intellectual and experiential background of the framing, including common law and natural rights theory, republicanism, economic &amp; political scientific ideas, and colonial and post-Independence experience. We then study large parts of the debates at the Constitutional Convention, primarily using Madison's Notes. Next come the ratification debates, including readings from antifederalist writers, about half of The Federalist, and overviews of the Virginia and New York ratification conventions. We conclude with the addition of the Bill of Rights. Classes consist of a combination of lecture and extensive participation by students.              HIST-GA.3704 Legal History Colloquium     This course, taught by faculty members of the School of Law, is designed for students planning academic careers, in particular, as legal historians. Students who take the course will be expected to work on a major research paper intended for publication. Specific topics discussed during the semester are determined by the interests of those participating in the colloquium. 2 credits. Consent of instructors is required to register.              HIST-GA.3803 Atlantic History Workshop     This yearlong course overlaps with the Atlantic History Workshop colloquium, which meets regularly in the Department of History throughout the academic year.

HIST-GA.1209 19th Century France: France and its Empire 1750-1800s    France and Its Empire, 1750-1880s focuses on the revolutionary period of modern France. This was a tumultuous and creative time, a time of revolution and reaction, republics and monarchies, liberalism and centralized power. We will study this period in three principal ways: by learning about the various regimes, politics, ideologies, and social patterns that marked the era; by reading documents written during this time and texts composed by some of its principal figures; and by analyzing selected works of present-day historical scholarship that help us understand modern France.         As we build this understanding, our thinking will be guided by the following questions: Why was it so difficult during the century following the French Revolution for France to develop a stable political regime? Why, in this connection, did France irrupt into revolution in response to the problems it faced? And to what extent did the French Revolution define the nature and meaning of the period that followed it? Finally, what was the role of France\u2019s empire, and how did colonialism square with the effort to build a stable republican regime?        The French Revolution is fundamental not just to French history but to world history. For this reason, we will devote considerable attention to the origins and meaning of this event. We will also consider the subsequent revolutions of the nineteenth century revolutions and examine the extent to which France became a modern society in the second half of the nineteenth century.

HIST-GA.1416 History of Modern Ireland I     Early-modern Irish history is an epic tale of conflict, subjugation, and the struggle for national identity. In the roughly two and a half centuries covered by this course, Ireland was transformed from a mysterious and remote island on the periphery of Europe to a quasi-autonomous state fully caught up in the sweeping economic, political, and social transformations that defined the late eighteenth century. Among the topics covered in History I are the Tudor conquest and colonization; Gaelic pushback; Ireland under the Stuarts; the Williamite War and formation of the Protestant Ascendancy; the emergence of Irish nationalism; Ireland and the Enlightenment; 18th-century political, economic, and societal transformations; and Ireland in the Age of Revolutions. The struggles and frustrations of this period define the agenda for Ireland\u2019s tumultuous passage through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.             HIST-GA.1421 Debates in Modern Irish History     This course seeks to analyze a selection of the intense debates in Ireland itself and abroad, especially in Britain and the USA, that characterize modern Irish history, concentrating on topics that transcend the specific Irish experience to raise issues of wider human import. It is equally a study of events and of their interpretation from various contested perspectives, and thus requires intense engagement with the historiography, and with the study of history as a mode of thought. The topics to be explored include the issues of Conquest, Collaboration, Assimilation and Resistance, viewed through the prism of Ireland and the British Empire, as reflected in a number of major topics, including: The Act of Union; The Great Irish Famine; Irish Diaspora; Issues of Irish Identity (as seen through Irish and British eyes via historical movements and events); the ethno-religious conflict in Northern Ireland since 1968; Ireland and Globalization.              HIST-GA.1441 History and Historiography of Irish America     The Irish are one of the most significant ethnic groups to ever migrate from Europe to the United States. Their impact has been disproportional to their numbers but this only partially explains our contemporary understanding of \u201cIrish America.\u201d This seminar will explore how the history of Irish immigrants and their descendants in the United States has been written over the past century and a half. Students will evaluate books and documentary films that have been influential in constructing the narrative of the Irish in America, in addition to article literature. The goal is to learn how to separate historical content from historiography and to see how both can influence popular perceptions of an ethnic people.              HIST-GA.1521 Medieval Marriage     This course will explore the practical experience of marriage in the Middle Ages. We will be looking at the lay experience of the stages of married life (from courting and wedding to annulment and death) in all its gendered aspects. For each of the thematic sessions we will explore as much as possible the experience across the whole social range from aristocracy to peasants. Although our focus will be on the Christian Middle Ages of western Europe we will devote ample space to comparative aspects in Islamic and Jewish culture especially for the Mediterranean area. Thematic sessions will centre on exogamy (intermarriage) in mixed faith and ethnic circumstances, polygamy and concubinage, remarriage and step family relationships, male power and female obedience and the memorialisation of married life. We will also explore alternative forms of cohabitation in a sexual or celibate manner. Wherever possible special attention will be paid to the material culture of marriage, such as the domestic arrangement in the houses, living and sleeping quarters and moveable possessions.              HIST-GA.1562 Lit of the Field: Africa     This course introduces students to the major themes, scholarly approaches, and sources for African history.              HIST-GA.1600 Literature of the Field: US to 1877     A reading course covering the earlier period of American history that introduces students to the major themes, interpretations, and methods of inquiry. It is intended to provide a broad command of the field.              HIST-GA.1646 Materializing in the Middle Ages     The theme of the seminar, materiality, is concerned with the tangible stuff of medieval lives, with those materials: animal parts, vegetable fibers, metal, stones, clay, wood, that were used and processed into finished objects: comestibles, clothing, homes and monuments, artifacts and ornaments, images and the media of written and visual communication. As they emerged from raw materials, things affected social relations and cultural perception, enabling action and provoking reaction. We will consider, for example, the effects of pageantry, with its elaborate display of culinary, heraldic, and sartorial splendor, in asserting and maintaining chivalric claims to dominance. We will examine recent archeological findings to understand the ways that, through accessories to their dress, peasants resisted and re-fashioned the identities imposed upon them by medieval elites. Objects, thus, shaped history, yet historians tend to write history based upon texts. Avoiding such an exclusive dependency requires methodological reflection. Stimulated by the work of social scientists such as Jane Bennett, Alfred Gell, Tim Ingold, Bruno Latour, and Bjrnar Olsen, lively debates are currently taking place about the theory, goals, and relevance of material culture studies, and we will develop our own perspectives on the issues at stake. Assessing the participation, meaning, and agency of things in pre-modern lives forces to question boundaries and to put them in a newer historical perspective: the relationships between humans and animals (and nature), between humans and technology, body and soul, images and memory, the animate and the inanimate. Our exploration of the connections between human and non-human environments will consider the appropriation of animal skins in the production of writing; the extension of human personhood via the use of animal power, tools, weapons, images, and memory aids; human involvement with a living landscape of holy trees, sacred groves and springs, and powerful stars; attitudes toward idols and automata; the perception of art as vibrant matter. Though modern theory inspires historians and art historians to seek agency in a network of social and material relationships, medieval intellectuals were more cautious in their belief in the power of matter. In fact, for many, the materiality of the human body was suspicious, as was knowledge that depended upon the mediation of the senses. Such \u2018carnal\u2019 knowledge was ascribed to minorities (Jews) and alleged dissenters (magi, witches). Materiality in the Middle Ages was a philosophical topic fraught with ambivalence, imbued with a potential for violence.              HIST-GA.1750 Intro to Public History     Reviews the history of public history, focusing on historians\u2019 relationships, dialogues, and collaborations with public audiences. Considers issues involving memory, identity, heritage, commemoration, historic preservation, history museums, historic sites, oral history, and digital history. Final project involves a collaborative endeavor with a local public history institution.               HIST-GA.1763 Approaches to History of Women and Gender     This course is intended as an introduction to some of the central methodological and interpretive issues involved in the historical study of women and gender. We consider the development of women\u2019s history as a field from the 1960s, the historiographies that have shaped women\u2019s history (and been influenced by it), the introduction of gender as an analytical category, the interpretive models that have structured writing about women and gender in the past, and the particular challenges involved in researching subjects who have often left little trace in the historic record. This is not a nation-based survey of women\u2019s history. Instead, our approach is comparative. We will read works that have had a significant impact on the development of the field, works that model particular methodological or interpretive approaches, and works by faculty at NYU. We will also consider contemporary reflections on the state of the field, both in the US and internationally .               HIST-GA.1773 Society &amp; Culture: 20th Century America     This is a graduate level research seminar on the social and cultural history of the United States in the twentieth-century. The central project of the course will be each student\u2019s development of an extended, article-length essay based on original research. Considerable class time will be dedicated to preliminary discussions of each research problematic and its relevant historiographies. Research takes time, as does writing and re-writing; papers are NOT written in one sitting or in a single draft. Accordingly, students will be required to develop their research in the first weeks, even as readings and discussion proceed and present finished drafts in class that will be revised for final submission.        Although the seminar is not be readings course or colloquium, the first half of the semester will include readings to introduce some theoretical tools and writing strategies. Introductory readings and wider reading around the relevant historiographies that the various students\u2019 research problematic engages, and shared reading of the research essays of others will also expose students to a broad a range of subjects in the literature in social and cultural history. The subject is cast broadly to allow for diverse student research interests, but will be limited to the long 20th century (from ca. 1890 to the present).              HIST-GA.1782 African American History     Broad exposure to African American history. Begins with a historiographical introduction, describing the growth and development of the field, and moves to a major theme and period treatment ranging from ancient Africa to the civil rights movement. Provides an understanding of the field and a foundation for specialized course work and research.              HIST-GA.1981 Migration History and Theory: The Italian Case as Litmus Test     The course begins with the assumption that mobility is the norm in human history and it will focus on the case of Italy \u2013 a geographically well-defined peninsula, which for centuries has been at the crossroad of demographic movements \u2013 as an ideal example of what kind of socio-cultural transformations can be consequence of population mobility in every society and context. The course will draw on the lessons from the various theories of migration to analyze the way in which Italy's human landscape has been affected by migratory flows and the social, cultural, political impacts these in- and out-flows have originated in the course of history. It will first provide an overview of the state of the art in the field of international migration theories, with a view to clarify any conceptual distinctions between the terms migration, immigration, mobility, diasporas, etc. Then, we will explore some key pathways that will form the focus of the transformations: a) the arts \u2013 literary and visual; b) institutions and laws \u2013 juridical concerns in controlling flows and identifying status and memberships; c) familial/societal structures; d) entrepreneurship and economic culture. Finally, the course will discuss to what extent and in what manner population movements have been forging states and societies and, through the Italian case, will reflect upon the role of mobility as a key dynamic in globalization. The course is addressed to those students with basic knowledge of Italian migration history and/or interest in migration studies, who intend to enhance their knowledge both of international migration theory and the history of Italian global migrations. The main aim of the course is to provide the students with effective tools to develop critical thinking on human mobility.              HIST-GA.2022 MA Proseminar     Introduction to the theoretical and methodological components involved in the research process. Considers historiographical issues; develops an understanding of the archival and library environments, focusing on searching strategies and the use of automated techniques; and emphasizes framing research questions. Students complete a research paper with appropriate documentation and bibliography in their area of interest.              HIST-GA.2031 Advanced Archival Description     Provides an understanding of archival descriptive standards and practices. Focuses on the development and use of bibliographic standards to create and exchange data concerning archival records. Particular emphases include the MARC format; the development, implementation, and evaluation of Encoded Archival Description and Encoded Archival Context; content management systems; digital encoding standards; and digital library development.               HIST-GA.2033 Creating Digital History     Historians who work with the public have a particular need to be confidant with digital tools. The course offers students a hands-on primer in the skills archivist and historians need to create, contribute to, and use web-based historical sites. Students will gain experience digitizing historical materials for preservation and access, creating structured metadata and folksonomies to describe historical objects, conducting online historical research and presenting the results of that research online in the form of blog posts and an online digital exhibit. Projects will center around the history of Greenwich Village and be publicly accessible at htttp://aphdigital.org/GVH. Class discussions will focus on current topics in digital humanities and how they impact the making of digital history sites.               HIST-GA.2122 Empire, Nation, Globalization     Empire and globalization lie at the heart of the spatial turn in academic work during the last several decades. This graduate seminar is designed to enrich student research in various disciplines by exploring empire and globalization as features of modern spatial history. We focus on imperial Britain and the United States and on globalization in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and in most detail, on South Asia. Spatial history begins with the premise that various scalar forms of social space and social power relations are meaningfully connected to one another. Localities weave into regions, continents, and global spaces. Expanding spaces of social power affect everyday life in smaller spaces, right down to New York neighborhoods and mountain hamlets in the Global South. The scale and impact of meaningful spatial interaction pose problems for historical study. Empire and nation do not necessarily form dominant spatial frames. Space is not a stage or container, but rather a permanently ongoing construction project, at all scalar levels. Spatial history entails the study of interactive, changing spaces over time, configured by social power of many kinds at many levels of scale. This course is designed to stimulate, support, and inform student research. Before mid-term, we read and discuss assigned texts. Each week, we focus on one theme, which we develop according to student interest. The bibliography at the end of the syllabus is a work-in-progress, providing resources for further work. After mid-term, we focus on student research. Each student should join the class with a research idea to work with all term. This idea can be very vague to begin with; it can derive from other courses or outside projects. Student work for the course includes weekly reading and one-page weekly essays to prepare for class. Students and instructor meet individually at mid-term to develop research ideas and devise readings for the remainder of the term. Ideas for final week readings also appear at the end of the syllabus. Students present their work in class at the end of the term. A research paper is due on the last day of university classes.                 HIST-GA.2150 Fiction, Historiography &amp; the Event     In this seminar we will examine the construction, disappearance, and persistence of \u201ceventfulness\u201din fiction, historiography, and theory. We will consider narrative theory as it pertains to the writing of fictional and historical texts; the historical novel genre; the problem of collective memory; subjectivity and historical agency; historical time and regimes of figurability; the question of \u201cthe recent past.\u201d Case Study: the Paris Commune. Readings to include Lukacs, Ricoeur, Braudel, Bakhtin, Badiou, Ranci\u00e8re, and Trouillot.              HIST-GA.2162 Twentieth Century Cities      Description forthcoming. In the meantime, please contact the professor directly.                  HIST-GA.2163 European Conceptions of the New Man, 1789-1945     This course concerns a fundamental fantasy of modern European thought, art, and culture, the figure of the \u201cNew Man\u201d in the period 1789-1939\u2014a figure that expressed the idea that human society and even human nature could and should be regenerated through political, philosophical, and aesthetic means. The course is intended as an engagement with a series of further questions: problems of modernity, secularism, humanism and time; methodological questions pertinent to intellectual and conceptual history as well as theory, comparative literature, and political theory: it is thus aimed at once at students with historical but also literary and political-science backgrounds. We will read a mixture of primary and secondary sources.              HIST-GA.2168 Methods and Approaches to World History     Description forthcoming. In the meantime, please contact the professor directly.             HIST-GA.2655 Morning in America: Ronald Reagan, the Nuclear Crisis, and the Cold War of the 1980s          This course seeks to place the final decade of the Cold War in historical perspective by focusing on the intertwinement of domestic and foreign policy during the Reagan administration. It explores the emergence of the neoconservative movement, the \u201cReagan revolution,\u201d the effects of \u201cReaganomics\u201d and the military buildup, and the ascent of Evangelical Christianity as a political factor. It also retraces the debates surrounding the role of government, social responsibility, the welfare state and public health care system, shifting value systems, and technological innovation, as well as their representations in society and popular culture. Merging an \u201cestablishment\u201d perspective with an analysis of protest cultures, the course examines Reagan\u2019s foreign policy of \u201cpeace through strength\u201d with regard to the Soviet Union from a global perspective, analyzing the nuclear threat and the renewed arms race, his policies toward Europe and Central America, Iran-Contra, the question of human rights in East-West diplomacy, and the controversy, widespread opposition, and grassroots activism these issues triggered both at home and abroad. Readings include the most recent and influential scholarship on this period as well as a variety of primary sources.             HIST-GA.2707 The Agrarian Question in History     This course will explore the emergence of what was called the \u201cAgrarian Question\u201d in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as that question was related to the emergence of industrialization and the question of value, problems of domestic and global revolution, and the issues of modernization and development in Europe and the non-Western world. We will trace the evolution of the question from its physiocratic core, through its articulation in Smith, Marx, the Soviet Union, Peru, and into the later twentieth century as part of the 'peasant problem.' The last part of the semester will be devoted to studying how this question has re-emerged in today\u2019s China, as a problem of development, where the peasantry persists. The aim of the class is to familiarize students with some of the basic philosophical and historical texts surrounding problems of development and culture, as they pertain to the agrarian question in China and elsewhere and to assist students in analyzing contemporary problems through a longer historical perspective. A lot of reading and a research paper at the end are basic requirements. Students from all geographical specializations welcome; MA students should write for permission to register.              HIST-GA.2901 Captivity, Displacement, and Migration     This course explores questions of voluntary and involuntary movement across the greater Ottoman and Mediterranean worlds. The emphasis is on the early modern period, especially the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, heyday of corsairs, renegades, captives, and converts. (Participants interested in other periods may write final papers accordingly.) The Ottoman empire, with its particular brand of imperial slavery and its forms of economic and household slavery, is a principal, although not exclusive, focus of the course; the \u201cGrand Turk\u201d looms large even when not a direct protagonist of events. The Eurasian and Mediterranean frontiers of the empire and the peoples who crossed them are emphasized. The majority of the readings are recent monographs; we will also read contemporary narratives. Occasional guest speakers will share their expertise in the themes of the course.            HIST-GA.3013 Research in Archives and Public History     This course is an independent study within the Archives and Public History Program.              HIST-GA.3021 Research in History     This course is an independent study.              HIST-GA.3022 Readings in History     This course is an independent study.              HIST-GA.3213 Eastern Europe Workshop     This 2-credit course involves discussion of selected readings concerning Eastern Europe, discussion of graduate student papers and current research concerning Eastern Europe, attendance at guest lectures concerning Eastern Europe, and independent research on Eastern Europe guided by the instructor.            HIST-GA.3330 Guantanamo Public Memory Project at NYU     This class will bring together Museum Studies, Public History and CLACS students into a nationwide collaboration facilitated by the Guantanamo Public Memory Project. The class will seek to trace the complex history of Guantanomo Bay via the project\u2019s collation of oral history, documentary and photographic, and material culture pertaining to the facility. This history will be framed within a broader set of questions about the politics of archives, the ethics of historical narratives, the techniques and technologies that make history present for the public and the constitution of public consciousness via engagement with images, text and testimony. The class will coordinate, create and curate an exhibition that will draw content from 8 similar classes held in graduate programs across the country (the exhibition itself will travel subsequently to each of the venues). The exhibition will be held at NYU in the Kimmel Windows gallery space \u2013 a 24 hour accessible series of vitrines on the intersection of West 3 rd street and LaGuardia Place. NYU students will curate this exhibition, create digital and other content and coordinate a large international symposium to be held at the exhibition\u2019s opening.              HIST-GA.3603 Approaches to Historical Research and Writing     This course is designed to introduce students to some of the basic methodological and interpretive issues involved in historical research. Based around a core set of readings, the course covers important books and articles that explicitly deal with questions of method, as well as examples of certain methodologies or schools of historiography in action. The goal of this course is to help the student produce a research paper that is of potentially publishable quality and to reveal that the student is capable of doing graduate level research and writing.              HIST-GA.3701 Creation of the Constitution     The course begins with readings setting forth the intellectual and experiential background of the framing, including common law and natural rights theory, republicanism, economic &amp; political scientific ideas, and colonial and post-Independence experience. We then study large parts of the debates at the Constitutional Convention, primarily using Madison's Notes. Next come the ratification debates, including readings from antifederalist writers, about half of The Federalist, and overviews of the Virginia and New York ratification conventions. We conclude with the addition of the Bill of Rights. Classes consist of a combination of lecture and extensive participation by students.              HIST-GA.3704 Legal History Colloquium     This course, taught by faculty members of the School of Law, is designed for students planning academic careers, in particular, as legal historians. Students who take the course will be expected to work on a major research paper intended for publication. Specific topics discussed during the semester are determined by the interests of those participating in the colloquium. 2 credits. Consent of instructors is required to register.              HIST-GA.3803 Atlantic History Workshop     This yearlong course overlaps with the Atlantic History Workshop colloquium, which meets regularly in the Department of History throughout the academic year. At the colloquium, participants discuss pre-circulated works-in-progress presented by visiting scholars or members of the colloquium. Students enrolled in this course attend every meeting of the colloquium and undertake additional activities assigned by the instructor during the regular class meetings.            HIST-GA.3901 The Mediterranean in Historical Perspective        Trains students in the history of the Mediterranean and provides them with insights into the theories and interpretations of the Mediterranean. Analyzes the ways in which the Mediterranean has been identified not only as a geographical region, but also as a cultural, political, and social one. Examines the reshaping of cultural, political, and social borders across the Mediterranean.

Richard Olivier, 1989), presented by Brent Edwards (Columbia University)   Presented by the Colloquium for Unpopular Culture     \u201cI\u2019m sad because I\u2019m schizophrenic, torn between many passions, desires and lovers. I\u2019m sad because I know the bottom line. I know what is going to happen to this world.\u201d     \u201cI\u2019m an orphan. And Ostend? That\u2019s my orphanage.\u201d     By 1981 Marvin Gaye was pretty much washed up. Heavily in debt, on the run from the I.R.S., in the middle of protracted divorces from Motown and from his wife, overing up mini-mountains of cocaine each day, abusive to his many partners, and, prone to dropping references to Nostradamus and Revelations, increasingly convinced that Apocalypse was imminent. He ended up in Ostend, a Belgian seafront town where, largely ignored by locals (\u201cWhere are you from? Paraguay?\u201d), he gazed at the grey skies, ran across lonely beaches and played darts badly in family cafes. He called it \u201ca beat back in tempo\u201d. It was a time of drift, reflection, expansion. A time of taking stock and recharging. Some kind of analogue to David Bowie\u2019s stay in Berlin at the end of the 1970s. Some kind of interregnum before the international but short-lived success of Sexual Healing and his violent death at the hands of his preacher father in 1984.     TRANSIT OSTEND is a moody, sometimes funny and quietly unforgettable portrait of the troubled singer that has long enjoyed a word-of-mouth reputation among filmmakers (Paul Kelly cited it as an influence on Lawrence Of Belgravia, his documentary about Lawrence from Felt), has inspired a song by the Band of Holy Joy (as well as a long-running comic routine by Reeves and Mortimer), but has rarely been seen.     BRENT EDWARDS, who will present Transit Ostend, is a Professor in the Department of English and Comparative Literature and the Center for Jazz Studies at Columbia University. His books include The Practice of Diaspora (2003), Uptown Conversation: The New Jazz Studies (2004), and the forthcoming Epistrophies: Jazz and the Literary Imagination. His current projects include the restoration of Sweet Willie Rollbar\u2019s Orientation (an experimental film made by Julius Hemphill and members of the Black Artists Group in 1972), and a translation of Michel Leiris\u2019s 1934 classic Phantom Africa.

Burnham (Middlebury College)   Presented by the Medieval Virtual Seminar, a collaboration of the University of Bristol, The University of Oslo, Middlebury College, and New York University. A series of lectures on topics in medieval studies, one hosted by each institution, to take place during the 2014-15 academic year.     In 1329, Limoux N\u00e8gre was burned at the stake as an unrepentant heretic who claimed mystical inspiration for what he called his \"subtlety\" and his \"philosophy.\" The beliefs he professed were unlike any the inquisitors of Carcassonne had ever heard: skeptical and materialist, but also blasphemous, fantastical, and difficult for inquisitors and scholars alike to untangle. In this paper, I will argue that his mystical revelations bloomed on an alchemical substrate and that his most outrageous assertions regarding Jesus's death and resurrection were based on the science of the Pseudo-Llullian Testamentum.

While the observation that this fiction is a project in writing the nation may have grown to be something of a commonplace, what is less generally recognized is its inflection by elite ideologies of rule. I am interested in tracking the anxiety, rivalry, and ambivalence that surround the precariousness of elite authority on the national scene. In successive chapters of the book I seek out the internal contradictions and external threats that destabilize the status and assumptions of this historical ruling class. This paper identifies the connections, affective and historical, that a post-Independence-born generation of authors and their protagonists variously develop with their nationalist fathers in the process of inheriting the nation.      Rajeswari Sunder Rajan is Global Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at New York University, and has taught earlier at the universities of Delhi and Oxford. She works in the areas of postcolonial studies, feminist theory, gender, law, and religion in South Asia, British Victorian literature and the Anglophone novel in India.

Reception to follow   RSVP by February 13, 2015.   Location: Hemmerdinger Hall, Silver Center of Arts and Science            ,               Legacy in the Dust: The Four Aces Story, presented by Vivien Goldman   Few clubs in Britain can claim to have a history as illustrious as The Four Aces in Dalston, north-east London. Set up by Jamaican-born Newton Dunbar in 1967 to play blue beat, rocksteady and ska, it soon became a mecca not just for the capital's growing Caribbean population but for all Londoners bored of the sifted, soulless sounds they were hearing on mainstream radio. The club was a place to dance, but also a community centre, a para-academic space, a retreat from the increasingly militarised, stop-and-frisk streetscapes outside. Musicians such as Bob Marley, Joe Strummer, Stevie Wonder and even Bob Dylan made a beeline there. It played a pivotal role in the development of lover's rock, acid house, jungle and happy hardcore. But it was hated by local politicians and property speculators who demonised it as a gangster hang-out and Yardie-run drug hole before colluding to money-maim it into a block of luxury apartments. LEGACY IN THE DUST unearths rare archival material, talks to pioneering musicians such as Bunny Lee and Dennis Bovell, and tells - with love and with sadness - the rich history of a remarkable club.     LEGACY IN THE DUST will be presented by writer, broadcaster and post-punk musician VIVIEN GOLDMAN who spent many halcyon nights at The Four Aces. As well as recording a number of classic records, both solo and in Chantage, she has written for the likes of The Flying Lizards, Massive Attack and Ryuichi Sakamoto. She is an Adjunct Professor at NYU's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Tisch School of the Arts where she teaches punk, Fela Kuti and reggae. Her five books include two on Bob Marley, most recently The Book of Exodus: The Making & Meaning of Marley's Album of the Century (Three Rivers Press). A Londoner, she now resides in Jackson Heights, Queens.     LEGACY IN THE DUST is the first screening in History Is Made At Night , an occasional series that gets its name from Neil Gordon-Orr's blog devoted to the politics of dancing and musicking.

Henry V and the Use of Languages,\u201d Malcolm Vale (Emeritus Research Fellow of History, St. John\u2019s College)   The reign of Henry V (1413-1422) was not only concerned with military victories. It also witnessed the emergence of the English language as an idiom and medium of government, politics and administration. For the first time since the Anglo-Saxon era, English was formally accepted as a language in which the ruler addressed his correspondents, officers and subjects. His promotion of English was part of an increasing \u2018personalisation\u2019 of kingship, and, paradoxically, its furtherance owed something to the continental ambitions of the English crown. We hear much about the rise of an English literary vernacular; less about its everyday use as a language of government, administration and business. The lecture will try to redress the balance.

Location: Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,           Reading for Mood: A Lecture by Jonathan Flatley (Wayne State University, Visiting Professor NYU)   Presented by the Department of Performance Studies Lecture Series     This lecture examines the usefulness of mood as a critical term at the current moment. Beginning with a consideration of the distinct places of affect in aesthetic theory and in critical reading practices, it makes a case for Martin Heidegger\u2019s understanding of Stimmung (which could also be translated as attunement) as a critical concept that helps us to read for the historicity and potentially political effects of aesthetic practices. To give an example of \u201creading for mood,\u201d I turn to the film Finally Got the News (1970), which the League of Revolutionary Black Workers made in collaboration with the Newsreel collective. I read this film as an attempt by the League to engage in the project of sustaining the revolutionary mood that had been awakened by the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement in 1968: how can such a mood, once awakened, be maintained? How does a politically active collective sustain and refresh itself?     The Performance Studies Lecture Series is a series of evening events featuring preeminent scholars and practitioners in the fields of art and performance. The events are presented on weekday evenings in the department's studio space, and are designed to create an informal and intimate setting for intellectual exchange among artists, students and scholars.

Location: Room 222, 19 University Place            , -           \"Modernity, world literature, and early modernisms in India,\" Supriya Chaudhuri (Jadavpur University)   Professor Chaudhuri\u2019s paper will examine the contested notion of world literature in the context of Bengali and other Indian modernisms in early twentieth century India. It has been argued that the idea of a world literature is tied in with the global reach of capital and its production of what Fredric Jameson calls a \u2018singular modernity\u2019 as well as what Franco Moretti describes as \u2018the world literary system\u2019. On such a view modernist literary communities in Calcutta or Buenos Aires are peripheral to the core modernist projects developed in Europe and America. This paper will posit instead the existence of a set of distributed, often resistant centers, whose members experience, as immediately as their European counterparts, the trauma, violence, and \u2018loss of history\u2019 that the process of modernization involves, and who struggle for a form of aesthetic recourse. How do early Indian modernisms negotiate with the world and with a notion of world literature? To understand this, Professor Chaudhuri will examine Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s essays on \u2018World Literature\u2019 (1907) and \u2018Modern Poetry\u2019 (1931) and his differences with the modernists; at rifts within early modernist groups; and at political radicalism and cosmopolitan friendships in the 1930s.   Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            , -               MARC Distinguished Lecture Series: \u201cTelling Tales: Piero di Cosimo, Renaissance Painter of Faith and Fantasy,\u201d Dennis Geronimus (NYU Art History)   Occasioned by the first-ever museum exhibition of Piero di Cosimo (1462-1522) painting career, now on view at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, this talk will introduce us to the most spellbinding storyteller of Renaissance Florence. A contemporary of Botticelli and Leonardo, Piero was esteemed in his day as a creative spirit of rare imagination, his visual poems rivaling the verses of the ancient poets whose myths and allegories he set out to transform in a wonderfully strange language all his own.     As his impressive list of patrons attests, Piero used his creative license to great advantage, devising elaborate fables the meanings of which continue to beguile us. But fantasy was not Piero\u2019s only domain. Equally compelling was his versatility as a master of many different styles, moods and subjects, sacred and profane. The common thread throughout is Piero\u2019s appeal to magical thinking.   Location: Silver, Room 300            ,               Can\u00edcula: Snapshots of a Girlhood in La Frontera, a Reading by Norma Elia Cant\u00fa   Chicana writer, folklorist, professor, and activist Norma Cant\u00fa will be reading and discussing excerpts from her book Can\u00edcula , winner of the 1995 Premio Azl\u00e5an Literary Prize, as well as from her works of poetry and her newly edited book on Chilean artist Liliana Wilson entitled Ofrenda: Liliana Wilson\u2019s Art of Dissidence and Dreams (Texas A&M University Press, 2014).

Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,               Surrounding One\u2019s Self with the Beauty of Life: Historicizing Nineteenth-Century Latina/o Writing   What distinguishes literature from other forms of writing? For example, Latina/o literary historians have uncovered only a handful of novels written by U.S. Latinas/os in the nineteenth century. And yet, the nineteenth-century Latina/o archive is chock-full of writing, both in manuscript-form and printed documents. How can these other documents contribute to our understanding of Latina/o literary history, and how might they force us to get at the root of what literature is supposed to offer? In 1850s San Antonio, Texas, Florencia Leal, a teenager attending the first girls\u2019 school, kept a beautiful journal where she transcribed letters to friends, wrote poems, copied lessons from school, and included sketches. My talk will address these questions by paying close attention to her journal, the earliest document written by a Texas-Mexican woman that I have been able to find in the course of fifteen years of archival research.     Ra\u00fal Coronado is an Associate Professor of Ethnic Studies at UC Berkeley. Prior to Berkeley, Coronado was an associate professor in the English Department at the University of Chicago. Coronado's research focuses on Latina/o literary and intellectual history, from the colonial period to the 1940s. His first book A World Not to Come: A History of Latino Writing and Print Culture (Harvard 2013) won numerous awards, including the Modern Language Association Prize for a First Book and the Sixteenth Annual Susanne M. Glasscock Humanities Book Prize for Interdisciplinary Scholarship. This event is free and open to the public.   Location: 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor            ,               Medieval Forum Two-Part Event: \"Containing Texts: Literature in One, Two, and Three Dimensions,\" Thomas A. Bredehoft   Tom Bredehoft's talk examines the literary implications of textual materiality, specifically the literary effects and uses of the three-dimensional objects we call books or codexes. In asking whether the shape of the physical container affects or constrains the shapes of the texts it contains, Bredehoft opens the door for a new understanding of textual dimensionality, including a clarification of whether verse is to be understood as one-dimensional or two. Consider examples ranging from Anglo-Saxon poems to the contemporary comics of Chris Ware, Bredehoft argues that two- and three-dimensional texts give us crucial insight into both the unconscious habits of typographic print textuality and the promises and challenges of digital text.   Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,           Poetry Reading: Theo Dorgan reads from Nine Bright Shiners   Cork-born Theo Dorgan is a novelist, translator, editor, sailor and poet whose most recent collection of poems, Nine Bright Shiners (Dedalus Press, 2014) was an Irish Times notable book of the year. He has also won the O'Shaughnessy Award for Irish Poetry and Listowel Prize for Poetry.     Theo Dorgan will read from Nine Bright Shiners , a sequence of elegies that reflect on early and recent deaths, from the loss of his infant sister to that of a contemporary by suicide. The book is unflinching in facing up to death and the poet\u2019s own mortality, but these dark meditations are framed by, subsumed into, whole-hearted celebrations of love, life, art and voyaging.     A former Director of Poetry Ireland/\u00c9igse \u00c9ireann, Theo has worked extensively as a broadcaster of literary programs on both radio and television. His other poetry collections include The Ordinary House of Love and Rosa Mundi (reprinted together as What This Earth Cost Us ), as well as, in Italian, La Case ai Margini del Mundo . He has edited several volumes.     Introduction by Luke Gibbons of Maynooth University, Ireland, Visiting Professor at NYU for Spring 2015.

Location: TBA            ,               The Presence of the Past: Histories of the 18th-Century Transatlantic Book Trade in the Digital Age (Molly Hardy)   The digitization of early modern texts offers an encounter with temporal dislocation as new and old media meet. The presence of the past in objects that have been retained and remediated is at once foregrounded and elided in the digital moment. With examples from the eighteenth-century transatlantic book trade as represented in library catalogs and content databases, Molly O'Hagan Hardy will examine time's traces in the archives and how such traces can be re-conceived or eclipsed in digital humanities projects, ultimately asking how dueling temporalities define scholarly practices of research on archival materials in the digital age.     Molly Hardy manages the Isaiah Thomas Broadside Ballads digital project, the Database of the Early American Book Trades, and the Digital Antiquarian initiative. She has recently completed a digital edition of A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black People, During the Late Awful Calamity in Philadelphia (1794). She received her in PhD in English from the University of Texas Austin, and her scholarship on archival research has appeared in The New Centennial Review and Book History .

Joyce\u2019s stylistic innovations are haunted by memory that slips its moorings in inner life, and circulates through the silences and shadows of a colonial counter-public sphere.     Luke Gibbons is professor of Irish literary and cultural studies at Maynooth University, Ireland, and the author of several books. He is Visiting Professor at NYU for Spring 2015.

But this sort of re-thinking has rarely been retrospective. A \"pre-history\" of postcolonial ideas is evident in the great internationalist movement of Third-Worldism that took place in the wake of decolonization after WWII. In this paper, Professor Srivastava compares postcolonial receptions of Frantz Fanon with earlier, Third-Worldist and anti-colonial receptions in the Italian context, with discussions of his role in influencing Italian psychiatry and renovating European Marxism. By examining 1960s and 1970s Italian editions and translations of his texts, she argues that historicizing this major anti-colonial thinker can lead to a re-reading of Fanon's theoretical body of work and his significance to the field.

The struggle for a comprehensive \u201cpermission to perform,\u201d which serves as a reminder of the disparity in power between the occupier and the occupied, characterizes the relationship between the Palestinian theatre artists and the state of Israel. I define \u201cpermission to perform\u201d as the guaranteed ability to legally, physically, literally, and publicly perform the experience of the oppressed under a systematically oppressive structure. By presenting three stories from the 1960s, 1970s, and the 1980s, I show that the Israeli censors\u2019 performance permit did not necessarily offer Palestinians the ability to perform freely. But in the struggle for such permission, these artists and their supporters created an inspiring model for cultural resistance.     Dr. Al-Saber is a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Theatre at Davidson College. His teaching and scholarship focus on the intersections of cultural production and political conflict. He has taught courses on the cultural representations of the Israel/Palestine conflict and \u201cperforming Arabs\u201d in a postcolonial context.

The goal of this workshop is to introduce necessary tools for the classroom (and beyond) that will aid in the transmission of knowledge to students. Registration deadline: Thursday, April 16 *Note: Space is limited, so please be sure to register early.     The topics covered in this workshop will include the following:     \u2022 Nonverbal Communication: There is no question that communication abilities are key to a good lecture. We will highlight the value and importance of using nonverbal skills to bolster your communication prowess.  Icebreakers: Getting off to a Good Start: First impressions really do count. We will address how to make a good impression on your students, right from the beginning. Learning how to set a tone in the classroom is crucial to your control for the remainder of the semester.     \u2022 Managing Conflict in the Classroom: In any classroom, there are always issues to resolve. We will discuss some of the best ways to manage these situations.     \u2022 Using your Voice for Interest: One of your best assets can be the enthusiasm you have for your discipline. We will discuss how you can project this with your voice alone. We will engage in voice activities that will help you create more interest in the classroom.     \u2022 Incorporating Humor: Even if you are not a naturally funny person, there are still ways to inject appropriate humor into the classroom. We will discuss the possibilities.     \u2022 Improving your Listening Skills: Listening is an important aspect of our communication abilities, and we will discuss how you can be more aware of how to be a better listener.

Continuing this semester's focus on Marxist urban theory, we'll be looking at two essays from Edward Soja's Postmodern Geographies (chapters 3 and 4, attached). The first contains core concepts in Soja's reading of Henri Lefebvre, and frames the subfield of Marxist geography as it emerged in the 1970s. The second comprises Soja's formulation of uneven geographical development via David Harvey and Ernest Mandel. This makes for a good transition from our last session on Harvey and should provide a useful point of entry into Soja's work. And yet it misses much, notably leaving out his clearest postmodern commitments and famous case studies of Los Angeles (chapters 7, 8 and 9), his foray into ontology and critique of Heidegger (chapter 5), as well as his useful tour of developments in the spatial imaginary of critical social theory (chapters 1 and 2). I hope we'll get to briefly discuss these other bits, and if you get the chance, take a look at the last two chapters in particular.   Location: 244 Greene Street, Rm 805           May          ,           Medieval Movie Night: Kingdom of Heaven       Location: Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,           Transported: Imagining colonies with Edward Gibbon Wakefield and the young Charlotte Bront\u00eb   In 1829 in the seclusion of the Parsonage at Howarth in Yorkshire, a twelve-year-old Charlotte Bront\u00eb and her three younger siblings imagined a colony in Africa, a place they called Glass Town. On tiny pieces of paper sewn together into books, they composed an intricate saga of conquest and colonisation by a group of European discoverers. In the same year, the philosophical radical and occasional rake, Edward Gibbon Wakefield imagined a colony in Australia in his newspaper serial, \u2018Letter From Sydney\u2019. Wakefield\u2019s theory of colonisation, \u2018systematic colonisation\u2019, influenced some of the most important thinkers of his day, and shaped British colonial policy throughout the middle decades of the century -- surprisingly, perhaps, given that he wrote the \u2018Letter\u2019 while in Newgate prison, serving a sentence for a sexual crime, and had never been to Australia. Bront\u00eb\u2019s juvenile stories and Wakefield\u2019s text are different in style, scale, and intent, yet they share some intriguing preoccupations and contexts. Taken together they provide some commentary on this important phase of transcontinental migrations of the nineteenth century. In this paper I consider their parallel disquisitions on mobility, transportation (in relation to migration, punishment, and the imagination), individual freedom, and the capture of property and persons.
