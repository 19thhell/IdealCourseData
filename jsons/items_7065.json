The Program in Dramatic Literature, Theater History, and Cinema recognizes the special nature of Drama, in particular its relationship to literary texts as well as to the performing arts, both theater and cinema. Accordingly, the program allows students with a primary interest in Drama to study it intensively and comparatively within the fields of literature, theater history and production, and cinema. The curriculum brings students into a close intellectual engagement with the classical and contemporary texts of Britain, Europe, and America, while also providing opportunities for practical dramatic and theatrical experiences. The program encourages students not only to pursue their interests through production and playwriting classes but also to take advantage of New York's thriving theater scene."}]}]
