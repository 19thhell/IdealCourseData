The Compensation Office must review and approve all requests for any type of salary adjustment. In the rare instance that a salary adjustment is warranted, it must be funded within the Department's or School's pool for adjustments.     Market/Equity Salary Adjustments   A market or equity adjustment is a salary increase that is granted for one of the following reasons:     Market (external equity) adjustments are used to align pay with the external market.   Internal equity adjustments may be used to address salary inequities among individuals who are functioning in like positions that require similar skills, responsibilities and experience.     Career Progression   With Bands, career progression is redefined and no longer considered to be only a move to a \u201chigher grade.\u201d Here are the three types of career progression:     Band-to-Band Promotion: Movement to a different job in a higher band   Within Band Growth: Movement to a different job in the same band   Role Enhancement: Adding significantly more responsibility within the same role     Promotions and Within Band Growth   A promotion is a move to a position in a higher band, whether in the same department (internal promotion) or another department (promotional transfer). It normally involves a salary increase. A promoted employee should be paid equitably compared to an employee with similar skills, experience, and qualifications within the same grade.   Note : The Talent Management Office must review and approve the Affirmative Action Recruitment Report for all hires and promotions into vacant positions before the Human Resources Officer may extend a job offer to the external or internal candidate.   NYU also acknowledges lateral (in-band) development, which includes movement to a different role in the same Band.   Both Band-to-Band Promotion and Within Band Growth involve movement to a different role, with a different set of responsibilities, and a different title. Band-to-Band Promotions and Within Band Growth are job changes that may be accompanied by a Career Progression Increase. The amount of the increase will vary, and will be based on several factors, including the Market Reference Range of the new position relative to that of the old position, the pay levels of others in the new position, and the magnitude of the change.   Generally, increases for Band-to-Band Promotions will be greater than those for Within Band Growth, as movement to a higher band necessarily reflects significantly larger impact and contribution.   Within Band Growth itself can be differentiated by magnitude of change. Of consideration is the size of the new job compared with the old job\u2014in terms of functional scope, organizational scope, P&amp;L or budget responsibility, supervision or required knowledge, skills and abilities.   Movement to a position in a different function is less common and would usually be considered to be a change of greater magnitude than movement to a position within the same function. This is because it affords the organization a greater breadth of skills, while representing a larger challenge, or stretch, to the individual.   Temporary Salary Increases   Administrator and Professional employees may receive salary increases for:     assuming temporary responsibility for a higher level vacancy for an extended period at the specific request of the department head   assuming responsibility for a special project that is clearly outside the scope of the employee\u2019s regular job responsibilities and is a significant additional work assignment     Role Enhancement   In addition to \u201ctraditional\u201d (vertical) band-to-band promotions and lateral (in-band development), NYU wishes to acknowledge, recognize, and encourage development within the same role (with or without a title change), via role enhancement. This tool is intended to help managers recognize and reward employees who achieve significant growth in their contribution and skills. It will help recognize the growth of employees in more ways beyond hierarchical band level advancements or moves to different roles as ways for career progression.   Salary Increase Guidelines   Human Resources Officers should consult with their respective Compensation Consultant for any type of career progression under the banding structure to determine appropriate salary increases.

We have made major strides towards fulfilling this mission: our research, clinical, educational, and community services have expanded and grown in new directions. In the face of increased threats to our security and safety, our work has highlighted the importance of strengthening resilience in all children as a preventive strategy to enhance and protect their psychological well-being.   Although our efforts are making a difference, significant challenges remain. Research shows that over 75 percent of mental health disorders have their roots in the childhood and adolescent years, though fewer than one quarter of children or adolescents needing services receive treatment. Millions of children are never properly diagnosed or treated. In the coming year, we will continue to work for increased awareness of child mental health issues, new knowledge, new treatments, and better care to help give children back their childhood.

The Compensation Office must review and approve all requests for any type of salary adjustment. In the rare instance that a salary adjustment is warranted, it must be funded within the Department's or School's pool for adjustments.     Market/Equity Salary Adjustments   A market or equity adjustment is a salary increase that is granted for one of the following reasons:     Market (external equity) adjustments are used to align pay with the external market.   Internal equity adjustments may be used to address salary inequities among individuals who are functioning in like positions that require similar skills, responsibilities and experience.     Career Progression   With Bands, career progression is redefined and no longer considered to be only a move to a \u201chigher grade.\u201d Here are the three types of career progression:     Band-to-Band Promotion: Movement to a different job in a higher band   Within Band Growth: Movement to a different job in the same band   Role Enhancement: Adding significantly more responsibility within the same role     Promotions and Within Band Growth   A promotion is a move to a position in a higher band, whether in the same department (internal promotion) or another department (promotional transfer). It normally involves a salary increase. A promoted employee should be paid equitably compared to an employee with similar skills, experience, and qualifications within the same grade.   Note : The Talent Management Office must review and approve the Affirmative Action Recruitment Report for all hires and promotions into vacant positions before the Human Resources Officer may extend a job offer to the external or internal candidate.   NYU also acknowledges lateral (in-band) development, which includes movement to a different role in the same Band.   Both Band-to-Band Promotion and Within Band Growth involve movement to a different role, with a different set of responsibilities, and a different title. Band-to-Band Promotions and Within Band Growth are job changes that may be accompanied by a Career Progression Increase. The amount of the increase will vary, and will be based on several factors, including the Market Reference Range of the new position relative to that of the old position, the pay levels of others in the new position, and the magnitude of the change.   Generally, increases for Band-to-Band Promotions will be greater than those for Within Band Growth, as movement to a higher band necessarily reflects significantly larger impact and contribution.   Within Band Growth itself can be differentiated by magnitude of change. Of consideration is the size of the new job compared with the old job\u2014in terms of functional scope, organizational scope, P&amp;L or budget responsibility, supervision or required knowledge, skills and abilities.   Movement to a position in a different function is less common and would usually be considered to be a change of greater magnitude than movement to a position within the same function. This is because it affords the organization a greater breadth of skills, while representing a larger challenge, or stretch, to the individual.   Temporary Salary Increases   Administrator and Professional employees may receive salary increases for:     assuming temporary responsibility for a higher level vacancy for an extended period at the specific request of the department head   assuming responsibility for a special project that is clearly outside the scope of the employee\u2019s regular job responsibilities and is a significant additional work assignment     Role Enhancement   In addition to \u201ctraditional\u201d (vertical) band-to-band promotions and lateral (in-band development), NYU wishes to acknowledge, recognize, and encourage development within the same role (with or without a title change), via role enhancement. This tool is intended to help managers recognize and reward employees who achieve significant growth in their contribution and skills. It will help recognize the growth of employees in more ways beyond hierarchical band level advancements or moves to different roles as ways for career progression.   Salary Increase Guidelines   Human Resources Officers should consult with their respective Compensation Consultant for any type of career progression under the banding structure to determine appropriate salary increases.

We have made major strides towards fulfilling this mission: our research, clinical, educational, and community services have expanded and grown in new directions. In the face of increased threats to our security and safety, our work has highlighted the importance of strengthening resilience in all children as a preventive strategy to enhance and protect their psychological well-being.   Although our efforts are making a difference, significant challenges remain. Research shows that over 75 percent of mental health disorders have their roots in the childhood and adolescent years, though fewer than one quarter of children or adolescents needing services receive treatment. Millions of children are never properly diagnosed or treated. In the coming year, we will continue to work for increased awareness of child mental health issues, new knowledge, new treatments, and better care to help give children back their childhood.
