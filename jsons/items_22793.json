Nearly every day we wake up to something new and unanticipated. This concentration is designed to give students an advanced understanding of the factors shaping IR, and to place these factors in a futures context. What alternate future scenarios can we imagine? What are the forces for change in IR? How are these forces shaping the policies and capabilities of states and nonstate actors? What are the emerging issues that the world will have to face, and how might they be addressed? Courses within this concentration help students improve their ability to anticipate change, and equip them with the analytical tools essential for professional success in a transforming environment.

This concentration introduces students to the new transnational security agenda by combining the study of traditional issues such as war and disarmament with more contemporary issues, including terrorism, organized crime, and human security scourges. These complex and interconnected challenges are as often the domain of aid workers, police officers, and development specialists as they are of soldiers, spies, and diplomats. The concentration provides students with a combination of knowledge and practical skills preparing them to address security issues and risk assessment in the context of the private and NGO sector, as well as government service.

Nearly every day we wake up to something new and unanticipated. This concentration is designed to give students an advanced understanding of the factors shaping IR, and to place these factors in a futures context. What alternate future scenarios can we imagine? What are the forces for change in IR? How are these forces shaping the policies and capabilities of states and nonstate actors? What are the emerging issues that the world will have to face, and how might they be addressed? Courses within this concentration help students improve their ability to anticipate change, and equip them with the analytical tools essential for professional success in a transforming environment.

This concentration introduces students to the new transnational security agenda by combining the study of traditional issues such as war and disarmament with more contemporary issues, including terrorism, organized crime, and human security scourges. These complex and interconnected challenges are as often the domain of aid workers, police officers, and development specialists as they are of soldiers, spies, and diplomats. The concentration provides students with a combination of knowledge and practical skills preparing them to address security issues and risk assessment in the context of the private and NGO sector, as well as government service.

Many organizations now seek individuals who have the capability to utilize both the lens and the skill sets offered by peacebuilding to help develop policies and programs that contribute to more sustainably peaceful societies.     The 15-credit Graduate Certificate in Peacebuilding is designed to meet the needs of both new and mid-career professionals who already operate in the international arena, but who need specific knowledge about the emerging theory and practice of peacebuilding in order to enhance their career opportunities. Students enrolled in the program will have the chance to investigate major theories and practices of international relations, and to examine how the emergence of peacebuilding thought reinforces some common approaches to global affairs, while transforming others.   Students who complete the Graduate Certificate in Peacebuilding will emerge with strengthened skills in: critical thinking about peace and conflict; conflict assessment and analysis; peace and conflict research; mediation; and peacebuilding program development and management.         The admissions criteria for the Graduate Certificate in Peacebuilding and the M.S. in Global Affairs are the same, and individuals who successfully earn the Certificate can apply course credits toward the completion of the M.S. in Global Affairs .
