What benefits, challenges and problems are we faced with because of the impact of technology (computers and Internet) on society?   (Skip past the intro stuff for details on the projects)     Introduction to the unit   Computers and the Internet have facilitated a massive change in how we can live our lives. Together, they have helped us leap into the &quot;digital age&quot;. We live in an age where information is instantly and readily available to more people than ever before.   We are becoming a &quot;society of knowledge workers&quot;. Technology is accelerating a rapid transition from a focus on producing &quot;tangible&quot; artifacts and objects to one focused on creating &quot;digital&quot; products and services.   Although it may be easier to communicate with people today, than perhaps ever before, the amount of digital information and media at our fingertips seems overwhelming at times.   Much of what is &quot;published&quot; as information today may have a short life span and &quot;dissolve into the past&quot;, or we may end up as a future society saddled with an &quot;information glut of non decomposing garbage&quot;.   Who will &quot;own&quot; the rights to &quot;information production and distribution&quot; in this age as we move from the tangible to the digital product? How can we protect the rights of information &quot;owners&quot;, if there are any rights to protect? Some say that &quot;information wants to be free&quot; and that no one should really own &quot;knowledge&quot;.   We will be exploring many of these issues and topics related to living in the digital age.    Quotes   &quot;to say that we live in an unprecedented age of information is merely to say that we have available more statements [information] about the world than we ever had.... how we can distinguish between what is true and what is false [information]? Aside from schools, which are supposed to attend to the matter but largely ignore it, is there any institution or medium that is concerned with the problem of misinformation?&quot; Neil Postman , Building a Bridge to the 18th Century   &quot;I would much prefer to be in an age of faith, an age of discovery, an age of reason, than an age of information.&quot; Theodore Roszak, The Cult of Information: The Folklore of Computers and the True Art of Thinking .   In the 21st century, the fittest will be those who can adapt and change, those who can obtain the information they need and learn skills quickly, as required.

Description       The main goal of this course is to provide students with ways how to enhance traditional storytelling by new technologies without diminishing the role of the written word. While authors and publishers are getting increasingly worried about the future of literature in the digital age, this course will offer constructive approach to the situation.We will examine every aspect of the craft of traditional fiction writing: plot, structure, point of view, narrative voice, dialogue, building of individual scenes, etc as well as the new techniques of the digital age: hypertext, moving text, self-editing text, visual and audio images, animation. We will learn how to balance the traditional with the new without overwhelming the written text with gadgets. The class will become a community of writers working in a safe, honest and considerate environment, presenting their own fiction, responding to the writing of others, and discussing questions about literature, editing, and publishing in the digital age. Each student will write two pieces of fiction using some of the ideas we will be discussing. (The pieces don\u2019t have to appear in the electronic form, but students must be able to explain how they would work.) Reading assignments will include works by a variety of classic and contemporary fiction writers, such as Franz Kafka, Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov, Mark Z. Danielewski, Andy Campbell, and Jonathan Safran Foer. Supplementary assignments will include books and articles on writing in the digital age, such as\u00a0 Rethinking Media and Change: Aesthetics of Transition \u00a0, eds. Thorburn and Jenkins,\u00a0 The New Media Reader \u00a0, eds. Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort.
