To use the service at any NYU Print Service-enabled location , you tag your document (establish ownership) and send it to your personal NYU Print Service queue using any computer connected to NYU-NET, including those at the ITS Academic Technology Centers and CoLabs in New York. Then you go to any NYU Print Station; swipe or tap your NYUCard (or, optionally, a Bobst Library Print Card if in New York); and print your document on the adjacent printer.

With the new NYU Print Service, you can print your documents where and when you wish to print them. No guessing &mdash; the printer is always right near the Print Station that you choose to use. Each document stays in your Print Service queue for up to 24 hours waiting for you to print it, and it won&rsquo;t be printed until you&rsquo;re right there, ready to pick it up.    Efficient &amp; green . The NYU Print Service also supports the University&rsquo;s efficiency and green initiatives by encouraging double-sided and more selective printing. By printing only what you need, and using some savvy printing tips , you can conserve your print grant, keep your printing costs low, and help reduce paper waste by 30 percent!

To use the service at any NYU Print Service-enabled location , you tag your document (establish ownership) and send it to your personal NYU Print Service queue using any computer connected to NYU-NET, including those at the ITS Academic Technology Centers and CoLabs in New York. Then you go to any NYU Print Station; swipe or tap your NYUCard (or, optionally, a Bobst Library Print Card if in New York); and print your document on the adjacent printer.

With the new NYU Print Service, you can print your documents where and when you wish to print them. No guessing &mdash; the printer is always right near the Print Station that you choose to use. Each document stays in your Print Service queue for up to 24 hours waiting for you to print it, and it won&rsquo;t be printed until you&rsquo;re right there, ready to pick it up.    Efficient &amp; green . The NYU Print Service also supports the University&rsquo;s efficiency and green initiatives by encouraging double-sided and more selective printing. By printing only what you need, and using some savvy printing tips , you can conserve your print grant, keep your printing costs low, and help reduce paper waste by 30 percent!
