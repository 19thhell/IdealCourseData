Email:     mikehout@nyu.edu           Areas of Research/Interest:   Inequality; Social Change; Demography; and Quantitative Methods   Research Description:   Mike Hout uses demographic methods to study social change in inequality, religion, and politics. His current work uses the General Social Survey panel to study Americans' changing perceptions of class, religion, and their place in society. In 2006, Mike and Claude Fischer published Century of Difference, a book on twentieth-century social and cultural trends in the United States. The Truth about Conservative Christians with Andrew Greeley (University of Chicago Press, 2006) explored the social and political context of the religious right. A couple of illustrative papers include \"How Class Works: Subjective Aspects of Class Since the 1970s\" in a book edited by Annette Lareau and Dalton Conley (Russell Sage Foundation 2008), \"The Demographic Imperative in Religious Change\" (Am. J. of Soc., Sept. 2001) and \"How 4 Million Irish Immigrants Came to be 40 Million Irish Americans\" (with Josh Goldstein, Am. Soc. Rev., April 1994). Previous books are: Following in Father's Footsteps: Social Mobility in Ireland (Harvard Univ. Press 1989) and, with five Berkeley colleagues, Inequality by Design (Princeton Univ. Press, 1996). Mike Hout's honors include election to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 1997, the National Academy of Sciences in 2003, and the American Philosophical Society in 2006. Mike's education includes a bachelor's degree from the University of Pittsburgh in history and sociology and masters and doctorate from Indiana University in sociology. Before coming to NYU in 2013, he taught at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1985 to 2013, and before that he taught at the University of Arizona from 1976 to 1984.

The Sociology of Conflict and War   SOC-UA 472 No prerequisites, but is intended for students in their third or fourth year with some background in the humanities and the social sciences. Offered every other year. Corradi. 4 points.   Studies the premise that war is much more than a means to an end (a rational, if very brutal, activity intended to serve the interests of one group by destroying those who oppose that group). Mounds of evidence suggest that war exercises a powerful fascination that has its greatest impact on participants but is by no means limited to them. War, in short, is a complex web of affiliations and emotions. This course seeks to place war in the larger map of social conflict, to examine both the persistence of warfare and its historical transformations, and to interpret the cultures of war that have grown around its fatal attraction.

His current work uses the General Social Survey panel to study Americans' changing perceptions of class, religion, and their place in society. In 2006, Mike and Claude Fischer published Century of Difference, a book on twentieth-century social and cultural trends in the United States. The Truth about Conservative Christians with Andrew Greeley (University of Chicago Press, 2006) explored the social and political context of the religious right. A couple of illustrative papers include \"How Class Works: Subjective Aspects of Class Since the 1970s\" in a book edited by Annette Lareau and Dalton Conley (Russell Sage Foundation 2008), \"The Demographic Imperative in Religious Change\" (Am. J. of Soc., Sept. 2001) and \"How 4 Million Irish Immigrants Came to be 40 Million Irish Americans\" (with Josh Goldstein, Am. Soc. Rev., April 1994). Previous books are: Following in Father's Footsteps: Social Mobility in Ireland (Harvard Univ. Press 1989) and, with five Berkeley colleagues, Inequality by Design (Princeton Univ. Press, 1996). Mike Hout's honors include election to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 1997, the National Academy of Sciences in 2003, and the American Philosophical Society in 2006. Mike's education includes a bachelor's degree from the University of Pittsburgh in history and sociology and masters and doctorate from Indiana University in sociology. Before coming to NYU in 2013, he taught at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1985 to 2013, and before that he taught at the University of Arizona from 1976 to 1984.
