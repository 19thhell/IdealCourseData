In addition, the Latino Studies program draws on the expertise of affiliated faculty in the fields of law, education, performance studies, medicine, social work,linguistics and art history. The program combines a historical perspective, going back to early colonialism and pre-colonial times,with the study of contemporary developments such as recent Mexican and South American immigration to New York City.

The program values the bilingual and multilingual aspects of Latino culture, and encourages them in its students.

The series is coordinated by Professors Jonathan Brown, Robert Lubar, and Edward Sullivan.    The Colloquium is now over 15 years old and it continues to enhance the considerable strength of the IFA in the areas of Latin American and Spanish art. We have tried this year to have a strong across-the-board presence of scholars from a variety of fields in the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking Americas. In addition, with the first lecture on art and society in Victorian Jamaica by Professor Timothy Barringer of Yale, we are including other aspects of the hemisphere--something which is only appropriate given the current interest in the Caribbean. Several of our scholar-speakers are graduates of the IFA: Michele Greet and Adele Nelson did their PhD degrees in modern Latin American art and Ronda Kasl studied early modern Spain. Richard Kagan of Johns Hopkins has developed a strong sub-speciality in the history of reception of Spanish art in the US and Professor Robert Davidson from Toronto will examine questions of social and artistic interest related to the Cuban revolution. This group of stellar art and social historians will certainly add immensely to our deeper understanding of the broadly-described field of Hispanic Studies.   We gratefully acknowledge the continuing support of Roberta and Richard Huber for making the 2013-2014 Colloquium possible.    2015       Thursday, April 30, 2015, 6:00 PM     Irene Small ,\u00a0 Assistant Professor , Princeton University     Poor Image and Meta-Medium: H\u00e9rcules Florence and the Invention of Photography in Brazil     RSVP required         Archive     March 5, 2015     Rachel Weiss ,\u00a0Professor of Arts Administration and Policy, School of the Art Institute of Chicago     The Tenuous Moonlight of an Unrequited Past    February 17, 2015     Denise Birkhofer ,\u00a0 Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art , Allen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin University   The Body and the Void in the Art of Mira Schendel and Eva Hesse    December 11, 2014     Thomas Kaufmann ,\u00a0 Frederick Marquand Professor of Art and Archaeology Princeton University     Reflections on World Art History    November 25, 2014   Barbara Mundy ,\u00a0 Associate Professor , Fordham University   The death of Aztec Tenochtitlan, the life of Mexico City       November 13, 2014   Niria E.
