Afterwards, when the beams were reflected in the mirror, a fearful kindling of fire was raised in the ships, and at the distance of a bow-shot he turned them into ashes. In this way did the old man prevail over Marcellus with his weapons.       The above passage is from       G REEK M ATHEMATICAL W ORKS     Translated by Ivor Thomas      Loeb Classical Library     Harvard University Press , Cambridge, 1941    Volume II, Page 19            E PITOME TON   I STORION       by John Zonaras   (circa twelfth century AD )               9, 4       A t last in an incredible manner he [Archimedes] burned up the whole Roman fleet. For by tilting a kind of mirror toward the sun he concentrated the sun's beam upon it; and owing to the thickness and smoothness of the mirror he ignited the air from this beam and kindled a great flame, the whole of which he directed upon the ships that lay at anchor in the path of the fire, until he consumed them all.
