Whether you're looking to enhance your existing social media strategy or just getting started with a new account, you've come to the right place. As social media usage continues to flourish here and in higher education as a whole, it's important that we take these efforts seriously.   This page is designed to help you, as the community manager or administrator of an NYU-focused account, to get started and to answer any questions that you may have regarding social media for University departments and organizations. The information provided is designed to enhance your social media strategy and help you meet your goals and benchmarks.              Social Media Best Practices          At NYU, we believe the use of social media is a way to digitally connect and communicate with others -- friends, classmates, colleagues, and sometimes strangers. The strength of social media is that it is built upon real relationships between people, with technology enabling people to easily connect with others around the world -- carrying messages quickly to others near and far.    Additionally, social networking (both on NYU-provided services and on commercially-available services) can help to support the University mission of teaching, learning, research, and community life.          Learn more about best practicies              Social Media Ambassadors          The Social Media Ambassadors is a group intended for employees who take part in managing social media on behalf of an NYU entity (i.e. office, department, school, etc.). The group is designed to facilitate community amongst the members increasing knowledge, awareness, and best practices in the areas of social media at NYU.    The group meets twice a semester for in-person meetings and communicates throughout the year using the Social Media Ambassadors Google Group.    Members should be active managers and administrators of a NYU social media account. An NYU.edu account is required to join. If you have any issues, please contact Chris Barrows at Chris.Barrows@nyu.edu .            Learn more about Social Media Ambassadors              Social Media Training Sessions          Training sessions are offered throughout the year through Human Resources iLearn system, the Social Media Ambassadors group and through personalized workshops set-up through the Digital Communications Group.   To inquire about social media training opportunities, you can inquire at social.media@nyu.edu .              Social Media Account Audits        If you manage an account for the university and would like to see improved results, we're here to help. Email Chris.Barrows@nyu.edu and request a social media account audit. In return, you'll get a one-page (per account) with tips and suggestions for improving your social media account. In addition, a follow-up conversation will take place to discuss the suggestions.    Audits are designed to provide guidance though all solutions may not be possible at the time of audit.              How Can We Help?

Whether you're looking to enhance your existing social media strategy or just getting started with a new account, you've come to the right place. As social media usage continues to flourish here and in higher education as a whole, it's important that we take these efforts seriously.   This page is designed to help you, as the community manager or administrator of an NYU-focused account, to get started and to answer any questions that you may have regarding social media for University departments and organizations. The information provided is designed to enhance your social media strategy and help you meet your goals and benchmarks.              Social Media Best Practices          At NYU, we believe the use of social media is a way to digitally connect and communicate with others -- friends, classmates, colleagues, and sometimes strangers. The strength of social media is that it is built upon real relationships between people, with technology enabling people to easily connect with others around the world -- carrying messages quickly to others near and far.    Additionally, social networking (both on NYU-provided services and on commercially-available services) can help to support the University mission of teaching, learning, research, and community life.          Learn more about best practicies              Social Media Ambassadors          The Social Media Ambassadors is a group intended for employees who take part in managing social media on behalf of an NYU entity (i.e. office, department, school, etc.). The group is designed to facilitate community amongst the members increasing knowledge, awareness, and best practices in the areas of social media at NYU.    The group meets twice a semester for in-person meetings and communicates throughout the year using the Social Media Ambassadors Google Group.    Members should be active managers and administrators of a NYU social media account. An NYU.edu account is required to join. If you have any issues, please contact Chris Barrows at Chris.Barrows@nyu.edu .            Learn more about Social Media Ambassadors              Social Media Training Sessions          Training sessions are offered throughout the year through Human Resources iLearn system, the Social Media Ambassadors group and through personalized workshops set-up through the Digital Communications Group.   To inquire about social media training opportunities, you can inquire at social.media@nyu.edu .              Social Media Account Audits        If you manage an account for the university and would like to see improved results, we're here to help. Email Chris.Barrows@nyu.edu and request a social media account audit. In return, you'll get a one-page (per account) with tips and suggestions for improving your social media account. In addition, a follow-up conversation will take place to discuss the suggestions.    Audits are designed to provide guidance though all solutions may not be possible at the time of audit.              How Can We Help?        The New York University Social Media team offers a variety of resources and services.
