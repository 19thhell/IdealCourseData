Citing Within the Paper     **Please note that when using footnotes or parenthetical citations, you still need to include a &quot;bibliography&quot; or a &quot;works cited&quot; section at the end of your paper.       Check with your instructor or editor to determine whether footnotes or parenthetical citations are required.       Parenthetical Citation  Some style guides (MLA, APA) recommend parenthetical citation instead of footnotes (although footnotes may be used with MLA). Insert a parenthesis with the author&#39;s last name and the page number at the end of a sentence.       Example: (Coren 142).      Footnotes  Just as for a bibliography, different style guides require footnotes to be formatted in different ways. You should consult the most recent guide for your discipline for details.      Example:  Using the MLA style to cite a reference with a footnote, insert a number at the place where you want to acknowledge another author&#39;s words, facts, or ideas. Then, at the bottom of the page, repeat the number and follow it with the citation information. For example. 1 (see below).     Footnote numbers should start with 1, and follow sequentially. If you cite a source a second time, you do not need to include the full citation, just the author&#39;s name and page number. 2 (see below).     The footnote style is basically the same as for bibliographies, except that:       The author&#39;s name is not inverted    Include the page number you are citing    Book Publication information is in parentheses    Footnotes do not use a hanging indent - indent the first line only.         1 Stanley Coren.

In constructing the essay, students should describe their educational experiences, the central idea(s)    of the concentration and the coursework relevant to their concentration. This requirement applies to students who    enter Gallatin during or after the Fall 2003 term. For more information about the essay and this requirement, please    see the Policies and Procedures for the Undergraduate Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration booklet.

There are a number of different options for formatting citations. Certain bibliographic styles correspond to certain disciplines, and you often may have a specific style assigned to you for a project. However, the most important thing to remember is that your citation style must be consistent throughout a single paper.       Automatic Citation Formatting          For information on RefWorks, ProCite, and EndNote, software used to  help you import and organize your bibliography, see http://library.nyu.edu/bib         For quick citations in MLA (Modern Language Association) and APA (American Psychological Association) style,  see the Citation Wizard: http://21cif.imsa.edu/tools/citation/         This Guide Contains Information on:     Style Guides and Manuals    Electronic Citations    Examples of Bibliographic Citations    Citing Within the Paper       \u00a0    1.

Citing Within the Paper     **Please note that when using footnotes or parenthetical citations, you still need to include a &quot;bibliography&quot; or a &quot;works cited&quot; section at the end of your paper.       Check with your instructor or editor to determine whether footnotes or parenthetical citations are required.       Parenthetical Citation  Some style guides (MLA, APA) recommend parenthetical citation instead of footnotes (although footnotes may be used with MLA). Insert a parenthesis with the author&#39;s last name and the page number at the end of a sentence.       Example: (Coren 142).      Footnotes  Just as for a bibliography, different style guides require footnotes to be formatted in different ways. You should consult the most recent guide for your discipline for details.      Example:  Using the MLA style to cite a reference with a footnote, insert a number at the place where you want to acknowledge another author&#39;s words, facts, or ideas. Then, at the bottom of the page, repeat the number and follow it with the citation information. For example. 1 (see below).     Footnote numbers should start with 1, and follow sequentially. If you cite a source a second time, you do not need to include the full citation, just the author&#39;s name and page number. 2 (see below).     The footnote style is basically the same as for bibliographies, except that:       The author&#39;s name is not inverted    Include the page number you are citing    Book Publication information is in parentheses    Footnotes do not use a hanging indent - indent the first line only.         1 Stanley Coren.
