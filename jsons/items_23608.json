Islam is a principle identity for these populations, but a focus of concern for their host countries. Are the sources of tension economic and social or cultural and rooted in a different set of values? Or are they both? What is the role of policy to surmount these tensions?  These and other questions will be addressed by a conference under the heading, \u201cMuslim Youth and Women in the West: Source of Concern or Source of Hope?\u201d to take place from 15-17 May 2007 in Salzburg, Austria, at the Salzburg Seminar facility, Schloss Leopoldskron.  New York University\u2019s Dialogues: Islamic World-U.S.-The West has organized the conference, with the financial support of the Austrian Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs. Additional funding has been provided by the Danish Ministry of Refugee, Immigration and Integration Affairs, the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Qatar Foundation, and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. The Austrian newspaper Die Kronenzeitung is providing promotional support.  The conference will explore the challenges of and to Muslim communities in the West through the lens of youth and women, who have emerged from traditional roles and are forging new identities for themselves, and, in some instances, are becoming leading agents of change. The conference will be policy-oriented, bringing together up to 60 youth and women activists and community leaders, religious leaders, policy-makers, policy analysts, scholars, and government officials from Canada, the United States, and Europe. The conference will open with a forum, which will examine the tensions produced by Islam in the West and how they can be overcome. Participants include: Ursula Plassnik, Austrian federal minister for European and international affairs; Marc Perrin de Brichambaut, secretary general, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE); and Amre Moussa, secretary general, League of Arab States. The conference\u2019s afternoon session will be divided into two panels. The first will offer a survey of the current economic, social, cultural, and political landscape of Muslim communities in the West. The second will reflect on a vision for the future and will ask whether successful integration is the key to enhanced security and how, and on what terms, Muslim youth and women can infuse new vitality into old Europe. Panelists will include: Zsolt Nyiri, regional research director for Europe, the Gallup Organization; Susan Scholefield, director general for equalities, United Kingdom Department of Communities and Local Government; and Tariq Ramadan, professor of Islamic studies, St. Antony\u2019s College, Oxford and visiting professor, Erasmus University, Rotterdam. On the second day of the conference, participants will divide into three working groups addressing, respectively, security, integration best practices, and the question of whether we are witnessing the emergence of a Western Islam. The working groups will aim at developing practical policy recommendations, and will be chaired by Randy Beardsworth, vice president, Human Capital & Corporate Communication Strategies, Analytic Services Inc., and former assistant secretary, policy, planning, and international affairs directorate, U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Haroon Siddiqui, editorial page editor emeritus, The Toronto Star ; and Farhan Nizami, director, Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies. In its background paper prepared for the conference, Dialogues acknowledges that these are not easy times to determine the right terms for the integration of Muslim communities in the West, and particularly in Europe. All involved-governments, ethnic associations, employers, educational institutions and religious voices-must exert a concerted effort to develop and define what might become a \u201ccitizenship pact,\u201d which would spell out mutual obligations and rights in a clear way. \u201cAs citizens, reassured in the integrity of their private values but in full agreement with the encompassing legal system of their adopted countries and its political culture, Western Muslims could become an inspiration for the larger Muslim world as it struggles to strike a balance between faith, tradition and modernity,\u201d stresses the paper. \u201cThe harmonious integration of Muslim communities in the West could also lead to a more peaceful and productive relationship between the West and the Muslim world.\u201d  Dialogues: Islamic World-U.S.-The West is a program of New York University that emerged from the tragedy of September 11th, which highlighted the need for greater communication among and about the United States, Europe, and the Muslim world. Dialogues was founded as a forum for constructive debate between the various religious, intellectual, economic, and political sectors of American, European, and Islamic societies. The program is committed to a number of academic, policy, and outreach activities, including international conferences on a variety of topics of critical importance today-the clash of perceptions, elections, the nature of authority in the Islamic world and in the West, among others-which result in the development of policy recommendations.

Participants from cultural institutions and organizations in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia will discuss the international programs and exchanges they have organized; the challenges and problems they've encountered; their successes; and ways in  which the private sector and government interact to enable this work. This practical perspective offers a chance to better understand the networks and circuits which exist across the globe facilitating cultural engagement \u2013 how they developed, how they work, and ways in which art and artists enter into the flow.     Recent Reporting         US Cultural Engagement with Global Muslim Communities: Contours and Connections in an Emerging Field - At the October 2013 conference \"Cultural Connections: Engaging Muslim-Majority Nations and the West,\" held by New York University's Brademas Center, discussions about the state of the field centered on the idea of \"global circuits.\" Participants suggested that practitioners, both independent and rooted in organizations, formed networks of connection through which art and artists flow, ranging from very informal and casual \u2014 in which practitioners may not have even met but share a common source of funding or presentation \u2014 to the most deliberate and formal. Likewise, participants emphasized the large degree of variation in programs, venue types, and disciplines, ranging from traditional to contemporary and hybrid forms, present in the field. This research provides strong arguments and preliminary insights into ways that culture can advance engagement across boundaries, both geographic and societal. But the most challenging efforts may be those intended to connect the United States to Muslim populations abroad. Download the FULL REPORT and CONFERENCE REPORT .                    Preceeding Reports            Moving Forward: A Renewed Roll for American Arts and Artists in the Global Age - In January 2009, the John Brademas Center of the NYU Wagner convened a group of experts to explore the public policy implications for American arts and culture of a renewed focus on U.S. public diplomacy and issued a call for an expansion of international arts and cultural exchanges in the service of this new direction. This report is the result of their expert opinions and deliberations.        Cultural Diplomacy: does it work? - A diverse group had assembled, with the co-sponsorship of the Ditchley Foundation, to analyse what cultural diplomacy could offer in today's world, the balance between promotion of national interest and increasing international understanding, and whether it could really work in helping to foster mutual engagement between different peoples.                      Conference Information     Analysis and sharing on-the-ground experiences among participants will offer concrete counsel for policymakers, funders, cultural organizations and artists themselves to broaden exchanges between the West and the Islamic World.     Given the host of challenges\u00a0pressing on the relationship between Muslim and Western states \u2013 from security to energy, trade to tourism, environmental issues to belief structures \u2013 greater cultural understanding across societies is critical today. Through exploration of activity and networks and analyses of their functioning, we hope to encourage more and better engagement and contact.

The Project is working to enhance visibility and resources for America's international cultural engagement in the cause of peace, economic growth and stability, and mutual understanding, respect, and tolerance. The goal is an expansion of exchange programs and structural reforms to foster better strategic planning, coordination, and implementation by the Federal Government and American citizens of this critical component of our relations with the governments and peoples of other countries. The Project has been on-going since it's inception in 2009.
