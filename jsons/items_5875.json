To set the context for future clinical research activities, the NIH convened a Director's Panel in the late 1990s. They recognized the state of clinical research as a national problem and made certain recommendations. These recommendations included improving the quality of clinical research training, initiating training programs to attract students into clinical research careers, and educating the public about the importance of clinical research.   NIH Roadmap clearly identifies that in order to provide 21 st century medicine; we need expanding medical/dental advances. To support such advances, a trained clinical research workforce is needed who will take research from bench-to-bedside or chair side. As of Oct 29, 2014, globally, there were 177,688 clinical trials listed on the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials web site ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). Nearly 46% of these studies were located in the U.S. (over 30,250 of these studies were in the tri-state area). As we need trained clinical research personnel at all levels to conduct these studies using the highest scientific, ethical, and regulatory standards, New York University College of Dentistry initiated a Clinical Research Training Program in 2001. As of May 2013, we have graduated over 150 students from this program who were born in 28 different countries. Among those who have gone through our program were foreign and U.S. trained dentists and physicians, pharmaceutical industry employees, colleague graduates with pharmacy, pharmacology, and other degrees, and even a few students with MS and/or PhD degrees in basic sciences. Our graduates have obtained positions in academia, industry, and government institutes and some others have gone to obtain higher degrees such as MD, DDS, and MPH. In an independent external review of the program conducted by three reviewers (two from academia and one from industry) in 2011, the students and alumni expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the program and the program faculty, which is comprised of both academicians and industry experts.   MISSION OF THE MS PROGRAM     The mission of the NYU College of Dentistry Master of Science (MS) in Clinical Research Program is to produce competent entry-level clinical researchers who are knowledgeable about clinical research methodology, administration, ethics, and governing regulations, with a programmatic emphasis on Randomized Controlled Trials.   GOALS OF THE MS PROGRAM   The major functions of the NYU College of Dentistry MS in Clinical Research Program are education, simulation, and practice and the goals for each function are defined below:                                                  Education                               To educate students about fundamentals of clinical research, clinical research regulations, and the process of constructing research protocols and grant proposals; to develop relevant skills needed for effective practice of clinical research; and, to maintain an environment conducive to learning and self-evaluation.                                                              Simulation                               To contribute to the advancement of clinical research knowledge and experience through simulation with peers, educators, researchers, and research administrators.                                                              Practice                               To provide relevant working experience in clinical research, research administration, and regulatory oversight.                      Academics   We offer two graduate programs in clinical research. The first is a two-year MS program and the second, a one-year Certificate Program .   Eligible applicants for these programs are individuals from academia and industry with backgrounds in dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and other allied health professions or those who possess a minimum of a BA or a BS degree. Tuition for the program is according to the standard per credit tuition fee for the Graduate School of Arts and Science at NYU.

Research Program                               Together with the hands-on experience in clinical research provided through the Bluestone Center for Clinical Research and other sites such as the NYU School of Medicine, Beth Israel Medical Center, and potential industry sites, MS students enrolled in the program are exposed to a wide array of topics (not limited to dental studies) related to clinical research in 5 different tracks (Clinical Research Track, Data Management Track, Academic Career Track, Quality Assurance Track, and Biological Assays Related to Clinical Research Track)                                                              Accreditation Status                               This program is approved by New York University and the New York State Department of Education.                                                                     Length of Program                                       The Masters of Science in Clinical Research degree is a two-year full-time program (or a 4 year part-time program) with 12 -14 credit hours of course work per semester. The MS degree has a total of 50 credit hours.

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.

Curriculum for the 21st Century, or C21, provides students with a patient-centered and disease-focused medical education. The curriculum has also been structured to provide students with flexibility in their educational experience. Students work autonomously and as part of a team as they develop the communication and cultural competency skills they will need to practice medicine in the 21st Century.   C21 is a competency-based curriculum. As such, Foundational Knowledge, Integrated Clinical Skills, Professional Development and Scholarship and Research are built upon throughout our curriculum.   C21 Highlights   The curriculum is divided into four thoughtfully laid out curriculum stages . Here the requirements for graduation are also explained.     Pillars are disease-based topics of medical importance that are woven throughout the curriculum. Pillars integrate teaching of basic and clinical science. Pillars layer knowledge onto core concepts, providing a scaffold for longitudinal learning.     Practice of Medicine allows students to interact with patients early in their medical education.     Selectives , Sub-Internships , and Concentrations allow for an individualized, flexible curriculum.     The twelve-week concentration allows students to develop a deeper understanding of a field of medicine and science.     Dual Degrees are offered in collaboration with other NYU degree-granting programs in a four to five year time frame (e.g. MD/MPA in Health Policy and Management, MD/MPH in Global Public Health, MD/MA in Bioethics, MD/MS in Clinical Investigation).     MD/PhD students begin laboratory training six months earlier.     The Honors Program allows students to pursue their research interests in conjunction with their medical studies.     NYU School of Medicine is at the forefront of curricular innovations .   \u00a0                                                                                        NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}]},

To set the context for future clinical research activities, the NIH convened a Director's Panel in the late 1990s. They recognized the state of clinical research as a national problem and made certain recommendations. These recommendations included improving the quality of clinical research training, initiating training programs to attract students into clinical research careers, and educating the public about the importance of clinical research.   NIH Roadmap clearly identifies that in order to provide 21 st century medicine; we need expanding medical/dental advances. To support such advances, a trained clinical research workforce is needed who will take research from bench-to-bedside or chair side. As of Oct 29, 2014, globally, there were 177,688 clinical trials listed on the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials web site ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). Nearly 46% of these studies were located in the U.S. (over 30,250 of these studies were in the tri-state area). As we need trained clinical research personnel at all levels to conduct these studies using the highest scientific, ethical, and regulatory standards, New York University College of Dentistry initiated a Clinical Research Training Program in 2001. As of May 2013, we have graduated over 150 students from this program who were born in 28 different countries. Among those who have gone through our program were foreign and U.S. trained dentists and physicians, pharmaceutical industry employees, colleague graduates with pharmacy, pharmacology, and other degrees, and even a few students with MS and/or PhD degrees in basic sciences. Our graduates have obtained positions in academia, industry, and government institutes and some others have gone to obtain higher degrees such as MD, DDS, and MPH. In an independent external review of the program conducted by three reviewers (two from academia and one from industry) in 2011, the students and alumni expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the program and the program faculty, which is comprised of both academicians and industry experts.   MISSION OF THE MS PROGRAM     The mission of the NYU College of Dentistry Master of Science (MS) in Clinical Research Program is to produce competent entry-level clinical researchers who are knowledgeable about clinical research methodology, administration, ethics, and governing regulations, with a programmatic emphasis on Randomized Controlled Trials.   GOALS OF THE MS PROGRAM   The major functions of the NYU College of Dentistry MS in Clinical Research Program are education, simulation, and practice and the goals for each function are defined below:                                                  Education                               To educate students about fundamentals of clinical research, clinical research regulations, and the process of constructing research protocols and grant proposals; to develop relevant skills needed for effective practice of clinical research; and, to maintain an environment conducive to learning and self-evaluation.                                                              Simulation                               To contribute to the advancement of clinical research knowledge and experience through simulation with peers, educators, researchers, and research administrators.                                                              Practice                               To provide relevant working experience in clinical research, research administration, and regulatory oversight.                      Academics   We offer two graduate programs in clinical research. The first is a two-year MS program and the second, a one-year Certificate Program .   Eligible applicants for these programs are individuals from academia and industry with backgrounds in dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and other allied health professions or those who possess a minimum of a BA or a BS degree.

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.

Curriculum for the 21st Century, or C21, provides students with a patient-centered and disease-focused medical education. The curriculum has also been structured to provide students with flexibility in their educational experience. Students work autonomously and as part of a team as they develop the communication and cultural competency skills they will need to practice medicine in the 21st Century.   C21 is a competency-based curriculum. As such, Foundational Knowledge, Integrated Clinical Skills, Professional Development and Scholarship and Research are built upon throughout our curriculum.   C21 Highlights   The curriculum is divided into four thoughtfully laid out curriculum stages . Here the requirements for graduation are also explained.     Pillars are disease-based topics of medical importance that are woven throughout the curriculum. Pillars integrate teaching of basic and clinical science. Pillars layer knowledge onto core concepts, providing a scaffold for longitudinal learning.     Practice of Medicine allows students to interact with patients early in their medical education.     Selectives , Sub-Internships , and Concentrations allow for an individualized, flexible curriculum.     The twelve-week concentration allows students to develop a deeper understanding of a field of medicine and science.     Dual Degrees are offered in collaboration with other NYU degree-granting programs in a four to five year time frame (e.g. MD/MPA in Health Policy and Management, MD/MPH in Global Public Health, MD/MA in Bioethics, MD/MS in Clinical Investigation).     MD/PhD students begin laboratory training six months earlier.     The Honors Program allows students to pursue their research interests in conjunction with their medical studies.     NYU School of Medicine is at the forefront of curricular innovations .   \u00a0                                                                                        NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}]}]
