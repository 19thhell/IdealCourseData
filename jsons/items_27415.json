Alumni hold positions at all levels of responsibility in diverse arts organizations, including, for example, president of The Philadelphia Orchestra, marketing and planning director of the Metropolitan Opera Association, executive director of The Sundance Foundation, finance director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, associate development director of Merce Cunningham Dance, and chief arts officer of the Hewlett Packard Foundation. Many others serve as faculty and administrators in higher education in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.    Our students come with a solid background in at least one of the performing arts forms: dance, theatre, music, opera, or film. Their performing arts backgrounds act as foundations for our program&rsquo;s intensive and systematic studies in performing arts management which is combined with course work in related disciplines such as economics, statistics, marketing, accounting, finance, planning, law, cultural policy, and philanthropic development.    Many courses in the curriculum are offered through NYU&rsquo;s Leonard N. Stern School of Business and the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Annually, the program places students in approximately 75 internships locally and abroad. These enriching and closely monitored and mentored internships are the bridge from classroom to practice in leading performing arts organizations. Our faculty advises and oversees all internships. Mentoring is a constant ingredient throughout four semesters of study.    Our popular summer study abroad program in Europe further enhances students&rsquo; learning by providing varied overseas perspectives. Our studies abroad program was the first in the nation to take students and professionals abroad to study cultural policy, public funding, sponsorship, and marketing in locations as varied as The Netherlands, Berlin, Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Paris, London, and Vienna. The innovation of these abroad programs is that they are interdisciplinary with visual and performing arts professionals focusing on management issues of the performing and visual arts.    In New York, our students receive unparalleled training within a university that is acclaimed for its preparation of leaders in business, management, and the arts. Faculty and students in our program frequently collaborate with Steinhardt&rsquo;s programs in music business and visual arts administration and with the Stern School of Business and the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Equipped with outstanding practica, international, and interdisciplinary experiences during their studies, our graduates enjoy high demand in the field. They are frequently recruited by our own alumni who hold positions of responsibility and who are eager to fill staff openings with our graduates.
