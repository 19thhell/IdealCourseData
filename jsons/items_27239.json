His plays have been reinterpreted for every new generation: as teen movies ( 10 Things I Hate About You / Taming of the Shrew ), musicals ( West Side Story / Romeo and Juliet ), science-fiction films ( Forbidden Planet / The Tempest ), Japanese warrior tales ( Throne of Blood/Macbeth ) and novels ( A Thousand Acres / King Lear ), to name a few. The time is ripe for a dedicated series of stand-alone retellings that will form a covetable library as well as a celebration of Shakespeare for years to come. The Hogarth Shakespeare will be a unique series to delight existing Shakespeare lovers and bring the world&rsquo;s favourite writer to a new readership, young and old.   The Hogarth Shakespeare programme will launch in 2016, coinciding with the 400 th anniversary of Shakespeare&rsquo;s death. This international publishing initiative is led by Hogarth UK and published in partnership with Hogarth US, Knopf Canada, Knaus Verlag in Germany and Mondadori in Spain; and Random House Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India. The novels will be published simultaneously across the English-speaking world in print, digital and audio formats. Hogarth is currently in discussion with a number of writers, with further announcements expected soon.   Some of the writers already signed up are Margaret Atwood (&ldquo;The Tempest&rdquo;), Howard Jacobson (&ldquo;The Merchant of Venice&rdquo;), Anne Tyler (&ldquo;The Taming of the Shrew&rdquo;), Jo Nesbo (\"Macbeth\"), and Jeanette Winterson (&ldquo;The Winter&rsquo;s Tale&rdquo;). I can't wait to see what they do with the plays!

The idea that Shakespeare is a global author has taken many forms since the building of the Globe playhouse. Our work honors the fact and demonstrates the diversity of the world-wide reception and production of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays in ways that we hope will nourish the remarkable array of new forms of cultural exchange that the digital age has made possible. Global Shakespeares is a participatory multi-centric networked model that offers wide access to international performances that are changing how we understand Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays and the world.        Global Shakespeares Global Shakespeares provides global, regional, and national portals to Shakespeare productions within a federated structure. As the archive grows, you will be able to view and study productions either in an environment focused on one area\u2014Shakespeare Performance in Asia is the first of these\u2014or in the context of world-wide Shakespeare production. The archive is a work in progress and currently includes a catalogue of more than 296 productions, 75 video clips, and online videos of over 30 full productions. This archive is intended to promote cross-cultural understanding and serve as a core resource for students, teachers, and researchers. We invite you to participate in this international research and educational online community.

We are critical omnivores; there is nothing about which we cannot develop a reasoned opinion. But what we love most is sitting around with a glass of wine or a tumbler of bourbon and talking about the Bard. Or sometimes yelling about the Bard. Occasionally fighting about the Bard. And some of us know how to use swords!    But here at The Mousetrap we&rsquo;re always civil, kind, and respectful, and we never type in all caps. We just want to share the joy and jealousy, the frustration and fascination as we investigate Shakespeare&rsquo;s life and work. Anyone who wants to join in our exploration is welcome; We&rsquo;re all here to learn.

It&rsquo;s a tapestry of cinematic art that infuses the poetry of William Shakespeare into the poetry of New York City. It&rsquo;s huge, it&rsquo;s visceral and it&rsquo;s right here.   We began this project as a continuation of our mission &ndash; getting new audiences to like Shakespeare. After raising almost $50,000 in a Kickstarter campaign we embarked on a journey &ndash; to film all of Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets, each performed by a different actor in a carefully chosen New York City location. It began as project with a deadline &ndash; by Shakespeare&rsquo;s 450th birthday (April 23rd 2014) all 154 sonnets would be assigned, filmed and released on our website and YouTube.     The Sonnet Project very quickly blossomed into something more. It became apparent that each sonnet was not simply a &lsquo;video&rsquo; &ndash; not simply an actor standing at a monument reciting a sonnet &ndash; but a short independent film. Every single sonnet required time and effort beyond our imagining. But the finished product! Each one is expansive , narrative &ndash; a work of art.   We decided to focus on the journey rather than the destination &ndash; the Project will not be finished by April. But that&rsquo;s ok. In fact, it&rsquo;s more than ok because the Project has exploded into a sprawling , barely controllable, ever-growing, ever-changing tribute to Shakespeare&rsquo;s art, New York City, and the artists that live here. And we love it.   Click here to read the NY Times article about the project.

Crackling and quick-moving, The Two Gentlemen of Verona may well have been Shakespeare&rsquo;s first play. A seemingly simple tale of shifting devotions among mismatched lovers, it helped launch the genre of rom-com. Yet its delightful madcap surface conceals undercurrents, as its putative hero proves a cad and a faithless friend.

Comments (0)                                         One of the most important books in the world? Recent books about Shakespeare's First Folio                   The Shakespeare thefts: in search of the first folios - Eric Rasmussen Call Number: PR3071 .R37 2011 The first edition of Shakespeare's collected works, the First Folio, published in 1623, is one of the most valuable books in the world and has historically proven to be an attractive target for thieves. Of the 160 First Folios listed in a census of 1902, 14 were subsequently stolen-and only two of these were ever recovered. In his efforts to catalog all these precious First Folios, renowned Shakespeare scholar Eric Rasmussen embarked on a riveting journey around the globe, involving run-ins with heavily tattooed criminal street gangs in Tokyo, bizarre visits with eccentric, reclusive billionaires, and intense battles of wills with secretive librarians.   The Shakespeare first folios: a descriptive catalogue - Eric Rasmussen and Anthony James West Call Number: Z8813 .S433 2012 Non-circulating This catalogue of the Shakespeare First Folio (1623) is the result of two decades of research during which 232 surviving copies of this immeasurably important book were located \u2013 a remarkable 72 more than were recorded in the previous census over a century ago \u2013 and examined in situ, creating an essential reference work.   Acting from Shakespeare's First Folio: Theory, Text and Performance - Don Weingust Call Number: PR3091 .W45 2006 (also in e-version) Acting from Shakespeare's First Folio examines a series of techniques for reading and performing Shakespeare's plays that are based on the texts of the first \u2018complete\u2019 volume of Shakespeare's works: the First Folio of 1623. Do extra syllables in a line suggest how it might be played? Can Folio commas reveal character? Don Weingust places this work on Folio performance possibility within current understandings about Shakespearean text, describing ways in which these challenging theories about acting often align quite nicely with the work of the theories' critics. As part of this study, Weingust looks at the work of Patrick Tucker and his London-based Original Shakespeare Company, who have sought to discover the opportunities in using First Folio texts, acting techniques, and what they consider to be original Shakespearean performance methodologies. Weingust argues that their experimental performances at the Globe on Bankside have revealed enhanced possibilities not only for performing Shakespeare, but for theatrical practice in general.

For twenty years it has been hailed as not only the most reliable but the liveliest and most entertaining overview of Shakespearean theater available to students. For this third edition Professor Gurr has substantially revised the book, bringing it right up to date and incorporating many new discoveries, including those of the archaeologists at the sites of the Rose and Globe theaters. The invaluable appendix, which lists all the plays performed at a particular playhouse, the playing company and date of performance, has also been revised and rearranged.   Shakespeare, language and the stage : the fifth wall, approaches to Shakespeare from criticism, performance and theatre studies - Lynette Hunter Call Number: PR 3072 .S37 2005 Resulting from workshops at Shakespeare's Globe between leading critics, performance theorists and theatre practitioners such as Greg Doran of the RSC, Nicholas Hytner of the Royal National Theatre, Ann Thompson of the Arden Shakespeare and W.B. Worthen of the University of California, Berkeley, Shakespeare Language and the Stage breaks down the invisible barrier between scholar and practitioner. Topics discussed include text and voice, playing and criticism, gesture, language and the body, gesture and audience and multilingualism and marginality. The book provides fresh ways of thinking about the impact of Shakespeare's language on an audience's understanding and interpretation of the action and examines how a variety of performances engage with Shakespeare's text, verse and language. As such it is a unique and invaluable resource for students, scholars and theatre practitioners alike.   The Shakespeare riots : revenge, drama, and death in nineteenth-century America - Nigel Cliff Call Number: PN2277 .N5 C58 2007 One of the bloodiest incidents in New York\u2019s history, the so-called Astor Place Riot of May 10, 1849, was ignited by a long-simmering grudge match between the two leading Shakespearean actors of the age. Despite its unlikely origins, though, there was nothing remotely quaint about this pivotal moment in history\u2013the unprecedented shooting by American soldiers of dozens of their fellow citizens, leading directly to the arming of American police forces. The Shakespeare Riots recounts the story of this momentous night, its two larger-than-life protagonists, and the myriad political and cultural currents that fueled the violence. In this wondrous saga Nigel Cliff immerses readers in the bustle of mid-nineteenth-century New York, re-creating the celebrity demimonde of the day and capturing all the high drama of a violent night that robbed a nation of its innocence. The Shakespeare Riots is social and cultural history of the highest order.   Shakespeare and Modern Culture - Marjorie Garber Call Number: PR2989 .G35 2008 Shakespeare has determined many of the ideas that we think of as \u201cnaturally\u201d true: ideas about human character, individuality and selfhood, government, leadership, love and jealousy, men and women, youth and age. Marjorie Garber delves into ten plays to explore the interrelationships between Shakespeare and contemporary culture, from James Joyce's Ulysses to George W. Bush's reading list. From the persistence of difference in Othello to the matter of character in Hamlet to the untimeliness of youth in Romeo and Juliet, Garber discusses how these ideas have been re-imagined in modern fiction, theater, film, and the news, and in the literature of psychology, sociology, political theory, business, medicine, and law.

The book shows what we know and can't know about Shakespeare's own beliefs, and demonstrates, in a series of wonderfully alert and agile readings, how the often fraught and vertiginous religious environment of Post-Reformation England gets refracted by the lens of Shakespeare's imagination.   Medieval Shakespeare: Pasts and Presents - Ruth Morse, Helen Cooper, and Peter Holland Call Number: PR3069.M47 M43 2013 For many, Shakespeare represents the advent of modernity. It is easy to forget that he was in fact a writer deeply embedded in the Middle Ages, who inherited many of his shaping ideas and assumptions from the medieval past. This collection brings together essays by internationally renowned scholars of medieval and early modern literature, the history of the book and theatre history to present new perspectives on Shakespeare and his medieval heritage.   Shakespeare's theatres and the effects of performance - Farah Karim Cooper and Tiffany Stern Call Number: PN2589 .S5 2013 How did Elizabethan and Jacobean acting companies create their visual and aural effects? What materials were available to them and how did they influence staging and writing? What impact did the sensations of theatre have on early modern audiences? How did the construction of the playhouses contribute to technological innovations in the theatre? What effect might these innovations have had on the writing of plays? Shakespeare's Theatres and The Effects of Performance is a landmark collection of essays by leading international scholars addressing these and other questions to create a unique and comprehensive overview of the practicalities and realities of the theatre in the early modern period.   Shakespeare and the Staging of English History - Janette Dillon Call Number: PR3091 .D55 2012 ISBN: 0199593167 This new study of Shakespeare's English history plays looks at the plays through the lens of early modern staging, focusing on the recurrence of particular stage pictures and 'units of action', and seeking to show how these units function in particular and characteristic ways within the history plays. Through close analysis of stage practice and stage picture, the book builds a profile of the kinds of writing and staging that characterise a Shakespearean history play and that differentiate one history play from another.   Shakespeare in America: An Anthology from the Revolution to Now - James Shapiro Call Number: PR2971.U6 S49 2014 \u201cThe history of Shakespeare in America,\u201d writes James Shapiro in his introduction to this groundbreaking anthology, \u201cis also the history of America itself.\u201d Shakespeare was a central, inescapable part of America\u2019s literary inheritance, and a prism through which crucial American issues\u2014revolution, slavery, war, social justice\u2014were refracted and understood. In tracing the many surprising forms this influence took, Shapiro draws on many genres\u2014poetry, fiction, essays, plays, memoirs, songs, speeches, letters, movie reviews, comedy routines\u2014and on a remarkable range of American writers from Emerson, Melville, Lincoln, and Mark Twain to James Agee, John Berryman, Pauline Kael, and Cynthia Ozick.

Folger Bindings Image Collection This database provides access to high resolution images and descriptions of bindings from the rare book and manuscript collections of the Folger Shakespeare Library. Bindings are chosen from the collection for photography and description not only because of their decorative tooled elements but also for their physical features as functional objects and cultural artifacts. Recording information about binding structure and decoration can reveal items where the same or similar tools may have been used at different times by different binders or binding workshops. Uncovering such similarities can also help link multiple bindings to individual owners, collectors, binders, or workshops --even in cases where a binder may be as yet unidentified --as well as to specific geographical regions or to specific time periods.

The following is a select list:   Shakespeare: Journal of the British Shakespeare Association Shakespeare is a major peer-reviewed journal, publishing articles drawn from the best of current international scholarship on the most recent developments in Shakespearean criticism. Its principal aim is to bridge the gap between the disciplines of Shakespeare in Performance Studies and Shakespeare in English Literature and Language. The journal builds on the existing aim of the British Shakespeare Association , to exploit the synergies between academics and performers of Shakespeare.   Shakespeare Studies Shakespeare Studies is an international volume published annually in hard cover and featuring essays and studies by critics and cultural historians from both hemispheres. Although the journal maintains a focus on the theatrical milieu of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, it is also concerned with Britain's intellectual and cultural connections to the continent, its sociopolitical history, and its place in the emerging globalism of the period. In addition to articles, the journal includes substantialreviews of significant publications dealing with these issues, as well as theoretical studies relevant to scholars of early modern culture.   Shakespeare Survey Shakespeare Survey is a yearbook of Shakespeare studies and production. Since 1948 Survey has published the best international scholarship in English and many of its essays have become classics of Shakespeare criticism. Each volume is devoted to a theme, or play, or group of plays; each also contains a section of reviews of that year's textual and critical studies, and of the year's major British performances. The virtues of accessible scholarship and a keen interest in performance, from Shakespeare's time to our own, have characterised the journal from the start. The books are illustrated with a variety of Shakespearean images and production photographs.   The Hare (online journal) The Hare is a peer-reviewed, on-line academic journal published three times yearly. The journal publishes short essays on the dramatic, poetic, and prose works of Shakespeare and his contemporaries.

Thinking with demons : the idea of witchcraft in early modern Europe - Stuart Clark Call Number: BF1584.E9 C57 1997 This major work offers a new interpretation of the witchcraft beliefs of European intellectuals between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries, showing how these beliefs fitted rationally with other beliefs of the period and how far the nature of rationality is dependent on its historical context.   Witchcraft in Europe, 400-1700: a documentary history - Alan Charles Kors Call Number: BF1566 .W739 2001 Spanning the period from 400 to 1700, Witchcraft in Europe assembles nearly twice as many primary documents as the first edition, many newly translated, along with new illustrations that trace the development of witch-beliefs from late Mediterranean antiquity through the Enlightenment. Trial records, inquisitors' reports, eyewitness statements, and witches' confessions, along with striking contemporary illustrations depicting the career of the Devil and his works, testify to the hundreds of years of terror that enslaved an entire continent.   Marks of an absolute witch: evidentiary dilemmas in early modern England - Orna Alyagon Darr Call Number: KD371.W56 D37 2011 This work explores the social foundation of evidence law in a specific historical social and cultural context - the debate concerning the proof of the crime of witchcraft in early modern England. In this period the question of how to prove the crime of witchcraft was the centre of a public debate and even those who strongly believed in the reality of witchcraft had considerable concerns regarding its proof.   The Ashgate research companion to popular culture in early modern England - Andrew Hadfield Call Number: Electronic resource The Ashgate Research Companion to Popular Culture in Early Modern England is a comprehensive, interdisciplinary examination of current research on popular culture in the early modern era. The authors examine how popular culture impacted upon people's everyday lives during the period, helping to define how individuals and groups experienced the world. Issues as disparate as popular reading cultures, games, food and drink, time, textiles, religious belief and superstition, and the function of festivals and rituals are discussed.   Religion and the Decline of Magic: Studies in popular beliefs in sixteenth and seventeenth century England - Keith Thomas Call Number: BR377 .T48 1997 In this fascinating and detailed book, Keith Thomas shows how magic, like the medieval Church, offered an explanation for misfortune and a means of redress in times of adversity. The supernatural thus had its own practical utility in daily life. Some forms of magic were challenged by the Protestant Reformation, but only with the increased search for scientific explanation of the universe did the English people begin to abandon their recourse to the supernatural.   Crafting the witch: gendering magic in medieval and early modern England - Heidi Breuer Call Number: PN671 .B73 2009 In the earlier texts, magic is predominantly a masculine pursuit, garnering its user prestige and power, but in the later texts, magic becomes a primarily feminine activity, one that marks its user as wicked and heretical. This project explores both the literary and the social motivations for this transformation, seeking an answer to the question, 'why did the witch become wicked?'   Malevolent nurture : witch-hunting and maternal power in early modern England - Deborah Willis Call Number: BF1581 .W55 1995   \"We three\": the mythology of Shakespeare\u2019s weird sisters - Laura Shamas Call Number: PR2823 .S45 2007 This book is an archetypal exploration of the Weird Sisters; by examining this feminine trio through the lens of mythology, new insights about their significance may be understood. The ramifications extend from classical comprehension to twenty-first century pop culture observations related to female trios.   Palgrave advances in witchcraft historiography - edited by Jonathan Barry and Owen Davies Call Number: BF1566 .P245 2007 This is the first book to offer a detailed modern survey of witchcraft historiography. By using a broad chronological structure, from contemporary responses through to modern day developments in historical theory in relation to the study of the history of witchcraft, the book draws on contributions from a range of leading experts to provide a much-needed overview of the area.   Languages of witchcraft: narrative, ideology, and meaning in early modern culture - Stuart Clark Call Number: BF1584.E85 L36 2001 Different conceptions of the world and of reality have made witchcraft possible in some societies and impossible in others. How did the people of early modern Europe experience it, what was it, and what was its place in their culture? The new essays in this collection illustrate the latest trends in witchcraft research and in cultural history in general.   Cunning folk and familiar spirits : shamanistic visionary traditions in early modern British witchcraft and magic - Emma Wilby Call Number: BF1581 .W54 2005 This book contains the first comprehensive examination of popular familiar belief in early modern Britain. It provides an in-depth analysis of the correlation between early modern British magic and tribal shamanism, examines the experiential dimension of popular magic and witchcraft in early modern Britain, and explores the links between British fairy beliefs and witch beliefs.   1603 : the death of Queen Elizabeth I, the return of the Black Plague, the rise of Shakespeare, piracy, witchcraft and the birth of the Stuart era - Christopher Lee Call Number: DA391 .L425 2004 Focuses on a crucial year in English history, 1603, the year that Queen Elizabeth I died and the monarchy passed from the Tudors to the Stuarts - from the house of Henry VIII to James VI of Scotland who ruled as James I of England. It was also the year the Black Death returned, killing some 30,000 out of a population of four million.

Think of the fairies in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" or Prospero's magical books in \"The Tempest\" - and these are just a few examples of the many occurances of things magical, dark, and supernatural in Shakespeare's plays. This page will assist you in finding some specific resources pertaining to witchcraft in the early modern period and its connection to Shakespeare's work.                                                  Subject Headings                  Subject headings are words and phrases which consitiute a \"controlled vocabulary\" to categorize books by subject field. Subject headings often indicate the contents of books in terms that their titles do not use, which often may be very general. Subject headings in online databases are often referred to as descriptors, but they serve the same purpose in locating valuable resources. Using a \"keyword\" search will identify catalog entries that contain those specific terms which can add value to a search; however, the terms can be found anywhere - author, notes, publisher, etc. - therefore there is no indication of the value of the term(s) as content matter of the items in a results list.    Use general subject headings for searching a broad topic or more specific subject headings for a specific text, film, or play.

The Witchcraft Collection is a rich source for students and scholars of the history of superstition and witchcraft persecution in Europe. It documents the earliest and the latest manifestations of the belief in witchcraft as well as its geographical boundaries, and elaborates this history with works on canon law, the Inquisition, torture, demonology, trial testimony, and narratives. Most importantly, the collection focuses on witchcraft not as folklore or anthropology, but as theology and as religious heresy. These titles were originally digitally scanned from microfilm by Primary Source Microfilm and the images were returned to Cornell University.

Kantorowicz Call Number: JC385 .K25 1997 Kantorowicz traces the historical problem posed by the \"King's two bodies\"--the body politic and the body natural--back to the Middle Ages and demonstrates, by placing the concept in its proper setting of medieval thought and political theory, how the early-modern Western monarchies gradually began to develop a \"political theology.\"   Shakespeare and the law - Paul Raffield and Gary Watt Call Number: KD612 .S53 2008 Shakespeare and the Law is evidence of the continued vitality of its topic; the range of approaches it offers ensures that those specialising in early modern law and literature will find much of value here, as will scholars of Shakespeare.

A bibliography is defined as a list of books or other works, such as journal articles, which relate to a particular subject, period, or author. Annotated bibliographies contain brief summaries of each source and a description of its relevance. Bibliographies can be very helpful because they give researchers an overview of what has been written about a particular subject and can also offer a starting point in the research process.

The complete series: Richard II, Henry IV part 1, Henry IV part 2, Henry V - Directed by Richard Eyre, Rupert Goold, and Thea Sharrock Call Number: DVD 31447 This stunning adaptation tells the story of three Kings, Richard II, Henry IV & Henry V and their battle for survival. Shakespeare's epic yet intimate plays are filmed in the visually breathtaking landscape and architecture of the period. Superb performances by Ben Whishaw, Tom Hiddleston & Jeremy Irons are not to be missed. These rich films are woven with the some of Shakespeare's finest poetry.   Much Ado About Nothing - Directed by Joss Whedon Call Number: DVD 31925 Joss Whedon's sexy and contemporary spin on Shakespeare's classic comedy about the story of sparring lovers Beatrice and Benedick offers a sensual, tragic and occasionally absurd view of the intricate game that is love.   Shakespeare Uncovered - PBS Call Number: DVD 28763 Six episodes combine history, biography, iconic performances, new analysis and the personal passion of its celebrated hosts Ethan Hawke, Jeremy Irons, Derek Jacobi, Trevor Nunn, Joely Richardson and David Tennant to tell the story behind the stories of Shakespeare's greatest plays.   Henry IV, Part I (Shakespeare's Globe) - Directed by Dominic Dromgoole Call Number: DVD 25174 The first installment of Shakespeare's gripping account of the rise of Hal from idle barfly to monarch-in-waiting combines compelling power politics with the hilarious antics of Falstaff, Shakespeare's greatest comic creation.   Macbeth - Directed by Rupert Goold Following a London West End run in December 2007, a sold-out limited engagement at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in March 2008, and a subsequent eight-week run on Broadway, director Rupert Goold's gripping stage production of Macbeth starring Patrick Stewart in a triumphant, Tony-nominated performance filmed for television in a co-production agreement between WNET.ORG and Illuminations Television, in association with the BBC. Goold will maintain the atmosphere and tone of the critically acclaimed stage production which relocates the action to a nameless 20th-century underground facility, offering a parable of the quest for power in the modern world.   Hamlet (Royal Shakespeare Company) - Directed by Greg Doran It's to director Gregory Doran's incredible credit that his staging of that most familiar of English-language plays, Shakespeare's Hamlet, should be completely reinvigorated by a modern interpretation of the tragedy as a true psychological thriller. This Hamlet, filmed in 2009, presents the inner torment of the Danish prince Hamlet as a believable, relatable controlled explosion of emotions, each more unmanageable than the last. Besides the director, the casting is also brilliant, including David Tennant as Hamlet and Patrick Stewart as Hamlet's uncle Claudius and the ghost of Hamlet's father. The direction is brisk, and the acting is first rate.   As You Like It (Shakespeare's Globe Theatre) - Directed by Thea Sharrock Thea Sharrock's irresistible new production of Shakespeare's popular romantic comedy stirs wit, sentiment, intrigue and love into a charming confection which challenges the traditional rules of romance. At its heart, a feisty but feminine Rosalind (Naomi Frederick), in love with the endearingly na\u00efve Orlando (Jack Laskey), uses her disguise as Ganymede to counsel him playfully in the art of wooing. Distraction is provided by Dominic Rowan, a remarkably funny Touchstone, and Tim McMullan, whose sonorous tones are perfectly suited to the lugubrious wit of Jaques.   King Lear (Royal Shakespeare Company) - Directed by Sir Trevor Nunn and Chris Hunt Sir Ian McKellan stars as King Lear in this Royal Shakespeare Company production that was televised on PBS Masterpiece Theatre.   Henry VIII (Shakespeare's Globe) - Directed by Mark Rosenblatt Call Number: DVD 24213 The Tudor Court is locked in a power struggle between its nobles and the Machiavellian Cardinal Wolsey, the King's first minister and the country's most conspicuous symbol of Catholic power.

It&rsquo;s a tapestry of cinematic art that infuses the poetry of William Shakespeare into the poetry of New York City. It&rsquo;s huge, it&rsquo;s visceral and it&rsquo;s right here.   We began this project as a continuation of our mission &ndash; getting new audiences to like Shakespeare. After raising almost $50,000 in a Kickstarter campaign we embarked on a journey &ndash; to film all of Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets, each performed by a different actor in a carefully chosen New York City location. It began as project with a deadline &ndash; by Shakespeare&rsquo;s 450th birthday (April 23rd 2014) all 154 sonnets would be assigned, filmed and released on our website and YouTube.     The Sonnet Project very quickly blossomed into something more. It became apparent that each sonnet was not simply a &lsquo;video&rsquo; &ndash; not simply an actor standing at a monument reciting a sonnet &ndash; but a short independent film. Every single sonnet required time and effort beyond our imagining. But the finished product! Each one is expansive , narrative &ndash; a work of art.   We decided to focus on the journey rather than the destination &ndash; the Project will not be finished by April. But that&rsquo;s ok. In fact, it&rsquo;s more than ok because the Project has exploded into a sprawling , barely controllable, ever-growing, ever-changing tribute to Shakespeare&rsquo;s art, New York City, and the artists that live here. And we love it.

Theatrical performances of Shakespeare's plays are unique and ephemeral experiences for the lucky few in the audience. However, versions of Shakespeare's plays are often filmed and preserved for posterity either as filmed stage performances or cinematic adaptations of the plays. The Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media located on the second floor of the Bobst Library holds over 28,000 videos including a wide variety of Shakespearean performances and documentaries. The database, Theatre in Video , contains more than 250 performances of the world's leading plays, together with more than 100 documentaries. It includes recently captured productions from Shakespeare's Globe Thetare in London as well as documentaries on acting from the Royal Shakespeare Company and a documentary on the reconstructed Globe Theatre in London, all in streaming video. The BBC Shakespeare Plays/Ambrose Video offer in streaming video the historical BBC television event which features productions the whole Shakespearean canon.

Comments (0)                                         Shakespeare on Film                 The Shakespeare's Globe Theatre production of Richard II from the 2003 Season of Regime Change, starring Mark Rylance and directed by Tim Carroll, aims to replicate the authentic Shakespearean experience as accurately as possible. This all-male interpretation was filmed and aired on BBC Four in late 2003. A number of clips from this \"original practices\" production are available on YouTube. In his dual role as actor and Artistic Director for the Globe Theatre, Rylance was recognized (and often criticized) for his attempts to envision and re-create Shakespeare's plays as they may have appeared to Shakespeare's original audiences. While watching this clip, observe the meticulous attention to detail in the construction of the Theatre, the stage decoration, and the lavish costumes. But, more importantly, pay attention to the interplay between actor and audience that the open playing space of the Globe Theatre encourages.

Filmed between 1978 and 1985, the full-length productions are traditional interpretations of the plays set in either Shakespeare's own time (1564 to 1616) or in the historical period of the events depicted (such as ancient Rome for Julius Caesar, or c1400 for Richard II etc). This series features one of the greatest casts ever assembled with actors from both stage and screen including notable classical actors such as John Gielgud, Patrick Stewart, Anthony Hopkins, Bob Hoskins, Jane Lapotaire and Helen Mirren.

Samuel Crowl, a noted scholar of Shakespeare on film, unpacks the process of adapting from text to screen through concentrating on two sharply contrasting film versions of Hamlet by Laurence Olivier (1948) and Kenneth Branagh (1996). The films\u2019 socio-political contexts are explored, and the importance of their screenplay, film score, setting, cinematography and editing examined.   The Cambridge companion to Shakespeare on film - edited by Russell Jackson Call Number: PR3093 .C36 2007 Film adaptations of Shakespeare's plays are increasingly popular and now figure prominently in the study of his work and its reception. An international team of leading scholars discuss Shakespearean films from a variety of perspectives: as works of art in their own right; as products of the international movie industry; and as the work of particular directors from Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles to Franco Zeffirelli and Kenneth Branagh. They also consider specific issues such as the portrayal of Shakespeare's women and the supernatural. The emphasis is on feature films for cinema, rather than television, with strong coverage of Hamlet, Richard III, Macbeth, King Lear and Romeo and Juliet.   Almost Shakespeare : reinventing his works for cinema and television - James R.

This collection of essays addresses the use of Shakespearean narratives, themes, imagery, and characterizations in non-Shakespearian cinema. The essays explore how Shakespeare and his work are manipulated within the popular media and explore topics such as racism, jealousy, misogyny and nationality.   Shakespeare, film studies, and the visual cultures of modernity - Anthony R. Guneratne Call Number: PR3093 .G86 2008 Shakespeare, Film Studies, and the Visual Cultures of Modernity elucidates the ways in which Shakespeare as a cultural phenomenon has influenced the development of nearly every dimension of cinema. An erudite and entertaining examination of interactions of words, images, music, dance, and theatrical styles, this book is an innovative history of the most globally pervasive medium of entertainment and a multidisciplinary insight into the continuing influence of the most revered and universal of Renaissance dramatists.   Shakespeare, cinema and desire: adaptation and other futures of Shakespeare's language - Simon Ryle Call Number: PR3093 .R95 2014 Shakespeare, Cinema and Desire explores the desires and the futures of Shakespeare's language and cinematographic adaptations of Shakespeare. Tracing ways that film offers us a rich new understanding of Shakespeare, Simon Ryle highlights issues that are central to both Shakespeare and film: media technologies, narrative territories and flows, mourning and loss, the voice, the body, sexuality and gender.

A seemingly simple tale of shifting devotions among mismatched lovers, it helped launch the genre of rom-com.

But putting documents or pages on the web is easy, cheap or free, unregulated, and unmonitored (at least in the USA). The great wealth that the Internet has brought to so much of society is the ability for people to express themselves, find one another, exchange ideas, discover possible peers worldwide they never would have otherwise met, and, through hypertext links in web pages, suggest so many other people's ideas and personalities to anyone who comes and clicks.   Therein lies the rationale for evaluating carefully whatever you find on the Web. The burden is on you - the reader - to establish the validity , authorship , timeliness , and integrity of what you find. Documents can easily be copied and falsified or copied with omissions and errors -- intentional or accidental. In the general World Wide Web there are no editors (unlike most print publications) to proofread and \"send it back\" or \"reject it\" until it meets the standards of a publishing house's reputation. Most pages found in general search engines for the web are self-published or published by businesses small and large with motives to get you to buy something or believe a point of view. The web needs to be free like that!! And you, if you want to use it for serious research, need to cultivate the habit of healthy skepticism, of questioning everything you find with critical thinking.   There are many unreliable sites out there, but there is also treasure to be found. This wonderful tutorial to help you critically evaluate the information you find on the Web has been put together by the UC Berkeley - Teaching Library Internet Workshops .

The Association holds annual meetings in different North American cities so that its members can exchange ideas and discuss strategies for reading, teaching, researching, and writing about Shakespeare's works and their many contexts. Sessions at these conferences include formal papers, seminars, workshops, and performances of plays by selected acting groups. The SAA also sponsors long-range projects of importance to Shakespearean scholarship, offers programs for high school teachers of Shakespeare, supports and tries to advance the values of the humanities more generally, and assists in the planning of world congresses in Shakespeare studies.

Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um)  is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author  of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.         Students, in the process of learning, acquire ideas from many sources and exchange ideas and opinions with classmates, professors, and others. This occurs in reading, writing, and discussion. Students are expected&mdash;often required&mdash;to build their own work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do. Giving credit to someone whose work has helped one is courteous and honest; in fact, not to give such credit is a crime. Plagiarism is the severest form of academic fraud. Plagiarism is theft.       More specifically, plagiarism is presenting as your own:                   a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks;    a paraphrased passage from another writer's work;    facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet;    another student's work with your name on it;    a purchased paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill.       Other forms of academic fraud include:       \"collaborating\" between two or more students who then submit the same paper under their individual names.    submitting the same paper for two or more courses without the knowledge and the expressed permission of all teachers involved.    giving permission to another student to use your work for a class.       Proper acknowledgement marks the difference. It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.

Fuseli first read Shakespeare's plays as a student in Z&uuml;rich. This painting illustrates the scene in A Midsummer Night's Dream in which the Fairy Queen Titania is punished for her pride by her husband Oberon. He casts a spell which makes her fall in love with Bottom, whose head has been magically replaced by that of an ass. Here Titania orders her fairies to serve his every whim. Shakespeare's enchanted realm held a special appeal for Fuseli, allowing him to explore the supernatural world. This painting was commissioned by the publisher John Boydell as part of his 'Shakespeare Gallery'. This work is currently on display at the Tate Britain.

The famous actress, Dame Ellen Terry (1847-1928), is shown here in the role of Lady Macbeth. At the first performance in 1888, Sargent was struck by Terry's appearance and persuaded her to sit for a portrait. Terry's costume for the role was sewn over with real green beetle wings! The artist invented her dramatic pose, which did not occur in the production. Oscar Wilde, who saw Terry's arrival at Sargent's Chelsea studio, remarked, 'The street that on a wet and dreary morning has vouchsafed the vision of Lady Macbeth in full regalia magnificently seated in a four-wheeler can never again be as other streets: it must always be full of wonderful possibilities.' This work is currently on display at the Tate Britain.

He received his early education at the King's School in Canterbury and was later awarded a scholarship to study at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Scholars recognize Marlowe as the first English dramatist to reveal the full potential of blank verse poetry, and as one who made significant advances in the genre of English tragedy through keen examinations of Renaissance morality. Marlowe wrote during the Elizabethan period, a time of change and uncertainty. The spirit of the age was marked by both the Renaissance and the Reformation. This was a time when society had begun to loose itself from medieval institutions and to celebrate the ascendancy of the individual. Marlowe witnessed these developments first-hand and began to explore the potential consequences of this newfound freedom. The dangers of excessive ambition abd the apparent compulsion to strive for more than one already has forms a major theme in Marlowe's plays. Although his achievements have been generally overshadowed by his exact contemporary, William Shakespeare, many critics contend that had he not died young, Marlowe's reputation would certainly have rivaled that of the more famous playwright.

It isn't long before Faustus has doubts about the bargain, but Mephistopheles has plenty of entertainment at hand to distract Faustus from the terrifying reality of his position and the prospect of its agonizing conclusion. In Doctor Faustus, the greatest tragedy in English before Shakespeare, Marlowe puts some of the finest poetry ever written for the stage and a good deal of anarchic comedy at the service of a mythic tale illustrating mankind's insatiable desire for knowledge and power. Featuring Paul Hilton as Faustus and Arthur Darvill as Mephistopheles.

This study balances close literary readings with lucidly presented historical context to give us a portrait of a brilliant but volatile enigma who shunned convention in favor of risk and marginality.   Christopher Marlowe : poet & spy - Park Honan Call Number: PR2673 .H57 2005 In this well-crafted biography, Honan sheds light on the much-speculated (and previously erroneously reported) aspects of Marlowe's life without neglecting its more ordinary features (his stable two-parent upbringing, his diligent scholarship at Cambridge) or destroying the poet's aura of intrigue.   Christopher Marlowe the craftsman : lives, stage, and page - Sarah Scott Call Number: PR2677.T4 C47 2010 Contributions to this volume explore the idea of Marlowe as a working artist, in keeping with John Addington Symonds' characterization of him as a 'sculptor-poet'. The collection engages in new ways the controversies and complexities of its subject's life and art. It reflects the flourishing state of Marlowe studies as it shapes the twenty-first century conception of the poet and playwright as master craftsman.   The Marlowe-Shakespeare continuum: Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, and the authorship of early Shakespeare and anonymous plays - Donna N. Murphy Call Number: PR2678 .M87 2013 In The Marlowe-Shakespeare Continuum, Donna N. Murphy demonstrates how Marlowe, sometimes in co-authorship with humorist Nashe, appears to have \"become\" Shakespeare on a linguistic basis. She documents a sharp, upward learning curve, with the initial penning of works she examines in the following chronological order: Caesar's Revenge, Henry VI, The Taming of a Shrew, Henry VI, Edward III, Titus Andronicus, Thomas of Woodstock, Romeo and Juliet, and Henry IV, and separates certain plays into Marlowe and Nashe components. Those who read Murphy's book with an open mind will find her work surprisingly convincing.   French origins of English tragedy - Richard Hillman Call Number: PR2823 .H55 2010 Richard Hillman applies to tragic patterns and practices in early modern England his long-standing critical preoccupation with English-French cultural connections in the period. With primary, though not exclusive, reference on the English side to Shakespeare and Marlowe, and on the French side to a wide range of dramatic and non-dramatic material, he focuses on distinctive elements that emerge within the English tragedy of the 1590s and early 1600s. These include the self-destructive tragic hero, the apparatus of neo-Senecanism (including the Machiavellian villain) and the confrontation between the warrior-hero and the femme fatale.   Placing the plays of Christopher Marlowe fresh cultural contexts - Sara Munson Deats; Robert A. Logan Call Number: PR2674 .P58 2008eb Focusing upon Marlowe the playwright as opposed to Marlowe the man, the essays in this collection position the dramatist's plays within the dramaturgical, ethical, and sociopolitical matrices of his own era. The volume also examines some of the most heated controversies of the early modern period 'such as the anti-theatrical debate, the relations between parents and children, Machiavaelli's ideology, the legitimacy of sectarian violence, and the discourse of addiction. Some of the chapter also explore Marlowe's polysemous influence on the theater of his time and of later periods, but, most centrally, upon his more famous contemporary poet/playwright, William Shakespeare.   Christopher Marlowe and the renaissance of tragedy - Douglas Cole Call Number: PR2674 .C59 1995 Assesses the consequences of Marlowe's life in the theatre: how his plays transformed the literary traditions of his time and how they helped redefine the themes of tragedy.  Elizabethan erotic narratives : irony and pathos in the Ovidian poetry of Shakespeare, Marlowe, and their contemporaries - William Keach Call Number: PR539.N3 K4   Marlowe and the popular tradition : innovation in the English drama before 1595 - Ruth Lunney Call Number: PR2677.P4 L86 2002 Marlowe and the Popular Tradition turns away from popular stereotypes to consider Marlowe as a popular dramatist who inherited an audience with certain expectations and shared experiences. This work explores Marlowe's engagement with the traditions of the popular stage in the 1580's and early 1590's. It offers a new approach to his major plays in terms of staging and audience response, as well as providing a new account of the English drama in these important but largely neglected years.   Christopher Marlowe, Renaissance dramatist - Lisa Hopkins Call Number: PR2674 .H67 2008 This book offers a lively introduction to all of the plays of Christopher Marlowe and to the central concerns of his age, many of which are still important to us& mdash;religious uncertainty, the clash between Islam and Christianity, ideas of sexuality, and the role of the marginalised inidividual in society. Each chapter focuses on a specific aspect of Marlowe's work and its cultural contexts: Marlowe's life and death; the Marlowe canon; the theatrical contexts and stage history of the plays; Marlowe's interest in old and new branches of knowledge; the ways in which he transgresses against established norms and values; and the major issues which have been raised in critical discussions of his plays.

A prolific Elizabethan dramatist and a man of letters highly learned inthe classics, he profoundly influenced the coming Augustan age through his emphasis on the precepts of Horace, Aristotle, and other early thinkers. While he is now remembered primarily for his satirical comedies, he also distinguished himself as a poet, preeminent writer of masques, edudite defender of his work, and the originator of English literary criticism. Jonson's professional reputation is often obscured by that of the man himself: bold, independent, aggressive, fashioning for himself an image as the sole arbiter of taste, standing for erudition and the supremacy of classical models against what he percieved as the general populace's ingorant prefence for the sensational. While his direct influence can be sen in each genre that he undertook, his ultimate influence is considered to be a legacy of literary craftsmanship, a strong sense of artistic form and control, and his role in bringing, as Alexander Pope noted, \"critical learning into vogue.\"     Excerpted from Drama Criticism .

It includes essays on poetry, theatre, criticism, religion, law, the court, the curriculum, medicine, commerce, the city, and family life.     The journal is also concerned with the manifestation of these and other interests in Renaissance life and culture generally and so contains material not only concerning Jonson specifically but of significance to the age in which he lived.

It offers a clear sense, afforded by no other previous edition, of the shape, scale, and variety of the entire Jonsonian canon.

Donaldson depicts a life full of drama. Jonson's early satirical play, The Isle of Dogs, landed him in prison, and brought all theatrical activity in London to a temporary--and very nearly permanent--standstill. He was \"almost at the gallows\" for killing a fellow actor after a quarrel, and converted to Catholicism while awaiting execution. He supped with the Gunpowder conspirators on the eve of their planned coup at Westminster. After satirizing the Scots in Eastward Ho! he was imprisoned again, and throughout his career was repeatedly interrogated about plays and poems thought to contain seditious or slanderous material. Throughout this lively biography, Donaldson provides the fullest picture available of Jonson's personal, political, spiritual, and intellectual interests, and he insightfully discusses all of Jonson's major poetry and drama, plus some newly discovered works.   The Cambridge companion to Ben Jonson - Richard Harp; Stanley Stewart Call Number: PR2631 .C35 2000 Ben Jonson is, in many ways, the figure of greatest centrality to literary study of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period. He wrote in virtually every literary genre: in drama, comedy, tragedy and masque; in poetry, epigram, and lyric; in prose, literary criticism and English grammar. This Companion brings together leading scholars from both sides of the Atlantic to provide an accessible, up-to-date introduction to Jonson's life and works. It represents an invaluable guide to current critical perspectives, providing generous coverage not only of his plays but also his non dramatic works.   Ben Jonson : a life - David Riggs Call Number: PR2631 .R54 1989 Ben Jonson, Shakespeare's slightly younger contemporary, is the earliest English author who left behind enough evidence to make a literary biography possible. Not that the evidence is, by modern standards, voluminous. We do not know for certain when Jonson was born, who his father was or how long he went to school. His relationships with patrons and fellow writers are obscure, and his conduct was sometimes so reckless as to defy rational explanation. His determined efforts to fashion a persona only make his personality murkier. On paper, he was both a champion of morality and a venturer into the near neighborhood of pornography. David Riggs' thorough biography emphasizes Jonson's contradictions.   Imitation and praise in the poems of Ben Jonson - Richard S. Peterson Call Number: PR2642.P63 P47 2011 Richard Peterson offered an important revaluation of the poetry of Ben Jonson and a new appreciation of the way in which the classical doctrine of imitation - the creative use of the thoughts and words of predecessors - permeates and shapes Jonson's critical ideas and his work as a whole. The publication of the original book in 1981 led to a reinterpretation of the poems and a coherent view of Jonson's philosophy; the resulting portrait of Johnson served as a corrective to earlier views based primarily on the satiric poems and plays.   Ben Jonson in context - Julie Sanders Call Number: PR2638 .B465 2010 Established and emergent Jonson scholars react to major new advances in thinking about the writer and his canon of works. Generously illustrated throughout, the first part of the volume considers Jonson's career from biographical, critical, and performance-based angles; the second looks at cultural and historical contexts.  Ben Johnson : a literary life - W. David Kay Call Number: PR2631 .K39 1995 This concise biography surveys Jonson's career and provides an introduction to his works in the context of Jacobean politics, court patronage and his many literary rivalries. Stressing his wit and inventiveness, it explores the strategies by which he attempted to maintain his independence from the conditions of theatrical production and from his patrons and introduces new evidence that, despite his vaunted classicism, he repeatedly appropriated the matter or forms of other English writers in order to demonstrate his own artistic superiority.   Jonson, Horace and the classical tradition - Victoria Moul Call Number: PR2642.R65 M68 2010 The influence of the Roman poet Horace on Ben Jonson has often been acknowledged, but never fully explored. Discussing Jonson's Horatianism in detail, this study also places Jonson's densely intertextual relationship with Horace's Latin text within the broader context of his complex negotiations with a range of other 'rivals' to the Horatian model including Pindar, Seneca, Juvenal and Martial. The new reading of Jonson's classicism that emerges is one founded not upon static imitation, but rather a lively dialogue between competing models - an allusive mode that extends into the seventeenth-century reception of Jonson himself as a latter-day 'Horace'. In the course of this analysis, the book provides fresh readings of many of Jonson's best known poems - including 'Inviting a Friend to Dinner' and 'To Penshurst' - as well as a new perspective on many lesser known pieces, and a range of unpublished manuscript material.   Ben Jonson and the politics of genre - A.D. Cousins and Allison D. Scott Call Number: PR2642.P64 B46 2009 While Ben Jonson's political visions have been well documented, this is the first study to consider how he threaded his views into the various literary genres in which he wrote. For Jonson, these genres were interactive and mutually affirming, necessary for negotiating the tempestuous politics of early modern society, and here some of the most renowned Jonson scholars provide a collection of essays that discuss his use of genre. They present new perspectives on many of Jonson's major works, from his epigrams and epistles, through to his Roman tragedies and satirical plays like Volpone. Other topics examined include Jonson's diverse representations of monarchy, his ambiguous celebrations of European commonwealths, his sexual politics, and his engagement with the issues of republicanism. These essays represent the forefront of critical thinking on Ben Jonson, and offer a timely reassessment of the author's political life in Jacobean and Caroline Britain.   Our scene is London : Ben Jonson's city and the space of the author - James D. Mardock Call Number: PR2634 .M37 2008 In this thought-provoking study Mardock looks at Ben Jonson's epigrams, prose, and verse satire in order to focus on Jonson's theatrical appropriations of London space both in and out of the playhouse. Through this critical analysis, the author argues that the strategies of authorial definition that Jonson pursued throughout his career as a poet and playwright were in large part determined by two intersecting factors: first, his complicated relationship with London's physical places and its institutional topography, and secondly--challenging commonplace assumptions about Jonson's anti-theatricality--the distinctly theatrical model of spatial practice that he brought to bear on his representation of the urban experience.

To ambitious young writers, London was a magnet offering the possibility of fame, excitement, wealth and opportunity beyond their wildest dreams. Arriving in London from quite ordinary backgrounds - Marlowe was the son of a shoemaker, Shakespeare's family were leather workers, Jonson's stepfather a bricklayer - they suddenly found themselves feted, offered large sums of money, the darlings of audiences - and they created drama off stage as well as on. Like footballer and media celebrtities of today, they behaved like the stars they thought themselves to be - drinking with wild abandon, partying, courting publicity - their reputations growing in the telling. Some set out to shock; some drank too much; some, like Christopher Marlowe, became involved in fights, fatally; a few ran headlong into political danger. This lively and engaging book, packed with anecdote, recreates the lives and times of these playwrights and actors, and the world in which they lived from 1578 when Burbage built the first purpose built theatre to 1620 when the great age came to its end.

Lusardi - Paul Nelsen Call Number: Electronic Resource This book assembles a cast of sixteen distinguished theater historians and performance critics, each of whom has contributed significantly to our understanding of issues associated with performing works of Shakespeare and his contemporaries.  Shakespeare and His Contemporaries in Performance - Edward J. Esche Call Number: PR3091 .S33 2000 The recreation of the Globe Theatre in London has heightened interest in Shakespeare performance studies. The essays in this volume testify to this burgeoning research into issues surrounding contemporary performances of plays by Shakespeare and his fellow dramatists, as well as modern trends and developments in state and media presentations of these works. International in coverage, the discussion here ranges across the performance and reception of Shakespeare in Japan, India, Germany, Italy, Denmark and the United States, as well as in Britain. Exploring many of the issues in Shakespeare studies, the volume aims to give a global perspective on Renaissance performance and the wide variety of ways in which it has been translated by today's media.   Reinventing the Renaissance: Shakespeare and his Contemporaries in Adaptation and Performance - Sarah Brown Call Number: PR2880.A1 R455 2013 The plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries continue to inspire fresh interpretations in every genre and medium. Reinventing the Renaissance: Shakespeare and his Contemporaries in Adaptation and Performance offers new perspectives on the ways in which writers, critics, directors, artists, and other creative practitioners have used Renaissance drama to address current concerns and reach new audiences. As well as exploring the fortunes of Shakespeare and his contemporaries in more expected contexts, such as film and theatre, these essays examine the relationship between the plays and new social media, detective fiction, translation, ballet, and illustration. The collection also reconsiders the boundary which separates critical and creative responses to Shakespeare by including explorations of 'creativity' in Shakespeare's biographers, as well as a creative revisioning of Macbeth. Written by an international team of scholars, this accessible and innovative volume will provide a valuable resource for all readers and researchers interested in the creative reception of Renaissance English drama.   Shakespeare and the Drama of His Time - Martin Wiggins Call Number: PR651 .W49 2000 William Shakespeare lived and worked during an extraordinary quarter-century in the history of English drama, which saw the development of new kinds of tragedy and comedy, and the birth of the entirely new genre of tragicomedy. Beginning with the institutional foundations that were laid with the emergence of the commercial theater business in 1570s London, Shakespeare and the Drama of His Time describes the principal audience fashions, artistic conventions, and professional circumstances which defined, and enabled, his remarkable plays and those of his colleagues.
