At the NYU Dental Faculty Practice, we believe that the best interests of patients are served by utilizing the expertise of our doctors consisting of general dentists, endodontists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, orthodontists, periodontists, and prosthodontists, all working collaboratively in a multidisciplinary approach to patient care.

Implants are biocompatible tooth roots          that integrate with the jawbone, where they become          the foundation for a natural-looking restoration.                                                              Cone Beam 3-D Digital Imaging                               The NYU Dental Faculty Practice utilizes the latest technology, including the cone beam imaging system, sometimes referred to as a          cone beam CAT scan, which provides highly accurate, high definition, 3-D images of a patient\u2019s mouth, face, and jaws.                                                              Additional Services                               In addition to the services listed, the NYU Dental Faculty Practice also provides treatment for complex problems affecting the mouth and face, such as oral cancer, corrective          jaw surgery, dry mouth, and chronic facial pain.
