Students who wish to broaden their knowledge and educational experience have the opportunity to pursue a double concentration in a select combination of existing concentrations.           Expand All   Collapse All          Art History        In our visually dominated world, images often are seen as mere \u201cbackground noise.\u201d The discipline of art history trains us how to see images with a more critical eye by teaching us how to analyze and comprehend the cultural, social, and political messages that lie hidden beneath art\u2019s aesthetic beauty. Provided with an understanding of, and facility with, the language of art, students learn to analyze how the artist\u2019s creative process both influenced, and was influenced by, the cultural context in which the art was created. The curriculum includes a selection of studio art course options allowing students to experience the creative process in a hands-on fashion. Our school\u2019s proximity to the many great museums and art galleries in New York City helps to reinforce knowledge learned in the classroom.   The art history concentration recognizes the importance of practical application tracks as career foundation options for students and offers three distinct tracks from which students may chose: art business, fine and decorative art appraisal, and arts administration. Graduates of our program have gone on to graduate studies in art history, museum studies, art education, art restoration and conservation, and library science, while others have found employment in auction houses, arts administration, advertising, and art galleries.

In the last phase of their studies, students participate in interdisciplinary humanities seminars that combine reading, writing, theory, and method. These courses precede the Senior Project in the Humanities .           Foundation Courses by Concentration         20 Credits .

You will learn to read analytically, to write critically, and to speak conceptually about literary works. You will explore the dynamic interaction of literary forms with history, science, politics, and social change, developing responses that are both unique and valid. Because of its cultural depth and the emphasis on analytical reading and writing skills, a specialization in literature is considered excellent preparation for career advancement and professional studies in fields such as business administration, law, and the social services, as well as for further study in humanities fields.         Foundation Courses by Concentration         20 credits . Prior to beginning this concentration, students must complete Introduction to Literature: The Craft of Reading and one of the following courses. In consultation with their advisor, students also select three additional courses from the humanities and social sciences foundation courses. Oral Traditions in Literature or Major 20th-century Writers (from the core curriculum ) is recommended. Those planning to attend graduate school are advised to take at least two semesters of a foreign language.
