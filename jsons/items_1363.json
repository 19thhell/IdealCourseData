Groups like the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Non-Violence Coordinating Committee (SNCC) organized students to perform educational work, to demonstrate throughout New York, and to support community voter registration and legal counseling. By 1965, student concerns began to change focus, concentrating on the escalating American involvement in Vietnam.

A few weeks later, a sizeable group of NYU students headed off to Washington to protest the war.     Students also began to focus on the need for University administrative reform. In the fall of 1965, four of the major student organizations on campus-CORE, Friends of SNCC, SDS, and CEWV-formed a coalition called the New Student Union (NSU). While NSUs campaign to challenge a tuition hike in December of 1965 proved unsuccessful, NSU succeeded in creating the so-called \"Students University at NYU,\" an alternative institution that challenged the political orientation of the official curriculum by offering courses in black history, the history of the Vietnam war, and Marxist economics.

Registration is now available.                                                           The 40th anniversary of the ending of the Vietnam War and 50th anniversary of the major U.S. escalation and first antiwar protests provide an appropriate occasion for reflecting upon the history of the war and examining its critical lessons. The U.S. Department of Defense is sponsoring an official Vietnam War Commemoration to honor veterans of the war and highlight the service of the armed forces, while also paying tribute to the contributions of people on the home front during that long and difficult period of American history. It is appropriate to honor those who served, but it is also necessary to learn the lessons of the war.   The conference on \u201cAssessing the Critical Lessons\u201d will examine the following themes:   &gt; Was the war just?  &gt; War or revolution?  &gt; A winnable war?  &gt; The misconduct of war and impacts in Vietnam  &gt; Diplomacy  &gt; Lessons in U.S. Foreign Policy  &gt; The Anti-war movement     This conference will address these and related questions through a systematic assessment of the decisions that led to the war and of the ways in which the war was fought.     It is appropriate to honor those who served, but it is also necessary to learn the lessons of the war. As former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said in his 2014 Veterans Day remarks at the Vietnam Memorial,   &quot;The Wall reminds us to be honest in our telling of history. There is nothing to be gained by glossing over the darker portions of a war ... that bitterly divided America. We must openly acknowledge past mistakes, and we must learn from past mistakes, because that is how we avoid repeating past mistakes.&quot;             Panel 1: Was the War Just? - Wed, April 29 at 4:30pm                                           Was the war necessary strategically and ethically?

Russell Smith Professor of International Relations and Politics, in the Politics Department of Pomona College in Claremont, California, and author of \u201cThe Vietnamese War\u201d and \u201cChanging Worlds.\u201d Professor Elliott spent many years in Vietnam during the Vietnam War era performing academic research for his own studies as well as for the RAND Corporation. During this time, he acquired a large collection of original books in the Vietnamese language covering a wide range of topics, from literature, to politics, history, economics, ethnography, anthropology, and sociology. Most were published in South Vietnam. Some, acquired in Hong Kong, were published by the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam or by the North. After the war, he returned to Vietnam, and was able to acquire many books published in North Vietnam during the war and after. A small number of publications are in English or French. This is a collection, now unavailable as original publications, that reflects the war period and encompasses both sides of the conflict in Vietnam. The rest represent retrospective works on the war North and South, or reflect conditions in Vietnam following the war.                           Mai Elliott                                           Author, RAND in Southeast Asia: A History of the Vietnam War Era (RAND Corporation)                               Mai Elliott was raised in Vietnam and is a graduate of Georgetown University. Her memoir, The Sacred Willow: Four Generations in the Life of a Vietnamese Family (Oxford University Press) was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 2000. It is notable for investigating, with a novelist\u2019s eye for detail and a historian\u2019s grasp of events, the stories of a family involved in every thread of the war against French colonial rule and the Vietnam War.    Her great-grandfather was a mandarin and member of the imperial court; her father was a government official under French rule; her older sister married an engineer who joined the Viet Minh resistance against the French under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh. Mai herself enrolled in Georgetown\u2019s School of Foreign Service in 1960 and met her husband, the political scientist David Elliott, at a Christmas party at the Vietnamese embassy in 1961.    Upon her graduation, she returned to Saigon where she interviewed Viet Cong prisoners of war and defectors for the RAND Corporation then performing research on the morale and motivation of the insurgents. Following her return to the United States, she worked in banking before retiring to write her personal, family-centered account of modern Vietnamese history. Besides being nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, The Sacred Willow was selected as a finalist for the Asian-American Literary Award (Asian American Writers Workshop).    Mai Elliott has recently published a book exploring the history of RAND\u2019s involvement in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War era through its research projects in the Republic of Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand.                         Lien Hang-Nguyen                                           Associate Professor of History, University of Kentucky                               Professor Nguyen specializes in the study of the United States in the world, with spatial focus on Southeast Asia and temporal interest in the Cold War. She is currently working two projects. The first is a comprehensive history of the 1968 Tet Offensive and the second explores the role of gender, people's diplomacy, and transnational networks of anti-war activism during the Vietnam War.   She is the author of Hanoi's War: An International History of the War for Peace in Vietnam, which won the Society for Military History (SMH) Edward M. Coffman Prize, the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations (SHAFR) Stuart L. Bernath Prize, the UKY Department of History Alice S.

David Hunt                                           Professor of History, University of Massachusetts, Boston                               Professor Hunt\u2019s current research interests are the Vietnam War and 20th-century Vietnam, peasant studies, the French Revolution and French social history, politics and culture, and world history in the early-modern period.    Professor Hunt's most recent book, Vietnam\u2019s Southern Revolution (UMass Press, 2008), is part of a larger attempt to write a social history of the war. It includes chapters on peasants and the urban/rural divide; the concerted uprising of 1959-1960; utopianism and violence of the popular movement; generational and gender conflicts at village level; the 1965 escalation and subsequent scattering of the rural population; quotidian encounters between Vietnamese and Americans; disruptions in conceptions of time and space; and the dual parentage of the Tet Offensive. More recent articles/chapters deal with mass consumer culture, the beginnings of an agricultural revolution, and the elaboration of a \u201cpublic sphere\u201d in the villages.

Marilyn Young                                           Professor of History; Collegiate Professor, New York University                               Thanks to a generous anonymous grant, Marilyn B. Young was able to attend Harvard University on full scholarship, provided she learned Chinese and wrote a thesis in the field of US-East Asian relations. This, in due course she did, under the direction of Ernest R. May and John King Fairbank, who nicely book-ended the subject matter. The thesis, and subsequent book, Rhetoric of Empire, put 19th century American policy towards China in an international context, examining the Notes as the emerged out of the crisis of the Boxer Rebellion. Her subsequent scholarship has had a dual track: to understand both American imperialism and those who fought against it, at home and abroad.
