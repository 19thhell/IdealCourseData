Research and Biography:   Maliheh is a J.S.D. candidate at NYU School of Law from the Islamic Republic of Iran. She is in the second year of the program, having successfully completed the coursework components of the program and passed candidacy. Her work is primarily in the field of law and development. Her research focuses on the relationship between law, religion, and economic development. Her project responds to literature claiming that Islamic law and development are incompatible. She intends to examine these assumptions and test the proposition by looking empirically at Iran\u2019s history, as well as what Islamic law really looks like, to see whether such claims can indeed be validated, or whether Islamic law in fact has the capacity to support development. She conducts her research under the supervision of Professor Kevin Davis, with Professor Intisar Rabb serving as a member of her dissertation committee.   Maliheh has thus far studied the foundations of a wide array of relevant fields of law, such as corporate law, Islamic finance, international trade and intellectual property and now hopes to use her acquired knowledge to contribute to scholarship in the law and development area. She holds a PhD in Private Law, focusing on corporate law, from the University of Tehran, where she was a lecturer on Business Law, and holds an LLM from New York University School of Law as an Arthur T. Vanderbilt Scholar (Amirsaleh Scholar).   Maliheh spent a year at Harvard Law School as a visiting fellow at the Islamic Legal Studies Program, conducting research on Islamic capital markets. She was also a research scholar at NYU School of Law and conducted research on the application of Islamic Law to the Iranian legal system. Moreover, she is a member of the Iranian Central Bar Association and passed the New York State Bar Examination (admission to New York State Bar pending).
