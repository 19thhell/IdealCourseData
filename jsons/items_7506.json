Information sessions allow you to speak directly with faculty members and administrators and to learn more about industry trends, job opportunities, and the ways in which enrolling in a noncredit course or a certificate can help to enhance your professional credentials.   Noncredit information sessions are conveniently scheduled during week nights. They occur every semester, so check back frequently for times and dates. While participation in these sessions does not require reservations, they are structured presentations, so please be punctual.   Below is a listing of upcoming events.
