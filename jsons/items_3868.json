The Charlie Hebdo attacks have raised questions not only about terrorism and freedom of expression, but also about the place of Islam in Europe\u2014now and in the future. In her lecture, G\u00f6le, a professor of sociology at \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales (EHESS) in Paris, will consider this matter. The lecture will be followed by a question-and-answer session moderated by political scientist Christine Landfried, Max Weber Professor at NYU.   G\u00f6le studies Islamic visibility, secularism, and intercultural controversies in European public spheres. She is the author of \u201cIslam in Europe: The Lure of Fundamentalism and the Allure of Cosmopolitanism\u201d (2010) and \u201cThe Forbidden Modern: Civilization and Veiling\u201d (1997). She headed a research project, \u201cEuroPublicIslam: Islam in the Making of a European Public Sphere,\u201d supported by the European Research Council. Based on her findings, G\u00f6le edited \u201cIslam and Public Controversy in Europe\u201d (2014) and wrote \u201cMusulmans au quotidien: une enqu\u00eate internationale sur les r\u00e9alit\u00e9s de l\u2019islam europ\u00e9en\u201d (\u201cOrdinary Muslims: An International Analysis of the Realities of Islam in Europe\u201d), forthcoming in 2015, which aims to give a voice to ordinary Muslims of Europe by creating an alternative public culture and new intercultural connections.

Subways: 4, 5, 6, L, N, Q, R, W (Union Square).  This event, co-sponsored with the Consulate General of Sweden, is free and open to the public. To RSVP, or for any questions, call 212.998.8693 or email info@centerfordialogues.org . For a complete schedule of sessions, go to www.centerfordialogues.org .

Observers see Europe as an ambivalently welcoming space for Muslims generally and especially so for Muslim women. Yet several recent studies have confirmed that Muslim European women are actively engaged in multiple spheres of European life and are becoming leading agents of change within their local and national communities. Although many still operate under some form of constraint-whether due to ethnic or religious expectations or simple prejudice-they are instrumental in infusing a new vitality into \u201cold\u201d Europe. What challenges and opportunities do Muslim European women currently face: at work, at school, at home, and in the political sphere? The session will examine the prevailing pessimism-particularly in the media and political spheres-that surrounds Muslim European women. It will consider the policy implications of an alternative approach, which considers Muslim European women as engaged actors within the framework of a European identity. The event\u2019s speakers include: Jocelyne Cesari, director of Harvard University\u2019s \u201cIslam in the West\u201d Program; author Assia Djebar, NYU Silver Professor and professor of French; and Ann Dismorr, former Swedish Ambassador and author of Turkey Decoded . Mustapha Tlili, founder and director of the NYU Center for Dialogues, will offer opening remarks, and Andrea L. Stanton, the center\u2019s assistant director, will moderate the discussion.   Editor\u2019s Note: New York University\u2019s Center for Dialogues: Islamic World-U.S.-The West emerged from the tragedy of September 11th, which highlighted the need for greater communication among and about the United States, Europe, and the Muslim world. The Center was founded as a forum for constructive debate among the various religious, intellectual, economic, and political sectors of American, European, and Islamic societies. It brings contentious issues between the Islamic world and the West into a more rational plane and promotes this approach to a wide audience, including the important constituencies of policy and decision-makers, policy analysts, the media, and educational institutions. The Center is located at 194 Mercer Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY, 10012. For more, go to www.centerfordialogues.org .
