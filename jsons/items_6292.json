The seminar will be held at Vanderbilt Hall\u2019s Greenberg Lounge (first floor), 40 Washington Square South, on Monday, Nov. 3 from 5-6:30 p.m.   Arum and Roksa\u2019s 2011 book, Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses, presented the findings of their longitudinal study of undergraduates\u2019 learning, socialization, and study habits. Their new book follows the same undergraduates through the remainder of college and out into the working world.   Built on interviews and surveys of nearly a thousand recent college graduates from a diverse range of colleges and universities, Aspiring Adults Adrift reveals a generation facing a difficult transition to adulthood. While some 20-somethings succeeded in landing jobs in their fields or pursued graduate degrees, more than half struggled to find decent employment, and a third were living with their parents a year after graduation. Despite these challenges, they remained hopeful about their futures. The authors argue that higher education is still worth the cost, but that both universities and students should do more to get the most out of the experience and investment.   Arum will lead the seminar, and will be joined by two respondents: Adam Gamoran, president of the William T. Grant Foundation, and Jennifer Jennings, assistant professor of sociology at NYU.   Reporters interested in attending should contact Rachel Harrison, NYU Office of Public Affairs, at 212.998.6797 or rachel.harrison@nyu.edu. Other attendees must RSVP online . The event is co-sponsored by the Applied Psychology Doctoral Student Colloquium, the Institute of Human Development and Social Change, the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences in the Professions, and the NYU Sociology Department.
