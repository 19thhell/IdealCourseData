There are two concurrent workshops held over three weeks: one for high school students preparing for college auditions and the other for college and graduate students preparing for competitions and/or graduate school auditions. The intensity of the schedule and exacting performance standards make SummerStrings most appropriate for serious, dedicated musicians ages 15-25.       These audition workshops will give you the skills you need to forge ahead with confidence! Under the guidance of NYU string faculty members, many of whom have won major competitions and orchestral auditions, you will spend your days putting together the elements needed for a successful audition. Faculty will assist you in preparing solo Bach, concerti, showpieces and etudes. You will learn sports psychology techniques to help deal with performance anxiety such as centering, mental practice and the perfect formula for audition preparation.       SummerStrings is pleased to offer Alexander Technique sessions to correct posture and teach bodily self-awareness. Participants who struggle with persistent bad habits have the opportunity to learn a ground-breaking method of overcoming them in as little as an hour. A select few participants will also have the opportunity to make a fully edited recording in NYU&rsquo;s state-of-the-art James L. Dolan Studio .       Upon completion of the course, you will have a clearer understanding of the audition process that will enable you to achieve your goals!    Courses and Faculty    Both programs include:          Two private lessons per week    One hour of daily chamber music rehearsal or coaching    One hour classes held each afternoon on a series of topics ranging from building confidence through audition strategies to developing one&rsquo;s musical voice through improvisation and freedom of expression    Five hours of daily practice time    Performance opportunities at bi-weekly student performances, master classes and chamber music recitals    Evening and weekend activities that in the past have included NY Philharmonic concerts, sightseeing in New York City and visits to museums          NYU Artist faculty include Cyrus Beroukhim , Stephanie Chase , Gregory Fulkerson , Kikuei Ikeda , Anton Miller , Naoko Tanaka , violin; Stephanie Baer , Shmuel Katz , Karen Ritscher , viola; Marion Feldman , Eileen Moon , Edward Arron , cello; Joseph Bongiorno , bass; Edward Malave , Alexander Technique and Justin Hines, improvisation.

There are two concurrent workshops held over three weeks: one for high school students preparing for college auditions and the other for college and graduate students preparing for competitions and/or graduate school auditions. The intensity of the schedule and exacting performance standards make SummerStrings most appropriate for serious, dedicated musicians ages 15-25.       These audition workshops will give you the skills you need to forge ahead with confidence! Under the guidance of NYU string faculty members, many of whom have won major competitions and orchestral auditions, you will spend your days putting together the elements needed for a successful audition. Faculty will assist you in preparing solo Bach, concerti, showpieces and etudes. You will learn sports psychology techniques to help deal with performance anxiety such as centering, mental practice and the perfect formula for audition preparation.       SummerStrings is pleased to offer Alexander Technique sessions to correct posture and teach bodily self-awareness. Participants who struggle with persistent bad habits have the opportunity to learn a ground-breaking method of overcoming them in as little as an hour. A select few participants will also have the opportunity to make a fully edited recording in NYU&rsquo;s state-of-the-art James L. Dolan Studio .       Upon completion of the course, you will have a clearer understanding of the audition process that will enable you to achieve your goals!    Courses and Faculty    Both programs include:          Two private lessons per week    One hour of daily chamber music rehearsal or coaching    One hour classes held each afternoon on a series of topics ranging from building confidence through audition strategies to developing one&rsquo;s musical voice through improvisation and freedom of expression    Five hours of daily practice time    Performance opportunities at bi-weekly student performances, master classes and chamber music recitals    Evening and weekend activities that in the past have included NY Philharmonic concerts, sightseeing in New York City and visits to museums          NYU Artist faculty include Cyrus Beroukhim , Stephanie Chase , Gregory Fulkerson , Kikuei Ikeda , Anton Miller , Naoko Tanaka , violin; Stephanie Baer , Shmuel Katz , Karen Ritscher , viola; Marion Feldman , Eileen Moon , Edward Arron , cello; Joseph Bongiorno , bass; Edward Malave , Alexander Technique and Justin Hines, improvisation.

Our music education program offers varying important approaches to music instruction. This enables to develop their own eclectic method that adapts to specific situations based on the experience and knowledge gained through study and teaching. We offer opportunities in the most prevalent methods, and a full certification program for Kodaly each summer. Kodaly : Based on the belief that singing is the foundation for musicianship, Kodaly methodology - a comprehensive system of music education - focuses on music literature through the use of folk and composed songs from children&#39;s linguistic heritage. For more information about the program, please visit our web site at Summer Studies Kodaly . Orff training provides a basis for developing beginning levels of improvisational, compositional, and preinstrumental musical skills in children by weaving rhythmic speech, body gestures, movement, and instrumental techniques around simple music forms.

Faculty Bio: Brigid Cohen holds degrees from Harvard University (Ph.D.), Kings College London (M.Mus.), and Wellesley College (B.A.). Before coming to NYU, she was an Assistant Professor at UNC Chapel Hill and taught at Wesleyan University, where she was an Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Humanities. Her research and teaching center on twentieth-century musical avant-gardes, postcolonial studies, cultural theory, migration and diaspora, cosmopolitanism, jazz, and intersections of music, the visual arts, and literature. Her book Stefan Wolpe and the Avant-Garde Diaspora turns to the case of one German-Jewish \u00e9 migr \u00e9 composer to explore how dilemmas of migration and cultural plurality shaped modernist movements from the Bauhaus to bebop to Black Mountain College. She is currently in the early stages of writing her second book Musical Migration and the Global City: New York, 1947-1965 , which explores questions of displacement and citizenship in the early Cold War through a study of New York concert avant-gardes, electronic music, jazz, and performance art. Professor Cohen has presented at numerous conferences, including those of the American Musicological Society, the Society for Ethnomusicology, the Society for Music Theory, the Society for American Music, and the Salzburg Festival. Her research has been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities (2014), the American Academy in Berlin (2010), the Alvin H. Johnson AMS 50 Fellowship (2007), the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) (2006), the Getty Research Institute (2005), the Minda de Gunzberg Center for European Studies at Harvard University (2004-5), the Paul Sacher Foundation (2004), and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (2000). Her work appears in publications including the Journal of the Society for American Music , Contemporary Music Review , and Journal of the American Musicological Society, and Musical Quarterly (forthcoming). She has also published and provided interviews in media outlets such as Der Tagesspiegel and Channel 13 New York (PBS/WNET).
