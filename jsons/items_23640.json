She is currently a third      year doctoral student working with Pat Shrout. Her      interests are in the processes involved in forming and      maintaining close relationships, including how      romantic relationships play out over time and the      support processes that are involved in relationship      maintenance. Her previous and current work uses      attachment theory as a framework for studying      individual differences in relationship experience. Her      current projects include studying fluctuations and      change in attachment anxiety over time, as well as      investigating how attachment and relationship support      relate to an individual's engagement in      exploration. Joy also works with Professor Susan      Andersen, investigating transference in ongoing      romantic relationships.                                Fred Clav&eacute;l, M.A.      Candidate      Lab Manager, Study Coordinator             Fred graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree      in Psychology from Fordham University. He is      currently in his final year of the M.A. Psychology      program at NYU. He coordinates the current NIAAA      research conducted between the NYU and Columbia      University Couples Labs, and collaborates with      researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute on      evaluating the predictive utility of assessments of      suicide risk in the near-term. His research      interests concern support processes in romantic      couples, exploring emotional expressions (particularly      negativity) as indicators of relational closeness,      security, &amp; commitment, as well as processes of      interpersonal merger and relationship dissolution. His      current research explores the effects of alcohol      consumption by our close others on our own attitudes      about the use of alcohol.  He moves to Iowa State University in       the Fall of 2012 to pursue a Ph.D. in Social       Psychology.                            Heather Barry Kappes Ph.D.                             Heather is interested in influences on the goals      that people pursue, how they do so, and whether they      achieve them. In the Couples Lab context she has      focused on how one member of a relationship can have      goals for their partner's achievement (e.g., for their      partner to become a lawyer, get a promotion, or      resolve a partner), and how this goal shapes support      provision, support effects, and goal achievement for      both partners.

Her      research focuses on a) political attitude change and      b) self-disclosure and intimacy. Prior to      attending NYU, Erin completed majors in Psychology,      Music, and Liberal Arts and Management at Indiana      University.                                 Liz Przybylinski      Ph.D. Candidate             Liz is a fifth year graduate student working in      collaboration with Prof. Susan Andersen and Prof. Pat      Shrout. She is interested in how we mentally represent      significant others in our lives, and how they may come      to influence new relationship endeavors. Currently,      she is working on several projects exploring the role      of meaning-systems that are created with significant      others, and how to regulate the influence that a      particular significant other may have when forming new      relationships. Future collaborations will involve      applying advanced statistical analysis techniques to      inform her research.

Shrout, and it focuses on two kinds of research, one     substantive and the other methodological. Our     substantive interests are concerned with how daily     transactions of social support affect psychological     functioning of individual partners and also how they     affect relationship processes such as intimacy, conflict     and satisfaction. In addressing these questions we     consider social cognitive perspectives, motivational     perspectives, as well as relationship perspectives.           Our methodological     interests are concerned with two lines of     research. One is how people respond to survey     questions and questions about their feelings, health and     stress. The other concerns the formulation of     statistical models of dependency in dyadic diary     data. We work with multilevel models, structural     equation models, and dynamic process models.

Participants were recruited from NYU and      Columbia pre-med courses and asked to fill out two      weeks of morning and evening daily diaries in the week      before and after an important midterm in their pre-med      course. Two hundred-and-twenty participants joined the      study and were randomly assigned to conditions that      dictated the start dates of their diaries as early as      8 days prior to the exam or only 2 days before the      exam.

She is currently a third      year doctoral student working with Pat Shrout. Her      interests are in the processes involved in forming and      maintaining close relationships, including how      romantic relationships play out over time and the      support processes that are involved in relationship      maintenance. Her previous and current work uses      attachment theory as a framework for studying      individual differences in relationship experience. Her      current projects include studying fluctuations and      change in attachment anxiety over time, as well as      investigating how attachment and relationship support      relate to an individual's engagement in      exploration. Joy also works with Professor Susan      Andersen, investigating transference in ongoing      romantic relationships.                                Fred Clav&eacute;l, M.A.      Candidate      Lab Manager, Study Coordinator             Fred graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree      in Psychology from Fordham University. He is      currently in his final year of the M.A. Psychology      program at NYU. He coordinates the current NIAAA      research conducted between the NYU and Columbia      University Couples Labs, and collaborates with      researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute on      evaluating the predictive utility of assessments of      suicide risk in the near-term. His research      interests concern support processes in romantic      couples, exploring emotional expressions (particularly      negativity) as indicators of relational closeness,      security, &amp; commitment, as well as processes of      interpersonal merger and relationship dissolution. His      current research explores the effects of alcohol      consumption by our close others on our own attitudes      about the use of alcohol.  He moves to Iowa State University in       the Fall of 2012 to pursue a Ph.D. in Social       Psychology.                            Heather Barry Kappes Ph.D.                             Heather is interested in influences on the goals      that people pursue, how they do so, and whether they      achieve them. In the Couples Lab context she has      focused on how one member of a relationship can have      goals for their partner's achievement (e.g., for their      partner to become a lawyer, get a promotion, or      resolve a partner), and how this goal shapes support      provision, support effects, and goal achievement for      both partners.

Her      research focuses on a) political attitude change and      b) self-disclosure and intimacy. Prior to      attending NYU, Erin completed majors in Psychology,      Music, and Liberal Arts and Management at Indiana      University.                                 Liz Przybylinski      Ph.D. Candidate             Liz is a fifth year graduate student working in      collaboration with Prof. Susan Andersen and Prof. Pat      Shrout. She is interested in how we mentally represent      significant others in our lives, and how they may come      to influence new relationship endeavors. Currently,      she is working on several projects exploring the role      of meaning-systems that are created with significant      others, and how to regulate the influence that a      particular significant other may have when forming new      relationships. Future collaborations will involve      applying advanced statistical analysis techniques to      inform her research.
