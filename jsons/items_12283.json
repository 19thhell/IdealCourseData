Networks of Scholars: The Transmission of Astronomical and Astrological Learning between Babylonians, Greeks and Jews    Mladen Popovi\u0107    1. Introduction    [\u261e p7.1] What do we know about what ancient Jewish scholars knew about what Babylonian scholars knew? 1 In order to answer this question we can analyse the different scholarly texts at our disposal, Babylonian and Jewish, and look for similarities and differences. We can then explain which Babylonian elements were familiar to Jewish scholars and how they appropriated, used and reworked these. Such analyses usually work from specific Jewish texts and then look for Babylonian elements, retracing these in specific cuneiform texts.    [\u261e p7.2] The issue of tracking influences and cultural encounters between Babylonia and Jewish Palestine has another side to it, one not often put to the fore. Previous research on tracing influences of Babylonian learning in ancient Jewish texts has reflected insufficiently on the specific nature of such cultural encounters and the means of transmission. It has been assumed, tacitly or explicitly, that Jewish scholars had direct access to Babylonian centres of learning. 2 On the level of textual comparisons, it is evident that elements of Babylonian origin appear in ancient Jewish texts; this is not disputed at all. However, the occurrence of textual similarities alone does not constitute enough evidence to argue for a direct connection. We at least need to further qualify the nature of that connection. Considering the social context of knowledge transmission, we must ask how and through whom ancient Jewish scholars got to know about some of the things that Babylonian scholars knew.    [\u261e p7.3] In this article I wish to focus mainly on two aspects of the social context of the transmission of astronomical learning in ancient Judaism. The first aspect is the differentiation between various levels of learning on the one hand and how this manifests itself in social relations between learned individuals on the other. The second aspect is that of ethnicity and cultural encounters with regard to learned knowledge.    [\u261e p7.4] I shall argue that the level of learning that we encounter in early Jewish sources differs starkly from contemporary developments in Babylonian and Greek astronomical science and points to a different trajectory of transmission. The transmission of Babylonian learning to Jewish scholars in Palestine was not a direct one. Furthermore, it went through different channels from the transmission of Babylonian astronomical science to Greek scholars. We should not assume as fact that Jewish scholars had direct access to Babylonian schools. We have no evidence for this. Due to the nature of the evidence at our disposal we cannot be very specific about the exact ways in which Babylonian scholarship reached Jewish Palestine sometime during the second half of the first millennium BCE Yet from a methodological point of view a number of considerations discussed in this article should be taken into account in future research on this issue. 3    2. Babylonian and Jewish Astral Sciences    [\u261e p7.5] A brief survey of the Enochic astronomical material and some of the Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran with regard to the Babylonian elements that they contain 4 provides some insight into the interests and level of knowledge of ancient Jewish scholars. 5 The point is to discern some of the social and cultural aspects that may have determined the context of transmission of Babylonian elements of astral sciences in Jewish texts, and to consider this in comparison with the transmission of astral sciences within Babylonian culture and between Babylonia and the Greek world.    [\u261e p7.6] On the one hand, the Jewish texts attest to knowledge of some elements from Babylonian astronomy from the first half of the first millennium BCE (En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin), of the concept of the zodiac that was introduced in the fifth century BCE and of the non-mathematical Lunar Three scheme that was developed sometime later. On the other hand, these texts show an apparent ignorance with regard to sophisticated forms of mathematical astronomy that were developed in Seleucid Babylonia and transmitted to the Greek world.    [\u261e p7.7] The scholars behind the Jewish texts remain anonymous. In the Enochic corpus the authorial \u201cI\u201d was ascribed to Enoch, while the astronomical and astrological manuscripts from Qumran lack an authorial \u201cI\u201d altogether, as I emphasized elsewhere, 6 as do the calendric texts. 7 What Babylonian elements do we encounter in these texts? What changes and transformations did Babylonian elements go through as they were used in new Jewish-Palestinian texts and contexts?    2.1 Textual Comparisons    [\u261e p7.8] The earliest Jewish astronomical work is the Enochic Astronomical Book (extant after extensive redaction and modifications in 1 Enoch 72\u201382). Composed in Aramaic in the third century BCE or even earlier, the most complete text is preserved in Ethiopic translation. Four Aramaic copies (4Q208\u2013211), containing only the Astronomical Book , have turned up at Qumran. The oldest fragments date to the late third or early second century BCE (4Q208). Scholars have pointed to a Mesopotamian background for some of the astronomical aspects of the Enochic Astronomical Book . 8 1 Enoch 72 records the annual variation in the length of day and night-time. This variation is measured on a scale of eighteen, reflecting an M:m ratio of 2:1, 9 which results in a simple linear zigzag function rooted in Babylonian astronomy. Originally counting a 360-day year, as does Mul.Apin, for example, the Astronomical Book subsequently developed a 364-day year tradition. 10 For the so-called synchronistic calendar in the Aramaic fragments from Qumran (4Q208\u2013209), the most recent suggestion is that it mainly deals with the duration of lunar visibility during night and day in a fashion similar to Tablet 14 of En\u016bma Anu Enlil. 11    [\u261e p7.9] The astronomy in the Enochic Astronomical Book reaches back to older Mesopotamian examples from the first half of the first millennium BCE, such as En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin, but the Astronomical Book does not reflect developments that occurred in Mesopotamian astronomy from the middle of the first millennium onward. These developments comprised the formulation of mathematical models that enable the prediction of the recurrence of certain astronomical phenomena and the introduction of the zodiac as a schematic, symbolic division of the ecliptic for computing and recording the planetary positions more exactly. The composition of the Astronomical Book 12 probably predates the even more advanced developments in Babylonian astronomy of the second century BCE, which were not incorporated into the text. The later copies of the Aramaic Astronomical Book from Qumran (4Q209\u2013211 date to the second half and the end of the first century BCE) do not show evidence of such \u201cupdates.\u201d Moreover, the importance attributed to the Enochic type of astronomy is illustrated by the fact that the Aramaic Astronomical Book influenced other texts of the Jewish-Palestinian astronomical tradition, such as 4Q317 and 4Q503 and possibly 4Q334, Hebrew manuscripts dating from the second half of the second century BCE (4Q317 and 4Q503) and from the turn of the era (4Q334). 13    [\u261e p7.10] There is also possible evidence for the use of more contemporary astronomical learning from Babylonia, although still in the form of non-mathematical astronomy. Scholars have interpreted some of the Qumran calendar texts in Hebrew (4Q320, 4Q321 and 4Q321a, which date to the end of the second century BCE until the second half of the first century BCE) to be based on elements of a Late-Babylonian lunar system (Persian-Hellenistic period), the Lunar Three scheme from non-mathematical astronomical texts, which were appropriated and modified by Jewish scholars to meet their own calendric needs. 14    [\u261e p7.11] In addition to the Aramaic Astronomical Book , the texts influenced by it and some of the calendar texts from Qumran, there are two astrological manuscripts from Qumran to take into account. Both texts attest to knowledge of the zodiac and thus illustrate that they had taken up one of the developments of Babylonian astronomy from the second half of the first millennium. However, whether this knowledge originated from Babylonia or from the Greek world is another matter.    [\u261e p7.12] Alongside Babylonian elements, these two texts appear to display Hellenistic features as well. This should not surprise us. During the Hellenistic period knowledge of Babylonian astrology and mathematical astronomy reached the Greek world, and having been transformed into Hellenistic astronomy and astrology it was taken elsewhere again. The Aramaic manuscript 4Q318 (copied around the turn of the era) consists of two parts. The first part ( selenodromion ) describes the synodic movement of the moon through the zodiac during twelve months of thirty days each, counting a 360-day year, as in Babylonian tradition. The second part ( brontologion ) has predictions for when it will thunder. This sort of text appears both in the Babylonian and Graeco-Roman astrological traditions. 15 The 360-day year scheme suggests a derivation from Babylonian tradition, but the zodiacal names in 4Q318 seem to point to Hellenistic origins. 16 The Hebrew manuscript 4Q186 (copied around the turn of the era) is a physiognomic-astrological catalogue combining different forms of learning (physiognomics, 17 astrology and possibly medicine and magic). The combination of different scientific disciplines within one text is probably already the case in Babylonian traditions predating the Hellenistic period. 18 The text\u2019s astrological framework, however, points decisively to a Hellenistic background, as the horoscope ( \u05de\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3 ; molad ) or ascendant (the point of the zodiac rising above the eastern horizon at the moment of birth) is of no importance at all in Babylonian horoscopy but is significant in Hellenistic horoscopy. 19    [\u261e p7.13] Three observations can be drawn from the previous survey. First, elements from older types of Mesopotamian astronomy and astrology such as En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin from the first half of the first millennium BCE resurfaced in Aramaic in the early Enochic corpus sometime in the third century BCE 20 In this form, this type of astronomy continued to influence new compositions in Hebrew up until at least the second half of the second century BCE (4Q317 and 4Q503) and possibly later (4Q334). The evidence of new Hebrew compositions inspired by Enochic astronomy is important, as it demonstrates that the reception of older types of Babylonian astronomy was not limited to the early Enochic corpus. From a diachronic perspective we may observe that older types of Babylonian astronomy did not become obsolete after their initial reception in Jewish circles in the form of Enochic astronomy, but continued to be regarded relevant. This is demonstrated both by the later date of the Astronomical Book manuscripts from Qumran (4Q209\u2013211) and by the new compositions in Hebrew that were inspired by it. This preservation of older types of material may argue against continuing contact with Babylonia or at least may suggest rare contact.    [\u261e p7.14] Second, alongside the ongoing transmission of older elements of Babylonian astronomy from En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin, more recent features appear that post-date that type of astronomy but predate developments in the advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy of the second century BCE. Calendric manuscripts from Qumran (4Q320, 4Q321 and 4Q321a) seem to be influenced by the Lunar Three scheme from Late-Babylonian non-mathematical astronomical texts. Astrological manuscripts from Qumran (4Q186 and 4Q318) demonstrate that knowledge of the zodiac, which was developed sometime in the fifth century BCE, found its way into Jewish society during this period as well. The manuscript copies are evidence of this development in the first century BCE at the latest. However, the mathematical type of astronomy is absent in all this.    [\u261e p7.15] Third, these ancient Jewish sources show a level of astronomical competency that was far less sophisticated than the advanced methods of contemporary astronomers in Babylonian and Greek societies. Starting in the Persian period but especially in the Seleucid period, Babylonian scholars made new and great advances in mathematical astronomy. 21 These advanced Babylonian astronomical methods were also transmitted to the Greek world. Due to the encounter with Babylonian astronomy and due to the work of Hipparchus and others such as Hypsicles, Hellenistic astronomy changed tremendously in this period. 22 Knowledge of certain elements of Babylonian astronomy among Greek scholars already occurred before Hipparchus, between the fifth and third centuries (Eudoxus, for example), but it is in the second century, especially with Hipparchus it seems, \u201cthat we see a more complex and systematic exploitation of the resources of the Babylonian astronomers, including not only a whole array of period relations, but also extensive observations and, most notably, mathematical methods.\u201d 23    [\u261e p7.16] The extant Jewish sources do not attest likewise to this influence from advanced mathematical astronomy from Babylonia. Aramaic Enochic astronomy remained non-mathematical. The earliest of the calendric manuscripts from Qumran (4Q320) dates to the end of the second century BCE and the youngest (4Q321) to the second half of the first century BCE While these manuscripts postdate the development of advanced astronomy in Babylonia and its transmission to the Greek world, they do not reflect those developments. The astrological manuscripts from Qumran attest knowledge of the zodiac, but this occurs in relatively straightforward lists. We do not find actual horoscopes, although even those need not presuppose the ability to execute complex observations and calculations. Such data may have been at hand in ephemerides and the like, but we have no evidence for this in Palestinian Judaism in this period. It appears that the concept of the zodiac found its way into Palestinian Jewish astral science as a finished product, so to say, without specialist knowledge of the mathematical-astronomical intricacies on which horoscopic astrology was based, and possibly also without access to supporting texts such as ephemerides\u2014there is at least no need to suppose that these sorts of texts were available to Jewish scholars. 24    2.2 Different Levels of Learning    [\u261e p7.17] Should we think of Enochic astronomy and its offshoots as survivals of types of astronomy that were already out-dated in Babylonia itself? What does \u201cout-dated\u201d mean? More advanced mathematical methods had been developed in Babylonian astronomy whilst Enochic astronomy flourished in Palestinian Judaism, but perhaps as a rule of thumb that kind of astronomy may still have had its worth. In that respect we should not unnecessarily devalue it. Furthermore, there is some evidence for the continued transmission of En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin in Babylonia during the Seleucid period, but we do not know whether these were actually used. 25 Even if there is some evidence for continued copying of En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin, it is evident that from a general perspective the character of astronomy differs strikingly between Babylonia and Jewish Palestine in the Hellenistic period. In Babylonia these texts were being copied alongside new and important astronomical advances, which are conspicuously absent from the extant Palestinian Jewish astronomical and astrological texts.    [\u261e p7.18] The extant texts thus show different levels of astronomical learning. What ramifications does this conclusion have for understanding the channels of transmission through which ancient Jewish scholars learned about Babylonian astral sciences? How did Jewish scholars in Palestine relate to the current advanced astronomical developments in Seleucid Babylonia? Did Jewish scholars consciously ignore these developments for some reason? Was the more recent and advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy too difficult for them to appropriate? Or were they completely unaware of these developments because they were not connected in the same way to the same networks as those that transmitted Babylonian learning to the Greek world?    [\u261e p7.19] It is doubtful whether the apparent lack of knowledge of advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy was due to a conscious decision motivated by certain theological considerations, as has been suggested. 26 A scientific-religious worldview characterized by a specific emphasis on heptadic-based numbers might explain the calendar texts from Qumran and the Enochic astronomical material to support that, but it does not provide a satisfactory explanation for the astrological material from Qumran. The concept of the zodiac does not support such a worldview. 27    [\u261e p7.20] This begs the question: why were some concepts appropriated while others were not? There seems no reason to suppose that the authors or scribes behind the Enochic material and the Dead Sea Scrolls would have been intellectually less capable of dealing with complex mathematical-astronomical procedures from contemporary Babylonia. Instead, we should look for an explanation in terms of social relations and networks.    [\u261e p7.21] With due regard for the caveat that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, in this case what is missing in the extant Jewish sources may provide us with a clue that, with regard to the astral sciences at that time, the channels of transmission between Babylonia and Jewish Palestine were probably different from the channels between Babylonia and the Greek world. When looking for Babylonian influences on ancient Jewish science it is not just a matter of listing the elements and looking for similarities and differences between texts. We cannot without further ado connect streams of traditions from Uruk, Sippar, Babylon and the like with Jerusalem, Qumran or any other place where Jewish scholars lived.    [\u261e p7.22] The different levels of learning should make us cautious of simply viewing the learned elites from different localities as interacting with each other on the same level. Mindful of Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s concept of cultural capital, we can appreciate the scholarly learning in the early Enochic and Qumran texts as a prized piece of knowledge signalling and confirming the status of those having access to and possessing it. 28 But the Jewish scholarly elite may not have been of the same standing as the Babylonian scholarly elite, or the Greek one for that matter. In their respective societies Babylonian and Jewish scholars may have been members of the elite, but although stories about Abraham teaching Phoenicians and Egyptians or Daniel at the Babylonian court suggest otherwise, this need not imply that in real life the one recognized the other as equal or that there was direct contact between them, as is often assumed. Especially important here is to balance the two elements of having or gaining access and giving or allowing access as these materialize in social relationships between individuals.    3. Cultural Encounters and the Transmission of Astronomical Learning    [\u261e p7.23] Simplicius, the Late Antique commentator on Aristotle\u2019s works, wrote that, according to Porphyry, Aristotle had asked Callisthenes, who was in Babylon with Alexander the Great, to send astronomical observations from Babylon to Greece. 29 In De caelo Aristotle himself refers to observational data by the Egyptians and the Babylonians as the basis for much of their (i.e. the Greeks) evidence about particular luminaries. 30    [\u261e p7.24] Regardless of whether such a request was really made by Aristotle, the anecdote illustrates how some in Late Antiquity imagined such cultural encounters and the transmission of knowledge between Babylon and Greece: reports were simply sent from Babylon directly to Greece by a Greek visitor of certain status. Unfortunately, the anecdote does not really provide us with much concrete information. The nature of the reports is not specified, nor their number: what kind of sources and how many? Nor is it clear what language they were in (a Late Antique writer would probably not have thought of Akkadian anymore): 31 did Simplicius imagine the reports were in Greek? Furthermore, there is no explanation of how exactly Callisthenes obtained these sources or from whom. It was not as if astronomical reports were just lying around to be picked up by anyone. How did he know where to go? Did Callisthenes walk into a temple in Babylon, the Esangila, for example? Did he know individual Babylonian astronomers? 32 Such questions were probably not on Simplicius\u2019 mind, but from a socio-historical perspective on science we need to address some of these questions as to possession, accessibility and mobility in order to better understand the transmission of scholarly knowledge, in this case astronomical learning.    [\u261e p7.25] That Babylonian learning travelled far beyond its original geographic boundaries is undisputed. It is evident that Babylonian sciences such as astronomy and astrology were transmitted beyond the Mesopotamian cultural realm to the west, and to the east for that matter. We find Babylonian mathematical and astronomical formulas and calculations that turn up in roughly contemporary and later texts of other cultural realms. Modern scholars have shown that Babylonian astral sciences contributed to and influenced Greek astronomy and astrology. 33 Ancient sources also acknowledge such Babylonian origins, 34 and we have examples of Jewish texts that put Abraham on a par with scholars from Egypt, Phoenicia and Babylon. 35    [\u261e p7.26] The views of Simplicius and, for example, Pseudo-Eupolemus, 36 are rather clear-cut: scientific data were transmitted to others in written form and scholarly knowledge was exchanged in direct interaction between learned men. In general, both aspects, written and oral communication, no doubt shaped ancient contexts of transmission, but in specific cases we probably have to differentiate: scientific data were not just sent around indiscriminately and not all learned men would, as a rule, have interacted with all learned men from other cultural realms, this being dependent on various factors.    [\u261e p7.27] Insights from Social Network Analysis theory may help to conceptualize specific conditions for the transmission of astronomical and astrological knowledge. 37 I will not provide a systematic consideration of all forms of connectivity that may have played a role, but will use Social Network Analysis theory as a heuristic tool to ask certain specific socio-cultural questions. The benefit of this approach is that it focuses our attention on the social context of the transmission of astronomical knowledge, as this is determined by social relationships, and with a special emphasis on networks. The question is what kinds of social networks were involved. People transmit information and knowledge via different mediums in specific contexts\u2014defined by, for example, locality, social status, gender, age, kinship, nationality and ethnicity. In order to understand the context, i.e. the circumstances of these interactions and of the transmission of knowledge, we must focus on concrete localities, channels and agents.    [\u261e p7.28] In this section I wish to address three issues regarding the transmission of Babylonian astronomy and astrology: the involvement of non-Babylonians in Babylonian science, the role of the Aramaic language and the transmission to the Greek world specifically.    3.1 The Involvement of Non-Babylonians in Babylonian Science    [\u261e p7.29] With regard to ethno-linguistic and cultural distinctions, modern anthropological and cultural studies have called essentialist distinctions into doubt: what makes a certain type of learning \u201cEgyptian\u201d or \u201cBabylonian,\u201d and how does that relate to concrete people, be they Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek or Jewish? 38 There is somewhat of a paradox in some recent analyses in that such terms are problematized as less useful heuristic concepts whereas our taxonomic interests call for their use. We wish to categorize and classify our data into neat and separate boxes, and at the same time wish to acknowledge that the boundaries between these conceptual boxes are often, in reality, fluid and fuzzy.    [\u261e p7.30] Nonetheless, that boundaries are fluid, fuzzy or that they can be crossed does not imply they do not exist; boundaries are not completely ephemeral, and sometimes they are very real. While ethno-linguistic and cultural borders can be crossed, they also function to create a persistent sense of difference. 39 Specific social and cultural contexts will have determined when and how boundaries would have been more fluid or stricter.    [\u261e p7.31] We have evidence from the Neo-Assyrian period of non-Babylonians and non-Assyrians engaged in royal scholarly networks. 40 The late Assyrian empire had become bilingual and bicultural, with Aramaic becoming the international vernacular. 41 At the same time, there is evidence for adversarial reactions among the Assyrian ruling classes to the rising importance of Aramaic. For example, to a request by the scribe Sin-iddina of Ur to reply in Aramaic, the king answers that the scribe should rather write to him in Akkadian. 42 This example works both ways. On the one hand, it shows that ethno-linguistic boundaries were not strict: letters to the Assyrian king could be written in Aramaic. On the other hand, it demonstrates that such boundaries were not completely ephemeral. The sender of the letter may have asked for too much by requesting the king\u2019s answer also be in Aramaic. The king retorts by raising the boundary and emphasizing its importance: he creates an ethno-linguistic sense of difference between the scribe and himself. While ethno-linguistic and cultural boundaries can be crossed, they are also maintained. However, in the Neo-Assyrian period such boundaries do not seem to have prohibited the accessibility and dissemination of Babylonian science.    [\u261e p7.32] If we look at evidence from the Neo- and Late-Babylonian periods, it seems that the Babylonian urban elite had stricter limitations for entry into the scholarly elite than the Assyrians. 43 There is, however, some evidence for scribes bearing non-Akkadian names who copied literary, scholarly texts: \u0160emaa, son of Adirum is thus far the only example, the extant sources showing that all Babylonian scribes with non-Akkadian names wrote documentary, legal texts. 44 Ethno-linguistic boundaries may not have been absolute, but some form of boundary maintenance with regard to literary and scholarly texts as distinct from documentary, legal texts did seem to be in effect.    [\u261e p7.33] Through cuneiform culture the Babylonian urban elite is said to have expressed a high degree of self-consciousness. For example, a cuneiform text from Hellenistic Uruk shows that the Aramaeans were still considered a separate ethno-linguistic group by some Babylonians; 45 the reference in the late Seleucid list from Uruk of kings and scholars to Esarhaddon\u2019s counsellor Aba-Enlil-dari as the one \u201cwhom the Aramaeans call A\u1e2buqar\u201d shows that the story of A\u1e2biqar was known but seen as part of \u201cpopular\u201d Aramaic culture rather than cuneiform elite culture. 46 The impression gained from cuneiform sources is of Late Babylonia as an imagined community of urban elites who retreated into the imaginary space provided by the temples and the schools, with cuneiform itself being the main distinguishing characteristic of this community. The Babylonian urban elites constructed a cultural identity for themselves, one that became more and more detached from the ethno-linguistic, cultural and political realities of Babylonia in the Hellenistic and Parthian periods. 47 At the same time, evidence from Hellenistic Uruk seems to indicate that they cultivated strong ties with the Greek elite and the Seleucid rulers that ensured their small community thrived. 48 This shows that despite a cultivated identity that seems detached from real life, Babylonian urban elites were also able to relate to changing ethno-linguistic, cultural and political realities and to do so to their own advantage.    [\u261e p7.34] Changed historical circumstances between the late fifth and late fourth centuries and the second century BCE no doubt influenced the possibilities presented to and the choices made by those specialized in astronomy and astrology in the cities of Babylonia, determining also the mobility, accessibility and dissemination of that learned knowledge. For example, recent research on the collection owned by two separate families of ma\u0161ma\u0161\u0161u \u2019s in Uruk in the late fifth and late fourth centuries BCE suggests a tight social network of scholarly families. 49 The colophons suggest that this scholarly network operated on a limited geographical scale: scholars, students and their writings seem to have rarely travelled beyond Uruk or across professional divides. 50 If we consider these two families from the perspective of Social Network Analysis theory, such a limited network that consists of strong ties\u2014kinship ties being the clearest example of strong ties\u2014seems less conducive to bridge social boundaries and cross network distance between different ethno-linguistic groups. 51    [\u261e p7.35] From a diachronic perspective, there is also evidence for non-familial apprenticeship in second-century BCE Seleucid Uruk. Although the social network there was tight, as over six generations just four scholarly families collaborated in the training of their sons, patterns of non-familial apprenticeship can be identified. 52 A limited network that consisted of strong ties (kinship) was thus able to bridge social boundaries and transmit learning to non-family. It is, however, not readily apparent whether these non-familial apprentices may be indicative as well for the crossing of ethno-linguistic and cultural boundaries, and if so, which ones exactly. Perhaps individual members from social networks such as these and others were able to cross much greater network distances: Uruk may have been one of the sources from which Babylonian astronomy made its way to the Greek world. 53 One can think of a scenario in which individual scholars from Uruk moved away from the city, taking their scientific knowledge with them. Historical and modern analogies suggest that this would have been mostly young men. 54 Perhaps such a move in the second century BCE, if it occurred at all, was due to economic reasons: private income generated by astronomical and astrological knowledge 55 may not have been sufficient, and in response some scribes took their chances and left.    [\u261e p7.36] In terms of ethno-linguistic and cultural boundaries the Neo- and Late-Babylonian evidence demonstrates complex and multi-layered contexts. On the one hand, ethno-linguistic distinctions were made and cuneiform culture was upheld to emphasize Babylonian identity. On the other hand, various sources show a multi-ethnic picture that seems to call into doubt the dominance of cuneiform culture in Late Babylonia. This picture highlights the difficulty of distinguishing neatly between what is Babylonian and what is non-Babylonian. 56    [\u261e p7.37] These two different aspects have direct bearing on the contexts of transmission of astronomical learning, and their complexity is well illustrated by the issue of Aramaic as a medium for the transmission of Babylonian astronomical and astrological learning.    3.2 Aramaic as a Medium for Transmission of Astronomical Learning    [\u261e p7.38] There is no evidence for the translation of complex astronomical cuneiform texts into Aramaic. 57 Aramaic Astronomical Enoch from Qumran does not even come remotely near to the advanced forms of cuneiform astronomy and it hardly can stand exemplary for a body of Babylonian Aramaic scholarship in the first millennium BCE    [\u261e p7.39] Apparently, the Babylonian urban elites kept to traditional cuneiform learning as the sole official culture of Babylonia. At the same time, Aramaic became the dominant vernacular. Should we then assume that there must have been a Babylonian literature and science written in Aramaic, now lost because it was written on perishable material? Or should we assume that Aramaic did not become the dominant language to express Babylonian high culture but remained mostly a language of communication and administration, and, moreover, that it is questionable whether any significant corpus of cuneiform was ever translated into Aramaic? 58    [\u261e p7.40] The Neo- and Late-Babylonian evidence presents us with different scenarios from the Neo-Assyrian evidence. We do not have a significant body of sources in Aramaic from first-millennium Babylonia or a clear and significant body of references from first-millennium Babylonia to the use of Aramaic and to the involvement of non-Babylonians in Babylonian science, as we do have regarding the last aspect for Assyria in the Neo-Assyrian period. Were ethno-linguistic and cultural boundaries in Babylonia more strictly maintained with regard to scholarly learning and did this inhibit the accessibility and dissemination of Babylonian science, or is it just a matter of evidence gone missing?    [\u261e p7.41] In addition to the Babylonian priests and scholars\u2014the old urban notability\u2014there was another group of scribes, the sep\u012bru scribes. These did not belong to the old Babylonian nobility but were recognized as important persons who were well integrated in the temple organization. 59 They appear to have been Aramaic speakers who had become assimilated into Babylonian culture. 60 Although there is thus far no evidence that these scribes worked on literary or scholarly texts, 61 the question is how strictly boundaries were maintained. The sep\u012bru scribes seem to have been well integrated into the temple organization, and the temple was the place of learning in Babylonia. The exact relations, however, between the Babylonian scholarly elite and Aramaic sep\u012bru scribes merit further investigation. It might be that in the future evidence will turn up that sep\u012bru scribes had access to cuneiform sources or that astronomical principles were divulged to them. 62    [\u261e p7.42] We might also entertain the possibility that individual Jews, being part of a general Aramaic milieu, were among such Aramaic sep\u012bru scribes\u2014perhaps having taken up Babylonian names even, making it more difficult for us to identify them as Jewish and thus also calling into question the aptness of such neat taxonomic distinctions. Be that as it may, no concrete evidence has as of yet turned up for Jews being Aramaic sep\u012bru scribes. In the wake of the Babylonian conquest of Judah and Jerusalem in 586 BCE a Jewish Diaspora formed in Babylonia. Jews were fully integrated in economic everyday life there, as \u201cis evidenced by their participation in very ordinary economic transactions in which they are recorded as the creditors and debtors in a variety of loan documents and receipts.\u201d 63 There is also enough evidence for Babylonian Jewish villagers or merchants in Neo- and Late-Babylonian documents, but there is no evidence for Jews accessing scholarly tablet collections directly. 64    [\u261e p7.43] It is important to consider the role of the Aramaic language as a medium for the transmission of Babylonian astronomical and astrological material to the Jewish world. The westward transmission of this body of learned knowledge originating in cuneiform culture may have occurred through Aramaic sources, which is how Jewish scholars, being part of a general Aramaic milieu, may have encountered it. 65 The astronomical Enoch manuscripts from Qumran, for example, may be evidence for this role of Aramaic. However, whether it was through direct access to cuneiform texts, direct contact with Babylonian scholars in Mesopotamia or elsewhere, or indirectly via access to a\u2014more vague\u2014continuous tradition is another matter.    [\u261e p7.44] In order to better understand the possible role of Aramaic as a medium for the transmission of Babylonian astronomical material and also how some of this material made its way to Aramaic texts such as the astronomical Enoch manuscripts from Qumran, it is instructive to briefly consider evidence from Late Antiquity. In Late Antiquity, Aramaic was no longer only the vernacular of Babylonian culture but had also become the literary language of Mesopotamian Christianity, Babylonian Judaism and Mandaean Gnosticism. 66    [\u261e p7.45] Considering the elements of Babylonian learning in Late Antique sources one may observe that these differ from what one finds in earlier cuneiform learning: Late Antique scholarship is different in character from the advanced mathematical astronomical texts from the latter part of the first millennium BCE, being less technical and more divinatory. 67 The textual similarities are of a more structural than of a specific nature (see section 4 below). What is important for our discussion is that these Late Antique traditions do not presuppose direct contact with cuneiform culture. The Late Antique texts do not derive from the \u201chigh culture\u201d of cuneiform written tradition, but instead probably represent the transmission of elements of popular Babylonian traditions, although elite and popular culture should not be seen as two completely separate strands of tradition. 68    [\u261e p7.46] There is, of course, some evidence for literary Aramaic texts from the first millennium BCE, and the Aramaic manuscripts from Qumran add significantly to this, 69 but this concerns literature (A\u1e2biqar) 70 or liturgy, 71 rather than Babylonian astronomy and astrology in its advanced forms. In our analysis of cultural encounters we need to distinguish between different kinds of texts and traditions and differentiate between various channels and agents of transmission. 72 What applies to one need not explain the other. For example, knowledge of the Gilgamesh epic concerns certain motifs that need not presuppose acquaintance with the Standard Version (not even consciously being related anymore to the epic as such), 73 but may have been part of popular oral traditions. Those who composed the Prayer of Nabonidus (4Q242) or Daniel 4 may have gotten their knowledge about the Babylonian king Nabonidus through a chain of transmission that originated in the public reading of Nabonidus\u2019 inscription. 74 In both cases, there is no need to suppose direct access to Babylonian centres of higher learning.    [\u261e p7.47] Another kind of tradition is that of law and legal formulas in documentary texts, the origins of which have been traced back to Babylonia, such as in the Wadi Daliyeh papyri from fourth-century BCE Samaria and also in second-century CE legal texts from Murabba\u02bfat and Na\u1e25al \u1e24ever. 75 The presence of empires as a political factor may account for the spread of legal traditions and formulary, and in this case the Aramaic sep\u012bru scribes, taking care of all sorts of legal, administrative writings, may too have been agents conducive for the transmission of Babylonian legal formulas.    [\u261e p7.48] A differentiated perspective on the use of Aramaic in the ancient Near East points to different means of transmission, via different channels and agents, for different kinds of traditions and texts. What may apply to the transmission of elements from narratives, may not apply likewise to scholarly literature. That some astronomical elements in the Astronomical Book have Babylonian origins is evident, as do other elements in 1 Enoch. 76 This is not disputed. The issue is how these astronomical elements reached Jewish scholars and materialized in the extant manuscripts from Qumran. The suggestion put forward here is that in this respect these texts are analogous to Late Antique traditions in which Babylonian elements, and Greek ones, appear. For early Jewish astronomical and astrological traditions there is no reason to suppose direct contact with Babylonian scholars or direct access to cuneiform texts, as we must assume for the Greek evidence.    3.3 The Transmission of Babylonian Astronomical Material to the Greek World    [\u261e p7.49] The exact routes by which Babylonian astronomical learning was transmitted to the Greek world are not known, but different suggestions have been put forward. We probably have to reckon with different channels of transmission that were in operation, sometimes perhaps simultaneously and sometimes not. What seems certain is that it must have involved, at one time at least, direct personal contact between individual Babylonian and Greek scholars, because of the technical and mathematical astronomical requirements, and even because of the visual aspects of the manuscripts such as their layout and structure. This may have happened when Greek astronomers visited Babylonia or when Babylonian scholars travelled to the Greek world. But we do not know exactly when, where and how this happened. 77 Furthermore, once this contact was established, a continuous tradition ensured its transmission until the days of Ptolemy and later. 78 Let us briefly consider these three channels of transmission: direct contact in Babylonia, direct contact elsewhere and a continuous tradition.    [\u261e p7.50] The first two proposed channels of transmission operate on the basis of the conclusion that direct access to cuneiform sources through contact between Greek and Babylonian astronomers must have occurred. For example, if, as has been suggested, the Greek astronomer Hipparchus in the second century BCE was the main channel through which important aspects of Babylonian astronomical science were transmitted to the Greeks, he must have had personal contact with one or more Babylonian experts. Hipparchus\u2019 extensive knowledge of both the observational and theoretical parts of Babylonian astronomy, it appears, cannot be explained without him having had direct access to Babylonian sources, most notably the observational Diaries. 79 If indeed Hipparchus personally accessed astronomical cuneiform sources with the help of one or more Babylonian scholars, we do not know whether he met them in Babylonia or elsewhere.    [\u261e p7.51] Although we do not know exactly the numbers journeying, and wherefrom and whereto they did so, Babylonian scholars certainly did travel and took up residence elsewhere in the Greek world, transmitting knowledge about Babylonian astronomy and astrology along the way. Scribes who were on the move and took their professional and scientific knowledge elsewhere would have been a potent link in the diffusion of knowledge. 80 For the Hellenistic period, the status that Babylonian astronomy and astrology enjoyed in the Greek world may have facilitated the reception of travelling scribes from Babylonia by local communities: knowledge of Babylonian astronomy crossed network distance and its effect on small-world networks was ensured by the status it already had. There is some intriguing documentary evidence for the diffusion of astronomical learning from Babylonia to the Greek world. An honorary inscription from second-century BCE Larissa in Thessaly refers to a certain Antipater from Hierapolis in Seleukia as a Chaldean astronomer who had lived for a long time in Larissa and had practised his mathematical profession there. 81 We do not know what kind of astronomy or astrology this Antipater pursued, but the inscription presents concrete evidence for a \u201cChaldean\u201d astronomer/astrologer who had travelled from his native city in the Near East to a Greek city sometime in the second century BCE 82 If so, Antipater\u2019s \u201cbiography\u201d illustrates that he crossed a large network distance and established himself successfully within his new social network, as testified by the honorary inscription. How exactly he crossed this distance, through what channels and through what connecting localities, we do not know. 83 There is in any case no reason to assume that this Antipater from Hierapolis was the only astronomer to have moved away from his original social network. There were, no doubt, others like him who travelled to the Greek world (for the suggestion that astronomers from Uruk were among them, see section 3.1 above). 84    [\u261e p7.52] In addition to these two channels of transmission of Babylonian astronomy to the Greek world via direct contact, a third one presupposes a continuous tradition once Babylonian science had been taken elsewhere. The use of Babylonian predictive schemes in the time of Ptolemy (second century CE) cannot be explained by direct contact with Babylonian scholars or direct access to cuneiform sources (Ptolemy received this information via Hipparchus). 85 A second-century CE fragmentary papyrus from Oxyrhynchus (P. Oxy 4139) has a reference to a lunar period scheme according to the Babylonian System A lunar theory and seems to refer to the Orchenoi (\u201cpeople of Uruk\u201d; line 8), indicating the diffusion of this Babylonian tradition. 86    Considering the moment of \u201cfirst contact,\u201d elements of Babylonian mathematical astronomy will have been transmitted to the Greek world directly from cuneiform into Greek, via personal contact with Babylonian astronomers, either in Babylonia or elsewhere. The Jewish world, on the other hand, as argued above, encountered some elements of Babylonian non-mathematical astronomy indirectly via the medium of the Aramaic language. We thus need to differentiate between channels for the westward transmission of Babylonian astronomy and astrology in their varied forms: directly from cuneiform into Greek and indirectly via Aramaic.    4. The Transmission of Babylonian Astronomical and Astrological Learning to the Jewish World    [\u261e p7.53] In order to explain the Babylonian origins of some astronomical and astrological elements in early Jewish texts, we need not envisage direct access to cuneiform sources in Babylonian centres of learning. The Jewish evidence differs markedly from the Greek evidence, where such direct contact must be presumed. In addition to the different levels of learning displayed by the Babylonian, Greek and Jewish evidence, we should again consider the textual similarities between Jewish and Babylonian texts.    [\u261e p7.54] The Hebrew Qumran calendar texts (4Q320\u2013321a) describe a consistent pattern of days between two phenomena from which it is clear that these phenomena are connected with the lunar cycle. This pattern has been explained by taking recourse to the Lunar Three scheme from Late Babylonian non-mathematical astronomical texts (see section 2.1 above), but this interpretation is not without difficulties. 87 Even if it would be certain that some elements of the Late Babylonian Lunar Three scheme were behind the Qumran calendar texts, these have been reworked in such a manner that there is no direct connection with actual Lunar Three texts.    [\u261e p7.55] Likewise, we need not suppose that the Aramaic Astronomical Book is a direct translation or rendering of cuneiform sources. 88 First, the texts do not look the same: En\u016bma Anu Enlil is shorter and more formulaic. 89 Second, similarities between the texts are of a structural rather than a specific nature. 90 As soon as a few astronomical and arithmetic principles from En\u016bma Anu Enlil Tablet 14 were understood it would not have been difficult to transmit that knowledge further. One need not assume further direct access to the text of En\u016bma Anu Enlil itself. This also applies to the linear zigzag function that is rooted in the type of astronomy of En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin. The occurrence of such principles alone in texts from other periods and from other cultural realms need not assume direct access to the cuneiform sources in Babylonia. Once such learning was carried elsewhere by scribes trained in it, those principles may have become part of a continuous tradition through which other individuals gained access to it, either through contact with travelling scribes or further down the chain of transmission via other individuals who equally no longer had access to the cuneiform texts.    [\u261e p7.56] The astrological texts from Qumran (4Q186 and 4Q318) also do not presuppose direct access to cuneiform sources or direct contact with Babylonian scholars. Moreover, the zodiac names in 4Q318 and the reference to the horoscope in 4Q186 point to Hellenistic traditions (see section 2.1 above). In this respect, these texts are analogous to Late Antique traditions in which Babylonian and Greek elements appear (see section 3.2 above). Knowledge of the zodiac did not therefore reach Jewish Palestine directly via access to cuneiform sources. If we take the evidence for the Hellenistic origin of the zodiac names in 4Q318 into account, perhaps the chain of transmission went via Aramaic to Greek and back again, or, after the zodiac was already appropriated by the Greeks, via Greek to Aramaic, through which Jews in Palestine may have encountered it in the second or first century BCE and also translated it into Hebrew. 91    [\u261e p7.57] The textual similarities between Jewish astronomical and astrological texts of the Hellenistic and early Roman periods and first millennium cuneiform sources from Babylonia are not of such a nature to suppose that the former are a direct translation or rendering of the latter. The similarities are \u2018structural\u2019 rather than specific. They concern general notions or motifs, rather than technical or specific data or visual layout and structure, as with evidence from the Greek world. 92    [\u261e p7.58] Whether we should see this Jewish tradition as popular or elite depends on the perspective taken. In their own society these Jewish scholars may have been part of the elite, but given the enormous difference between this learning and the advanced mathematical astronomy that was exchanged between Babylonian and Greek scholars at that time, the Jewish scholars probably were not part of that same scholarly network.    [\u261e p7.59] Regarding the assumption that Jewish scholars had direct access to Babylonian learning, we cannot simply invoke the Babylonian \u201cstream of tradition\u201d as a fixed and stable entity available everywhere, 93 into which Jewish individuals could simply have tapped, almost at will, at certain moments in history, such as during the Babylonian exile or thereafter. Recent research on a number of cuneiform scholarly collections indicate that the \u201cstream of tradition\u201d was not simply present everywhere and available to everyone. The production, transmission and dissemination of scholarly knowledge and texts was conditioned by specific circumstances, thus affecting the concrete manifestations of the Babylonian \u201cstream of tradition\u201d at certain places and times. 94 In addition, prohibitions on tablet movement expressed through secrecy formulae, which appear as important topoi in the colophons of scholarly texts, may not have been absolute, 95 but some form of boundary maintenance with regard to literary and scholarly texts did seem to have been in effect in Babylonia, limiting the accessibility and mobility of scientific knowledge.    [\u261e p7.60] Furthermore, the impression gained from cuneiform texts from the second half of the first millennium BCE in Babylonia is one of Babylonian urban elites who seemed reluctant to acknowledge the role of Aramaic and instead kept to traditional cuneiform as the sole official culture of Babylonia. The evidence is skewed because the cuneiform texts serve the self-interests of the Babylonian elite, conjuring up a view of Babylonia as an entirely cuneiform culture (see sections 3.1 and 3.2 above). However, from such an assessment we cannot infer that despite the Babylonian elite\u2019s self-interest and their preoccupation with their self-understanding amid a changing world there must have been a considerable body of Babylonian Aramaic literature and scholarship, all evidence of which subsequently was suppressed or must have vanished.    [\u261e p7.61] While the prestige of Babylonian astronomy facilitated the reception of Babylonian astronomers in the Greek world (see section 3.3 above), there may perhaps have been a similar effect in some cases with regard to Greek culture in the Babylonian world. 96 The Babylonian urban elite, with its thoroughly cuneiform culture and identity, seems to have positioned itself differently with regard to Greek culture and language than it did with regard to Aramaic culture and language. Some Babylonians learned Greek and participated in Greek scholarly networks. 97 This is not only illustrated by evidence for the direct transmission of advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy to the Greek world, but also by Berossus and the so-called Graeco-Babyloniaca. The Graeco-Babyloniaca tablets (Akkadian written in Greek characters) from around the turn of the Common Era demonstrate that native Babylonians, students in this case, knew Greek. 98 Berossus represents a fascinating example of a native Babylonian who aimed to present his culture to the wider Hellenistic world beyond the community of traditional Babylonian learning and therefore wrote in Greek. 99 That he wrote in Greek and not in Aramaic seems significant. Of course, this was motivated by his wish to address a Greek-speaking audience, but this is precisely why it seems significant that he wrote in Greek. When some members of the Babylonian urban elite opened up, so to say, it was to Greek culture and language, something they had apparently not done in a similar manner earlier in the context of the Persian Empire with regard to the Aramaic language in relation to astronomy and astrology, Aramaic being only the vernacular. 100 Greek culture and language may have enhanced the self-esteem and identity of Babylonian elites, which Aramaic presumably did not in first-millennium BCE Babylonia. 101 In the Hellenistic period, therefore, the available sources seem to indicate that some of the Babylonian elite had an active interest in disseminating elements of their culture to non-Babylonians\u2014but not just to any non-Babylonians.    [\u261e p7.62] While the evidence for the involvement of non-Babylonians in Babylonian science is meagre at best, the transmission of Babylonian astronomy to the Greek world and the cases of Berossus and the Graeco-Babyloniaca seem to suggest a different attitude among members of the Babylonian elite toward the Greeks. These considerations argue against the assumption that Babylonian elites would have been actively involved in transmitting some of their astronomical knowledge to Jews who were, relatively, only quite recently in their midst, 102 as opposed to the Aramaeans who settled there earlier but against whom, it appears, it was possible to maintain a persistent sense of difference up until the Hellenistic period (even if we assume Jews to have been part of a general Aramaic milieu). 103 It seems unlikely that in Babylonia, where impressive developments took place in mathematical astronomy from the mid-first-millennium BCE onward, Babylonian scholars would have engaged in the transmission of older forms of their astronomy to local Jews or more recent insights if the Lunar Three scheme should indeed be seen as having influenced Qumran calendar texts.    [\u261e p7.63] Of course, we may posit all sorts of suppositions: that there must already have been a whole body of Babylonian literature and scholarship in Aramaic in the first millennium BCE; that Jews must have been active in administrative functions; that they knew cuneiform; and that they had access to Babylonian cuneiform literature and scholarship. But there is no evidence for this and also no reason to assume such conditions in order to explain the Jewish evidence for scholarly traditions. If we take the actual Babylonian elements into account, these amount to features that do not presuppose direct access to cuneiform sources. The connecting chains of early Jewish astronomical and astrological traditions were probably much more remote from the centres of Babylonian science than previously assumed. All this does not deny the Babylonian origins of elements in early Jewish astronomical and astrological traditions, but it does highlight that these were encountered via different channels and agents than the transmission of Babylonian astronomical science to the Greek world. The transmission of cuneiform culture in Aramaic in Late Antiquity may suggest one such different trajectory.    [\u261e p7.64] So how did Jewish scholars become acquainted with some of the learning originating with Babylonian scholars? What network connections and channels of transmission can we suggest for Jewish scholars to have gained access to certain elements of Babylonian learning? Bearing in mind the three possible channels of transmission to the Greek world (see section 3.3 above), the one channel of transmission ruled out on the basis of the evidence available is that of direct contact in Babylonia between Jewish and Babylonian scholars. This leaves us with two possibilities, namely directly via contact with travelling scribes outside Babylonia or indirectly via a continuous tradition that had been transmitted to various localities through such travelling scholars. It is impossible to be specific as to the exact channels, localities and agents of transmission, as concrete evidence is lacking, but we might venture a hypothesis.    [\u261e p7.65] Two possible historical contexts seem to present themselves for obvious\u2014but different\u2014reasons: the Neo-Assyrian period and the Neo- and Late-Babylonian periods. Once we realize that for the \u201chow\u201d we need not assume direct contact, it is unnecessary to limit the cultural transfer of Mul.Apin and En\u016bma Anu Enlil type of astronomy to the Neo-Babylonian period or later. 104 Moreover, elements of Babylonian as well as Greek astronomical and astrological learning will have been transmitted at different moments in history, but there is no reason to think of these as clearly separate waves. 105 Logical necessity and historical sequence are not always identical in the history of science. 106 Thus, the older type of Enochic astronomy was used and slightly updated in Hebrew texts (4Q317, 4Q503 and possibly 4Q334) at a time when presumably other lunar schemes were also appropriated in the second century BCE (see section 2.1 above).    [\u261e p7.66] Only in the Neo-Assyrian period do we find evidence, at least in correspondence between scholars and the king, for the use of Aramaic in scholarly settings. The Neo-Assyrian period may thus have been conducive for the transmission of elements of cuneiform astronomical learning into Aramaic, from whence Aramaic became the medium for further diffusion of this material. This may have happened at the centres of learning, or perhaps at more provincial or peripheral localities. In addition, international scholars at the Neo-Assyrian court may have taken such traditions with them on their travels and transmitted elements of them into Aramaic along the way. Via such an indirect trajectory and through various points in between it may have reached Jews in Palestine sometime in the Hellenistic period, or perhaps already in the Persian period. As with the Late Antique evidence, we need not assume direct contact to explain the early Jewish evidence and can thus allow for a certain amount of time for such a hypothesized continuous tradition and for some of its elements to have materialized in the Aramaic Astronomical Book and Enochic astronomy.    [\u261e p7.67] If we posit the Neo- or Late-Babylonian periods as the historical context for this diffusion, the Aramaic Astronomical Book from Qumran is evidence for the transmission of Babylonian learning via the medium of Aramaic in first-millennium BCE Babylonia. This transmission probably did not happen in a direct manner such that Jews learned this type of astronomy through personal interaction with Babylonian or Assyrian scholars in their centres of learning. There being no reason to see the origin of the Aramaic Astronomical Book in the eastern Diaspora, it should be considered a Jewish Palestinian text. It is, therefore, not necessary to posit Babylonia as the place where the actual transmission to Jewish individuals must have occurred. 107    [\u261e p7.68] The astrological texts from Qumran seem to point to a different channel of transmission because of the Hellenistic astrological elements alongside a Babylonian one in the case of 4Q318 and probably 4Q186. These texts do not presuppose direct contact with cuneiform sources or Babylonian scholars, but may point to a more vague, continuous tradition of astronomical and astrological lore, analogous to Late Antique traditions (see above in this section). As for the Qumran calendar texts, if indeed these did have elements of the Late-Babylonian Lunar Three scheme as their model of inspiration, it seems significant that we find them rendered directly in Hebrew rather than Aramaic. 108 This argues against direct access to cuneiform sources and contact with Babylonian scholars.     5. Conclusion    [\u261e p7.69] Contrary to what is often assumed, 109 there is no evidence to suggest that during the first millennium BCE Jewish scholars had direct access to Babylonian centres of higher learning, such as the temples in Neo- and Late-Babylonian times, where they interacted with Babylonian astronomers and were able to read with their help cuneiform astronomical texts and appropriate such learning.    [\u261e p7.70] We should no longer think of a disembodied Babylonian \u201cstream of tradition\u201d that was simply out there and available and which individual representatives of Jewish tradition could have accessed effortlessly. Considering cultural encounters between Jews and Babylonians, there would have been different aspects involved and different levels of interaction to reckon with. Explanations for the appropriation of motifs from Gilgamesh, for acquaintance with Nabonidus traditions, for the reception of legal formulas or for the transmission of astronomical and astrological traditions should not be lumped together indiscriminately as being the result of direct access to elite Babylonian learning. In our approach we need to distinguish between different kinds of texts and traditions and differentiate between various channels and agents of transmission.    [\u261e p7.71] Regarding the transmission of Babylonian astronomical and astrological material to the Jewish world, we have considered the transmission of advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy into Greek sources, which suggests high-level contact between Greek and Babylonian scholars, either in Babylonia or elsewhere, or, at a later date when direct contact would not have been possible anymore, through a continuous tradition. Jewish scholars, at least as far as our sources are concerned (setting aside indirect testimonies, such as Abraham being an astronomical teacher, or the Daniel narratives presenting a Jewish sage at the Babylonian court), were not part of that same high-level network: the Jewish sources testify to a different level of scholarship. Future research should therefore look for network connections at other places than the centres of Babylonian learning, as has often been the case. Nor should we perceive of the transmission of Babylonian astronomical and astrological material to Second Temple period Palestine as having taken place in a direct manner but rather through various intermediaries, Aramaic and other channels, as well as via a\u2014more vague\u2014continuous tradition.    [\u261e p7.72] Via such indirect channels, elements of Babylonian and Greek astronomical and astrological learning reached certain people and certain places in Jewish Palestine, at least those at Qumran and the movement behind the Dead Sea Scrolls. Regarding these people, one might suggest that they formed a rather closed network, which was not particularly interested in current developments in the outside world. However, the scientific material shows otherwise, indicating a degree of openness to scholarly learning from other traditions. The different level of learning in comparison with contemporary Babylonian and Hellenistic astronomy suggests that although \u201cQumran\u201d was connected, it was not as well connected to those scholarly networks that participated in the transmission of knowledge between Babylonia and Greek culture in Greece, Egypt and elsewhere in the Hellenistic world.    [\u261e p7.73] In the centuries after the turn of the era things may have been different in terms of \u201chigh-level\u201d contact between Jewish and Babylonian elites, 110 but these data cannot be anachronistically projected backward into the first millennium BCE Jewish participation in society may simply have been different in those changed historical contexts. 111 The times of Medieval and especially early Modern Europe were still far away. 112      [\u261e endnote-chapter7-1] 1 In this article I develop further some of the arguments in my \u201cThe Emergence of Aramaic and Hebrew Scholarly Texts: Transmission and Translation of Alien Wisdom,\u201d in The Dead Sea Scrolls: Transmission of Traditions and Production of Texts (ed. S. Metso, H. Najman, and E. Schuller; Leiden: Brill, 2010), 81\u2013114.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-2] 2 This relates to primarily indirect evidence in ancient sources that has been adduced to support such inferences; one can think of the portrayal of Daniel\u2019s position at the Neo-Babylonian court. See, for example, the discussion and references in Jonathan Ben-Dov, Head of All Years: Astronomy and Calendars at Qumran in their Ancient Context (Leiden: Brill, 2008), 266, 270-275. See also Henryk Drawnel, The Aramaic Astronomical Book (4Q208-4Q211) from Qumran: Text, Commentary, and Translation (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 51, 53, 70, 301, 304, and the contribution by James VanderKam in this volume.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-3] 3 Regarding the concept of science in Antiquity, I am not interested in any normative evaluations about whether the ancient learning we encounter in these texts should properly be called \u201cscience.\u201d Science is not detached from social reality. It is to a degree a historically defined activity conducted by people in different contexts. What counts as scientific knowledge may differ over time and place depending on context; see, e.g., David N. Livingstone, Putting Science in Its Place: Geographies of Scientific Knowledge (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2003); Mladen Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body: Physiognomics and Astrology in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Hellenistic-Early Roman Period Judaism (Leiden: Brill, 2007), 211-213; Eleanor Robson, \u201cEmpirical Scholarship in the Neo-Assyrian Court,\u201d in The Empirical Dimension of Ancient Near Eastern Studies / Die empirische Dimension altorientalischer Forschungen (ed. G.J. Selz and K. Wagensonner; Vienna: Lit, 2011), 603-629. If need be, working definitions for ancient science can be given; see, e.g., Philip S. Alexander, \u201cEnoch and the Beginnings of Jewish Interest in Natural Science,\u201d in this volume; Francesca Rochberg, The Heavenly Writing: Divination, Horoscopy, and Astronomy in Mesopotamian Culture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004); Ben-Dov, Head of All Years ; Rita Watson and Wayne Horowitz, Writing Science before the Greeks: A Naturalistic Analysis of the Babylonian Astronomical Treatise Mul.Apin (Leiden: Brill, 2011). The choice of what count as scientific texts here has been made pragmatically and is determined by specific Jewish texts and their Babylonian \u201ccounterparts.\u201d To a certain extent, the demarcation between various kinds of texts is, of course, arbitrary. In this article I do not include, for example, magical texts, although elements that we might denote as magical also play a role in some of the texts under consideration here; see Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 51\u201354, 234-237; idem, \u201cAstrologische und magische Traditionen im antiken Judentum und die Texte vom Toten Meer,\u201d in Qumran aktuell: Texte und Themen der Schriften vom Toten Meer (ed. S. Beyerle and J. Frey; Biblisch-Theologische Studien 120; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 2011), 111-136 (112-113, 127-131). Furthermore, if we take into account the people that worked with these texts, demarcations are also to a certain extent arbitrary: there is evidence that different specialists in Mesopotamia worked on diverse and distinct disciplines, but there is also evidence that learned disciplines were not always nicely divided between different types of specialists. We need to look at specific historical contexts to determine whether demarcations were upheld and to what extent, and ask what this means for the dissemination and transmission of learned knowledge in that particular context. With regard to Jewish scholars or scientists in Hellenistic and early Roman Palestine, we have no comparative evidence about different kinds of scholars being responsible for different types of learning, although some such distinctions may be hypothesized; see the discussion and references in Popovi\u0107, \u201cThe Emergence of Aramaic and Hebrew Scholarly Texts,\u201d 106\u20138.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-4] 4 For the possibility that the numbers and fractions used in the Aramaic Levi Document reflect a Babylonian-type sexagesimal numeral system, see Henryk Drawnel, An Aramaic Wisdom Text from Qumran: A New Interpretation of the Levi Document (Leiden: Brill, 2004), 280-293. See also Ben-Dov, Head of All Years , 254; Popovi\u0107, \u201cThe Emergence of Aramaic and Hebrew Scholarly Texts,\u201d 106\u20137.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-5] 5 It is a moot point whether the scientific manuscripts from Qumran are representative for Jewish scholarship in general at the time or more typical for the movement behind the Dead Sea Scrolls. We know all ancient Jewish scientific literature, except the Enochic, only via the Qumran corpus. I assume that Jews outside this specific movement were also acquainted with this type of knowledge. The dates for some of the Aramaic Astronomical Enoch manuscripts predate the settlement at Qumran and indicate scholarly activity elsewhere and outside of that specific movement.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-7] 7 The temporal horizon of the Jewish texts is determined by the dates of the manuscripts from Qumran; these range broadly from the third century BCE to the first century CE.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-10] 10 Ben-Dov, Head of All Years , 161-167, 182-183, 245-246 suggests that the Jewish 364-day year tradition actually goes back to an intercalation passage in Mul.Apin that implies the same number, but was never implemented in the actual astronomical models and soon after the seventh century BCE yielded to more accurate numbers. In Jewish astral science as we find it in the Qumran texts, however, the 364-day year model became the cornerstone of Enochic cosmological learning.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-17] 17 There is no evidence for astrology in the Aramaic text 4Q561; see Popovi\u0107, \u201cThe Emergence of Aramaic and Hebrew Scholarly Texts,\u201d 102. 4Q561 (copied in either the first or the second half of the first century BCE) is a physiognomic catalogue that listed the physical descriptions of different types of people. There is some evidence that the text originally listed prognostics for each physiognomic type. Generally speaking, the physiognomic traditions of Babylonia and Greece are different. Babylonian physiognomics was principally a divinatory art that predicted people\u2019s future on the basis of their physical characteristics. Graeco-Roman physiognomics was by and large concerned with the discernment of people\u2019s characters, whereas the predictive function was minimal. The evidence for predictions in 4Q561 seems, therefore, to suggest Babylonian influence. But matters are not as clear-cut, because Babylonian physiognomics also seems to have been partially concerned with the discernment of character, and the case of Polemo of Laodicea (second century CE) demonstrates that Graeco-Roman traditions were also familiar with the predictive possibilities of physiognomics. See Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 69\u201371, 111-112; Simon Swain (ed.), Seeing the Face, Seeing the Soul: Polemon\u2019s Physiognomy from Classical Antiquity to Medieval Islam (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007).

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-20] 20 Maybe the composition should be dated to the fourth century already, although I see insufficient reason to assume a date for the Astronomical Book that much earlier than the manuscript evidence of 4Q208, especially since it is debatable whether the Aramaic Enoch manuscripts from Qumran should be equated with the Astronomical Book from Ethiopic Enoch; see the references in n. 12 above for a discussion of these issues.

Previously I assumed that this absence of evidence does not imply evidence for the lack of ephemerides and almanacs, but I also emphasized that complex mathematical-astronomical knowledge was not a prerequisite for practising astrology. Now I also tend to emphasize that the absence of evidence should caution us not to tacitly assume that Jewish scholars would have had access to resources such as ephemerides and almanacs.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-27] 27 The astrological texts from Qumran represent learning that is different with regard to the heptadic-based model from Enochic astronomy and its offshoots and the calendric texts from Qumran. The notion of the zodiac is another crucial difference. The zodiac is absent in early Enochic astronomy.

There is no reason to think that Aristotle made any such request to Callisthenes. More likely, Aristotle\u2019s reference in De caelo to observational data from the Babylonians set commentators thinking how the information could have been obtained, and one obvious hypothesis, it seems, was that Callisthenes supplied it, although this ignores the reference to the Egyptians.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-32] 32 Strabo, Geogr. 16.1.6, refers to the Orchenoi and the Borsippenoi as classes of Chaldean astronomers. In the same passage, Strabo also refers to individual Chaldean astronomers: Kidenas, Naburianus, Sudines and Seleucus of Seleuceia. For a brief discussion of individual astronomers known by name to Graeco-Roman authors as Chaldean astronomers, see Jones, \u201cEvidence for Babylonian Arithmetical Schemes,\u201d 88\u201389; Geller, \u201cThe Last Wedge,\u201d 49; Tom Boiy, Late Achaemenid and Hellenistic Babylon (Leuven: Peeters, 2004), 297 n. 24. See also below in section 3.3 for an inscription from Larissa in Thessaly that refers to a certain Antipater from Hierapolis as a Chaldean astronomer. Of course, there are numerous references to the \u201cChaldeans\u201d and their skills in Greek and Latin sources, but they function more often than not as stock characters for authors to talk about astrologers or their skills. Not much specific information as to the transmission of their learning or in what respect it was of Babylonian origin can be gleaned from these sources. The references to the expulsion of \u201cChaldeans\u201d from Rome indicate that they were regarded as undesirable for various reasons at various times, but these references hardly give us specific data as to the concrete people and circumstances involved.

Steele, \u201cVisual Aspects of the Transmission of Babylonian Astronomy and its Reception into Greek Astronomy,\u201d Annals of Science 68 (2011): 453-465.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-34] 34 For example, Ptolemy of Alexandria, Almagest 3.7, refers to records of ancient observations from the beginning of the reign of the Babylonian king Nabonassar (747\u2013734 BCE) that had been preserved down to his own time, and to which Ptolemy claimed to have had access, although no further information about them is provided, nor how Ptolemy accessed them and in what language.

Steele, \u201cApplied Historical Astronomy: An Historical Perspective,\u201d Journal for the History of Astronomy 35 (2004): 337-355 (338-346). See also Christopher B.F. Walker, \u201cAchaemenid Chronology and the Babylonian Sources,\u201d in Mesopotamia and Iran in the Persian Period: Conquest and Imperialism 539-331 BC (ed. J.

Presenting astral learning also as revealed knowledge (Methuselah learned everything through the angels of God), Pseudo-Eupolemus shares a topos with Babylonian sources. See, e.g., Wilfred G. Lambert, \u201cA Catalogue of Texts and Authors,\u201d JCS 16 (1962): 59\u201377; Beate Pongratz-Leisten, Herrschaftswissen in Mesopotamien: Formen der Kommunikation zwischen Gott und K\u00f6nig im 2. und 1. Jahrtausend v. Chr. (Helsinki: The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 1999), 293-295; Rochberg, Heavenly Writing , 181-185, 215. The Genesis Apocryphon from Qumran Cave 1 also emphasizes Abraham\u2019s wisdom and learning, pointing out that the pharaoh\u2019s officials visited him to seek out his wisdom, as well as his wife. The Genesis Apocryphon possibly also refers more specifically to Abraham\u2019s astronomical wisdom, as he is said to have read to the Egyptian officials from the book of the words of Enoch (1QapGen ar 19:24\u201325). Josephus remarks that astronomical learning derived from the Chaldeans ( Ant. 1.168). Philo admits as much, but explains Abraham\u2019s emigration from Ur allegorically as a rejection of astrology ( Abraham 68\u201384; Migration 176\u2013187; cf. also Heir 96\u201399; Josephus, Ant. 1.155\u2013157). Likewise, Jub 12:16\u201318 has Abraham observing the stars before leaving Ur and his astrological interests behind. Some of these passages reflect an ancient discourse on the origins of astronomy/astrology, putting Abraham, via Enoch, forward as a Jewish culture hero. See brief discussion and references in Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 225-226. The discourse on the origins of astronomy/astrology was in itself part of the wider debate about the priority of cultures and about which culture was dependent on which. See, e.g., Geert De Breucker, \u201cBerossos between Tradition and Innovation,\u201d in The Oxford Handbook of Cuneiform Culture (ed. K. Radner and E. Robson; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 637-657 (650).   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-36] 36 See n. 35 above.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-37] 37 The literature on Social Network Analysis theory is enormous, and it mostly concentrates on the study of the present, using statistical data. However, Social Network Analysis theory has also begun to be used for earlier periods of history. See, e.g., Peter S. Bearman, Relations into Rhetorics: Local Elite Social Structure in Norfolk 1540\u20131640 (Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1993); John F. Padgett and Christopher K.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-67] 67 This assessment may distract rather than explain. It is not meant as a normative observation but rather to indicate that Late Antique Babylonian sources do not transmit advanced mathematical astronomy but instead the divinatory astrological traditions. It is readily admitted that one goes with the other, as it did in first millennium BCE Babylonia and in Hellenistic astronomy and astrology, as in the case of Ptolemy. At the same time, when we find the divinatory side of the coin, we need not always presuppose knowledge of the technical and mathematical astronomical requirements. A telling example from the modern world comes from present-day India, which vividly shows how traditional horoscopy is practiced without mathematical astronomical knowledge; see Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 162-163.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-68] 68 See Westenholz, \u201cThe Graeco-Babyloniaca Once Again,\u201d 308. The situation of Late Antique Babylonian astrological literature is actually somewhat more complex, as some of the sources of these texts are not just Babylonian, but also Greek; see Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 37, 111. Aage Westenholz\u2019s remark is directed at the medical, astrological and magical traditions reflected in the Talmud and the Mandaic texts from Late Antiquity, arguing that these do not derive \u201cdirectly\u201d from scholarly cuneiform tablets. The case with the texts from Qumran is different in that those texts are not examples of \u201cpopular\u201d culture but of a different level of scholarly culture than that of cuneiform culture at the time. The point, however, is the same: neither derives directly from cuneiform sources. For the early Jewish evidence we likewise need to posit indirect channels of diffusion (see below).

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-95] 95 It has long been debated in Assyriological studies how such secrecy and curse formulae should be understood. Recently, the pendulum seems to have swung back in the direction of the secrecy formulae being taken more or less at face value, implying that the scholarly corpora of astrologers, diviners and others were considered to be secret in principle. How this principle will have worked out in specific contexts, however, is a different matter. The notion of secrecy and especially its social functions should be further specified in its socio-cultural contexts.

Networks of Scholars: The Transmission of Astronomical and Astrological Learning between Babylonians, Greeks and Jews    Mladen Popovi\u0107    1. Introduction    [\u261e p7.1] What do we know about what ancient Jewish scholars knew about what Babylonian scholars knew? 1 In order to answer this question we can analyse the different scholarly texts at our disposal, Babylonian and Jewish, and look for similarities and differences. We can then explain which Babylonian elements were familiar to Jewish scholars and how they appropriated, used and reworked these. Such analyses usually work from specific Jewish texts and then look for Babylonian elements, retracing these in specific cuneiform texts.    [\u261e p7.2] The issue of tracking influences and cultural encounters between Babylonia and Jewish Palestine has another side to it, one not often put to the fore. Previous research on tracing influences of Babylonian learning in ancient Jewish texts has reflected insufficiently on the specific nature of such cultural encounters and the means of transmission. It has been assumed, tacitly or explicitly, that Jewish scholars had direct access to Babylonian centres of learning. 2 On the level of textual comparisons, it is evident that elements of Babylonian origin appear in ancient Jewish texts; this is not disputed at all. However, the occurrence of textual similarities alone does not constitute enough evidence to argue for a direct connection. We at least need to further qualify the nature of that connection. Considering the social context of knowledge transmission, we must ask how and through whom ancient Jewish scholars got to know about some of the things that Babylonian scholars knew.    [\u261e p7.3] In this article I wish to focus mainly on two aspects of the social context of the transmission of astronomical learning in ancient Judaism. The first aspect is the differentiation between various levels of learning on the one hand and how this manifests itself in social relations between learned individuals on the other. The second aspect is that of ethnicity and cultural encounters with regard to learned knowledge.    [\u261e p7.4] I shall argue that the level of learning that we encounter in early Jewish sources differs starkly from contemporary developments in Babylonian and Greek astronomical science and points to a different trajectory of transmission. The transmission of Babylonian learning to Jewish scholars in Palestine was not a direct one. Furthermore, it went through different channels from the transmission of Babylonian astronomical science to Greek scholars. We should not assume as fact that Jewish scholars had direct access to Babylonian schools. We have no evidence for this. Due to the nature of the evidence at our disposal we cannot be very specific about the exact ways in which Babylonian scholarship reached Jewish Palestine sometime during the second half of the first millennium BCE Yet from a methodological point of view a number of considerations discussed in this article should be taken into account in future research on this issue. 3    2. Babylonian and Jewish Astral Sciences    [\u261e p7.5] A brief survey of the Enochic astronomical material and some of the Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran with regard to the Babylonian elements that they contain 4 provides some insight into the interests and level of knowledge of ancient Jewish scholars. 5 The point is to discern some of the social and cultural aspects that may have determined the context of transmission of Babylonian elements of astral sciences in Jewish texts, and to consider this in comparison with the transmission of astral sciences within Babylonian culture and between Babylonia and the Greek world.    [\u261e p7.6] On the one hand, the Jewish texts attest to knowledge of some elements from Babylonian astronomy from the first half of the first millennium BCE (En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin), of the concept of the zodiac that was introduced in the fifth century BCE and of the non-mathematical Lunar Three scheme that was developed sometime later. On the other hand, these texts show an apparent ignorance with regard to sophisticated forms of mathematical astronomy that were developed in Seleucid Babylonia and transmitted to the Greek world.    [\u261e p7.7] The scholars behind the Jewish texts remain anonymous. In the Enochic corpus the authorial \u201cI\u201d was ascribed to Enoch, while the astronomical and astrological manuscripts from Qumran lack an authorial \u201cI\u201d altogether, as I emphasized elsewhere, 6 as do the calendric texts. 7 What Babylonian elements do we encounter in these texts? What changes and transformations did Babylonian elements go through as they were used in new Jewish-Palestinian texts and contexts?    2.1 Textual Comparisons    [\u261e p7.8] The earliest Jewish astronomical work is the Enochic Astronomical Book (extant after extensive redaction and modifications in 1 Enoch 72\u201382). Composed in Aramaic in the third century BCE or even earlier, the most complete text is preserved in Ethiopic translation. Four Aramaic copies (4Q208\u2013211), containing only the Astronomical Book , have turned up at Qumran. The oldest fragments date to the late third or early second century BCE (4Q208). Scholars have pointed to a Mesopotamian background for some of the astronomical aspects of the Enochic Astronomical Book . 8 1 Enoch 72 records the annual variation in the length of day and night-time. This variation is measured on a scale of eighteen, reflecting an M:m ratio of 2:1, 9 which results in a simple linear zigzag function rooted in Babylonian astronomy. Originally counting a 360-day year, as does Mul.Apin, for example, the Astronomical Book subsequently developed a 364-day year tradition. 10 For the so-called synchronistic calendar in the Aramaic fragments from Qumran (4Q208\u2013209), the most recent suggestion is that it mainly deals with the duration of lunar visibility during night and day in a fashion similar to Tablet 14 of En\u016bma Anu Enlil. 11    [\u261e p7.9] The astronomy in the Enochic Astronomical Book reaches back to older Mesopotamian examples from the first half of the first millennium BCE, such as En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin, but the Astronomical Book does not reflect developments that occurred in Mesopotamian astronomy from the middle of the first millennium onward. These developments comprised the formulation of mathematical models that enable the prediction of the recurrence of certain astronomical phenomena and the introduction of the zodiac as a schematic, symbolic division of the ecliptic for computing and recording the planetary positions more exactly. The composition of the Astronomical Book 12 probably predates the even more advanced developments in Babylonian astronomy of the second century BCE, which were not incorporated into the text. The later copies of the Aramaic Astronomical Book from Qumran (4Q209\u2013211 date to the second half and the end of the first century BCE) do not show evidence of such \u201cupdates.\u201d Moreover, the importance attributed to the Enochic type of astronomy is illustrated by the fact that the Aramaic Astronomical Book influenced other texts of the Jewish-Palestinian astronomical tradition, such as 4Q317 and 4Q503 and possibly 4Q334, Hebrew manuscripts dating from the second half of the second century BCE (4Q317 and 4Q503) and from the turn of the era (4Q334). 13    [\u261e p7.10] There is also possible evidence for the use of more contemporary astronomical learning from Babylonia, although still in the form of non-mathematical astronomy. Scholars have interpreted some of the Qumran calendar texts in Hebrew (4Q320, 4Q321 and 4Q321a, which date to the end of the second century BCE until the second half of the first century BCE) to be based on elements of a Late-Babylonian lunar system (Persian-Hellenistic period), the Lunar Three scheme from non-mathematical astronomical texts, which were appropriated and modified by Jewish scholars to meet their own calendric needs. 14    [\u261e p7.11] In addition to the Aramaic Astronomical Book , the texts influenced by it and some of the calendar texts from Qumran, there are two astrological manuscripts from Qumran to take into account. Both texts attest to knowledge of the zodiac and thus illustrate that they had taken up one of the developments of Babylonian astronomy from the second half of the first millennium. However, whether this knowledge originated from Babylonia or from the Greek world is another matter.    [\u261e p7.12] Alongside Babylonian elements, these two texts appear to display Hellenistic features as well. This should not surprise us. During the Hellenistic period knowledge of Babylonian astrology and mathematical astronomy reached the Greek world, and having been transformed into Hellenistic astronomy and astrology it was taken elsewhere again. The Aramaic manuscript 4Q318 (copied around the turn of the era) consists of two parts. The first part ( selenodromion ) describes the synodic movement of the moon through the zodiac during twelve months of thirty days each, counting a 360-day year, as in Babylonian tradition. The second part ( brontologion ) has predictions for when it will thunder. This sort of text appears both in the Babylonian and Graeco-Roman astrological traditions. 15 The 360-day year scheme suggests a derivation from Babylonian tradition, but the zodiacal names in 4Q318 seem to point to Hellenistic origins. 16 The Hebrew manuscript 4Q186 (copied around the turn of the era) is a physiognomic-astrological catalogue combining different forms of learning (physiognomics, 17 astrology and possibly medicine and magic). The combination of different scientific disciplines within one text is probably already the case in Babylonian traditions predating the Hellenistic period. 18 The text\u2019s astrological framework, however, points decisively to a Hellenistic background, as the horoscope ( \u05de\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3 ; molad ) or ascendant (the point of the zodiac rising above the eastern horizon at the moment of birth) is of no importance at all in Babylonian horoscopy but is significant in Hellenistic horoscopy. 19    [\u261e p7.13] Three observations can be drawn from the previous survey. First, elements from older types of Mesopotamian astronomy and astrology such as En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin from the first half of the first millennium BCE resurfaced in Aramaic in the early Enochic corpus sometime in the third century BCE 20 In this form, this type of astronomy continued to influence new compositions in Hebrew up until at least the second half of the second century BCE (4Q317 and 4Q503) and possibly later (4Q334). The evidence of new Hebrew compositions inspired by Enochic astronomy is important, as it demonstrates that the reception of older types of Babylonian astronomy was not limited to the early Enochic corpus. From a diachronic perspective we may observe that older types of Babylonian astronomy did not become obsolete after their initial reception in Jewish circles in the form of Enochic astronomy, but continued to be regarded relevant. This is demonstrated both by the later date of the Astronomical Book manuscripts from Qumran (4Q209\u2013211) and by the new compositions in Hebrew that were inspired by it. This preservation of older types of material may argue against continuing contact with Babylonia or at least may suggest rare contact.    [\u261e p7.14] Second, alongside the ongoing transmission of older elements of Babylonian astronomy from En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin, more recent features appear that post-date that type of astronomy but predate developments in the advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy of the second century BCE. Calendric manuscripts from Qumran (4Q320, 4Q321 and 4Q321a) seem to be influenced by the Lunar Three scheme from Late-Babylonian non-mathematical astronomical texts. Astrological manuscripts from Qumran (4Q186 and 4Q318) demonstrate that knowledge of the zodiac, which was developed sometime in the fifth century BCE, found its way into Jewish society during this period as well. The manuscript copies are evidence of this development in the first century BCE at the latest. However, the mathematical type of astronomy is absent in all this.    [\u261e p7.15] Third, these ancient Jewish sources show a level of astronomical competency that was far less sophisticated than the advanced methods of contemporary astronomers in Babylonian and Greek societies. Starting in the Persian period but especially in the Seleucid period, Babylonian scholars made new and great advances in mathematical astronomy. 21 These advanced Babylonian astronomical methods were also transmitted to the Greek world. Due to the encounter with Babylonian astronomy and due to the work of Hipparchus and others such as Hypsicles, Hellenistic astronomy changed tremendously in this period. 22 Knowledge of certain elements of Babylonian astronomy among Greek scholars already occurred before Hipparchus, between the fifth and third centuries (Eudoxus, for example), but it is in the second century, especially with Hipparchus it seems, \u201cthat we see a more complex and systematic exploitation of the resources of the Babylonian astronomers, including not only a whole array of period relations, but also extensive observations and, most notably, mathematical methods.\u201d 23    [\u261e p7.16] The extant Jewish sources do not attest likewise to this influence from advanced mathematical astronomy from Babylonia. Aramaic Enochic astronomy remained non-mathematical. The earliest of the calendric manuscripts from Qumran (4Q320) dates to the end of the second century BCE and the youngest (4Q321) to the second half of the first century BCE While these manuscripts postdate the development of advanced astronomy in Babylonia and its transmission to the Greek world, they do not reflect those developments. The astrological manuscripts from Qumran attest knowledge of the zodiac, but this occurs in relatively straightforward lists. We do not find actual horoscopes, although even those need not presuppose the ability to execute complex observations and calculations. Such data may have been at hand in ephemerides and the like, but we have no evidence for this in Palestinian Judaism in this period. It appears that the concept of the zodiac found its way into Palestinian Jewish astral science as a finished product, so to say, without specialist knowledge of the mathematical-astronomical intricacies on which horoscopic astrology was based, and possibly also without access to supporting texts such as ephemerides\u2014there is at least no need to suppose that these sorts of texts were available to Jewish scholars. 24    2.2 Different Levels of Learning    [\u261e p7.17] Should we think of Enochic astronomy and its offshoots as survivals of types of astronomy that were already out-dated in Babylonia itself? What does \u201cout-dated\u201d mean? More advanced mathematical methods had been developed in Babylonian astronomy whilst Enochic astronomy flourished in Palestinian Judaism, but perhaps as a rule of thumb that kind of astronomy may still have had its worth. In that respect we should not unnecessarily devalue it. Furthermore, there is some evidence for the continued transmission of En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin in Babylonia during the Seleucid period, but we do not know whether these were actually used. 25 Even if there is some evidence for continued copying of En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin, it is evident that from a general perspective the character of astronomy differs strikingly between Babylonia and Jewish Palestine in the Hellenistic period. In Babylonia these texts were being copied alongside new and important astronomical advances, which are conspicuously absent from the extant Palestinian Jewish astronomical and astrological texts.    [\u261e p7.18] The extant texts thus show different levels of astronomical learning. What ramifications does this conclusion have for understanding the channels of transmission through which ancient Jewish scholars learned about Babylonian astral sciences? How did Jewish scholars in Palestine relate to the current advanced astronomical developments in Seleucid Babylonia? Did Jewish scholars consciously ignore these developments for some reason? Was the more recent and advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy too difficult for them to appropriate? Or were they completely unaware of these developments because they were not connected in the same way to the same networks as those that transmitted Babylonian learning to the Greek world?    [\u261e p7.19] It is doubtful whether the apparent lack of knowledge of advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy was due to a conscious decision motivated by certain theological considerations, as has been suggested. 26 A scientific-religious worldview characterized by a specific emphasis on heptadic-based numbers might explain the calendar texts from Qumran and the Enochic astronomical material to support that, but it does not provide a satisfactory explanation for the astrological material from Qumran. The concept of the zodiac does not support such a worldview. 27    [\u261e p7.20] This begs the question: why were some concepts appropriated while others were not? There seems no reason to suppose that the authors or scribes behind the Enochic material and the Dead Sea Scrolls would have been intellectually less capable of dealing with complex mathematical-astronomical procedures from contemporary Babylonia. Instead, we should look for an explanation in terms of social relations and networks.    [\u261e p7.21] With due regard for the caveat that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, in this case what is missing in the extant Jewish sources may provide us with a clue that, with regard to the astral sciences at that time, the channels of transmission between Babylonia and Jewish Palestine were probably different from the channels between Babylonia and the Greek world. When looking for Babylonian influences on ancient Jewish science it is not just a matter of listing the elements and looking for similarities and differences between texts. We cannot without further ado connect streams of traditions from Uruk, Sippar, Babylon and the like with Jerusalem, Qumran or any other place where Jewish scholars lived.    [\u261e p7.22] The different levels of learning should make us cautious of simply viewing the learned elites from different localities as interacting with each other on the same level. Mindful of Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s concept of cultural capital, we can appreciate the scholarly learning in the early Enochic and Qumran texts as a prized piece of knowledge signalling and confirming the status of those having access to and possessing it. 28 But the Jewish scholarly elite may not have been of the same standing as the Babylonian scholarly elite, or the Greek one for that matter. In their respective societies Babylonian and Jewish scholars may have been members of the elite, but although stories about Abraham teaching Phoenicians and Egyptians or Daniel at the Babylonian court suggest otherwise, this need not imply that in real life the one recognized the other as equal or that there was direct contact between them, as is often assumed. Especially important here is to balance the two elements of having or gaining access and giving or allowing access as these materialize in social relationships between individuals.    3. Cultural Encounters and the Transmission of Astronomical Learning    [\u261e p7.23] Simplicius, the Late Antique commentator on Aristotle\u2019s works, wrote that, according to Porphyry, Aristotle had asked Callisthenes, who was in Babylon with Alexander the Great, to send astronomical observations from Babylon to Greece. 29 In De caelo Aristotle himself refers to observational data by the Egyptians and the Babylonians as the basis for much of their (i.e. the Greeks) evidence about particular luminaries. 30    [\u261e p7.24] Regardless of whether such a request was really made by Aristotle, the anecdote illustrates how some in Late Antiquity imagined such cultural encounters and the transmission of knowledge between Babylon and Greece: reports were simply sent from Babylon directly to Greece by a Greek visitor of certain status. Unfortunately, the anecdote does not really provide us with much concrete information. The nature of the reports is not specified, nor their number: what kind of sources and how many? Nor is it clear what language they were in (a Late Antique writer would probably not have thought of Akkadian anymore): 31 did Simplicius imagine the reports were in Greek? Furthermore, there is no explanation of how exactly Callisthenes obtained these sources or from whom. It was not as if astronomical reports were just lying around to be picked up by anyone. How did he know where to go? Did Callisthenes walk into a temple in Babylon, the Esangila, for example? Did he know individual Babylonian astronomers? 32 Such questions were probably not on Simplicius\u2019 mind, but from a socio-historical perspective on science we need to address some of these questions as to possession, accessibility and mobility in order to better understand the transmission of scholarly knowledge, in this case astronomical learning.    [\u261e p7.25] That Babylonian learning travelled far beyond its original geographic boundaries is undisputed. It is evident that Babylonian sciences such as astronomy and astrology were transmitted beyond the Mesopotamian cultural realm to the west, and to the east for that matter. We find Babylonian mathematical and astronomical formulas and calculations that turn up in roughly contemporary and later texts of other cultural realms. Modern scholars have shown that Babylonian astral sciences contributed to and influenced Greek astronomy and astrology. 33 Ancient sources also acknowledge such Babylonian origins, 34 and we have examples of Jewish texts that put Abraham on a par with scholars from Egypt, Phoenicia and Babylon. 35    [\u261e p7.26] The views of Simplicius and, for example, Pseudo-Eupolemus, 36 are rather clear-cut: scientific data were transmitted to others in written form and scholarly knowledge was exchanged in direct interaction between learned men. In general, both aspects, written and oral communication, no doubt shaped ancient contexts of transmission, but in specific cases we probably have to differentiate: scientific data were not just sent around indiscriminately and not all learned men would, as a rule, have interacted with all learned men from other cultural realms, this being dependent on various factors.    [\u261e p7.27] Insights from Social Network Analysis theory may help to conceptualize specific conditions for the transmission of astronomical and astrological knowledge. 37 I will not provide a systematic consideration of all forms of connectivity that may have played a role, but will use Social Network Analysis theory as a heuristic tool to ask certain specific socio-cultural questions. The benefit of this approach is that it focuses our attention on the social context of the transmission of astronomical knowledge, as this is determined by social relationships, and with a special emphasis on networks. The question is what kinds of social networks were involved. People transmit information and knowledge via different mediums in specific contexts\u2014defined by, for example, locality, social status, gender, age, kinship, nationality and ethnicity. In order to understand the context, i.e. the circumstances of these interactions and of the transmission of knowledge, we must focus on concrete localities, channels and agents.    [\u261e p7.28] In this section I wish to address three issues regarding the transmission of Babylonian astronomy and astrology: the involvement of non-Babylonians in Babylonian science, the role of the Aramaic language and the transmission to the Greek world specifically.    3.1 The Involvement of Non-Babylonians in Babylonian Science    [\u261e p7.29] With regard to ethno-linguistic and cultural distinctions, modern anthropological and cultural studies have called essentialist distinctions into doubt: what makes a certain type of learning \u201cEgyptian\u201d or \u201cBabylonian,\u201d and how does that relate to concrete people, be they Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek or Jewish? 38 There is somewhat of a paradox in some recent analyses in that such terms are problematized as less useful heuristic concepts whereas our taxonomic interests call for their use. We wish to categorize and classify our data into neat and separate boxes, and at the same time wish to acknowledge that the boundaries between these conceptual boxes are often, in reality, fluid and fuzzy.    [\u261e p7.30] Nonetheless, that boundaries are fluid, fuzzy or that they can be crossed does not imply they do not exist; boundaries are not completely ephemeral, and sometimes they are very real. While ethno-linguistic and cultural borders can be crossed, they also function to create a persistent sense of difference. 39 Specific social and cultural contexts will have determined when and how boundaries would have been more fluid or stricter.    [\u261e p7.31] We have evidence from the Neo-Assyrian period of non-Babylonians and non-Assyrians engaged in royal scholarly networks. 40 The late Assyrian empire had become bilingual and bicultural, with Aramaic becoming the international vernacular. 41 At the same time, there is evidence for adversarial reactions among the Assyrian ruling classes to the rising importance of Aramaic. For example, to a request by the scribe Sin-iddina of Ur to reply in Aramaic, the king answers that the scribe should rather write to him in Akkadian. 42 This example works both ways. On the one hand, it shows that ethno-linguistic boundaries were not strict: letters to the Assyrian king could be written in Aramaic. On the other hand, it demonstrates that such boundaries were not completely ephemeral. The sender of the letter may have asked for too much by requesting the king\u2019s answer also be in Aramaic. The king retorts by raising the boundary and emphasizing its importance: he creates an ethno-linguistic sense of difference between the scribe and himself. While ethno-linguistic and cultural boundaries can be crossed, they are also maintained. However, in the Neo-Assyrian period such boundaries do not seem to have prohibited the accessibility and dissemination of Babylonian science.    [\u261e p7.32] If we look at evidence from the Neo- and Late-Babylonian periods, it seems that the Babylonian urban elite had stricter limitations for entry into the scholarly elite than the Assyrians. 43 There is, however, some evidence for scribes bearing non-Akkadian names who copied literary, scholarly texts: \u0160emaa, son of Adirum is thus far the only example, the extant sources showing that all Babylonian scribes with non-Akkadian names wrote documentary, legal texts. 44 Ethno-linguistic boundaries may not have been absolute, but some form of boundary maintenance with regard to literary and scholarly texts as distinct from documentary, legal texts did seem to be in effect.    [\u261e p7.33] Through cuneiform culture the Babylonian urban elite is said to have expressed a high degree of self-consciousness. For example, a cuneiform text from Hellenistic Uruk shows that the Aramaeans were still considered a separate ethno-linguistic group by some Babylonians; 45 the reference in the late Seleucid list from Uruk of kings and scholars to Esarhaddon\u2019s counsellor Aba-Enlil-dari as the one \u201cwhom the Aramaeans call A\u1e2buqar\u201d shows that the story of A\u1e2biqar was known but seen as part of \u201cpopular\u201d Aramaic culture rather than cuneiform elite culture. 46 The impression gained from cuneiform sources is of Late Babylonia as an imagined community of urban elites who retreated into the imaginary space provided by the temples and the schools, with cuneiform itself being the main distinguishing characteristic of this community. The Babylonian urban elites constructed a cultural identity for themselves, one that became more and more detached from the ethno-linguistic, cultural and political realities of Babylonia in the Hellenistic and Parthian periods. 47 At the same time, evidence from Hellenistic Uruk seems to indicate that they cultivated strong ties with the Greek elite and the Seleucid rulers that ensured their small community thrived. 48 This shows that despite a cultivated identity that seems detached from real life, Babylonian urban elites were also able to relate to changing ethno-linguistic, cultural and political realities and to do so to their own advantage.    [\u261e p7.34] Changed historical circumstances between the late fifth and late fourth centuries and the second century BCE no doubt influenced the possibilities presented to and the choices made by those specialized in astronomy and astrology in the cities of Babylonia, determining also the mobility, accessibility and dissemination of that learned knowledge. For example, recent research on the collection owned by two separate families of ma\u0161ma\u0161\u0161u \u2019s in Uruk in the late fifth and late fourth centuries BCE suggests a tight social network of scholarly families. 49 The colophons suggest that this scholarly network operated on a limited geographical scale: scholars, students and their writings seem to have rarely travelled beyond Uruk or across professional divides. 50 If we consider these two families from the perspective of Social Network Analysis theory, such a limited network that consists of strong ties\u2014kinship ties being the clearest example of strong ties\u2014seems less conducive to bridge social boundaries and cross network distance between different ethno-linguistic groups. 51    [\u261e p7.35] From a diachronic perspective, there is also evidence for non-familial apprenticeship in second-century BCE Seleucid Uruk. Although the social network there was tight, as over six generations just four scholarly families collaborated in the training of their sons, patterns of non-familial apprenticeship can be identified. 52 A limited network that consisted of strong ties (kinship) was thus able to bridge social boundaries and transmit learning to non-family. It is, however, not readily apparent whether these non-familial apprentices may be indicative as well for the crossing of ethno-linguistic and cultural boundaries, and if so, which ones exactly. Perhaps individual members from social networks such as these and others were able to cross much greater network distances: Uruk may have been one of the sources from which Babylonian astronomy made its way to the Greek world. 53 One can think of a scenario in which individual scholars from Uruk moved away from the city, taking their scientific knowledge with them. Historical and modern analogies suggest that this would have been mostly young men. 54 Perhaps such a move in the second century BCE, if it occurred at all, was due to economic reasons: private income generated by astronomical and astrological knowledge 55 may not have been sufficient, and in response some scribes took their chances and left.    [\u261e p7.36] In terms of ethno-linguistic and cultural boundaries the Neo- and Late-Babylonian evidence demonstrates complex and multi-layered contexts. On the one hand, ethno-linguistic distinctions were made and cuneiform culture was upheld to emphasize Babylonian identity. On the other hand, various sources show a multi-ethnic picture that seems to call into doubt the dominance of cuneiform culture in Late Babylonia. This picture highlights the difficulty of distinguishing neatly between what is Babylonian and what is non-Babylonian. 56    [\u261e p7.37] These two different aspects have direct bearing on the contexts of transmission of astronomical learning, and their complexity is well illustrated by the issue of Aramaic as a medium for the transmission of Babylonian astronomical and astrological learning.    3.2 Aramaic as a Medium for Transmission of Astronomical Learning    [\u261e p7.38] There is no evidence for the translation of complex astronomical cuneiform texts into Aramaic. 57 Aramaic Astronomical Enoch from Qumran does not even come remotely near to the advanced forms of cuneiform astronomy and it hardly can stand exemplary for a body of Babylonian Aramaic scholarship in the first millennium BCE    [\u261e p7.39] Apparently, the Babylonian urban elites kept to traditional cuneiform learning as the sole official culture of Babylonia. At the same time, Aramaic became the dominant vernacular. Should we then assume that there must have been a Babylonian literature and science written in Aramaic, now lost because it was written on perishable material? Or should we assume that Aramaic did not become the dominant language to express Babylonian high culture but remained mostly a language of communication and administration, and, moreover, that it is questionable whether any significant corpus of cuneiform was ever translated into Aramaic? 58    [\u261e p7.40] The Neo- and Late-Babylonian evidence presents us with different scenarios from the Neo-Assyrian evidence. We do not have a significant body of sources in Aramaic from first-millennium Babylonia or a clear and significant body of references from first-millennium Babylonia to the use of Aramaic and to the involvement of non-Babylonians in Babylonian science, as we do have regarding the last aspect for Assyria in the Neo-Assyrian period. Were ethno-linguistic and cultural boundaries in Babylonia more strictly maintained with regard to scholarly learning and did this inhibit the accessibility and dissemination of Babylonian science, or is it just a matter of evidence gone missing?    [\u261e p7.41] In addition to the Babylonian priests and scholars\u2014the old urban notability\u2014there was another group of scribes, the sep\u012bru scribes. These did not belong to the old Babylonian nobility but were recognized as important persons who were well integrated in the temple organization. 59 They appear to have been Aramaic speakers who had become assimilated into Babylonian culture. 60 Although there is thus far no evidence that these scribes worked on literary or scholarly texts, 61 the question is how strictly boundaries were maintained. The sep\u012bru scribes seem to have been well integrated into the temple organization, and the temple was the place of learning in Babylonia. The exact relations, however, between the Babylonian scholarly elite and Aramaic sep\u012bru scribes merit further investigation. It might be that in the future evidence will turn up that sep\u012bru scribes had access to cuneiform sources or that astronomical principles were divulged to them. 62    [\u261e p7.42] We might also entertain the possibility that individual Jews, being part of a general Aramaic milieu, were among such Aramaic sep\u012bru scribes\u2014perhaps having taken up Babylonian names even, making it more difficult for us to identify them as Jewish and thus also calling into question the aptness of such neat taxonomic distinctions. Be that as it may, no concrete evidence has as of yet turned up for Jews being Aramaic sep\u012bru scribes. In the wake of the Babylonian conquest of Judah and Jerusalem in 586 BCE a Jewish Diaspora formed in Babylonia. Jews were fully integrated in economic everyday life there, as \u201cis evidenced by their participation in very ordinary economic transactions in which they are recorded as the creditors and debtors in a variety of loan documents and receipts.\u201d 63 There is also enough evidence for Babylonian Jewish villagers or merchants in Neo- and Late-Babylonian documents, but there is no evidence for Jews accessing scholarly tablet collections directly. 64    [\u261e p7.43] It is important to consider the role of the Aramaic language as a medium for the transmission of Babylonian astronomical and astrological material to the Jewish world. The westward transmission of this body of learned knowledge originating in cuneiform culture may have occurred through Aramaic sources, which is how Jewish scholars, being part of a general Aramaic milieu, may have encountered it. 65 The astronomical Enoch manuscripts from Qumran, for example, may be evidence for this role of Aramaic. However, whether it was through direct access to cuneiform texts, direct contact with Babylonian scholars in Mesopotamia or elsewhere, or indirectly via access to a\u2014more vague\u2014continuous tradition is another matter.    [\u261e p7.44] In order to better understand the possible role of Aramaic as a medium for the transmission of Babylonian astronomical material and also how some of this material made its way to Aramaic texts such as the astronomical Enoch manuscripts from Qumran, it is instructive to briefly consider evidence from Late Antiquity. In Late Antiquity, Aramaic was no longer only the vernacular of Babylonian culture but had also become the literary language of Mesopotamian Christianity, Babylonian Judaism and Mandaean Gnosticism. 66    [\u261e p7.45] Considering the elements of Babylonian learning in Late Antique sources one may observe that these differ from what one finds in earlier cuneiform learning: Late Antique scholarship is different in character from the advanced mathematical astronomical texts from the latter part of the first millennium BCE, being less technical and more divinatory. 67 The textual similarities are of a more structural than of a specific nature (see section 4 below). What is important for our discussion is that these Late Antique traditions do not presuppose direct contact with cuneiform culture. The Late Antique texts do not derive from the \u201chigh culture\u201d of cuneiform written tradition, but instead probably represent the transmission of elements of popular Babylonian traditions, although elite and popular culture should not be seen as two completely separate strands of tradition. 68    [\u261e p7.46] There is, of course, some evidence for literary Aramaic texts from the first millennium BCE, and the Aramaic manuscripts from Qumran add significantly to this, 69 but this concerns literature (A\u1e2biqar) 70 or liturgy, 71 rather than Babylonian astronomy and astrology in its advanced forms. In our analysis of cultural encounters we need to distinguish between different kinds of texts and traditions and differentiate between various channels and agents of transmission. 72 What applies to one need not explain the other. For example, knowledge of the Gilgamesh epic concerns certain motifs that need not presuppose acquaintance with the Standard Version (not even consciously being related anymore to the epic as such), 73 but may have been part of popular oral traditions. Those who composed the Prayer of Nabonidus (4Q242) or Daniel 4 may have gotten their knowledge about the Babylonian king Nabonidus through a chain of transmission that originated in the public reading of Nabonidus\u2019 inscription. 74 In both cases, there is no need to suppose direct access to Babylonian centres of higher learning.    [\u261e p7.47] Another kind of tradition is that of law and legal formulas in documentary texts, the origins of which have been traced back to Babylonia, such as in the Wadi Daliyeh papyri from fourth-century BCE Samaria and also in second-century CE legal texts from Murabba\u02bfat and Na\u1e25al \u1e24ever. 75 The presence of empires as a political factor may account for the spread of legal traditions and formulary, and in this case the Aramaic sep\u012bru scribes, taking care of all sorts of legal, administrative writings, may too have been agents conducive for the transmission of Babylonian legal formulas.    [\u261e p7.48] A differentiated perspective on the use of Aramaic in the ancient Near East points to different means of transmission, via different channels and agents, for different kinds of traditions and texts. What may apply to the transmission of elements from narratives, may not apply likewise to scholarly literature. That some astronomical elements in the Astronomical Book have Babylonian origins is evident, as do other elements in 1 Enoch. 76 This is not disputed. The issue is how these astronomical elements reached Jewish scholars and materialized in the extant manuscripts from Qumran. The suggestion put forward here is that in this respect these texts are analogous to Late Antique traditions in which Babylonian elements, and Greek ones, appear. For early Jewish astronomical and astrological traditions there is no reason to suppose direct contact with Babylonian scholars or direct access to cuneiform texts, as we must assume for the Greek evidence.    3.3 The Transmission of Babylonian Astronomical Material to the Greek World    [\u261e p7.49] The exact routes by which Babylonian astronomical learning was transmitted to the Greek world are not known, but different suggestions have been put forward. We probably have to reckon with different channels of transmission that were in operation, sometimes perhaps simultaneously and sometimes not. What seems certain is that it must have involved, at one time at least, direct personal contact between individual Babylonian and Greek scholars, because of the technical and mathematical astronomical requirements, and even because of the visual aspects of the manuscripts such as their layout and structure. This may have happened when Greek astronomers visited Babylonia or when Babylonian scholars travelled to the Greek world. But we do not know exactly when, where and how this happened. 77 Furthermore, once this contact was established, a continuous tradition ensured its transmission until the days of Ptolemy and later. 78 Let us briefly consider these three channels of transmission: direct contact in Babylonia, direct contact elsewhere and a continuous tradition.    [\u261e p7.50] The first two proposed channels of transmission operate on the basis of the conclusion that direct access to cuneiform sources through contact between Greek and Babylonian astronomers must have occurred. For example, if, as has been suggested, the Greek astronomer Hipparchus in the second century BCE was the main channel through which important aspects of Babylonian astronomical science were transmitted to the Greeks, he must have had personal contact with one or more Babylonian experts. Hipparchus\u2019 extensive knowledge of both the observational and theoretical parts of Babylonian astronomy, it appears, cannot be explained without him having had direct access to Babylonian sources, most notably the observational Diaries. 79 If indeed Hipparchus personally accessed astronomical cuneiform sources with the help of one or more Babylonian scholars, we do not know whether he met them in Babylonia or elsewhere.    [\u261e p7.51] Although we do not know exactly the numbers journeying, and wherefrom and whereto they did so, Babylonian scholars certainly did travel and took up residence elsewhere in the Greek world, transmitting knowledge about Babylonian astronomy and astrology along the way. Scribes who were on the move and took their professional and scientific knowledge elsewhere would have been a potent link in the diffusion of knowledge. 80 For the Hellenistic period, the status that Babylonian astronomy and astrology enjoyed in the Greek world may have facilitated the reception of travelling scribes from Babylonia by local communities: knowledge of Babylonian astronomy crossed network distance and its effect on small-world networks was ensured by the status it already had. There is some intriguing documentary evidence for the diffusion of astronomical learning from Babylonia to the Greek world. An honorary inscription from second-century BCE Larissa in Thessaly refers to a certain Antipater from Hierapolis in Seleukia as a Chaldean astronomer who had lived for a long time in Larissa and had practised his mathematical profession there. 81 We do not know what kind of astronomy or astrology this Antipater pursued, but the inscription presents concrete evidence for a \u201cChaldean\u201d astronomer/astrologer who had travelled from his native city in the Near East to a Greek city sometime in the second century BCE 82 If so, Antipater\u2019s \u201cbiography\u201d illustrates that he crossed a large network distance and established himself successfully within his new social network, as testified by the honorary inscription. How exactly he crossed this distance, through what channels and through what connecting localities, we do not know. 83 There is in any case no reason to assume that this Antipater from Hierapolis was the only astronomer to have moved away from his original social network. There were, no doubt, others like him who travelled to the Greek world (for the suggestion that astronomers from Uruk were among them, see section 3.1 above). 84    [\u261e p7.52] In addition to these two channels of transmission of Babylonian astronomy to the Greek world via direct contact, a third one presupposes a continuous tradition once Babylonian science had been taken elsewhere. The use of Babylonian predictive schemes in the time of Ptolemy (second century CE) cannot be explained by direct contact with Babylonian scholars or direct access to cuneiform sources (Ptolemy received this information via Hipparchus). 85 A second-century CE fragmentary papyrus from Oxyrhynchus (P. Oxy 4139) has a reference to a lunar period scheme according to the Babylonian System A lunar theory and seems to refer to the Orchenoi (\u201cpeople of Uruk\u201d; line 8), indicating the diffusion of this Babylonian tradition. 86    Considering the moment of \u201cfirst contact,\u201d elements of Babylonian mathematical astronomy will have been transmitted to the Greek world directly from cuneiform into Greek, via personal contact with Babylonian astronomers, either in Babylonia or elsewhere. The Jewish world, on the other hand, as argued above, encountered some elements of Babylonian non-mathematical astronomy indirectly via the medium of the Aramaic language. We thus need to differentiate between channels for the westward transmission of Babylonian astronomy and astrology in their varied forms: directly from cuneiform into Greek and indirectly via Aramaic.    4. The Transmission of Babylonian Astronomical and Astrological Learning to the Jewish World    [\u261e p7.53] In order to explain the Babylonian origins of some astronomical and astrological elements in early Jewish texts, we need not envisage direct access to cuneiform sources in Babylonian centres of learning. The Jewish evidence differs markedly from the Greek evidence, where such direct contact must be presumed. In addition to the different levels of learning displayed by the Babylonian, Greek and Jewish evidence, we should again consider the textual similarities between Jewish and Babylonian texts.    [\u261e p7.54] The Hebrew Qumran calendar texts (4Q320\u2013321a) describe a consistent pattern of days between two phenomena from which it is clear that these phenomena are connected with the lunar cycle. This pattern has been explained by taking recourse to the Lunar Three scheme from Late Babylonian non-mathematical astronomical texts (see section 2.1 above), but this interpretation is not without difficulties. 87 Even if it would be certain that some elements of the Late Babylonian Lunar Three scheme were behind the Qumran calendar texts, these have been reworked in such a manner that there is no direct connection with actual Lunar Three texts.    [\u261e p7.55] Likewise, we need not suppose that the Aramaic Astronomical Book is a direct translation or rendering of cuneiform sources. 88 First, the texts do not look the same: En\u016bma Anu Enlil is shorter and more formulaic. 89 Second, similarities between the texts are of a structural rather than a specific nature. 90 As soon as a few astronomical and arithmetic principles from En\u016bma Anu Enlil Tablet 14 were understood it would not have been difficult to transmit that knowledge further. One need not assume further direct access to the text of En\u016bma Anu Enlil itself. This also applies to the linear zigzag function that is rooted in the type of astronomy of En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin. The occurrence of such principles alone in texts from other periods and from other cultural realms need not assume direct access to the cuneiform sources in Babylonia. Once such learning was carried elsewhere by scribes trained in it, those principles may have become part of a continuous tradition through which other individuals gained access to it, either through contact with travelling scribes or further down the chain of transmission via other individuals who equally no longer had access to the cuneiform texts.    [\u261e p7.56] The astrological texts from Qumran (4Q186 and 4Q318) also do not presuppose direct access to cuneiform sources or direct contact with Babylonian scholars. Moreover, the zodiac names in 4Q318 and the reference to the horoscope in 4Q186 point to Hellenistic traditions (see section 2.1 above). In this respect, these texts are analogous to Late Antique traditions in which Babylonian and Greek elements appear (see section 3.2 above). Knowledge of the zodiac did not therefore reach Jewish Palestine directly via access to cuneiform sources. If we take the evidence for the Hellenistic origin of the zodiac names in 4Q318 into account, perhaps the chain of transmission went via Aramaic to Greek and back again, or, after the zodiac was already appropriated by the Greeks, via Greek to Aramaic, through which Jews in Palestine may have encountered it in the second or first century BCE and also translated it into Hebrew. 91    [\u261e p7.57] The textual similarities between Jewish astronomical and astrological texts of the Hellenistic and early Roman periods and first millennium cuneiform sources from Babylonia are not of such a nature to suppose that the former are a direct translation or rendering of the latter. The similarities are \u2018structural\u2019 rather than specific. They concern general notions or motifs, rather than technical or specific data or visual layout and structure, as with evidence from the Greek world. 92    [\u261e p7.58] Whether we should see this Jewish tradition as popular or elite depends on the perspective taken. In their own society these Jewish scholars may have been part of the elite, but given the enormous difference between this learning and the advanced mathematical astronomy that was exchanged between Babylonian and Greek scholars at that time, the Jewish scholars probably were not part of that same scholarly network.    [\u261e p7.59] Regarding the assumption that Jewish scholars had direct access to Babylonian learning, we cannot simply invoke the Babylonian \u201cstream of tradition\u201d as a fixed and stable entity available everywhere, 93 into which Jewish individuals could simply have tapped, almost at will, at certain moments in history, such as during the Babylonian exile or thereafter. Recent research on a number of cuneiform scholarly collections indicate that the \u201cstream of tradition\u201d was not simply present everywhere and available to everyone. The production, transmission and dissemination of scholarly knowledge and texts was conditioned by specific circumstances, thus affecting the concrete manifestations of the Babylonian \u201cstream of tradition\u201d at certain places and times. 94 In addition, prohibitions on tablet movement expressed through secrecy formulae, which appear as important topoi in the colophons of scholarly texts, may not have been absolute, 95 but some form of boundary maintenance with regard to literary and scholarly texts did seem to have been in effect in Babylonia, limiting the accessibility and mobility of scientific knowledge.    [\u261e p7.60] Furthermore, the impression gained from cuneiform texts from the second half of the first millennium BCE in Babylonia is one of Babylonian urban elites who seemed reluctant to acknowledge the role of Aramaic and instead kept to traditional cuneiform as the sole official culture of Babylonia. The evidence is skewed because the cuneiform texts serve the self-interests of the Babylonian elite, conjuring up a view of Babylonia as an entirely cuneiform culture (see sections 3.1 and 3.2 above). However, from such an assessment we cannot infer that despite the Babylonian elite\u2019s self-interest and their preoccupation with their self-understanding amid a changing world there must have been a considerable body of Babylonian Aramaic literature and scholarship, all evidence of which subsequently was suppressed or must have vanished.    [\u261e p7.61] While the prestige of Babylonian astronomy facilitated the reception of Babylonian astronomers in the Greek world (see section 3.3 above), there may perhaps have been a similar effect in some cases with regard to Greek culture in the Babylonian world. 96 The Babylonian urban elite, with its thoroughly cuneiform culture and identity, seems to have positioned itself differently with regard to Greek culture and language than it did with regard to Aramaic culture and language. Some Babylonians learned Greek and participated in Greek scholarly networks. 97 This is not only illustrated by evidence for the direct transmission of advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy to the Greek world, but also by Berossus and the so-called Graeco-Babyloniaca. The Graeco-Babyloniaca tablets (Akkadian written in Greek characters) from around the turn of the Common Era demonstrate that native Babylonians, students in this case, knew Greek. 98 Berossus represents a fascinating example of a native Babylonian who aimed to present his culture to the wider Hellenistic world beyond the community of traditional Babylonian learning and therefore wrote in Greek. 99 That he wrote in Greek and not in Aramaic seems significant. Of course, this was motivated by his wish to address a Greek-speaking audience, but this is precisely why it seems significant that he wrote in Greek. When some members of the Babylonian urban elite opened up, so to say, it was to Greek culture and language, something they had apparently not done in a similar manner earlier in the context of the Persian Empire with regard to the Aramaic language in relation to astronomy and astrology, Aramaic being only the vernacular. 100 Greek culture and language may have enhanced the self-esteem and identity of Babylonian elites, which Aramaic presumably did not in first-millennium BCE Babylonia. 101 In the Hellenistic period, therefore, the available sources seem to indicate that some of the Babylonian elite had an active interest in disseminating elements of their culture to non-Babylonians\u2014but not just to any non-Babylonians.    [\u261e p7.62] While the evidence for the involvement of non-Babylonians in Babylonian science is meagre at best, the transmission of Babylonian astronomy to the Greek world and the cases of Berossus and the Graeco-Babyloniaca seem to suggest a different attitude among members of the Babylonian elite toward the Greeks. These considerations argue against the assumption that Babylonian elites would have been actively involved in transmitting some of their astronomical knowledge to Jews who were, relatively, only quite recently in their midst, 102 as opposed to the Aramaeans who settled there earlier but against whom, it appears, it was possible to maintain a persistent sense of difference up until the Hellenistic period (even if we assume Jews to have been part of a general Aramaic milieu). 103 It seems unlikely that in Babylonia, where impressive developments took place in mathematical astronomy from the mid-first-millennium BCE onward, Babylonian scholars would have engaged in the transmission of older forms of their astronomy to local Jews or more recent insights if the Lunar Three scheme should indeed be seen as having influenced Qumran calendar texts.    [\u261e p7.63] Of course, we may posit all sorts of suppositions: that there must already have been a whole body of Babylonian literature and scholarship in Aramaic in the first millennium BCE; that Jews must have been active in administrative functions; that they knew cuneiform; and that they had access to Babylonian cuneiform literature and scholarship. But there is no evidence for this and also no reason to assume such conditions in order to explain the Jewish evidence for scholarly traditions. If we take the actual Babylonian elements into account, these amount to features that do not presuppose direct access to cuneiform sources. The connecting chains of early Jewish astronomical and astrological traditions were probably much more remote from the centres of Babylonian science than previously assumed. All this does not deny the Babylonian origins of elements in early Jewish astronomical and astrological traditions, but it does highlight that these were encountered via different channels and agents than the transmission of Babylonian astronomical science to the Greek world. The transmission of cuneiform culture in Aramaic in Late Antiquity may suggest one such different trajectory.    [\u261e p7.64] So how did Jewish scholars become acquainted with some of the learning originating with Babylonian scholars? What network connections and channels of transmission can we suggest for Jewish scholars to have gained access to certain elements of Babylonian learning? Bearing in mind the three possible channels of transmission to the Greek world (see section 3.3 above), the one channel of transmission ruled out on the basis of the evidence available is that of direct contact in Babylonia between Jewish and Babylonian scholars. This leaves us with two possibilities, namely directly via contact with travelling scribes outside Babylonia or indirectly via a continuous tradition that had been transmitted to various localities through such travelling scholars. It is impossible to be specific as to the exact channels, localities and agents of transmission, as concrete evidence is lacking, but we might venture a hypothesis.    [\u261e p7.65] Two possible historical contexts seem to present themselves for obvious\u2014but different\u2014reasons: the Neo-Assyrian period and the Neo- and Late-Babylonian periods. Once we realize that for the \u201chow\u201d we need not assume direct contact, it is unnecessary to limit the cultural transfer of Mul.Apin and En\u016bma Anu Enlil type of astronomy to the Neo-Babylonian period or later. 104 Moreover, elements of Babylonian as well as Greek astronomical and astrological learning will have been transmitted at different moments in history, but there is no reason to think of these as clearly separate waves. 105 Logical necessity and historical sequence are not always identical in the history of science. 106 Thus, the older type of Enochic astronomy was used and slightly updated in Hebrew texts (4Q317, 4Q503 and possibly 4Q334) at a time when presumably other lunar schemes were also appropriated in the second century BCE (see section 2.1 above).    [\u261e p7.66] Only in the Neo-Assyrian period do we find evidence, at least in correspondence between scholars and the king, for the use of Aramaic in scholarly settings. The Neo-Assyrian period may thus have been conducive for the transmission of elements of cuneiform astronomical learning into Aramaic, from whence Aramaic became the medium for further diffusion of this material. This may have happened at the centres of learning, or perhaps at more provincial or peripheral localities. In addition, international scholars at the Neo-Assyrian court may have taken such traditions with them on their travels and transmitted elements of them into Aramaic along the way. Via such an indirect trajectory and through various points in between it may have reached Jews in Palestine sometime in the Hellenistic period, or perhaps already in the Persian period. As with the Late Antique evidence, we need not assume direct contact to explain the early Jewish evidence and can thus allow for a certain amount of time for such a hypothesized continuous tradition and for some of its elements to have materialized in the Aramaic Astronomical Book and Enochic astronomy.    [\u261e p7.67] If we posit the Neo- or Late-Babylonian periods as the historical context for this diffusion, the Aramaic Astronomical Book from Qumran is evidence for the transmission of Babylonian learning via the medium of Aramaic in first-millennium BCE Babylonia. This transmission probably did not happen in a direct manner such that Jews learned this type of astronomy through personal interaction with Babylonian or Assyrian scholars in their centres of learning. There being no reason to see the origin of the Aramaic Astronomical Book in the eastern Diaspora, it should be considered a Jewish Palestinian text. It is, therefore, not necessary to posit Babylonia as the place where the actual transmission to Jewish individuals must have occurred. 107    [\u261e p7.68] The astrological texts from Qumran seem to point to a different channel of transmission because of the Hellenistic astrological elements alongside a Babylonian one in the case of 4Q318 and probably 4Q186. These texts do not presuppose direct contact with cuneiform sources or Babylonian scholars, but may point to a more vague, continuous tradition of astronomical and astrological lore, analogous to Late Antique traditions (see above in this section). As for the Qumran calendar texts, if indeed these did have elements of the Late-Babylonian Lunar Three scheme as their model of inspiration, it seems significant that we find them rendered directly in Hebrew rather than Aramaic. 108 This argues against direct access to cuneiform sources and contact with Babylonian scholars.     5. Conclusion    [\u261e p7.69] Contrary to what is often assumed, 109 there is no evidence to suggest that during the first millennium BCE Jewish scholars had direct access to Babylonian centres of higher learning, such as the temples in Neo- and Late-Babylonian times, where they interacted with Babylonian astronomers and were able to read with their help cuneiform astronomical texts and appropriate such learning.    [\u261e p7.70] We should no longer think of a disembodied Babylonian \u201cstream of tradition\u201d that was simply out there and available and which individual representatives of Jewish tradition could have accessed effortlessly. Considering cultural encounters between Jews and Babylonians, there would have been different aspects involved and different levels of interaction to reckon with. Explanations for the appropriation of motifs from Gilgamesh, for acquaintance with Nabonidus traditions, for the reception of legal formulas or for the transmission of astronomical and astrological traditions should not be lumped together indiscriminately as being the result of direct access to elite Babylonian learning. In our approach we need to distinguish between different kinds of texts and traditions and differentiate between various channels and agents of transmission.    [\u261e p7.71] Regarding the transmission of Babylonian astronomical and astrological material to the Jewish world, we have considered the transmission of advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy into Greek sources, which suggests high-level contact between Greek and Babylonian scholars, either in Babylonia or elsewhere, or, at a later date when direct contact would not have been possible anymore, through a continuous tradition. Jewish scholars, at least as far as our sources are concerned (setting aside indirect testimonies, such as Abraham being an astronomical teacher, or the Daniel narratives presenting a Jewish sage at the Babylonian court), were not part of that same high-level network: the Jewish sources testify to a different level of scholarship. Future research should therefore look for network connections at other places than the centres of Babylonian learning, as has often been the case. Nor should we perceive of the transmission of Babylonian astronomical and astrological material to Second Temple period Palestine as having taken place in a direct manner but rather through various intermediaries, Aramaic and other channels, as well as via a\u2014more vague\u2014continuous tradition.    [\u261e p7.72] Via such indirect channels, elements of Babylonian and Greek astronomical and astrological learning reached certain people and certain places in Jewish Palestine, at least those at Qumran and the movement behind the Dead Sea Scrolls. Regarding these people, one might suggest that they formed a rather closed network, which was not particularly interested in current developments in the outside world. However, the scientific material shows otherwise, indicating a degree of openness to scholarly learning from other traditions. The different level of learning in comparison with contemporary Babylonian and Hellenistic astronomy suggests that although \u201cQumran\u201d was connected, it was not as well connected to those scholarly networks that participated in the transmission of knowledge between Babylonia and Greek culture in Greece, Egypt and elsewhere in the Hellenistic world.    [\u261e p7.73] In the centuries after the turn of the era things may have been different in terms of \u201chigh-level\u201d contact between Jewish and Babylonian elites, 110 but these data cannot be anachronistically projected backward into the first millennium BCE Jewish participation in society may simply have been different in those changed historical contexts. 111 The times of Medieval and especially early Modern Europe were still far away. 112      [\u261e endnote-chapter7-1] 1 In this article I develop further some of the arguments in my \u201cThe Emergence of Aramaic and Hebrew Scholarly Texts: Transmission and Translation of Alien Wisdom,\u201d in The Dead Sea Scrolls: Transmission of Traditions and Production of Texts (ed. S. Metso, H. Najman, and E. Schuller; Leiden: Brill, 2010), 81\u2013114.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-2] 2 This relates to primarily indirect evidence in ancient sources that has been adduced to support such inferences; one can think of the portrayal of Daniel\u2019s position at the Neo-Babylonian court. See, for example, the discussion and references in Jonathan Ben-Dov, Head of All Years: Astronomy and Calendars at Qumran in their Ancient Context (Leiden: Brill, 2008), 266, 270-275. See also Henryk Drawnel, The Aramaic Astronomical Book (4Q208-4Q211) from Qumran: Text, Commentary, and Translation (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 51, 53, 70, 301, 304, and the contribution by James VanderKam in this volume.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-3] 3 Regarding the concept of science in Antiquity, I am not interested in any normative evaluations about whether the ancient learning we encounter in these texts should properly be called \u201cscience.\u201d Science is not detached from social reality. It is to a degree a historically defined activity conducted by people in different contexts. What counts as scientific knowledge may differ over time and place depending on context; see, e.g., David N. Livingstone, Putting Science in Its Place: Geographies of Scientific Knowledge (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2003); Mladen Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body: Physiognomics and Astrology in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Hellenistic-Early Roman Period Judaism (Leiden: Brill, 2007), 211-213; Eleanor Robson, \u201cEmpirical Scholarship in the Neo-Assyrian Court,\u201d in The Empirical Dimension of Ancient Near Eastern Studies / Die empirische Dimension altorientalischer Forschungen (ed. G.J. Selz and K. Wagensonner; Vienna: Lit, 2011), 603-629. If need be, working definitions for ancient science can be given; see, e.g., Philip S. Alexander, \u201cEnoch and the Beginnings of Jewish Interest in Natural Science,\u201d in this volume; Francesca Rochberg, The Heavenly Writing: Divination, Horoscopy, and Astronomy in Mesopotamian Culture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004); Ben-Dov, Head of All Years ; Rita Watson and Wayne Horowitz, Writing Science before the Greeks: A Naturalistic Analysis of the Babylonian Astronomical Treatise Mul.Apin (Leiden: Brill, 2011). The choice of what count as scientific texts here has been made pragmatically and is determined by specific Jewish texts and their Babylonian \u201ccounterparts.\u201d To a certain extent, the demarcation between various kinds of texts is, of course, arbitrary. In this article I do not include, for example, magical texts, although elements that we might denote as magical also play a role in some of the texts under consideration here; see Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 51\u201354, 234-237; idem, \u201cAstrologische und magische Traditionen im antiken Judentum und die Texte vom Toten Meer,\u201d in Qumran aktuell: Texte und Themen der Schriften vom Toten Meer (ed. S. Beyerle and J. Frey; Biblisch-Theologische Studien 120; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 2011), 111-136 (112-113, 127-131). Furthermore, if we take into account the people that worked with these texts, demarcations are also to a certain extent arbitrary: there is evidence that different specialists in Mesopotamia worked on diverse and distinct disciplines, but there is also evidence that learned disciplines were not always nicely divided between different types of specialists. We need to look at specific historical contexts to determine whether demarcations were upheld and to what extent, and ask what this means for the dissemination and transmission of learned knowledge in that particular context. With regard to Jewish scholars or scientists in Hellenistic and early Roman Palestine, we have no comparative evidence about different kinds of scholars being responsible for different types of learning, although some such distinctions may be hypothesized; see the discussion and references in Popovi\u0107, \u201cThe Emergence of Aramaic and Hebrew Scholarly Texts,\u201d 106\u20138.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-4] 4 For the possibility that the numbers and fractions used in the Aramaic Levi Document reflect a Babylonian-type sexagesimal numeral system, see Henryk Drawnel, An Aramaic Wisdom Text from Qumran: A New Interpretation of the Levi Document (Leiden: Brill, 2004), 280-293. See also Ben-Dov, Head of All Years , 254; Popovi\u0107, \u201cThe Emergence of Aramaic and Hebrew Scholarly Texts,\u201d 106\u20137.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-5] 5 It is a moot point whether the scientific manuscripts from Qumran are representative for Jewish scholarship in general at the time or more typical for the movement behind the Dead Sea Scrolls. We know all ancient Jewish scientific literature, except the Enochic, only via the Qumran corpus. I assume that Jews outside this specific movement were also acquainted with this type of knowledge. The dates for some of the Aramaic Astronomical Enoch manuscripts predate the settlement at Qumran and indicate scholarly activity elsewhere and outside of that specific movement. Some of the other scholarly texts may likewise have circulated also outside of that movement; see Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 8-11.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-6] 6 See Popovi\u0107, \u201cThe Emergence of Aramaic and Hebrew Scholarly Texts,\u201d 87\u201393, 97, 99, 110 n. 72.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-7] 7 The temporal horizon of the Jewish texts is determined by the dates of the manuscripts from Qumran; these range broadly from the third century BCE to the first century CE.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-10] 10 Ben-Dov, Head of All Years , 161-167, 182-183, 245-246 suggests that the Jewish 364-day year tradition actually goes back to an intercalation passage in Mul.Apin that implies the same number, but was never implemented in the actual astronomical models and soon after the seventh century BCE yielded to more accurate numbers. In Jewish astral science as we find it in the Qumran texts, however, the 364-day year model became the cornerstone of Enochic cosmological learning.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-17] 17 There is no evidence for astrology in the Aramaic text 4Q561; see Popovi\u0107, \u201cThe Emergence of Aramaic and Hebrew Scholarly Texts,\u201d 102. 4Q561 (copied in either the first or the second half of the first century BCE) is a physiognomic catalogue that listed the physical descriptions of different types of people. There is some evidence that the text originally listed prognostics for each physiognomic type. Generally speaking, the physiognomic traditions of Babylonia and Greece are different. Babylonian physiognomics was principally a divinatory art that predicted people\u2019s future on the basis of their physical characteristics. Graeco-Roman physiognomics was by and large concerned with the discernment of people\u2019s characters, whereas the predictive function was minimal. The evidence for predictions in 4Q561 seems, therefore, to suggest Babylonian influence. But matters are not as clear-cut, because Babylonian physiognomics also seems to have been partially concerned with the discernment of character, and the case of Polemo of Laodicea (second century CE) demonstrates that Graeco-Roman traditions were also familiar with the predictive possibilities of physiognomics. See Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 69\u201371, 111-112; Simon Swain (ed.), Seeing the Face, Seeing the Soul: Polemon\u2019s Physiognomy from Classical Antiquity to Medieval Islam (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007).

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-20] 20 Maybe the composition should be dated to the fourth century already, although I see insufficient reason to assume a date for the Astronomical Book that much earlier than the manuscript evidence of 4Q208, especially since it is debatable whether the Aramaic Enoch manuscripts from Qumran should be equated with the Astronomical Book from Ethiopic Enoch; see the references in n. 12 above for a discussion of these issues.

Previously I assumed that this absence of evidence does not imply evidence for the lack of ephemerides and almanacs, but I also emphasized that complex mathematical-astronomical knowledge was not a prerequisite for practising astrology. Now I also tend to emphasize that the absence of evidence should caution us not to tacitly assume that Jewish scholars would have had access to resources such as ephemerides and almanacs.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-27] 27 The astrological texts from Qumran represent learning that is different with regard to the heptadic-based model from Enochic astronomy and its offshoots and the calendric texts from Qumran. The notion of the zodiac is another crucial difference. The zodiac is absent in early Enochic astronomy.

There is no reason to think that Aristotle made any such request to Callisthenes. More likely, Aristotle\u2019s reference in De caelo to observational data from the Babylonians set commentators thinking how the information could have been obtained, and one obvious hypothesis, it seems, was that Callisthenes supplied it, although this ignores the reference to the Egyptians.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-32] 32 Strabo, Geogr. 16.1.6, refers to the Orchenoi and the Borsippenoi as classes of Chaldean astronomers. In the same passage, Strabo also refers to individual Chaldean astronomers: Kidenas, Naburianus, Sudines and Seleucus of Seleuceia. For a brief discussion of individual astronomers known by name to Graeco-Roman authors as Chaldean astronomers, see Jones, \u201cEvidence for Babylonian Arithmetical Schemes,\u201d 88\u201389; Geller, \u201cThe Last Wedge,\u201d 49; Tom Boiy, Late Achaemenid and Hellenistic Babylon (Leuven: Peeters, 2004), 297 n. 24. See also below in section 3.3 for an inscription from Larissa in Thessaly that refers to a certain Antipater from Hierapolis as a Chaldean astronomer. Of course, there are numerous references to the \u201cChaldeans\u201d and their skills in Greek and Latin sources, but they function more often than not as stock characters for authors to talk about astrologers or their skills. Not much specific information as to the transmission of their learning or in what respect it was of Babylonian origin can be gleaned from these sources. The references to the expulsion of \u201cChaldeans\u201d from Rome indicate that they were regarded as undesirable for various reasons at various times, but these references hardly give us specific data as to the concrete people and circumstances involved.

Steele, \u201cVisual Aspects of the Transmission of Babylonian Astronomy and its Reception into Greek Astronomy,\u201d Annals of Science 68 (2011): 453-465.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-34] 34 For example, Ptolemy of Alexandria, Almagest 3.7, refers to records of ancient observations from the beginning of the reign of the Babylonian king Nabonassar (747\u2013734 BCE) that had been preserved down to his own time, and to which Ptolemy claimed to have had access, although no further information about them is provided, nor how Ptolemy accessed them and in what language.

Steele, \u201cApplied Historical Astronomy: An Historical Perspective,\u201d Journal for the History of Astronomy 35 (2004): 337-355 (338-346). See also Christopher B.F. Walker, \u201cAchaemenid Chronology and the Babylonian Sources,\u201d in Mesopotamia and Iran in the Persian Period: Conquest and Imperialism 539-331 BC (ed. J.

Presenting astral learning also as revealed knowledge (Methuselah learned everything through the angels of God), Pseudo-Eupolemus shares a topos with Babylonian sources. See, e.g., Wilfred G. Lambert, \u201cA Catalogue of Texts and Authors,\u201d JCS 16 (1962): 59\u201377; Beate Pongratz-Leisten, Herrschaftswissen in Mesopotamien: Formen der Kommunikation zwischen Gott und K\u00f6nig im 2. und 1. Jahrtausend v. Chr. (Helsinki: The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 1999), 293-295; Rochberg, Heavenly Writing , 181-185, 215. The Genesis Apocryphon from Qumran Cave 1 also emphasizes Abraham\u2019s wisdom and learning, pointing out that the pharaoh\u2019s officials visited him to seek out his wisdom, as well as his wife. The Genesis Apocryphon possibly also refers more specifically to Abraham\u2019s astronomical wisdom, as he is said to have read to the Egyptian officials from the book of the words of Enoch (1QapGen ar 19:24\u201325). Josephus remarks that astronomical learning derived from the Chaldeans ( Ant. 1.168). Philo admits as much, but explains Abraham\u2019s emigration from Ur allegorically as a rejection of astrology ( Abraham 68\u201384; Migration 176\u2013187; cf. also Heir 96\u201399; Josephus, Ant. 1.155\u2013157). Likewise, Jub 12:16\u201318 has Abraham observing the stars before leaving Ur and his astrological interests behind. Some of these passages reflect an ancient discourse on the origins of astronomy/astrology, putting Abraham, via Enoch, forward as a Jewish culture hero. See brief discussion and references in Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 225-226. The discourse on the origins of astronomy/astrology was in itself part of the wider debate about the priority of cultures and about which culture was dependent on which. See, e.g., Geert De Breucker, \u201cBerossos between Tradition and Innovation,\u201d in The Oxford Handbook of Cuneiform Culture (ed. K. Radner and E. Robson; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 637-657 (650).   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-36] 36 See n. 35 above.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-37] 37 The literature on Social Network Analysis theory is enormous, and it mostly concentrates on the study of the present, using statistical data. However, Social Network Analysis theory has also begun to be used for earlier periods of history. See, e.g., Peter S. Bearman, Relations into Rhetorics: Local Elite Social Structure in Norfolk 1540\u20131640 (Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1993); John F. Padgett and Christopher K.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-67] 67 This assessment may distract rather than explain. It is not meant as a normative observation but rather to indicate that Late Antique Babylonian sources do not transmit advanced mathematical astronomy but instead the divinatory astrological traditions. It is readily admitted that one goes with the other, as it did in first millennium BCE Babylonia and in Hellenistic astronomy and astrology, as in the case of Ptolemy. At the same time, when we find the divinatory side of the coin, we need not always presuppose knowledge of the technical and mathematical astronomical requirements. A telling example from the modern world comes from present-day India, which vividly shows how traditional horoscopy is practiced without mathematical astronomical knowledge; see Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 162-163.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-68] 68 See Westenholz, \u201cThe Graeco-Babyloniaca Once Again,\u201d 308. The situation of Late Antique Babylonian astrological literature is actually somewhat more complex, as some of the sources of these texts are not just Babylonian, but also Greek; see Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 37, 111. Aage Westenholz\u2019s remark is directed at the medical, astrological and magical traditions reflected in the Talmud and the Mandaic texts from Late Antiquity, arguing that these do not derive \u201cdirectly\u201d from scholarly cuneiform tablets. The case with the texts from Qumran is different in that those texts are not examples of \u201cpopular\u201d culture but of a different level of scholarly culture than that of cuneiform culture at the time. The point, however, is the same: neither derives directly from cuneiform sources. For the early Jewish evidence we likewise need to posit indirect channels of diffusion (see below).

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-95] 95 It has long been debated in Assyriological studies how such secrecy and curse formulae should be understood. Recently, the pendulum seems to have swung back in the direction of the secrecy formulae being taken more or less at face value, implying that the scholarly corpora of astrologers, diviners and others were considered to be secret in principle. How this principle will have worked out in specific contexts, however, is a different matter. The notion of secrecy and especially its social functions should be further specified in its socio-cultural contexts.

Introduction to the English Edition    Some 2,500 years after the first Jews established roots in Babylon, the once-vibrant and prosperous Jewish community of Iraq has disappeared. A community that numbered close to 140,000 in the late 1940 and comprised fully one-third of Baghdad s population consisted of a mere 20 when U.S. tanks rolled into the   Iraqi  capital in 2003.   Yet as late as the 1920s and 1930s, Iraqi Jews felt the heady potential of full equality in a secular society for the first time in their long history of subordination to Muslim rulers. From  music  to politics to commerce, Jews played a major role in Iraqi society and culture. For centuries after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, Babylon was the world s epicenter of Jewish life and religion the place where the Babylonian Talmud was written and where rabbis from across the region and Europe came to learn from the most scholarly sages. But the community dissolved in the middle of the 20th century when pro-Nazi forces, Arab nationalism, and the formation of Israel led to violence against and a general sense of insecurity among Iraqi Jews, causing them to flee, mostly over the course of about a year and a half.   This book tells the story of that last generation, people who in many cases grew up with strong   patriotic  feelings but were always prepared for a future beyond Iraq's borders just in case. The storytellers of these first-person accounts vary as widely as any group of Jews does, reflecting the breadth and texture of the community: wealthy businessmen and Communists, popular musicians and reformist writers, Iraqi patriots and early Zionists. Many had close friends among the Muslims and Christians of Iraq of whom they speak warmly. They tell the tales of a people with a love for their birth country that persisted even as they were forced to leave their homes.   The story of the final decades of the Jewish community in Iraq divides into three periods. First is the period before 1939 when the Jews in Iraq saw themselves as part of the Iraqi national fiber in government, commerce, and the arts. That ended verbally with the rise of Nazi influences andviolently with the Farhoud, a pogrom against the Jews, in 1941. Second is the period between then and 1953 when increasing Nazi agitation and Arab hostility toward the new state of Israel turned most Jews into Zionists and the vast majority of the community left. The final period records an Iraq that drifted towards increasingly autocratic leadership, culminating in the sadistic dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, with the Jews often playing the role of scapegoat. Finally, the book closes with several moving retrospectives of the community from a diverse group that includes two poets, a novelist, and an Iraqi Shiite.   These stories are sometimes funny, often tragic, touching, and insightful. Readers will find that the editors, in addition to recording descriptions of daily life, have also uncovered acts of heroism, adventure, and intrigue: from the undercover Israeli agents who helped orchestrate the mass emigration of Iraqi Jews to the young Jewish state at mid-century, to those who argued for the lives of their loved ones in the brutal prisons of Saddam Hussein. What has been compiled here, ultimately, is a book about quiet bravery in times of distress and a celebration of the possibility of peace.

At the time of the British occupation of Iraq in 1917, one third of Baghdad's  population was Jewish. An incredible statistic, given that there are only about  a dozen Iraqi Jews left there today. Of the 137,000 Jews who resided in Iraq in  the early 1940s, 124,000 had fled the country by 1952.     The book is filled with amazing characters like Baghdad-born Halahmy, who moved  to Israel in 1951, and is now a famous sculptor and art gallery owner in New  York. At his Pomegranate Gallery in SoHo, Halahmy now helps young Iraqi artists  (of all faiths) promote their work internationally.     In contrast to his positive memory of Iraq, Linda Masri Hakim, who left in  1972, after the Ba'athist regime had taken power and steadily increased its  persecution the Jewish community, still has nightmares about being stuck in  that country today. \"When I wake up, I touch my pillow and say, 'thank God I am  not in Iraq.'\" Linda says she would like to \"close the book\" on the Jews'  history in that country and \"forget about perpetuating the memory. This is my  attitude because we can't go back in the same way that European Jews could go  back to Europe after the Holocaust.\"     From the mix of idyllic and traumatic memories we get a sense of the enormous  loss Iraq itself suffered from the persecution and flight of its Jewish  community. Shiite Muslim Dhiaa Kasim Kashi writes that, from a cultural  standpoint, Iraq \"suffered a big shock when the Jews left,\" because \"all of  Iraq's famous musicians and composers were Jewish,\" as were a large portion of  its other artists. In addition, \"Jews were so central to commercial life in  Iraq that business across the country used to shut down on Saturdays because it  was the Jewish Shabbat. They were the most prominent members of every elite  profession - bankers, doctors, lawyers, professors, engineers, etc.\" In Kashi's  view, had the Jews stayed, they would have helped \"manage the country far  better\" and served as a \"moderating influence of society,\" a bulwark against  the \"extreme brand of Arab Nationalism\" embodied by Saddam Hussein, which  ultimately led the country into three devastating wars and complete economic  collapse.     If many of the individuals who fled Iraq rose to prominence thereafter, it may  be due to the exceptional richness of their heritage. They were thoroughly  integrated into the larger community and used Arabic as their main language,  they were literate and Jewish community leaders played an important role in  shaping Iraq's political destiny for centuries. Sir Sassoon Hezkel, for  example, participated in the negotiations with Winston Churchill that led the  formation of the modern Iraqi state. Knighted by the British crown, he was also  an early supporter of King Faisal I, the first Hashemite leader of Iraq. (He  later served as Faisal's minister of finance, which goes to show the level of  trust that used to exist between Iraq's Muslim and Jewish communities).     Yet \"Iraq's Last Jews\" is almost a misleading title. The story of Iraq's  prominent Christian communities is also told here. At a time when many Iraqi  Christians are suffering from renewed persecution, their proud history is both  timely and relevant for diplomats and journalists involved in that country's  transition. It is not a coincidence, for example, that the northern city of  Mosul remains the last bastion of Sunni extremism. There is a very real fear  among some of the town's Sunni population, many of whom now live in the homes  formerly occupied by expelled Jews, Kurds and Christians, that they may be  dispossessed of the ill-gotten gains they acquired under Saddam's rule.    What is it about this ancient land that had the world's major powers involved  in its destiny throughout recorded history? That is the larger question this  book addresses. The testimonies of \"Iraq's Last Jews\" serve as the narrative  threads that help to unveil layer upon layer of false assumptions and misguided  perceptions, most of which stem from news coverage devoid of historical  perspective. Even the normally well-informed New York Times columnist Thomas  Friedman thought it wise to joke, in 2003, that the US had invaded \"the  Flintstones.\" Though Friedman was obviously trying to convey the extreme  poverty he witnessed while traveling through Iraq, of all the countries the US  has ever invaded, Iraq may be the least befitting of such a simplistic analogy.  Iraq is a naturally rich country, both in resources and culture, and the  extreme poverty its civilians were reduced to under Saddam Hussein is a  historical anomaly.     \"Iraq's Last Jews\" does describe heart wrenching tragedies, but the collection  also reminds us that \"mutual respect and even friendship\" between Arabs and  Jews and Christians was \"once the norm\" in Iraq.     Having traveled extensively throughout Iraq, both before the war (as a  humanitarian worker) and after the 2003 invasion (as a journalist), I learned  more flipping through these 200 hundred pages than I imagined possible. \"Iraq's  Last Jews\" is without a doubt the most surprising and informative book about  that country's culture and history to date.

Jewish Journal of Boston     Book Sheds Light on Iraq's Once-Thriving Jewish Population Eric Shoag Special to the Journal Wed, January 28, 2009   Iraq's Last Jews: Stories of Daily Life, Upheaval, and Escape from Modern Babylon Tamar Morad, Dennos Shasha and Robert Shasha Palgrave Macmillan, 2008.   When one thinks of Iraq, images of war, destruction and chaos come to mind. One certainly does not imagine it being home to a flourishing, vibrant and vital Jewish community.    Yet in the not- too-distant past, that is precisely what existed there, and the largely untold story of that community and its demise is the subject of the book \"Iraq's Last Jews: Stories of Daily Life, Upheaval, and Escape from Modern Babylon\". The book is part of Palgrave Macmillan's \"Studies in Oral History\" series. The story is by no means a pleasant one, but it is essential to our understanding of not only the past and present of Iraq, but also of Israel, and of the epic Jewish odyssey of the tumultuous twentieth century.   At just over two hundred pages, this unassuming volume is packed with the detailed reminiscences of ex-patriots from many different social and economic strata. Editors Tamar Morad, Dennos Shasha and Robert Shasha have trimmed the narratives skillfully to present a composite picture of a once-thriving community systematically decimated over the years by the whims of unstable governments, and the fanned flames of racism and Arab nationalism.   Many of the interviews begin with affectionate recollections of a beloved homeland lost forever: the sights, sounds, and smells of routines, relatives, friends and neighborhoods now dispersed and dismantled. Jews were an integral part of Iraqi society from the centuries it existed as part of the Ottoman Empire, through the British-Arab alliance following World War I that resulted in its creation as an independent state. King Faisal's benevolent rule over this new state fostered an atmosphere of tolerance and equality which ended abruptly with his death in 1933, after which rising anti-Jewish and Pan-Arabic sentiment led to restrictions on all phases of Jewish life, culminating in the establishment of a pro-Nazi government and a notorious deadly pogrom against the Jews known as the Farhoud in 1941.    Anti-Jewish feelings exploded to new heights in the aftermath of Israel's independence in 1948, and its subsequent victory over the Arab armies that challenged its very right to exist. This led directly to the massive emigration of Jews from Iraq to Israel in the 1950s in what came to be called Operation Ezra and Nehemiah. It is here that a book of this kind, a history told in the form of a string of first-person tales, is particularly affecting. The notion that history is made up of ordinary people's decisions is brought home in full force, particularly in the story of Shlomo Hillel, an agent of the Mossad (Israeli Secret Service) who helped organize illegal airlifts of Jews. Hillel tells of the moment of panic he experienced when he found himself in a cockpit for the first time, feeling completely in over his head, fearing imminent discovery and failure. The individual leaps of faith by people like Hillel added up to a heroic movement whereby most of Iraq's 140,000 Jews found new homes in Israel and elsewhere.   Things turn surreal and horrific in the testimonies of those who stayed in Iraq through the 1960s, when the cycle of tolerance supplanted by increasingly repressive regimes continued, leading to the domination of the sadistic Saddam Hussein, who appears in these pages in some truly foreboding and ominous encounters. Random arrests and torture became commonplace, especially after Israel's decisive victory in the Six-Day War of 1967, when Jews suddenly found themselves without jobs, their assets frozen, and even their phone service cut off.    A brutal touchstone moment came in January 1969, when a group of 15 prisoners (nine Jews) was hanged in the public square of Baghdad. This event, like the Farhoud of 1941, we see through many pairs of eyes, including those of Zuhair Sassoon, grandson of the last Chief Rabbi of Iraq, whose father was imprisoned with those who were hanged. Sassoon speaks of his shock upon seeing the bodies and identifying his father's distinctive shoes on one of them. After what \"felt like an eternity,\" he looked up to the face, which was that of a stranger. His father (released the following year) had loaned the shoes to another, less fortunate, prisoner.   Sadly, Jews themselves are not spared criticism from some interviewees, who tell of Israeli prejudices against Arab Jews, or Mizrachim, once they arrived in the Jewish State. The difficulties Mizrachim faced both in Iraq and at the hands of a largely Eastern European, or Ashkenazi, power structure in Israel is perhaps understandably avoided considering the unflattering light it shines on traditional Zionist narratives, but it should not be ignored. The once-voluminous Jewish population of Iraq has dwindled incredibly to the single digits, but thanks to this book, its story has not disappeared and the small but significant acts of kindness and heroism that punctuate this tragic tale lend it an air of humanity and hope, as well as the fact that by its mere existence, there is the opportunity to learn from the mistakes of the past and forge a brighter future both for the Jews and for the world at large.    Eric Shoag writes from Boston   Zvi Gabay's Review    Here is how it appeared originally in the Jerusalem Post:   first page   and    second page       May 27, 2009 12:18 | Updated May 28, 2009 12:41   Babylonian heritage   By ZVI GABAY   Iraq's Last Jews - Stories of Daily Life,  Upheaval and Escape from Modern Babylon     Edited by Tamar Morad, Dennis Shasha and Robert Shasha   Introduction by Prof. Shmuel Moreh Palgrave-Macmillan 211 pp., $75.99 (hardcover)    Although the Jewish community of Iraq was forced to flee, its story is rarely told, leaving the Palestinians as the only victims of the Arab-Israeli conflict.   How does one explain the reason why a prosperous community of 140,000 people, with a history and heritage of 2,600 years, uproots itself en masse, and leaves Iraq, the country which it helped modernize in all areas - government and politics, economy, medicine, education, literature, poetry and music? An explanation for this extraordinary historical phenomenon is found in Iraq's Last Jews.   This book includes testimonies of 19 Jews (men and women) as well as of an Iraqi Shi'ite, who personally experienced the events that occurred in Iraq during the last century.   The main reasons that brought about the escape of the Jews from Iraq may be summarized as follows:    the xenophobia of the nationalistic Sunni leadership, which did not tolerate minorities, including Shi'ites, Christians and Kurds, especially if they had substantial financial means and social standing;    anti-Semitism, which existed in newly independent Iraq (and in other Arab countries), which was sponsored by Nazi Germany and led by the German ambassador, Dr. Fritz Grobba, who was supported by fanatical religious leaders, such as Haj Amin el-Husseni (who escaped from Palestine under British Mandate and continued his anti-Jewish activities in Iraq).   The climax of the anti-Jewish activities in Iraq, was the Farhud - the uprising against the Jews on Shavuot of 1941 - during which 135 men, women and children were murdered, hundreds were injured and much property was looted. This uprising ultimately brought about the escape and the mass emigration of the Jews from Iraq. The longing for Zion among Iraqi Jews directed many of them to Mandate Palestine and later on to Israel, while a minority opted to immigrate to other countries such as the United States, Canada, England and Australia. Today, the number of Iraqi Jews residing in Israel is 244,000, while 40,000 are distributed elsewhere in the world.   The catastrophe of the Jews of Iraq occurred for no obvious reason. The anti-Jewish policy of its governments left them with one option - to escape and leave behind all their personal and communal property. Unlike the Palestinians, the Jews of Iraq did not wage a war against Iraq nor did the Jews in other Arab countries. They were the scapegoats of political conflict in their own countries. Israeli governments throughout the years, for reasons which are not clear, did not include this catastrophe of the Jews of Arab countries as part of their political agenda nor was it included in the educational program, as in the case of the Nakba of the Palestinians. This enabled Arab propagandists to portray the Palestinians as the only victims of the Arab-Israeli conflict.   The testimonies are personal and include a broad description of Jewish life in Iraq spanning the comfortable day-to-day life, mainly during British rule, the sufferings and persecutions once Iraq became independent and finally the escape to Eretz Yisrael, through the assistance of the Zionist underground movement, which was established after the Farhud.   They are also authentic and can be the basis for writing the history of the Jews of Iraq in the last century. The introduction, written by Prof. Shmuel Moreh, provides historical background and explains how the Jewish community survived for 2,600 years, in Babylon and later in Iraq.   The extraordinary history of Dhiaa Kassem Kashi, the young Shi'ite, who suffered from oppression in Iraq and was forced to escape in the 1980s, is a vivid example of the sufferings of the non-Sunni communities in the country. He longs for the good relations that existed between his family and his Jewish neighbors. Needless to say, there were Muslims who did not agree with the policy of hatred toward the Jews; however, their voices at the time were not heard. The Jews in Iraq suffered from the struggles between the Sunnis and Shi'ites, as today Israel is at the center of the conflict between Shi'ite Iran and Sunni Arab countries.   The timing of the publication of this book is critical, since firsthand testimonies of Jews who lived in Iraq are dwindling (two of the Jews included in the book were not fortunate enough to see its publication). In this respect, special acknowledgment should be given to the Jewish Babylonian Heritage Center in Or Yehuda, for its important work in collecting and documenting personal testimonies of Iraqi Jews.   Since the book is in English, it provides for the first time a good glimpse of the history and the plight of the Iraqi Jewish community to a broad range of readers. Many of the descendents of the Jews of Iraq in Israel and other countries reached prominent positions in a range of fields - government, economy, science and the arts - due in part to their great heritage. The book is highly recommended for readers interested in exploring this unfortunately neglected part of Jewish history.

Die fuer dieses Buch zusammengetragenen Zeitzeugeninterviews geben einen wunderbaren Einblick in die Geschichte der irakischen Juden im 20. Jahrhundert. Den Gespraechstexten sind hilfreiche kurze historische Einleitungen vorangestellt. Seit dem babylonischen Exil vor rund 2.500 Jahren leben Juden im Irak, Ueber Jahrhunderte war die dortige Gemeinde eine der wichtigsten. Um 1940 zaehlte sie mehr als 130.000 Menschen und machte ein Drittel der Bevoelkerung Bagdads aus, Juden waren wichtige Stuetzen der irakischen Gesellschaft.    Mit den Unabhaengigkeitskaempfen des Irak von der Mandatsmacht Grossbritannien, dem arabischen Nationalismus und dem Einfluss des Nationalsozialismus verstaerkte sich ab den 1930ern der Antisemitismus; 1941 kam es zum sogenannten \"Farhoud\", einem zweitaegigen Pogrom, bei dem 170 Juden getoetet und viele verletzt wurden. In der Folge dieser Ereignisse sowie auch des Zionismus und des nach der Staatsgruendung Israels 1948 verschaerften juedisch-arabischen Konflikts begannen Juden, aus dem Irak zu fliehen. Von 1950 bis 1951 verliessen in einem Massenexodus mehr als 120.000 Juden das Land in Richtung Israel. Heute leben nur noch weniger als ein Dutzend Juden im Irak.    Die Geschichte der orientalischen Juden ist im Okzident wenig bekannt, und auch in Israel waren die Misrachim, die Juden aus den arabischen Laendern, lange eine kulturelle Minderheit, die von der aschkenasischen Mehrheitsgesellschaft wenig Beachtung und manchmal auch Verachtung erfuhr. Im juedisch-arabischen Konflikt, in dem sie aufgrund ihrer \"arabischen\" Herkunft auch haetten vermitteln koennen, gerieten sie oft zwischen alle Fronten.    Das Buch \"Iraks letzte Juden\" gibt nun einen wunderbaren Einblick in die Geschichte der irakischen Juden im 20. Jahrhundert. Es besteht aus Interviews mit bedeutenden Zeitzeugen, die durch hilfreiche kurze historische Einleitungen eingefuehrt werden. Den Anfang machen Erinnerungen an die Zeit vor dem Exil, an die widerspruechliche Existenz als Minderheit in einem arabischen Land zwischen Eingebundenheit und Diskriminierung, und die Bedeutung, die die juedische Gemeinde fuer das Land hatte.    So erfaehrt man, dass fast die gesamte irakische Musikszene in juedischer Hand war (das 1936 gegruendet \"Iraqi Broadcasting Authority Orchestra\" war bis auf einen einzigen Musiker ausschliesslich juedisch besetzt) und dass auch heute noch fast alle traditionelle irakische Musik von juedischen Komponisten stammt.    Ein weiteres Kapitel ist der Flucht und Vertreibung gewidmet, wichtige Figuren wie Shlomo Hillel und Mordechai Ben Porat, welche federfuehrend die Luftbruecke organisierten, mit der in tausend Fluegen die Juden Anfang der 1950er Jahre den Irak verliessen, kommen zu Wort, sie erzaehlen von den dramatischen und hoechst improvisierten Verhandlungen und Geheimdienstaktivitaeten, mit denen dies ermoeglicht wurde.    Auch die Schwierigkeiten der Fluechtlingsmassen, in Israel ganz neu zu beginnen, werden geschildert, und zuletzt erfaehrt man auch vom Leben der wenigen im Irak verbliebenen Juden, die nach dem Sechstagekrieg 1967 schwersten Verfolgungen ausgesetzt waren und ab 1979, wie andere Minderheiten auch, ganz besonders unter der Schreckensherrschaft von Saddam Hussein litten.    Mit ihrer Fuelle von faszinierenden Details (so liest man, wie die Ehefrau eines verhafteten Juden mehrfach bis zu Saddam Hussein persoenlich vordringt, der sie im Hausrock empfaengt) bilden die vielen persoenlichen Erinnerungen in ihrer Gesamtheit eine unglaublich dichte und spannende Geschichte des Irak im 20. Jahrhundert, aus der Sicht einer seiner Minderheiten. Eine Minderheit, die auch mehr als ein halbes Jahrhundert nach ihrem Exil noch Sehnsucht nach ihrer alten Heimat empfindet - auch dies ein anruehrender Aspekt, der aus vielen Erzaehlungen deutlich wird.

Von Alexander Kluy   Das Buch Iraks letzte Juden ist ein wichtiges, ein bewegendes Memorial. Und ein eminentes Zeugnis. Es ist eine archaeologische Erinnerung an eine Zeit, als jeder dritte Einwohner Bagdads Jude war (1917: 202.000 Einwohner -- davon knapp 80.000 Juden); und es ist Erinnerung an eine der am laengsten existierenden Gemeinden.   Ungefaehr 2.500 Jahre lang gab es eine juedische Gemeinschaft in Babylon, in Mesopotamien, im Irak. Lange waren sie, worauf Shmuueel Moreh in seiner klugen, konzisen Einleitung verweist, politisch, wirtschaftlich und gesellschaftlich gut integriert. Bis zum abrupten Exodus im Jahr 1950, als buchstaeblich ueber Nacht im Zuge der Operation Esra und Nehemia rund 124.000 der 137.000 irakischen Juden nach Israel uebersiedelten.   ...   Das nicht zuletzt gut uebersetzte und sorgfaeltig edierte Buch inklusive Zeittafel und weiterfaehrender Literatur ist ein bewegendes, Augen oeffnendes und nicht hoch genug zu lobendes Memorial. Aehnliches wuenscht man sich ueber viele andere Diasporagemeinden.   Die Welt    December 8, 2012   http://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/literatur/article111892900/Iraks-letzte-Juden.html   Iraks letzte Juden Bagdad war eines der wichtigsten sephardischen Zentren. Heute sind die Ueberlebenden traurige Zeugen einer vergangenen Epoche Von Najem Wali   Mehr als 2500 Jahre lang haben Juden im Irak gelebt. Trotz Unterdrueckung, politischer Unruhen, Krieg und Plagen, war die juedische Gemeinde in der Lage, ihre Identitaet, Kultur und Tradition zu bewahren. Gleichwohl waren sie politisch, sozial und oekonomisch gut im Lande integriert, und durch ihre Sprache, ihre gesellschaftlichen Traditionen und ihrer Lebensweise im Wesentlichen kaum von ihren arabischen Landsleuten zu unterscheiden. Es war eine pulsierende und bluehende Gemeinde, deren Mitgliederzahl sich in den 1940er-Jahren noch auf etwa 150.000 Seelen belief (einer alten britischen Statistik zufolge sah die Verteilung folgendermassen aus: fuenf Prozent von ihnen waren reich, dreissig Prozent gehoerten der Mittelschicht an, sechzig Prozent waren arm, und fuenf Prozent waren Bettler). Allein in der irakischen Hauptstadt Bagdad zaehlte die juedische Gemeinde 130.000 Mitglieder und stellte damit ein Drittel der gesamten Bevoelkerung der Stadt. Als 2003 die amerikanischen Panzer in Bagdad einrollten, bestand die juedische Gemeinde gerade noch aus 20 Personen!   Bis zu ihrem Massenexodus im Jahre 1951 betrachteten die Juden sich selbst als Teil des Iraks und seiner Geschichte. Sie waren stolz darauf, die Erben einer grossartigen, in kultureller und geistiger Hinsicht einzigartigen Vergangenheit zu sein. Der babylonische Talmud oder auf Hebraeisch das \"Zeitalter der Dscha'unim\" oder \"Zeitalter der Genies\", bezeichnet diese vergangene Epoche, als die, in der die grossen Rabbiner und Denker aus ihren Reihen hervorgingen.   Es ist also nicht verwunderlich, wenn die irakischen Juden sich automatisch als an dem \"modernen\", im Jahr 1921 gegruendeten irakischen Staat interessierte Mitbuerger betrachteten. Zum ersten Mal in ihrer langen Geschichte unter muslimischer Herrschaft machten die Juden die Erfahrung, gleichberechtigt in einer saekularen Gesellschaft zu leben. Ab jetzt spielten sie eine herausragende Rolle in der irakischen Gesellschaft -- in der Musik, der Politik, bei Technik und im Handel. Auch der erste Finanzminister in der Regierung von Koenig Faisal, Sassoon Eskell, war Jude.   Leider war diese Euphorie, diese goldene Aera nicht von langer Dauer. Die aelteste Gemeinde im Irak musste erleben, wie Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts nazifreundliche Stroemungen, arabischer Nationalismus und die Gruendung des Staates Israels zu Gewalttaetigkeiten gegenueber irakischen Juden und zu einem allgemeinen Gefuehl der Unsicherheit unter ihnen fuehrten. Am 6. Mai 1941 fand der Farhud (irakisches Pogrom) statt, zwei gesetzlose Tage nach der Niederschlagung eines Militaerputsches unter der Fuehrung von Kolonel Raschid Ali al-Gailani, einem Freund von Hitler, der spaeter nach seiner Flucht in Berlin vom \"Fuehrer\" persoenlich empfangen wurde. Ab diesem Tag flohen immer mehr Juden aus dem Land -- die meisten im Verlauf von nur anderthalb Jahren.   Es ist erstaunlich, mit welcher Praezision alle interviewten aus dem Irak stammenden Juden in dem kuerzlich im Wallstein Verlag erschienenen Buch \"Iraks letzten Juden\", die Chronik vom Verschwinden der \u00e4ltesten Gemeinde im Irak, von ihren tragischen, aber auch gluecklichen Momenten erzaehlen. Wir lesen von Menschen, \"die nicht selten starke patriotische Gefuehle f\u00fcr ihr Land hegten, die sich aber immer f\u00fcr eine Zukunft ausserhalb der Landesgrenzen bereithielten, fuer alle Faelle.\" Da die Ich-Erzaehler, \"die im Buch zu Wort kommen, so wenig homogen sind, wie jede andere Gruppe von Juden auch\", sind deren Geschichten in drei Kategorien eingeteilt: Unter dem Titel, \"Der Irak, unser Land\", erzaehlen Menschen von ihrer \u00dcberzeugung, dass sie (oder ihre Eltern) dachten, im Irak in \"ihrem\" Land zu leben. Unter dem Titel \"Das Wagnis\" berichten andere von ihren Leistungen als Pioniere der Zionistischen Bewegung in Bagdad oder auch als Agenten fuer den israelischen Geheimdienst, dem die Organisation des damaligen Massenexodus der irakischen Juden (1946-1951) zugeschrieben wird. Im Kapitel \"Nicht laenger unser Land\" versammeln sich jene Erzaehler, die von ihrem Beharren auf das Bleiben im Irak berichten, trotz Schikanen und Verfolgungen. Die letzten von ihnen verliessen den Irak erst 1982. All diese Lebenserzaehlungen offenbaren die Vielschichtigkeit der juedischen Gemeinde -- Geschaeftsleute und Kommunisten, bekannte Musiker und Schriftsteller, irakische Patrioten  und fruehe Zionisten. Wir erfahren von Menschen, die im Irak oder spaeter in Israel, in den USA und Grossbritannien Geschichte geschrieben haben: Die Gebrueder Kuwaity, Salah und Daoud, zum Beispiel, die vielleicht beruehmtesten Musiker des Irak, die ihre Bluetezeit zwischen 1920 und 1940 hatten, und deren Lieder sich bis heute grousser Popularitaet in Irak und Kuwait erfreuen. Die Soehne von Khedouri Abdoudi Zilkha, der das erste Department-Bankensystem in der arabischen Welt gruendete, die Bank Zilkha, die 1951 in New York in Zilkha & Sohns unbenannt wurde.

Richard Obadiah, der Sohn von Abdulla Obadiah, dem letzten Direktor der Frank-Iny-Schule, der letzten juedische Schule in Irak. Abdullah war bis die 1980er-Jahre einer der bekanntesten irakischen Mathematikprofessoren.   Unter seinen Studenten waren hohe Beamte mehrerer irakischer Regierungen, wie etwa der Saddams, oder der Leiter der nationalen Sicherheit in der Baath Partei, Nazim Kazzar. Von Letzterem, dem die Menschen spaeter den Spitznamen Jazzar, der Schlaechter, gaben, bekam Richard seinen Reisepass ausgehaendigt. Wir erfahren auch von den Kommunisten Salim Fatal und Sami Michael. Fatal wurde 1930 in Bagdad im armen juedischen Viertel Tatran geboren. Seiner Meinung nach sind Armut und Kommunismus die beiden verschwiegenen Kapitel der Geschichte der Juden. Sami Michael (1926 in Bagdad geboren), heute einer der populaersten israelischen Autoren, uebt sogar Kritik an den meisten Israelis, die ueber das Leben der Juden im Irak schreiben. Sie stellen die Realitaet so dar, schreibt Sami Michael, dass sie dem zionistischen Narrativ entspricht, in dem sie sagen, \"dass die zionistische Deutung ihrer Auswanderung die einzig wahre sei\". Fuer ihn ist das purer Mythos, denn \"die irakischen Juden hatten eine aehnliche Einstellung zu Palaestina wie die Juden in Amerika heute: Das Wohlergehen der Juden in Palaestina war uns wichtig, aber wir lebten gerne in unserem Land und wollten es nicht verlassen\".   Leider bedauern nur wenige Autoren im Buch wie Dhia Kachi, der 1952 in Bagdad geboren wurde, dass im Irak keine juedische Gemeinde mehr existiert: Aus zionistischer Sicht sollten ohnehin alle Juden in Israel leben; arabische Nationalisten sind auf Antisemitismus indoktriniert und viele Nachfahren der irakischen Juden wissen die der Gesellschaft, in die sie immigrierten, zu schaetzen. Trotzdem: \"Die Geschichte der irakischen Juden ist mehr als die Flucht von Verfolgten vor dem Zugriff ihrer Verfolger\".       How Do I Order A Copy?    The book is published by Palgrave Macmillan.

Ancient Jewish Sciences Editors Jonathan Ben-Dov and Seth L. Sanders \u00a92014 The Authors   7. Networks of Scholars: The Transmission of Astronomical and Astrological Learning between Babylonians, Greeks and Jews    Mladen Popovi\u0107    1. Introduction    [\u261e p7.1] What do we know about what ancient Jewish scholars knew about what Babylonian scholars knew? 1 In order to answer this question we can analyse the different scholarly texts at our disposal, Babylonian and Jewish, and look for similarities and differences. We can then explain which Babylonian elements were familiar to Jewish scholars and how they appropriated, used and reworked these. Such analyses usually work from specific Jewish texts and then look for Babylonian elements, retracing these in specific cuneiform texts.    [\u261e p7.2] The issue of tracking influences and cultural encounters between Babylonia and Jewish Palestine has another side to it, one not often put to the fore. Previous research on tracing influences of Babylonian learning in ancient Jewish texts has reflected insufficiently on the specific nature of such cultural encounters and the means of transmission. It has been assumed, tacitly or explicitly, that Jewish scholars had direct access to Babylonian centres of learning. 2 On the level of textual comparisons, it is evident that elements of Babylonian origin appear in ancient Jewish texts; this is not disputed at all. However, the occurrence of textual similarities alone does not constitute enough evidence to argue for a direct connection. We at least need to further qualify the nature of that connection. Considering the social context of knowledge transmission, we must ask how and through whom ancient Jewish scholars got to know about some of the things that Babylonian scholars knew.    [\u261e p7.3] In this article I wish to focus mainly on two aspects of the social context of the transmission of astronomical learning in ancient Judaism. The first aspect is the differentiation between various levels of learning on the one hand and how this manifests itself in social relations between learned individuals on the other. The second aspect is that of ethnicity and cultural encounters with regard to learned knowledge.    [\u261e p7.4] I shall argue that the level of learning that we encounter in early Jewish sources differs starkly from contemporary developments in Babylonian and Greek astronomical science and points to a different trajectory of transmission. The transmission of Babylonian learning to Jewish scholars in Palestine was not a direct one. Furthermore, it went through different channels from the transmission of Babylonian astronomical science to Greek scholars. We should not assume as fact that Jewish scholars had direct access to Babylonian schools. We have no evidence for this. Due to the nature of the evidence at our disposal we cannot be very specific about the exact ways in which Babylonian scholarship reached Jewish Palestine sometime during the second half of the first millennium BCE Yet from a methodological point of view a number of considerations discussed in this article should be taken into account in future research on this issue. 3    2. Babylonian and Jewish Astral Sciences    [\u261e p7.5] A brief survey of the Enochic astronomical material and some of the Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran with regard to the Babylonian elements that they contain 4 provides some insight into the interests and level of knowledge of ancient Jewish scholars. 5 The point is to discern some of the social and cultural aspects that may have determined the context of transmission of Babylonian elements of astral sciences in Jewish texts, and to consider this in comparison with the transmission of astral sciences within Babylonian culture and between Babylonia and the Greek world.    [\u261e p7.6] On the one hand, the Jewish texts attest to knowledge of some elements from Babylonian astronomy from the first half of the first millennium BCE (En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin), of the concept of the zodiac that was introduced in the fifth century BCE and of the non-mathematical Lunar Three scheme that was developed sometime later. On the other hand, these texts show an apparent ignorance with regard to sophisticated forms of mathematical astronomy that were developed in Seleucid Babylonia and transmitted to the Greek world.    [\u261e p7.7] The scholars behind the Jewish texts remain anonymous. In the Enochic corpus the authorial \u201cI\u201d was ascribed to Enoch, while the astronomical and astrological manuscripts from Qumran lack an authorial \u201cI\u201d altogether, as I emphasized elsewhere, 6 as do the calendric texts. 7 What Babylonian elements do we encounter in these texts? What changes and transformations did Babylonian elements go through as they were used in new Jewish-Palestinian texts and contexts?    2.1 Textual Comparisons    [\u261e p7.8] The earliest Jewish astronomical work is the Enochic Astronomical Book (extant after extensive redaction and modifications in 1 Enoch 72\u201382). Composed in Aramaic in the third century BCE or even earlier, the most complete text is preserved in Ethiopic translation. Four Aramaic copies (4Q208\u2013211), containing only the Astronomical Book , have turned up at Qumran. The oldest fragments date to the late third or early second century BCE (4Q208). Scholars have pointed to a Mesopotamian background for some of the astronomical aspects of the Enochic Astronomical Book . 8 1 Enoch 72 records the annual variation in the length of day and night-time. This variation is measured on a scale of eighteen, reflecting an M:m ratio of 2:1, 9 which results in a simple linear zigzag function rooted in Babylonian astronomy. Originally counting a 360-day year, as does Mul.Apin, for example, the Astronomical Book subsequently developed a 364-day year tradition. 10 For the so-called synchronistic calendar in the Aramaic fragments from Qumran (4Q208\u2013209), the most recent suggestion is that it mainly deals with the duration of lunar visibility during night and day in a fashion similar to Tablet 14 of En\u016bma Anu Enlil. 11    [\u261e p7.9] The astronomy in the Enochic Astronomical Book reaches back to older Mesopotamian examples from the first half of the first millennium BCE, such as En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin, but the Astronomical Book does not reflect developments that occurred in Mesopotamian astronomy from the middle of the first millennium onward. These developments comprised the formulation of mathematical models that enable the prediction of the recurrence of certain astronomical phenomena and the introduction of the zodiac as a schematic, symbolic division of the ecliptic for computing and recording the planetary positions more exactly. The composition of the Astronomical Book 12 probably predates the even more advanced developments in Babylonian astronomy of the second century BCE, which were not incorporated into the text. The later copies of the Aramaic Astronomical Book from Qumran (4Q209\u2013211 date to the second half and the end of the first century BCE) do not show evidence of such \u201cupdates.\u201d Moreover, the importance attributed to the Enochic type of astronomy is illustrated by the fact that the Aramaic Astronomical Book influenced other texts of the Jewish-Palestinian astronomical tradition, such as 4Q317 and 4Q503 and possibly 4Q334, Hebrew manuscripts dating from the second half of the second century BCE (4Q317 and 4Q503) and from the turn of the era (4Q334). 13    [\u261e p7.10] There is also possible evidence for the use of more contemporary astronomical learning from Babylonia, although still in the form of non-mathematical astronomy. Scholars have interpreted some of the Qumran calendar texts in Hebrew (4Q320, 4Q321 and 4Q321a, which date to the end of the second century BCE until the second half of the first century BCE) to be based on elements of a Late-Babylonian lunar system (Persian-Hellenistic period), the Lunar Three scheme from non-mathematical astronomical texts, which were appropriated and modified by Jewish scholars to meet their own calendric needs. 14    [\u261e p7.11] In addition to the Aramaic Astronomical Book , the texts influenced by it and some of the calendar texts from Qumran, there are two astrological manuscripts from Qumran to take into account. Both texts attest to knowledge of the zodiac and thus illustrate that they had taken up one of the developments of Babylonian astronomy from the second half of the first millennium. However, whether this knowledge originated from Babylonia or from the Greek world is another matter.    [\u261e p7.12] Alongside Babylonian elements, these two texts appear to display Hellenistic features as well. This should not surprise us. During the Hellenistic period knowledge of Babylonian astrology and mathematical astronomy reached the Greek world, and having been transformed into Hellenistic astronomy and astrology it was taken elsewhere again. The Aramaic manuscript 4Q318 (copied around the turn of the era) consists of two parts. The first part ( selenodromion ) describes the synodic movement of the moon through the zodiac during twelve months of thirty days each, counting a 360-day year, as in Babylonian tradition. The second part ( brontologion ) has predictions for when it will thunder. This sort of text appears both in the Babylonian and Graeco-Roman astrological traditions. 15 The 360-day year scheme suggests a derivation from Babylonian tradition, but the zodiacal names in 4Q318 seem to point to Hellenistic origins. 16 The Hebrew manuscript 4Q186 (copied around the turn of the era) is a physiognomic-astrological catalogue combining different forms of learning (physiognomics, 17 astrology and possibly medicine and magic). The combination of different scientific disciplines within one text is probably already the case in Babylonian traditions predating the Hellenistic period. 18 The text\u2019s astrological framework, however, points decisively to a Hellenistic background, as the horoscope ( \u05de\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3 ; molad ) or ascendant (the point of the zodiac rising above the eastern horizon at the moment of birth) is of no importance at all in Babylonian horoscopy but is significant in Hellenistic horoscopy. 19    [\u261e p7.13] Three observations can be drawn from the previous survey. First, elements from older types of Mesopotamian astronomy and astrology such as En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin from the first half of the first millennium BCE resurfaced in Aramaic in the early Enochic corpus sometime in the third century BCE 20 In this form, this type of astronomy continued to influence new compositions in Hebrew up until at least the second half of the second century BCE (4Q317 and 4Q503) and possibly later (4Q334). The evidence of new Hebrew compositions inspired by Enochic astronomy is important, as it demonstrates that the reception of older types of Babylonian astronomy was not limited to the early Enochic corpus. From a diachronic perspective we may observe that older types of Babylonian astronomy did not become obsolete after their initial reception in Jewish circles in the form of Enochic astronomy, but continued to be regarded relevant. This is demonstrated both by the later date of the Astronomical Book manuscripts from Qumran (4Q209\u2013211) and by the new compositions in Hebrew that were inspired by it. This preservation of older types of material may argue against continuing contact with Babylonia or at least may suggest rare contact.    [\u261e p7.14] Second, alongside the ongoing transmission of older elements of Babylonian astronomy from En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin, more recent features appear that post-date that type of astronomy but predate developments in the advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy of the second century BCE. Calendric manuscripts from Qumran (4Q320, 4Q321 and 4Q321a) seem to be influenced by the Lunar Three scheme from Late-Babylonian non-mathematical astronomical texts. Astrological manuscripts from Qumran (4Q186 and 4Q318) demonstrate that knowledge of the zodiac, which was developed sometime in the fifth century BCE, found its way into Jewish society during this period as well. The manuscript copies are evidence of this development in the first century BCE at the latest. However, the mathematical type of astronomy is absent in all this.    [\u261e p7.15] Third, these ancient Jewish sources show a level of astronomical competency that was far less sophisticated than the advanced methods of contemporary astronomers in Babylonian and Greek societies. Starting in the Persian period but especially in the Seleucid period, Babylonian scholars made new and great advances in mathematical astronomy. 21 These advanced Babylonian astronomical methods were also transmitted to the Greek world. Due to the encounter with Babylonian astronomy and due to the work of Hipparchus and others such as Hypsicles, Hellenistic astronomy changed tremendously in this period. 22 Knowledge of certain elements of Babylonian astronomy among Greek scholars already occurred before Hipparchus, between the fifth and third centuries (Eudoxus, for example), but it is in the second century, especially with Hipparchus it seems, \u201cthat we see a more complex and systematic exploitation of the resources of the Babylonian astronomers, including not only a whole array of period relations, but also extensive observations and, most notably, mathematical methods.\u201d 23    [\u261e p7.16] The extant Jewish sources do not attest likewise to this influence from advanced mathematical astronomy from Babylonia. Aramaic Enochic astronomy remained non-mathematical. The earliest of the calendric manuscripts from Qumran (4Q320) dates to the end of the second century BCE and the youngest (4Q321) to the second half of the first century BCE While these manuscripts postdate the development of advanced astronomy in Babylonia and its transmission to the Greek world, they do not reflect those developments. The astrological manuscripts from Qumran attest knowledge of the zodiac, but this occurs in relatively straightforward lists. We do not find actual horoscopes, although even those need not presuppose the ability to execute complex observations and calculations. Such data may have been at hand in ephemerides and the like, but we have no evidence for this in Palestinian Judaism in this period. It appears that the concept of the zodiac found its way into Palestinian Jewish astral science as a finished product, so to say, without specialist knowledge of the mathematical-astronomical intricacies on which horoscopic astrology was based, and possibly also without access to supporting texts such as ephemerides\u2014there is at least no need to suppose that these sorts of texts were available to Jewish scholars. 24    2.2 Different Levels of Learning    [\u261e p7.17] Should we think of Enochic astronomy and its offshoots as survivals of types of astronomy that were already out-dated in Babylonia itself? What does \u201cout-dated\u201d mean? More advanced mathematical methods had been developed in Babylonian astronomy whilst Enochic astronomy flourished in Palestinian Judaism, but perhaps as a rule of thumb that kind of astronomy may still have had its worth. In that respect we should not unnecessarily devalue it. Furthermore, there is some evidence for the continued transmission of En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin in Babylonia during the Seleucid period, but we do not know whether these were actually used. 25 Even if there is some evidence for continued copying of En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin, it is evident that from a general perspective the character of astronomy differs strikingly between Babylonia and Jewish Palestine in the Hellenistic period. In Babylonia these texts were being copied alongside new and important astronomical advances, which are conspicuously absent from the extant Palestinian Jewish astronomical and astrological texts.    [\u261e p7.18] The extant texts thus show different levels of astronomical learning. What ramifications does this conclusion have for understanding the channels of transmission through which ancient Jewish scholars learned about Babylonian astral sciences? How did Jewish scholars in Palestine relate to the current advanced astronomical developments in Seleucid Babylonia? Did Jewish scholars consciously ignore these developments for some reason? Was the more recent and advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy too difficult for them to appropriate? Or were they completely unaware of these developments because they were not connected in the same way to the same networks as those that transmitted Babylonian learning to the Greek world?    [\u261e p7.19] It is doubtful whether the apparent lack of knowledge of advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy was due to a conscious decision motivated by certain theological considerations, as has been suggested. 26 A scientific-religious worldview characterized by a specific emphasis on heptadic-based numbers might explain the calendar texts from Qumran and the Enochic astronomical material to support that, but it does not provide a satisfactory explanation for the astrological material from Qumran. The concept of the zodiac does not support such a worldview. 27    [\u261e p7.20] This begs the question: why were some concepts appropriated while others were not? There seems no reason to suppose that the authors or scribes behind the Enochic material and the Dead Sea Scrolls would have been intellectually less capable of dealing with complex mathematical-astronomical procedures from contemporary Babylonia. Instead, we should look for an explanation in terms of social relations and networks.    [\u261e p7.21] With due regard for the caveat that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, in this case what is missing in the extant Jewish sources may provide us with a clue that, with regard to the astral sciences at that time, the channels of transmission between Babylonia and Jewish Palestine were probably different from the channels between Babylonia and the Greek world. When looking for Babylonian influences on ancient Jewish science it is not just a matter of listing the elements and looking for similarities and differences between texts. We cannot without further ado connect streams of traditions from Uruk, Sippar, Babylon and the like with Jerusalem, Qumran or any other place where Jewish scholars lived.    [\u261e p7.22] The different levels of learning should make us cautious of simply viewing the learned elites from different localities as interacting with each other on the same level. Mindful of Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s concept of cultural capital, we can appreciate the scholarly learning in the early Enochic and Qumran texts as a prized piece of knowledge signalling and confirming the status of those having access to and possessing it. 28 But the Jewish scholarly elite may not have been of the same standing as the Babylonian scholarly elite, or the Greek one for that matter. In their respective societies Babylonian and Jewish scholars may have been members of the elite, but although stories about Abraham teaching Phoenicians and Egyptians or Daniel at the Babylonian court suggest otherwise, this need not imply that in real life the one recognized the other as equal or that there was direct contact between them, as is often assumed. Especially important here is to balance the two elements of having or gaining access and giving or allowing access as these materialize in social relationships between individuals.    3. Cultural Encounters and the Transmission of Astronomical Learning    [\u261e p7.23] Simplicius, the Late Antique commentator on Aristotle\u2019s works, wrote that, according to Porphyry, Aristotle had asked Callisthenes, who was in Babylon with Alexander the Great, to send astronomical observations from Babylon to Greece. 29 In De caelo Aristotle himself refers to observational data by the Egyptians and the Babylonians as the basis for much of their (i.e. the Greeks) evidence about particular luminaries. 30    [\u261e p7.24] Regardless of whether such a request was really made by Aristotle, the anecdote illustrates how some in Late Antiquity imagined such cultural encounters and the transmission of knowledge between Babylon and Greece: reports were simply sent from Babylon directly to Greece by a Greek visitor of certain status. Unfortunately, the anecdote does not really provide us with much concrete information. The nature of the reports is not specified, nor their number: what kind of sources and how many? Nor is it clear what language they were in (a Late Antique writer would probably not have thought of Akkadian anymore): 31 did Simplicius imagine the reports were in Greek? Furthermore, there is no explanation of how exactly Callisthenes obtained these sources or from whom. It was not as if astronomical reports were just lying around to be picked up by anyone. How did he know where to go? Did Callisthenes walk into a temple in Babylon, the Esangila, for example? Did he know individual Babylonian astronomers? 32 Such questions were probably not on Simplicius\u2019 mind, but from a socio-historical perspective on science we need to address some of these questions as to possession, accessibility and mobility in order to better understand the transmission of scholarly knowledge, in this case astronomical learning.    [\u261e p7.25] That Babylonian learning travelled far beyond its original geographic boundaries is undisputed. It is evident that Babylonian sciences such as astronomy and astrology were transmitted beyond the Mesopotamian cultural realm to the west, and to the east for that matter. We find Babylonian mathematical and astronomical formulas and calculations that turn up in roughly contemporary and later texts of other cultural realms. Modern scholars have shown that Babylonian astral sciences contributed to and influenced Greek astronomy and astrology. 33 Ancient sources also acknowledge such Babylonian origins, 34 and we have examples of Jewish texts that put Abraham on a par with scholars from Egypt, Phoenicia and Babylon. 35    [\u261e p7.26] The views of Simplicius and, for example, Pseudo-Eupolemus, 36 are rather clear-cut: scientific data were transmitted to others in written form and scholarly knowledge was exchanged in direct interaction between learned men. In general, both aspects, written and oral communication, no doubt shaped ancient contexts of transmission, but in specific cases we probably have to differentiate: scientific data were not just sent around indiscriminately and not all learned men would, as a rule, have interacted with all learned men from other cultural realms, this being dependent on various factors.    [\u261e p7.27] Insights from Social Network Analysis theory may help to conceptualize specific conditions for the transmission of astronomical and astrological knowledge. 37 I will not provide a systematic consideration of all forms of connectivity that may have played a role, but will use Social Network Analysis theory as a heuristic tool to ask certain specific socio-cultural questions. The benefit of this approach is that it focuses our attention on the social context of the transmission of astronomical knowledge, as this is determined by social relationships, and with a special emphasis on networks. The question is what kinds of social networks were involved. People transmit information and knowledge via different mediums in specific contexts\u2014defined by, for example, locality, social status, gender, age, kinship, nationality and ethnicity. In order to understand the context, i.e. the circumstances of these interactions and of the transmission of knowledge, we must focus on concrete localities, channels and agents.    [\u261e p7.28] In this section I wish to address three issues regarding the transmission of Babylonian astronomy and astrology: the involvement of non-Babylonians in Babylonian science, the role of the Aramaic language and the transmission to the Greek world specifically.    3.1 The Involvement of Non-Babylonians in Babylonian Science    [\u261e p7.29] With regard to ethno-linguistic and cultural distinctions, modern anthropological and cultural studies have called essentialist distinctions into doubt: what makes a certain type of learning \u201cEgyptian\u201d or \u201cBabylonian,\u201d and how does that relate to concrete people, be they Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek or Jewish? 38 There is somewhat of a paradox in some recent analyses in that such terms are problematized as less useful heuristic concepts whereas our taxonomic interests call for their use. We wish to categorize and classify our data into neat and separate boxes, and at the same time wish to acknowledge that the boundaries between these conceptual boxes are often, in reality, fluid and fuzzy.    [\u261e p7.30] Nonetheless, that boundaries are fluid, fuzzy or that they can be crossed does not imply they do not exist; boundaries are not completely ephemeral, and sometimes they are very real. While ethno-linguistic and cultural borders can be crossed, they also function to create a persistent sense of difference. 39 Specific social and cultural contexts will have determined when and how boundaries would have been more fluid or stricter.    [\u261e p7.31] We have evidence from the Neo-Assyrian period of non-Babylonians and non-Assyrians engaged in royal scholarly networks. 40 The late Assyrian empire had become bilingual and bicultural, with Aramaic becoming the international vernacular. 41 At the same time, there is evidence for adversarial reactions among the Assyrian ruling classes to the rising importance of Aramaic. For example, to a request by the scribe Sin-iddina of Ur to reply in Aramaic, the king answers that the scribe should rather write to him in Akkadian. 42 This example works both ways. On the one hand, it shows that ethno-linguistic boundaries were not strict: letters to the Assyrian king could be written in Aramaic. On the other hand, it demonstrates that such boundaries were not completely ephemeral. The sender of the letter may have asked for too much by requesting the king\u2019s answer also be in Aramaic. The king retorts by raising the boundary and emphasizing its importance: he creates an ethno-linguistic sense of difference between the scribe and himself. While ethno-linguistic and cultural boundaries can be crossed, they are also maintained. However, in the Neo-Assyrian period such boundaries do not seem to have prohibited the accessibility and dissemination of Babylonian science.    [\u261e p7.32] If we look at evidence from the Neo- and Late-Babylonian periods, it seems that the Babylonian urban elite had stricter limitations for entry into the scholarly elite than the Assyrians. 43 There is, however, some evidence for scribes bearing non-Akkadian names who copied literary, scholarly texts: \u0160emaa, son of Adirum is thus far the only example, the extant sources showing that all Babylonian scribes with non-Akkadian names wrote documentary, legal texts. 44 Ethno-linguistic boundaries may not have been absolute, but some form of boundary maintenance with regard to literary and scholarly texts as distinct from documentary, legal texts did seem to be in effect.    [\u261e p7.33] Through cuneiform culture the Babylonian urban elite is said to have expressed a high degree of self-consciousness. For example, a cuneiform text from Hellenistic Uruk shows that the Aramaeans were still considered a separate ethno-linguistic group by some Babylonians; 45 the reference in the late Seleucid list from Uruk of kings and scholars to Esarhaddon\u2019s counsellor Aba-Enlil-dari as the one \u201cwhom the Aramaeans call A\u1e2buqar\u201d shows that the story of A\u1e2biqar was known but seen as part of \u201cpopular\u201d Aramaic culture rather than cuneiform elite culture. 46 The impression gained from cuneiform sources is of Late Babylonia as an imagined community of urban elites who retreated into the imaginary space provided by the temples and the schools, with cuneiform itself being the main distinguishing characteristic of this community. The Babylonian urban elites constructed a cultural identity for themselves, one that became more and more detached from the ethno-linguistic, cultural and political realities of Babylonia in the Hellenistic and Parthian periods. 47 At the same time, evidence from Hellenistic Uruk seems to indicate that they cultivated strong ties with the Greek elite and the Seleucid rulers that ensured their small community thrived. 48 This shows that despite a cultivated identity that seems detached from real life, Babylonian urban elites were also able to relate to changing ethno-linguistic, cultural and political realities and to do so to their own advantage.    [\u261e p7.34] Changed historical circumstances between the late fifth and late fourth centuries and the second century BCE no doubt influenced the possibilities presented to and the choices made by those specialized in astronomy and astrology in the cities of Babylonia, determining also the mobility, accessibility and dissemination of that learned knowledge. For example, recent research on the collection owned by two separate families of ma\u0161ma\u0161\u0161u \u2019s in Uruk in the late fifth and late fourth centuries BCE suggests a tight social network of scholarly families. 49 The colophons suggest that this scholarly network operated on a limited geographical scale: scholars, students and their writings seem to have rarely travelled beyond Uruk or across professional divides. 50 If we consider these two families from the perspective of Social Network Analysis theory, such a limited network that consists of strong ties\u2014kinship ties being the clearest example of strong ties\u2014seems less conducive to bridge social boundaries and cross network distance between different ethno-linguistic groups. 51    [\u261e p7.35] From a diachronic perspective, there is also evidence for non-familial apprenticeship in second-century BCE Seleucid Uruk. Although the social network there was tight, as over six generations just four scholarly families collaborated in the training of their sons, patterns of non-familial apprenticeship can be identified. 52 A limited network that consisted of strong ties (kinship) was thus able to bridge social boundaries and transmit learning to non-family. It is, however, not readily apparent whether these non-familial apprentices may be indicative as well for the crossing of ethno-linguistic and cultural boundaries, and if so, which ones exactly. Perhaps individual members from social networks such as these and others were able to cross much greater network distances: Uruk may have been one of the sources from which Babylonian astronomy made its way to the Greek world. 53 One can think of a scenario in which individual scholars from Uruk moved away from the city, taking their scientific knowledge with them. Historical and modern analogies suggest that this would have been mostly young men. 54 Perhaps such a move in the second century BCE, if it occurred at all, was due to economic reasons: private income generated by astronomical and astrological knowledge 55 may not have been sufficient, and in response some scribes took their chances and left.    [\u261e p7.36] In terms of ethno-linguistic and cultural boundaries the Neo- and Late-Babylonian evidence demonstrates complex and multi-layered contexts. On the one hand, ethno-linguistic distinctions were made and cuneiform culture was upheld to emphasize Babylonian identity. On the other hand, various sources show a multi-ethnic picture that seems to call into doubt the dominance of cuneiform culture in Late Babylonia. This picture highlights the difficulty of distinguishing neatly between what is Babylonian and what is non-Babylonian. 56    [\u261e p7.37] These two different aspects have direct bearing on the contexts of transmission of astronomical learning, and their complexity is well illustrated by the issue of Aramaic as a medium for the transmission of Babylonian astronomical and astrological learning.    3.2 Aramaic as a Medium for Transmission of Astronomical Learning    [\u261e p7.38] There is no evidence for the translation of complex astronomical cuneiform texts into Aramaic. 57 Aramaic Astronomical Enoch from Qumran does not even come remotely near to the advanced forms of cuneiform astronomy and it hardly can stand exemplary for a body of Babylonian Aramaic scholarship in the first millennium BCE    [\u261e p7.39] Apparently, the Babylonian urban elites kept to traditional cuneiform learning as the sole official culture of Babylonia. At the same time, Aramaic became the dominant vernacular. Should we then assume that there must have been a Babylonian literature and science written in Aramaic, now lost because it was written on perishable material? Or should we assume that Aramaic did not become the dominant language to express Babylonian high culture but remained mostly a language of communication and administration, and, moreover, that it is questionable whether any significant corpus of cuneiform was ever translated into Aramaic? 58    [\u261e p7.40] The Neo- and Late-Babylonian evidence presents us with different scenarios from the Neo-Assyrian evidence. We do not have a significant body of sources in Aramaic from first-millennium Babylonia or a clear and significant body of references from first-millennium Babylonia to the use of Aramaic and to the involvement of non-Babylonians in Babylonian science, as we do have regarding the last aspect for Assyria in the Neo-Assyrian period. Were ethno-linguistic and cultural boundaries in Babylonia more strictly maintained with regard to scholarly learning and did this inhibit the accessibility and dissemination of Babylonian science, or is it just a matter of evidence gone missing?    [\u261e p7.41] In addition to the Babylonian priests and scholars\u2014the old urban notability\u2014there was another group of scribes, the sep\u012bru scribes. These did not belong to the old Babylonian nobility but were recognized as important persons who were well integrated in the temple organization. 59 They appear to have been Aramaic speakers who had become assimilated into Babylonian culture. 60 Although there is thus far no evidence that these scribes worked on literary or scholarly texts, 61 the question is how strictly boundaries were maintained. The sep\u012bru scribes seem to have been well integrated into the temple organization, and the temple was the place of learning in Babylonia. The exact relations, however, between the Babylonian scholarly elite and Aramaic sep\u012bru scribes merit further investigation. It might be that in the future evidence will turn up that sep\u012bru scribes had access to cuneiform sources or that astronomical principles were divulged to them. 62    [\u261e p7.42] We might also entertain the possibility that individual Jews, being part of a general Aramaic milieu, were among such Aramaic sep\u012bru scribes\u2014perhaps having taken up Babylonian names even, making it more difficult for us to identify them as Jewish and thus also calling into question the aptness of such neat taxonomic distinctions. Be that as it may, no concrete evidence has as of yet turned up for Jews being Aramaic sep\u012bru scribes. In the wake of the Babylonian conquest of Judah and Jerusalem in 586 BCE a Jewish Diaspora formed in Babylonia. Jews were fully integrated in economic everyday life there, as \u201cis evidenced by their participation in very ordinary economic transactions in which they are recorded as the creditors and debtors in a variety of loan documents and receipts.\u201d 63 There is also enough evidence for Babylonian Jewish villagers or merchants in Neo- and Late-Babylonian documents, but there is no evidence for Jews accessing scholarly tablet collections directly. 64    [\u261e p7.43] It is important to consider the role of the Aramaic language as a medium for the transmission of Babylonian astronomical and astrological material to the Jewish world. The westward transmission of this body of learned knowledge originating in cuneiform culture may have occurred through Aramaic sources, which is how Jewish scholars, being part of a general Aramaic milieu, may have encountered it. 65 The astronomical Enoch manuscripts from Qumran, for example, may be evidence for this role of Aramaic. However, whether it was through direct access to cuneiform texts, direct contact with Babylonian scholars in Mesopotamia or elsewhere, or indirectly via access to a\u2014more vague\u2014continuous tradition is another matter.    [\u261e p7.44] In order to better understand the possible role of Aramaic as a medium for the transmission of Babylonian astronomical material and also how some of this material made its way to Aramaic texts such as the astronomical Enoch manuscripts from Qumran, it is instructive to briefly consider evidence from Late Antiquity. In Late Antiquity, Aramaic was no longer only the vernacular of Babylonian culture but had also become the literary language of Mesopotamian Christianity, Babylonian Judaism and Mandaean Gnosticism. 66    [\u261e p7.45] Considering the elements of Babylonian learning in Late Antique sources one may observe that these differ from what one finds in earlier cuneiform learning: Late Antique scholarship is different in character from the advanced mathematical astronomical texts from the latter part of the first millennium BCE, being less technical and more divinatory. 67 The textual similarities are of a more structural than of a specific nature (see section 4 below). What is important for our discussion is that these Late Antique traditions do not presuppose direct contact with cuneiform culture. The Late Antique texts do not derive from the \u201chigh culture\u201d of cuneiform written tradition, but instead probably represent the transmission of elements of popular Babylonian traditions, although elite and popular culture should not be seen as two completely separate strands of tradition. 68    [\u261e p7.46] There is, of course, some evidence for literary Aramaic texts from the first millennium BCE, and the Aramaic manuscripts from Qumran add significantly to this, 69 but this concerns literature (A\u1e2biqar) 70 or liturgy, 71 rather than Babylonian astronomy and astrology in its advanced forms. In our analysis of cultural encounters we need to distinguish between different kinds of texts and traditions and differentiate between various channels and agents of transmission. 72 What applies to one need not explain the other. For example, knowledge of the Gilgamesh epic concerns certain motifs that need not presuppose acquaintance with the Standard Version (not even consciously being related anymore to the epic as such), 73 but may have been part of popular oral traditions. Those who composed the Prayer of Nabonidus (4Q242) or Daniel 4 may have gotten their knowledge about the Babylonian king Nabonidus through a chain of transmission that originated in the public reading of Nabonidus\u2019 inscription. 74 In both cases, there is no need to suppose direct access to Babylonian centres of higher learning.    [\u261e p7.47] Another kind of tradition is that of law and legal formulas in documentary texts, the origins of which have been traced back to Babylonia, such as in the Wadi Daliyeh papyri from fourth-century BCE Samaria and also in second-century CE legal texts from Murabba\u02bfat and Na\u1e25al \u1e24ever. 75 The presence of empires as a political factor may account for the spread of legal traditions and formulary, and in this case the Aramaic sep\u012bru scribes, taking care of all sorts of legal, administrative writings, may too have been agents conducive for the transmission of Babylonian legal formulas.    [\u261e p7.48] A differentiated perspective on the use of Aramaic in the ancient Near East points to different means of transmission, via different channels and agents, for different kinds of traditions and texts. What may apply to the transmission of elements from narratives, may not apply likewise to scholarly literature. That some astronomical elements in the Astronomical Book have Babylonian origins is evident, as do other elements in 1 Enoch. 76 This is not disputed. The issue is how these astronomical elements reached Jewish scholars and materialized in the extant manuscripts from Qumran. The suggestion put forward here is that in this respect these texts are analogous to Late Antique traditions in which Babylonian elements, and Greek ones, appear. For early Jewish astronomical and astrological traditions there is no reason to suppose direct contact with Babylonian scholars or direct access to cuneiform texts, as we must assume for the Greek evidence.    3.3 The Transmission of Babylonian Astronomical Material to the Greek World    [\u261e p7.49] The exact routes by which Babylonian astronomical learning was transmitted to the Greek world are not known, but different suggestions have been put forward. We probably have to reckon with different channels of transmission that were in operation, sometimes perhaps simultaneously and sometimes not. What seems certain is that it must have involved, at one time at least, direct personal contact between individual Babylonian and Greek scholars, because of the technical and mathematical astronomical requirements, and even because of the visual aspects of the manuscripts such as their layout and structure. This may have happened when Greek astronomers visited Babylonia or when Babylonian scholars travelled to the Greek world. But we do not know exactly when, where and how this happened. 77 Furthermore, once this contact was established, a continuous tradition ensured its transmission until the days of Ptolemy and later. 78 Let us briefly consider these three channels of transmission: direct contact in Babylonia, direct contact elsewhere and a continuous tradition.    [\u261e p7.50] The first two proposed channels of transmission operate on the basis of the conclusion that direct access to cuneiform sources through contact between Greek and Babylonian astronomers must have occurred. For example, if, as has been suggested, the Greek astronomer Hipparchus in the second century BCE was the main channel through which important aspects of Babylonian astronomical science were transmitted to the Greeks, he must have had personal contact with one or more Babylonian experts. Hipparchus\u2019 extensive knowledge of both the observational and theoretical parts of Babylonian astronomy, it appears, cannot be explained without him having had direct access to Babylonian sources, most notably the observational Diaries. 79 If indeed Hipparchus personally accessed astronomical cuneiform sources with the help of one or more Babylonian scholars, we do not know whether he met them in Babylonia or elsewhere.    [\u261e p7.51] Although we do not know exactly the numbers journeying, and wherefrom and whereto they did so, Babylonian scholars certainly did travel and took up residence elsewhere in the Greek world, transmitting knowledge about Babylonian astronomy and astrology along the way. Scribes who were on the move and took their professional and scientific knowledge elsewhere would have been a potent link in the diffusion of knowledge. 80 For the Hellenistic period, the status that Babylonian astronomy and astrology enjoyed in the Greek world may have facilitated the reception of travelling scribes from Babylonia by local communities: knowledge of Babylonian astronomy crossed network distance and its effect on small-world networks was ensured by the status it already had. There is some intriguing documentary evidence for the diffusion of astronomical learning from Babylonia to the Greek world. An honorary inscription from second-century BCE Larissa in Thessaly refers to a certain Antipater from Hierapolis in Seleukia as a Chaldean astronomer who had lived for a long time in Larissa and had practised his mathematical profession there. 81 We do not know what kind of astronomy or astrology this Antipater pursued, but the inscription presents concrete evidence for a \u201cChaldean\u201d astronomer/astrologer who had travelled from his native city in the Near East to a Greek city sometime in the second century BCE 82 If so, Antipater\u2019s \u201cbiography\u201d illustrates that he crossed a large network distance and established himself successfully within his new social network, as testified by the honorary inscription. How exactly he crossed this distance, through what channels and through what connecting localities, we do not know. 83 There is in any case no reason to assume that this Antipater from Hierapolis was the only astronomer to have moved away from his original social network. There were, no doubt, others like him who travelled to the Greek world (for the suggestion that astronomers from Uruk were among them, see section 3.1 above). 84    [\u261e p7.52] In addition to these two channels of transmission of Babylonian astronomy to the Greek world via direct contact, a third one presupposes a continuous tradition once Babylonian science had been taken elsewhere. The use of Babylonian predictive schemes in the time of Ptolemy (second century CE) cannot be explained by direct contact with Babylonian scholars or direct access to cuneiform sources (Ptolemy received this information via Hipparchus). 85 A second-century CE fragmentary papyrus from Oxyrhynchus (P. Oxy 4139) has a reference to a lunar period scheme according to the Babylonian System A lunar theory and seems to refer to the Orchenoi (\u201cpeople of Uruk\u201d; line 8), indicating the diffusion of this Babylonian tradition. 86    Considering the moment of \u201cfirst contact,\u201d elements of Babylonian mathematical astronomy will have been transmitted to the Greek world directly from cuneiform into Greek, via personal contact with Babylonian astronomers, either in Babylonia or elsewhere. The Jewish world, on the other hand, as argued above, encountered some elements of Babylonian non-mathematical astronomy indirectly via the medium of the Aramaic language. We thus need to differentiate between channels for the westward transmission of Babylonian astronomy and astrology in their varied forms: directly from cuneiform into Greek and indirectly via Aramaic.    4. The Transmission of Babylonian Astronomical and Astrological Learning to the Jewish World    [\u261e p7.53] In order to explain the Babylonian origins of some astronomical and astrological elements in early Jewish texts, we need not envisage direct access to cuneiform sources in Babylonian centres of learning. The Jewish evidence differs markedly from the Greek evidence, where such direct contact must be presumed. In addition to the different levels of learning displayed by the Babylonian, Greek and Jewish evidence, we should again consider the textual similarities between Jewish and Babylonian texts.    [\u261e p7.54] The Hebrew Qumran calendar texts (4Q320\u2013321a) describe a consistent pattern of days between two phenomena from which it is clear that these phenomena are connected with the lunar cycle. This pattern has been explained by taking recourse to the Lunar Three scheme from Late Babylonian non-mathematical astronomical texts (see section 2.1 above), but this interpretation is not without difficulties. 87 Even if it would be certain that some elements of the Late Babylonian Lunar Three scheme were behind the Qumran calendar texts, these have been reworked in such a manner that there is no direct connection with actual Lunar Three texts.    [\u261e p7.55] Likewise, we need not suppose that the Aramaic Astronomical Book is a direct translation or rendering of cuneiform sources. 88 First, the texts do not look the same: En\u016bma Anu Enlil is shorter and more formulaic. 89 Second, similarities between the texts are of a structural rather than a specific nature. 90 As soon as a few astronomical and arithmetic principles from En\u016bma Anu Enlil Tablet 14 were understood it would not have been difficult to transmit that knowledge further. One need not assume further direct access to the text of En\u016bma Anu Enlil itself. This also applies to the linear zigzag function that is rooted in the type of astronomy of En\u016bma Anu Enlil and Mul.Apin. The occurrence of such principles alone in texts from other periods and from other cultural realms need not assume direct access to the cuneiform sources in Babylonia. Once such learning was carried elsewhere by scribes trained in it, those principles may have become part of a continuous tradition through which other individuals gained access to it, either through contact with travelling scribes or further down the chain of transmission via other individuals who equally no longer had access to the cuneiform texts.    [\u261e p7.56] The astrological texts from Qumran (4Q186 and 4Q318) also do not presuppose direct access to cuneiform sources or direct contact with Babylonian scholars. Moreover, the zodiac names in 4Q318 and the reference to the horoscope in 4Q186 point to Hellenistic traditions (see section 2.1 above). In this respect, these texts are analogous to Late Antique traditions in which Babylonian and Greek elements appear (see section 3.2 above). Knowledge of the zodiac did not therefore reach Jewish Palestine directly via access to cuneiform sources. If we take the evidence for the Hellenistic origin of the zodiac names in 4Q318 into account, perhaps the chain of transmission went via Aramaic to Greek and back again, or, after the zodiac was already appropriated by the Greeks, via Greek to Aramaic, through which Jews in Palestine may have encountered it in the second or first century BCE and also translated it into Hebrew. 91    [\u261e p7.57] The textual similarities between Jewish astronomical and astrological texts of the Hellenistic and early Roman periods and first millennium cuneiform sources from Babylonia are not of such a nature to suppose that the former are a direct translation or rendering of the latter. The similarities are \u2018structural\u2019 rather than specific. They concern general notions or motifs, rather than technical or specific data or visual layout and structure, as with evidence from the Greek world. 92    [\u261e p7.58] Whether we should see this Jewish tradition as popular or elite depends on the perspective taken. In their own society these Jewish scholars may have been part of the elite, but given the enormous difference between this learning and the advanced mathematical astronomy that was exchanged between Babylonian and Greek scholars at that time, the Jewish scholars probably were not part of that same scholarly network.    [\u261e p7.59] Regarding the assumption that Jewish scholars had direct access to Babylonian learning, we cannot simply invoke the Babylonian \u201cstream of tradition\u201d as a fixed and stable entity available everywhere, 93 into which Jewish individuals could simply have tapped, almost at will, at certain moments in history, such as during the Babylonian exile or thereafter. Recent research on a number of cuneiform scholarly collections indicate that the \u201cstream of tradition\u201d was not simply present everywhere and available to everyone. The production, transmission and dissemination of scholarly knowledge and texts was conditioned by specific circumstances, thus affecting the concrete manifestations of the Babylonian \u201cstream of tradition\u201d at certain places and times. 94 In addition, prohibitions on tablet movement expressed through secrecy formulae, which appear as important topoi in the colophons of scholarly texts, may not have been absolute, 95 but some form of boundary maintenance with regard to literary and scholarly texts did seem to have been in effect in Babylonia, limiting the accessibility and mobility of scientific knowledge.    [\u261e p7.60] Furthermore, the impression gained from cuneiform texts from the second half of the first millennium BCE in Babylonia is one of Babylonian urban elites who seemed reluctant to acknowledge the role of Aramaic and instead kept to traditional cuneiform as the sole official culture of Babylonia. The evidence is skewed because the cuneiform texts serve the self-interests of the Babylonian elite, conjuring up a view of Babylonia as an entirely cuneiform culture (see sections 3.1 and 3.2 above). However, from such an assessment we cannot infer that despite the Babylonian elite\u2019s self-interest and their preoccupation with their self-understanding amid a changing world there must have been a considerable body of Babylonian Aramaic literature and scholarship, all evidence of which subsequently was suppressed or must have vanished.    [\u261e p7.61] While the prestige of Babylonian astronomy facilitated the reception of Babylonian astronomers in the Greek world (see section 3.3 above), there may perhaps have been a similar effect in some cases with regard to Greek culture in the Babylonian world. 96 The Babylonian urban elite, with its thoroughly cuneiform culture and identity, seems to have positioned itself differently with regard to Greek culture and language than it did with regard to Aramaic culture and language. Some Babylonians learned Greek and participated in Greek scholarly networks. 97 This is not only illustrated by evidence for the direct transmission of advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy to the Greek world, but also by Berossus and the so-called Graeco-Babyloniaca. The Graeco-Babyloniaca tablets (Akkadian written in Greek characters) from around the turn of the Common Era demonstrate that native Babylonians, students in this case, knew Greek. 98 Berossus represents a fascinating example of a native Babylonian who aimed to present his culture to the wider Hellenistic world beyond the community of traditional Babylonian learning and therefore wrote in Greek. 99 That he wrote in Greek and not in Aramaic seems significant. Of course, this was motivated by his wish to address a Greek-speaking audience, but this is precisely why it seems significant that he wrote in Greek. When some members of the Babylonian urban elite opened up, so to say, it was to Greek culture and language, something they had apparently not done in a similar manner earlier in the context of the Persian Empire with regard to the Aramaic language in relation to astronomy and astrology, Aramaic being only the vernacular. 100 Greek culture and language may have enhanced the self-esteem and identity of Babylonian elites, which Aramaic presumably did not in first-millennium BCE Babylonia. 101 In the Hellenistic period, therefore, the available sources seem to indicate that some of the Babylonian elite had an active interest in disseminating elements of their culture to non-Babylonians\u2014but not just to any non-Babylonians.    [\u261e p7.62] While the evidence for the involvement of non-Babylonians in Babylonian science is meagre at best, the transmission of Babylonian astronomy to the Greek world and the cases of Berossus and the Graeco-Babyloniaca seem to suggest a different attitude among members of the Babylonian elite toward the Greeks. These considerations argue against the assumption that Babylonian elites would have been actively involved in transmitting some of their astronomical knowledge to Jews who were, relatively, only quite recently in their midst, 102 as opposed to the Aramaeans who settled there earlier but against whom, it appears, it was possible to maintain a persistent sense of difference up until the Hellenistic period (even if we assume Jews to have been part of a general Aramaic milieu). 103 It seems unlikely that in Babylonia, where impressive developments took place in mathematical astronomy from the mid-first-millennium BCE onward, Babylonian scholars would have engaged in the transmission of older forms of their astronomy to local Jews or more recent insights if the Lunar Three scheme should indeed be seen as having influenced Qumran calendar texts.    [\u261e p7.63] Of course, we may posit all sorts of suppositions: that there must already have been a whole body of Babylonian literature and scholarship in Aramaic in the first millennium BCE; that Jews must have been active in administrative functions; that they knew cuneiform; and that they had access to Babylonian cuneiform literature and scholarship. But there is no evidence for this and also no reason to assume such conditions in order to explain the Jewish evidence for scholarly traditions. If we take the actual Babylonian elements into account, these amount to features that do not presuppose direct access to cuneiform sources. The connecting chains of early Jewish astronomical and astrological traditions were probably much more remote from the centres of Babylonian science than previously assumed. All this does not deny the Babylonian origins of elements in early Jewish astronomical and astrological traditions, but it does highlight that these were encountered via different channels and agents than the transmission of Babylonian astronomical science to the Greek world. The transmission of cuneiform culture in Aramaic in Late Antiquity may suggest one such different trajectory.    [\u261e p7.64] So how did Jewish scholars become acquainted with some of the learning originating with Babylonian scholars? What network connections and channels of transmission can we suggest for Jewish scholars to have gained access to certain elements of Babylonian learning? Bearing in mind the three possible channels of transmission to the Greek world (see section 3.3 above), the one channel of transmission ruled out on the basis of the evidence available is that of direct contact in Babylonia between Jewish and Babylonian scholars. This leaves us with two possibilities, namely directly via contact with travelling scribes outside Babylonia or indirectly via a continuous tradition that had been transmitted to various localities through such travelling scholars. It is impossible to be specific as to the exact channels, localities and agents of transmission, as concrete evidence is lacking, but we might venture a hypothesis.    [\u261e p7.65] Two possible historical contexts seem to present themselves for obvious\u2014but different\u2014reasons: the Neo-Assyrian period and the Neo- and Late-Babylonian periods. Once we realize that for the \u201chow\u201d we need not assume direct contact, it is unnecessary to limit the cultural transfer of Mul.Apin and En\u016bma Anu Enlil type of astronomy to the Neo-Babylonian period or later. 104 Moreover, elements of Babylonian as well as Greek astronomical and astrological learning will have been transmitted at different moments in history, but there is no reason to think of these as clearly separate waves. 105 Logical necessity and historical sequence are not always identical in the history of science. 106 Thus, the older type of Enochic astronomy was used and slightly updated in Hebrew texts (4Q317, 4Q503 and possibly 4Q334) at a time when presumably other lunar schemes were also appropriated in the second century BCE (see section 2.1 above).    [\u261e p7.66] Only in the Neo-Assyrian period do we find evidence, at least in correspondence between scholars and the king, for the use of Aramaic in scholarly settings. The Neo-Assyrian period may thus have been conducive for the transmission of elements of cuneiform astronomical learning into Aramaic, from whence Aramaic became the medium for further diffusion of this material. This may have happened at the centres of learning, or perhaps at more provincial or peripheral localities. In addition, international scholars at the Neo-Assyrian court may have taken such traditions with them on their travels and transmitted elements of them into Aramaic along the way. Via such an indirect trajectory and through various points in between it may have reached Jews in Palestine sometime in the Hellenistic period, or perhaps already in the Persian period. As with the Late Antique evidence, we need not assume direct contact to explain the early Jewish evidence and can thus allow for a certain amount of time for such a hypothesized continuous tradition and for some of its elements to have materialized in the Aramaic Astronomical Book and Enochic astronomy.    [\u261e p7.67] If we posit the Neo- or Late-Babylonian periods as the historical context for this diffusion, the Aramaic Astronomical Book from Qumran is evidence for the transmission of Babylonian learning via the medium of Aramaic in first-millennium BCE Babylonia. This transmission probably did not happen in a direct manner such that Jews learned this type of astronomy through personal interaction with Babylonian or Assyrian scholars in their centres of learning. There being no reason to see the origin of the Aramaic Astronomical Book in the eastern Diaspora, it should be considered a Jewish Palestinian text. It is, therefore, not necessary to posit Babylonia as the place where the actual transmission to Jewish individuals must have occurred. 107    [\u261e p7.68] The astrological texts from Qumran seem to point to a different channel of transmission because of the Hellenistic astrological elements alongside a Babylonian one in the case of 4Q318 and probably 4Q186. These texts do not presuppose direct contact with cuneiform sources or Babylonian scholars, but may point to a more vague, continuous tradition of astronomical and astrological lore, analogous to Late Antique traditions (see above in this section). As for the Qumran calendar texts, if indeed these did have elements of the Late-Babylonian Lunar Three scheme as their model of inspiration, it seems significant that we find them rendered directly in Hebrew rather than Aramaic. 108 This argues against direct access to cuneiform sources and contact with Babylonian scholars.     5. Conclusion    [\u261e p7.69] Contrary to what is often assumed, 109 there is no evidence to suggest that during the first millennium BCE Jewish scholars had direct access to Babylonian centres of higher learning, such as the temples in Neo- and Late-Babylonian times, where they interacted with Babylonian astronomers and were able to read with their help cuneiform astronomical texts and appropriate such learning.    [\u261e p7.70] We should no longer think of a disembodied Babylonian \u201cstream of tradition\u201d that was simply out there and available and which individual representatives of Jewish tradition could have accessed effortlessly. Considering cultural encounters between Jews and Babylonians, there would have been different aspects involved and different levels of interaction to reckon with. Explanations for the appropriation of motifs from Gilgamesh, for acquaintance with Nabonidus traditions, for the reception of legal formulas or for the transmission of astronomical and astrological traditions should not be lumped together indiscriminately as being the result of direct access to elite Babylonian learning. In our approach we need to distinguish between different kinds of texts and traditions and differentiate between various channels and agents of transmission.    [\u261e p7.71] Regarding the transmission of Babylonian astronomical and astrological material to the Jewish world, we have considered the transmission of advanced Babylonian mathematical astronomy into Greek sources, which suggests high-level contact between Greek and Babylonian scholars, either in Babylonia or elsewhere, or, at a later date when direct contact would not have been possible anymore, through a continuous tradition. Jewish scholars, at least as far as our sources are concerned (setting aside indirect testimonies, such as Abraham being an astronomical teacher, or the Daniel narratives presenting a Jewish sage at the Babylonian court), were not part of that same high-level network: the Jewish sources testify to a different level of scholarship. Future research should therefore look for network connections at other places than the centres of Babylonian learning, as has often been the case. Nor should we perceive of the transmission of Babylonian astronomical and astrological material to Second Temple period Palestine as having taken place in a direct manner but rather through various intermediaries, Aramaic and other channels, as well as via a\u2014more vague\u2014continuous tradition.    [\u261e p7.72] Via such indirect channels, elements of Babylonian and Greek astronomical and astrological learning reached certain people and certain places in Jewish Palestine, at least those at Qumran and the movement behind the Dead Sea Scrolls. Regarding these people, one might suggest that they formed a rather closed network, which was not particularly interested in current developments in the outside world. However, the scientific material shows otherwise, indicating a degree of openness to scholarly learning from other traditions. The different level of learning in comparison with contemporary Babylonian and Hellenistic astronomy suggests that although \u201cQumran\u201d was connected, it was not as well connected to those scholarly networks that participated in the transmission of knowledge between Babylonia and Greek culture in Greece, Egypt and elsewhere in the Hellenistic world.    [\u261e p7.73] In the centuries after the turn of the era things may have been different in terms of \u201chigh-level\u201d contact between Jewish and Babylonian elites, 110 but these data cannot be anachronistically projected backward into the first millennium BCE Jewish participation in society may simply have been different in those changed historical contexts. 111 The times of Medieval and especially early Modern Europe were still far away. 112      [\u261e endnote-chapter7-1] 1 In this article I develop further some of the arguments in my \u201cThe Emergence of Aramaic and Hebrew Scholarly Texts: Transmission and Translation of Alien Wisdom,\u201d in The Dead Sea Scrolls: Transmission of Traditions and Production of Texts (ed. S. Metso, H. Najman, and E. Schuller; Leiden: Brill, 2010), 81\u2013114.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-2] 2 This relates to primarily indirect evidence in ancient sources that has been adduced to support such inferences; one can think of the portrayal of Daniel\u2019s position at the Neo-Babylonian court. See, for example, the discussion and references in Jonathan Ben-Dov, Head of All Years: Astronomy and Calendars at Qumran in their Ancient Context (Leiden: Brill, 2008), 266, 270-275. See also Henryk Drawnel, The Aramaic Astronomical Book (4Q208-4Q211) from Qumran: Text, Commentary, and Translation (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 51, 53, 70, 301, 304, and the contribution by James VanderKam in this volume.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-3] 3 Regarding the concept of science in Antiquity, I am not interested in any normative evaluations about whether the ancient learning we encounter in these texts should properly be called \u201cscience.\u201d Science is not detached from social reality. It is to a degree a historically defined activity conducted by people in different contexts. What counts as scientific knowledge may differ over time and place depending on context; see, e.g., David N. Livingstone, Putting Science in Its Place: Geographies of Scientific Knowledge (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2003); Mladen Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body: Physiognomics and Astrology in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Hellenistic-Early Roman Period Judaism (Leiden: Brill, 2007), 211-213; Eleanor Robson, \u201cEmpirical Scholarship in the Neo-Assyrian Court,\u201d in The Empirical Dimension of Ancient Near Eastern Studies / Die empirische Dimension altorientalischer Forschungen (ed. G.J. Selz and K. Wagensonner; Vienna: Lit, 2011), 603-629. If need be, working definitions for ancient science can be given; see, e.g., Philip S. Alexander, \u201cEnoch and the Beginnings of Jewish Interest in Natural Science,\u201d in this volume; Francesca Rochberg, The Heavenly Writing: Divination, Horoscopy, and Astronomy in Mesopotamian Culture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004); Ben-Dov, Head of All Years ; Rita Watson and Wayne Horowitz, Writing Science before the Greeks: A Naturalistic Analysis of the Babylonian Astronomical Treatise Mul.Apin (Leiden: Brill, 2011). The choice of what count as scientific texts here has been made pragmatically and is determined by specific Jewish texts and their Babylonian \u201ccounterparts.\u201d To a certain extent, the demarcation between various kinds of texts is, of course, arbitrary. In this article I do not include, for example, magical texts, although elements that we might denote as magical also play a role in some of the texts under consideration here; see Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 51\u201354, 234-237; idem, \u201cAstrologische und magische Traditionen im antiken Judentum und die Texte vom Toten Meer,\u201d in Qumran aktuell: Texte und Themen der Schriften vom Toten Meer (ed. S. Beyerle and J. Frey; Biblisch-Theologische Studien 120; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 2011), 111-136 (112-113, 127-131). Furthermore, if we take into account the people that worked with these texts, demarcations are also to a certain extent arbitrary: there is evidence that different specialists in Mesopotamia worked on diverse and distinct disciplines, but there is also evidence that learned disciplines were not always nicely divided between different types of specialists. We need to look at specific historical contexts to determine whether demarcations were upheld and to what extent, and ask what this means for the dissemination and transmission of learned knowledge in that particular context. With regard to Jewish scholars or scientists in Hellenistic and early Roman Palestine, we have no comparative evidence about different kinds of scholars being responsible for different types of learning, although some such distinctions may be hypothesized; see the discussion and references in Popovi\u0107, \u201cThe Emergence of Aramaic and Hebrew Scholarly Texts,\u201d 106\u20138.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-4] 4 For the possibility that the numbers and fractions used in the Aramaic Levi Document reflect a Babylonian-type sexagesimal numeral system, see Henryk Drawnel, An Aramaic Wisdom Text from Qumran: A New Interpretation of the Levi Document (Leiden: Brill, 2004), 280-293. See also Ben-Dov, Head of All Years , 254; Popovi\u0107, \u201cThe Emergence of Aramaic and Hebrew Scholarly Texts,\u201d 106\u20137.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-5] 5 It is a moot point whether the scientific manuscripts from Qumran are representative for Jewish scholarship in general at the time or more typical for the movement behind the Dead Sea Scrolls. We know all ancient Jewish scientific literature, except the Enochic, only via the Qumran corpus. I assume that Jews outside this specific movement were also acquainted with this type of knowledge. The dates for some of the Aramaic Astronomical Enoch manuscripts predate the settlement at Qumran and indicate scholarly activity elsewhere and outside of that specific movement. Some of the other scholarly texts may likewise have circulated also outside of that movement; see Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 8-11.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-7] 7 The temporal horizon of the Jewish texts is determined by the dates of the manuscripts from Qumran; these range broadly from the third century BCE to the first century CE.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-10] 10 Ben-Dov, Head of All Years , 161-167, 182-183, 245-246 suggests that the Jewish 364-day year tradition actually goes back to an intercalation passage in Mul.Apin that implies the same number, but was never implemented in the actual astronomical models and soon after the seventh century BCE yielded to more accurate numbers. In Jewish astral science as we find it in the Qumran texts, however, the 364-day year model became the cornerstone of Enochic cosmological learning.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-17] 17 There is no evidence for astrology in the Aramaic text 4Q561; see Popovi\u0107, \u201cThe Emergence of Aramaic and Hebrew Scholarly Texts,\u201d 102. 4Q561 (copied in either the first or the second half of the first century BCE) is a physiognomic catalogue that listed the physical descriptions of different types of people. There is some evidence that the text originally listed prognostics for each physiognomic type. Generally speaking, the physiognomic traditions of Babylonia and Greece are different. Babylonian physiognomics was principally a divinatory art that predicted people\u2019s future on the basis of their physical characteristics. Graeco-Roman physiognomics was by and large concerned with the discernment of people\u2019s characters, whereas the predictive function was minimal. The evidence for predictions in 4Q561 seems, therefore, to suggest Babylonian influence. But matters are not as clear-cut, because Babylonian physiognomics also seems to have been partially concerned with the discernment of character, and the case of Polemo of Laodicea (second century CE) demonstrates that Graeco-Roman traditions were also familiar with the predictive possibilities of physiognomics. See Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 69\u201371, 111-112; Simon Swain (ed.), Seeing the Face, Seeing the Soul: Polemon\u2019s Physiognomy from Classical Antiquity to Medieval Islam (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007).

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-20] 20 Maybe the composition should be dated to the fourth century already, although I see insufficient reason to assume a date for the Astronomical Book that much earlier than the manuscript evidence of 4Q208, especially since it is debatable whether the Aramaic Enoch manuscripts from Qumran should be equated with the Astronomical Book from Ethiopic Enoch; see the references in n. 12 above for a discussion of these issues.

Previously I assumed that this absence of evidence does not imply evidence for the lack of ephemerides and almanacs, but I also emphasized that complex mathematical-astronomical knowledge was not a prerequisite for practising astrology. Now I also tend to emphasize that the absence of evidence should caution us not to tacitly assume that Jewish scholars would have had access to resources such as ephemerides and almanacs.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-27] 27 The astrological texts from Qumran represent learning that is different with regard to the heptadic-based model from Enochic astronomy and its offshoots and the calendric texts from Qumran. The notion of the zodiac is another crucial difference. The zodiac is absent in early Enochic astronomy.

There is no reason to think that Aristotle made any such request to Callisthenes. More likely, Aristotle\u2019s reference in De caelo to observational data from the Babylonians set commentators thinking how the information could have been obtained, and one obvious hypothesis, it seems, was that Callisthenes supplied it, although this ignores the reference to the Egyptians.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-32] 32 Strabo, Geogr. 16.1.6, refers to the Orchenoi and the Borsippenoi as classes of Chaldean astronomers. In the same passage, Strabo also refers to individual Chaldean astronomers: Kidenas, Naburianus, Sudines and Seleucus of Seleuceia. For a brief discussion of individual astronomers known by name to Graeco-Roman authors as Chaldean astronomers, see Jones, \u201cEvidence for Babylonian Arithmetical Schemes,\u201d 88\u201389; Geller, \u201cThe Last Wedge,\u201d 49; Tom Boiy, Late Achaemenid and Hellenistic Babylon (Leuven: Peeters, 2004), 297 n. 24. See also below in section 3.3 for an inscription from Larissa in Thessaly that refers to a certain Antipater from Hierapolis as a Chaldean astronomer. Of course, there are numerous references to the \u201cChaldeans\u201d and their skills in Greek and Latin sources, but they function more often than not as stock characters for authors to talk about astrologers or their skills. Not much specific information as to the transmission of their learning or in what respect it was of Babylonian origin can be gleaned from these sources. The references to the expulsion of \u201cChaldeans\u201d from Rome indicate that they were regarded as undesirable for various reasons at various times, but these references hardly give us specific data as to the concrete people and circumstances involved.

Steele, \u201cVisual Aspects of the Transmission of Babylonian Astronomy and its Reception into Greek Astronomy,\u201d Annals of Science 68 (2011): 453-465.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-34] 34 For example, Ptolemy of Alexandria, Almagest 3.7, refers to records of ancient observations from the beginning of the reign of the Babylonian king Nabonassar (747\u2013734 BCE) that had been preserved down to his own time, and to which Ptolemy claimed to have had access, although no further information about them is provided, nor how Ptolemy accessed them and in what language.

Steele, \u201cApplied Historical Astronomy: An Historical Perspective,\u201d Journal for the History of Astronomy 35 (2004): 337-355 (338-346). See also Christopher B.F. Walker, \u201cAchaemenid Chronology and the Babylonian Sources,\u201d in Mesopotamia and Iran in the Persian Period: Conquest and Imperialism 539-331 BC (ed. J.

Presenting astral learning also as revealed knowledge (Methuselah learned everything through the angels of God), Pseudo-Eupolemus shares a topos with Babylonian sources. See, e.g., Wilfred G. Lambert, \u201cA Catalogue of Texts and Authors,\u201d JCS 16 (1962): 59\u201377; Beate Pongratz-Leisten, Herrschaftswissen in Mesopotamien: Formen der Kommunikation zwischen Gott und K\u00f6nig im 2. und 1. Jahrtausend v. Chr. (Helsinki: The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 1999), 293-295; Rochberg, Heavenly Writing , 181-185, 215. The Genesis Apocryphon from Qumran Cave 1 also emphasizes Abraham\u2019s wisdom and learning, pointing out that the pharaoh\u2019s officials visited him to seek out his wisdom, as well as his wife. The Genesis Apocryphon possibly also refers more specifically to Abraham\u2019s astronomical wisdom, as he is said to have read to the Egyptian officials from the book of the words of Enoch (1QapGen ar 19:24\u201325). Josephus remarks that astronomical learning derived from the Chaldeans ( Ant. 1.168). Philo admits as much, but explains Abraham\u2019s emigration from Ur allegorically as a rejection of astrology ( Abraham 68\u201384; Migration 176\u2013187; cf. also Heir 96\u201399; Josephus, Ant. 1.155\u2013157). Likewise, Jub 12:16\u201318 has Abraham observing the stars before leaving Ur and his astrological interests behind. Some of these passages reflect an ancient discourse on the origins of astronomy/astrology, putting Abraham, via Enoch, forward as a Jewish culture hero. See brief discussion and references in Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 225-226. The discourse on the origins of astronomy/astrology was in itself part of the wider debate about the priority of cultures and about which culture was dependent on which. See, e.g., Geert De Breucker, \u201cBerossos between Tradition and Innovation,\u201d in The Oxford Handbook of Cuneiform Culture (ed. K. Radner and E. Robson; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 637-657 (650).   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-36] 36 See n. 35 above.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-37] 37 The literature on Social Network Analysis theory is enormous, and it mostly concentrates on the study of the present, using statistical data. However, Social Network Analysis theory has also begun to be used for earlier periods of history. See, e.g., Peter S.

See Zadok, \u201cThe Representation of Foreigners,\u201d 482-484.

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-67] 67 This assessment may distract rather than explain. It is not meant as a normative observation but rather to indicate that Late Antique Babylonian sources do not transmit advanced mathematical astronomy but instead the divinatory astrological traditions. It is readily admitted that one goes with the other, as it did in first millennium BCE Babylonia and in Hellenistic astronomy and astrology, as in the case of Ptolemy. At the same time, when we find the divinatory side of the coin, we need not always presuppose knowledge of the technical and mathematical astronomical requirements. A telling example from the modern world comes from present-day India, which vividly shows how traditional horoscopy is practiced without mathematical astronomical knowledge; see Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 162-163.   [\u261e endnote-chapter7-68] 68 See Westenholz, \u201cThe Graeco-Babyloniaca Once Again,\u201d 308. The situation of Late Antique Babylonian astrological literature is actually somewhat more complex, as some of the sources of these texts are not just Babylonian, but also Greek; see Popovi\u0107, Reading the Human Body , 37, 111. Aage Westenholz\u2019s remark is directed at the medical, astrological and magical traditions reflected in the Talmud and the Mandaic texts from Late Antiquity, arguing that these do not derive \u201cdirectly\u201d from scholarly cuneiform tablets. The case with the texts from Qumran is different in that those texts are not examples of \u201cpopular\u201d culture but of a different level of scholarly culture than that of cuneiform culture at the time. The point, however, is the same: neither derives directly from cuneiform sources. For the early Jewish evidence we likewise need to posit indirect channels of diffusion (see below).

[\u261e endnote-chapter7-95] 95 It has long been debated in Assyriological studies how such secrecy and curse formulae should be understood. Recently, the pendulum seems to have swung back in the direction of the secrecy formulae being taken more or less at face value, implying that the scholarly corpora of astrologers, diviners and others were considered to be secret in principle. How this principle will have worked out in specific contexts, however, is a different matter. The notion of secrecy and especially its social functions should be further specified in its socio-cultural contexts.

Introduction to the English Edition    Some 2,500 years after the first Jews established roots in Babylon, the once-vibrant and prosperous Jewish community of Iraq has disappeared. A community that numbered close to 140,000 in the late 1940 and comprised fully one-third of Baghdad s population consisted of a mere 20 when U.S. tanks rolled into the   Iraqi  capital in 2003.   Yet as late as the 1920s and 1930s, Iraqi Jews felt the heady potential of full equality in a secular society for the first time in their long history of subordination to Muslim rulers. From  music  to politics to commerce, Jews played a major role in Iraqi society and culture. For centuries after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, Babylon was the world s epicenter of Jewish life and religion the place where the Babylonian Talmud was written and where rabbis from across the region and Europe came to learn from the most scholarly sages. But the community dissolved in the middle of the 20th century when pro-Nazi forces, Arab nationalism, and the formation of Israel led to violence against and a general sense of insecurity among Iraqi Jews, causing them to flee, mostly over the course of about a year and a half.   This book tells the story of that last generation, people who in many cases grew up with strong   patriotic  feelings but were always prepared for a future beyond Iraq's borders just in case. The storytellers of these first-person accounts vary as widely as any group of Jews does, reflecting the breadth and texture of the community: wealthy businessmen and Communists, popular musicians and reformist writers, Iraqi patriots and early Zionists. Many had close friends among the Muslims and Christians of Iraq of whom they speak warmly. They tell the tales of a people with a love for their birth country that persisted even as they were forced to leave their homes.   The story of the final decades of the Jewish community in Iraq divides into three periods. First is the period before 1939 when the Jews in Iraq saw themselves as part of the Iraqi national fiber in government, commerce, and the arts. That ended verbally with the rise of Nazi influences andviolently with the Farhoud, a pogrom against the Jews, in 1941. Second is the period between then and 1953 when increasing Nazi agitation and Arab hostility toward the new state of Israel turned most Jews into Zionists and the vast majority of the community left. The final period records an Iraq that drifted towards increasingly autocratic leadership, culminating in the sadistic dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, with the Jews often playing the role of scapegoat. Finally, the book closes with several moving retrospectives of the community from a diverse group that includes two poets, a novelist, and an Iraqi Shiite.   These stories are sometimes funny, often tragic, touching, and insightful. Readers will find that the editors, in addition to recording descriptions of daily life, have also uncovered acts of heroism, adventure, and intrigue: from the undercover Israeli agents who helped orchestrate the mass emigration of Iraqi Jews to the young Jewish state at mid-century, to those who argued for the lives of their loved ones in the brutal prisons of Saddam Hussein. What has been compiled here, ultimately, is a book about quiet bravery in times of distress and a celebration of the possibility of peace.

New York Post Review    By MICHAEL SOUSSAN November 23, 2008    \"I felt I was leaving behind the Garden of Eden,\" writes Oded Halahmy of his  expulsion from Iraq. His is just one of the fascinating testimonials in \"Iraq's  Last Jews,\" a compilation of first hand accounts by Jews who fled their Iraqi  homeland. These stories provide more than just the details of Iraq's former  Jewish community; we learn so much about that country's larger history and  culture.     At the time of the British occupation of Iraq in 1917, one third of Baghdad's  population was Jewish. An incredible statistic, given that there are only about  a dozen Iraqi Jews left there today. Of the 137,000 Jews who resided in Iraq in  the early 1940s, 124,000 had fled the country by 1952.     The book is filled with amazing characters like Baghdad-born Halahmy, who moved  to Israel in 1951, and is now a famous sculptor and art gallery owner in New  York. At his Pomegranate Gallery in SoHo, Halahmy now helps young Iraqi artists  (of all faiths) promote their work internationally.     In contrast to his positive memory of Iraq, Linda Masri Hakim, who left in  1972, after the Ba'athist regime had taken power and steadily increased its  persecution the Jewish community, still has nightmares about being stuck in  that country today. \"When I wake up, I touch my pillow and say, 'thank God I am  not in Iraq.'\" Linda says she would like to \"close the book\" on the Jews'  history in that country and \"forget about perpetuating the memory. This is my  attitude because we can't go back in the same way that European Jews could go  back to Europe after the Holocaust.\"     From the mix of idyllic and traumatic memories we get a sense of the enormous  loss Iraq itself suffered from the persecution and flight of its Jewish  community. Shiite Muslim Dhiaa Kasim Kashi writes that, from a cultural  standpoint, Iraq \"suffered a big shock when the Jews left,\" because \"all of  Iraq's famous musicians and composers were Jewish,\" as were a large portion of  its other artists. In addition, \"Jews were so central to commercial life in  Iraq that business across the country used to shut down on Saturdays because it  was the Jewish Shabbat. They were the most prominent members of every elite  profession - bankers, doctors, lawyers, professors, engineers, etc.\" In Kashi's  view, had the Jews stayed, they would have helped \"manage the country far  better\" and served as a \"moderating influence of society,\" a bulwark against  the \"extreme brand of Arab Nationalism\" embodied by Saddam Hussein, which  ultimately led the country into three devastating wars and complete economic  collapse.     If many of the individuals who fled Iraq rose to prominence thereafter, it may  be due to the exceptional richness of their heritage. They were thoroughly  integrated into the larger community and used Arabic as their main language,  they were literate and Jewish community leaders played an important role in  shaping Iraq's political destiny for centuries. Sir Sassoon Hezkel, for  example, participated in the negotiations with Winston Churchill that led the  formation of the modern Iraqi state. Knighted by the British crown, he was also  an early supporter of King Faisal I, the first Hashemite leader of Iraq. (He  later served as Faisal's minister of finance, which goes to show the level of  trust that used to exist between Iraq's Muslim and Jewish communities).     Yet \"Iraq's Last Jews\" is almost a misleading title. The story of Iraq's  prominent Christian communities is also told here. At a time when many Iraqi  Christians are suffering from renewed persecution, their proud history is both  timely and relevant for diplomats and journalists involved in that country's  transition. It is not a coincidence, for example, that the northern city of  Mosul remains the last bastion of Sunni extremism. There is a very real fear  among some of the town's Sunni population, many of whom now live in the homes  formerly occupied by expelled Jews, Kurds and Christians, that they may be  dispossessed of the ill-gotten gains they acquired under Saddam's rule.    What is it about this ancient land that had the world's major powers involved  in its destiny throughout recorded history? That is the larger question this  book addresses. The testimonies of \"Iraq's Last Jews\" serve as the narrative  threads that help to unveil layer upon layer of false assumptions and misguided  perceptions, most of which stem from news coverage devoid of historical  perspective. Even the normally well-informed New York Times columnist Thomas  Friedman thought it wise to joke, in 2003, that the US had invaded \"the  Flintstones.\" Though Friedman was obviously trying to convey the extreme  poverty he witnessed while traveling through Iraq, of all the countries the US  has ever invaded, Iraq may be the least befitting of such a simplistic analogy.  Iraq is a naturally rich country, both in resources and culture, and the  extreme poverty its civilians were reduced to under Saddam Hussein is a  historical anomaly.     \"Iraq's Last Jews\" does describe heart wrenching tragedies, but the collection  also reminds us that \"mutual respect and even friendship\" between Arabs and  Jews and Christians was \"once the norm\" in Iraq.     Having traveled extensively throughout Iraq, both before the war (as a  humanitarian worker) and after the 2003 invasion (as a journalist), I learned  more flipping through these 200 hundred pages than I imagined possible. \"Iraq's  Last Jews\" is without a doubt the most surprising and informative book about  that country's culture and history to date.     Michael Soussan teaches international relations at New York university's Center  for Global Affairs and is the author of the book Backstabbing for  Beginners: My crash course in international diplomacy.    Jewish Journal of Boston     Book Sheds Light on Iraq's Once-Thriving Jewish Population Eric Shoag Special to the Journal Wed, January 28, 2009   Iraq's Last Jews: Stories of Daily Life, Upheaval, and Escape from Modern Babylon Tamar Morad, Dennos Shasha and Robert Shasha Palgrave Macmillan, 2008.   When one thinks of Iraq, images of war, destruction and chaos come to mind. One certainly does not imagine it being home to a flourishing, vibrant and vital Jewish community.    Yet in the not- too-distant past, that is precisely what existed there, and the largely untold story of that community and its demise is the subject of the book \"Iraq's Last Jews: Stories of Daily Life, Upheaval, and Escape from Modern Babylon\". The book is part of Palgrave Macmillan's \"Studies in Oral History\" series. The story is by no means a pleasant one, but it is essential to our understanding of not only the past and present of Iraq, but also of Israel, and of the epic Jewish odyssey of the tumultuous twentieth century.   At just over two hundred pages, this unassuming volume is packed with the detailed reminiscences of ex-patriots from many different social and economic strata. Editors Tamar Morad, Dennos Shasha and Robert Shasha have trimmed the narratives skillfully to present a composite picture of a once-thriving community systematically decimated over the years by the whims of unstable governments, and the fanned flames of racism and Arab nationalism.   Many of the interviews begin with affectionate recollections of a beloved homeland lost forever: the sights, sounds, and smells of routines, relatives, friends and neighborhoods now dispersed and dismantled. Jews were an integral part of Iraqi society from the centuries it existed as part of the Ottoman Empire, through the British-Arab alliance following World War I that resulted in its creation as an independent state. King Faisal's benevolent rule over this new state fostered an atmosphere of tolerance and equality which ended abruptly with his death in 1933, after which rising anti-Jewish and Pan-Arabic sentiment led to restrictions on all phases of Jewish life, culminating in the establishment of a pro-Nazi government and a notorious deadly pogrom against the Jews known as the Farhoud in 1941.    Anti-Jewish feelings exploded to new heights in the aftermath of Israel's independence in 1948, and its subsequent victory over the Arab armies that challenged its very right to exist. This led directly to the massive emigration of Jews from Iraq to Israel in the 1950s in what came to be called Operation Ezra and Nehemiah. It is here that a book of this kind, a history told in the form of a string of first-person tales, is particularly affecting. The notion that history is made up of ordinary people's decisions is brought home in full force, particularly in the story of Shlomo Hillel, an agent of the Mossad (Israeli Secret Service) who helped organize illegal airlifts of Jews. Hillel tells of the moment of panic he experienced when he found himself in a cockpit for the first time, feeling completely in over his head, fearing imminent discovery and failure. The individual leaps of faith by people like Hillel added up to a heroic movement whereby most of Iraq's 140,000 Jews found new homes in Israel and elsewhere.   Things turn surreal and horrific in the testimonies of those who stayed in Iraq through the 1960s, when the cycle of tolerance supplanted by increasingly repressive regimes continued, leading to the domination of the sadistic Saddam Hussein, who appears in these pages in some truly foreboding and ominous encounters. Random arrests and torture became commonplace, especially after Israel's decisive victory in the Six-Day War of 1967, when Jews suddenly found themselves without jobs, their assets frozen, and even their phone service cut off.    A brutal touchstone moment came in January 1969, when a group of 15 prisoners (nine Jews) was hanged in the public square of Baghdad. This event, like the Farhoud of 1941, we see through many pairs of eyes, including those of Zuhair Sassoon, grandson of the last Chief Rabbi of Iraq, whose father was imprisoned with those who were hanged. Sassoon speaks of his shock upon seeing the bodies and identifying his father's distinctive shoes on one of them. After what \"felt like an eternity,\" he looked up to the face, which was that of a stranger. His father (released the following year) had loaned the shoes to another, less fortunate, prisoner.   Sadly, Jews themselves are not spared criticism from some interviewees, who tell of Israeli prejudices against Arab Jews, or Mizrachim, once they arrived in the Jewish State. The difficulties Mizrachim faced both in Iraq and at the hands of a largely Eastern European, or Ashkenazi, power structure in Israel is perhaps understandably avoided considering the unflattering light it shines on traditional Zionist narratives, but it should not be ignored. The once-voluminous Jewish population of Iraq has dwindled incredibly to the single digits, but thanks to this book, its story has not disappeared and the small but significant acts of kindness and heroism that punctuate this tragic tale lend it an air of humanity and hope, as well as the fact that by its mere existence, there is the opportunity to learn from the mistakes of the past and forge a brighter future both for the Jews and for the world at large.    Eric Shoag writes from Boston   Zvi Gabay's Review    Here is how it appeared originally in the Jerusalem Post:   first page   and    second page       May 27, 2009 12:18 | Updated May 28, 2009 12:41   Babylonian heritage   By ZVI GABAY   Iraq's Last Jews - Stories of Daily Life,  Upheaval and Escape from Modern Babylon     Edited by Tamar Morad, Dennis Shasha and Robert Shasha   Introduction by Prof. Shmuel Moreh Palgrave-Macmillan 211 pp., $75.99 (hardcover)    Although the Jewish community of Iraq was forced to flee, its story is rarely told, leaving the Palestinians as the only victims of the Arab-Israeli conflict.   How does one explain the reason why a prosperous community of 140,000 people, with a history and heritage of 2,600 years, uproots itself en masse, and leaves Iraq, the country which it helped modernize in all areas - government and politics, economy, medicine, education, literature, poetry and music? An explanation for this extraordinary historical phenomenon is found in Iraq's Last Jews.   This book includes testimonies of 19 Jews (men and women) as well as of an Iraqi Shi'ite, who personally experienced the events that occurred in Iraq during the last century.   The main reasons that brought about the escape of the Jews from Iraq may be summarized as follows:    the xenophobia of the nationalistic Sunni leadership, which did not tolerate minorities, including Shi'ites, Christians and Kurds, especially if they had substantial financial means and social standing;    anti-Semitism, which existed in newly independent Iraq (and in other Arab countries), which was sponsored by Nazi Germany and led by the German ambassador, Dr. Fritz Grobba, who was supported by fanatical religious leaders, such as Haj Amin el-Husseni (who escaped from Palestine under British Mandate and continued his anti-Jewish activities in Iraq).   The climax of the anti-Jewish activities in Iraq, was the Farhud - the uprising against the Jews on Shavuot of 1941 - during which 135 men, women and children were murdered, hundreds were injured and much property was looted. This uprising ultimately brought about the escape and the mass emigration of the Jews from Iraq. The longing for Zion among Iraqi Jews directed many of them to Mandate Palestine and later on to Israel, while a minority opted to immigrate to other countries such as the United States, Canada, England and Australia. Today, the number of Iraqi Jews residing in Israel is 244,000, while 40,000 are distributed elsewhere in the world.   The catastrophe of the Jews of Iraq occurred for no obvious reason. The anti-Jewish policy of its governments left them with one option - to escape and leave behind all their personal and communal property. Unlike the Palestinians, the Jews of Iraq did not wage a war against Iraq nor did the Jews in other Arab countries. They were the scapegoats of political conflict in their own countries. Israeli governments throughout the years, for reasons which are not clear, did not include this catastrophe of the Jews of Arab countries as part of their political agenda nor was it included in the educational program, as in the case of the Nakba of the Palestinians. This enabled Arab propagandists to portray the Palestinians as the only victims of the Arab-Israeli conflict.   The testimonies are personal and include a broad description of Jewish life in Iraq spanning the comfortable day-to-day life, mainly during British rule, the sufferings and persecutions once Iraq became independent and finally the escape to Eretz Yisrael, through the assistance of the Zionist underground movement, which was established after the Farhud.   They are also authentic and can be the basis for writing the history of the Jews of Iraq in the last century. The introduction, written by Prof. Shmuel Moreh, provides historical background and explains how the Jewish community survived for 2,600 years, in Babylon and later in Iraq.   The extraordinary history of Dhiaa Kassem Kashi, the young Shi'ite, who suffered from oppression in Iraq and was forced to escape in the 1980s, is a vivid example of the sufferings of the non-Sunni communities in the country. He longs for the good relations that existed between his family and his Jewish neighbors. Needless to say, there were Muslims who did not agree with the policy of hatred toward the Jews; however, their voices at the time were not heard. The Jews in Iraq suffered from the struggles between the Sunnis and Shi'ites, as today Israel is at the center of the conflict between Shi'ite Iran and Sunni Arab countries.   The timing of the publication of this book is critical, since firsthand testimonies of Jews who lived in Iraq are dwindling (two of the Jews included in the book were not fortunate enough to see its publication). In this respect, special acknowledgment should be given to the Jewish Babylonian Heritage Center in Or Yehuda, for its important work in collecting and documenting personal testimonies of Iraqi Jews.   Since the book is in English, it provides for the first time a good glimpse of the history and the plight of the Iraqi Jewish community to a broad range of readers. Many of the descendents of the Jews of Iraq in Israel and other countries reached prominent positions in a range of fields - government, economy, science and the arts - due in part to their great heritage. The book is highly recommended for readers interested in exploring this unfortunately neglected part of Jewish history.   The writer is a former ambassador and deputy director-general of the Foreign Ministry.    Review of German Translation on German Radio      Deutschlandradio Kultur   Erinnerungen an die einst bluehende juedische Kultur im Irak August 23, 2012   Audio review of Dr. Catherine Newmark was recorded using garageband and can be found    here.      Die fuer dieses Buch zusammengetragenen Zeitzeugeninterviews geben einen wunderbaren Einblick in die Geschichte der irakischen Juden im 20. Jahrhundert. Den Gespraechstexten sind hilfreiche kurze historische Einleitungen vorangestellt. Seit dem babylonischen Exil vor rund 2.500 Jahren leben Juden im Irak, Ueber Jahrhunderte war die dortige Gemeinde eine der wichtigsten. Um 1940 zaehlte sie mehr als 130.000 Menschen und machte ein Drittel der Bevoelkerung Bagdads aus, Juden waren wichtige Stuetzen der irakischen Gesellschaft.    Mit den Unabhaengigkeitskaempfen des Irak von der Mandatsmacht Grossbritannien, dem arabischen Nationalismus und dem Einfluss des Nationalsozialismus verstaerkte sich ab den 1930ern der Antisemitismus; 1941 kam es zum sogenannten \"Farhoud\", einem zweitaegigen Pogrom, bei dem 170 Juden getoetet und viele verletzt wurden. In der Folge dieser Ereignisse sowie auch des Zionismus und des nach der Staatsgruendung Israels 1948 verschaerften juedisch-arabischen Konflikts begannen Juden, aus dem Irak zu fliehen. Von 1950 bis 1951 verliessen in einem Massenexodus mehr als 120.000 Juden das Land in Richtung Israel. Heute leben nur noch weniger als ein Dutzend Juden im Irak.    Die Geschichte der orientalischen Juden ist im Okzident wenig bekannt, und auch in Israel waren die Misrachim, die Juden aus den arabischen Laendern, lange eine kulturelle Minderheit, die von der aschkenasischen Mehrheitsgesellschaft wenig Beachtung und manchmal auch Verachtung erfuhr. Im juedisch-arabischen Konflikt, in dem sie aufgrund ihrer \"arabischen\" Herkunft auch haetten vermitteln koennen, gerieten sie oft zwischen alle Fronten.    Das Buch \"Iraks letzte Juden\" gibt nun einen wunderbaren Einblick in die Geschichte der irakischen Juden im 20. Jahrhundert. Es besteht aus Interviews mit bedeutenden Zeitzeugen, die durch hilfreiche kurze historische Einleitungen eingefuehrt werden. Den Anfang machen Erinnerungen an die Zeit vor dem Exil, an die widerspruechliche Existenz als Minderheit in einem arabischen Land zwischen Eingebundenheit und Diskriminierung, und die Bedeutung, die die juedische Gemeinde fuer das Land hatte.    So erfaehrt man, dass fast die gesamte irakische Musikszene in juedischer Hand war (das 1936 gegruendet \"Iraqi Broadcasting Authority Orchestra\" war bis auf einen einzigen Musiker ausschliesslich juedisch besetzt) und dass auch heute noch fast alle traditionelle irakische Musik von juedischen Komponisten stammt.    Ein weiteres Kapitel ist der Flucht und Vertreibung gewidmet, wichtige Figuren wie Shlomo Hillel und Mordechai Ben Porat, welche federfuehrend die Luftbruecke organisierten, mit der in tausend Fluegen die Juden Anfang der 1950er Jahre den Irak verliessen, kommen zu Wort, sie erzaehlen von den dramatischen und hoechst improvisierten Verhandlungen und Geheimdienstaktivitaeten, mit denen dies ermoeglicht wurde.    Auch die Schwierigkeiten der Fluechtlingsmassen, in Israel ganz neu zu beginnen, werden geschildert, und zuletzt erfaehrt man auch vom Leben der wenigen im Irak verbliebenen Juden, die nach dem Sechstagekrieg 1967 schwersten Verfolgungen ausgesetzt waren und ab 1979, wie andere Minderheiten auch, ganz besonders unter der Schreckensherrschaft von Saddam Hussein litten.    Mit ihrer Fuelle von faszinierenden Details (so liest man, wie die Ehefrau eines verhafteten Juden mehrfach bis zu Saddam Hussein persoenlich vordringt, der sie im Hausrock empfaengt) bilden die vielen persoenlichen Erinnerungen in ihrer Gesamtheit eine unglaublich dichte und spannende Geschichte des Irak im 20. Jahrhundert, aus der Sicht einer seiner Minderheiten. Eine Minderheit, die auch mehr als ein halbes Jahrhundert nach ihrem Exil noch Sehnsucht nach ihrer alten Heimat empfindet - auch dies ein anruehrender Aspekt, der aus vielen Erzaehlungen deutlich wird.

Von Alexander Kluy   Das Buch Iraks letzte Juden ist ein wichtiges, ein bewegendes Memorial. Und ein eminentes Zeugnis. Es ist eine archaeologische Erinnerung an eine Zeit, als jeder dritte Einwohner Bagdads Jude war (1917: 202.000 Einwohner -- davon knapp 80.000 Juden); und es ist Erinnerung an eine der am laengsten existierenden Gemeinden.   Ungefaehr 2.500 Jahre lang gab es eine juedische Gemeinschaft in Babylon, in Mesopotamien, im Irak. Lange waren sie, worauf Shmuueel Moreh in seiner klugen, konzisen Einleitung verweist, politisch, wirtschaftlich und gesellschaftlich gut integriert. Bis zum abrupten Exodus im Jahr 1950, als buchstaeblich ueber Nacht im Zuge der Operation Esra und Nehemia rund 124.000 der 137.000 irakischen Juden nach Israel uebersiedelten.   ...   Das nicht zuletzt gut uebersetzte und sorgfaeltig edierte Buch inklusive Zeittafel und weiterfaehrender Literatur ist ein bewegendes, Augen oeffnendes und nicht hoch genug zu lobendes Memorial. Aehnliches wuenscht man sich ueber viele andere Diasporagemeinden.   Die Welt    December 8, 2012   http://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/literatur/article111892900/Iraks-letzte-Juden.html   Iraks letzte Juden Bagdad war eines der wichtigsten sephardischen Zentren. Heute sind die Ueberlebenden traurige Zeugen einer vergangenen Epoche Von Najem Wali   Mehr als 2500 Jahre lang haben Juden im Irak gelebt. Trotz Unterdrueckung, politischer Unruhen, Krieg und Plagen, war die juedische Gemeinde in der Lage, ihre Identitaet, Kultur und Tradition zu bewahren. Gleichwohl waren sie politisch, sozial und oekonomisch gut im Lande integriert, und durch ihre Sprache, ihre gesellschaftlichen Traditionen und ihrer Lebensweise im Wesentlichen kaum von ihren arabischen Landsleuten zu unterscheiden. Es war eine pulsierende und bluehende Gemeinde, deren Mitgliederzahl sich in den 1940er-Jahren noch auf etwa 150.000 Seelen belief (einer alten britischen Statistik zufolge sah die Verteilung folgendermassen aus: fuenf Prozent von ihnen waren reich, dreissig Prozent gehoerten der Mittelschicht an, sechzig Prozent waren arm, und fuenf Prozent waren Bettler). Allein in der irakischen Hauptstadt Bagdad zaehlte die juedische Gemeinde 130.000 Mitglieder und stellte damit ein Drittel der gesamten Bevoelkerung der Stadt. Als 2003 die amerikanischen Panzer in Bagdad einrollten, bestand die juedische Gemeinde gerade noch aus 20 Personen!   Bis zu ihrem Massenexodus im Jahre 1951 betrachteten die Juden sich selbst als Teil des Iraks und seiner Geschichte. Sie waren stolz darauf, die Erben einer grossartigen, in kultureller und geistiger Hinsicht einzigartigen Vergangenheit zu sein. Der babylonische Talmud oder auf Hebraeisch das \"Zeitalter der Dscha'unim\" oder \"Zeitalter der Genies\", bezeichnet diese vergangene Epoche, als die, in der die grossen Rabbiner und Denker aus ihren Reihen hervorgingen.   Es ist also nicht verwunderlich, wenn die irakischen Juden sich automatisch als an dem \"modernen\", im Jahr 1921 gegruendeten irakischen Staat interessierte Mitbuerger betrachteten. Zum ersten Mal in ihrer langen Geschichte unter muslimischer Herrschaft machten die Juden die Erfahrung, gleichberechtigt in einer saekularen Gesellschaft zu leben. Ab jetzt spielten sie eine herausragende Rolle in der irakischen Gesellschaft -- in der Musik, der Politik, bei Technik und im Handel. Auch der erste Finanzminister in der Regierung von Koenig Faisal, Sassoon Eskell, war Jude.   Leider war diese Euphorie, diese goldene Aera nicht von langer Dauer. Die aelteste Gemeinde im Irak musste erleben, wie Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts nazifreundliche Stroemungen, arabischer Nationalismus und die Gruendung des Staates Israels zu Gewalttaetigkeiten gegenueber irakischen Juden und zu einem allgemeinen Gefuehl der Unsicherheit unter ihnen fuehrten. Am 6. Mai 1941 fand der Farhud (irakisches Pogrom) statt, zwei gesetzlose Tage nach der Niederschlagung eines Militaerputsches unter der Fuehrung von Kolonel Raschid Ali al-Gailani, einem Freund von Hitler, der spaeter nach seiner Flucht in Berlin vom \"Fuehrer\" persoenlich empfangen wurde. Ab diesem Tag flohen immer mehr Juden aus dem Land -- die meisten im Verlauf von nur anderthalb Jahren.   Es ist erstaunlich, mit welcher Praezision alle interviewten aus dem Irak stammenden Juden in dem kuerzlich im Wallstein Verlag erschienenen Buch \"Iraks letzten Juden\", die Chronik vom Verschwinden der \u00e4ltesten Gemeinde im Irak, von ihren tragischen, aber auch gluecklichen Momenten erzaehlen. Wir lesen von Menschen, \"die nicht selten starke patriotische Gefuehle f\u00fcr ihr Land hegten, die sich aber immer f\u00fcr eine Zukunft ausserhalb der Landesgrenzen bereithielten, fuer alle Faelle.\" Da die Ich-Erzaehler, \"die im Buch zu Wort kommen, so wenig homogen sind, wie jede andere Gruppe von Juden auch\", sind deren Geschichten in drei Kategorien eingeteilt: Unter dem Titel, \"Der Irak, unser Land\", erzaehlen Menschen von ihrer \u00dcberzeugung, dass sie (oder ihre Eltern) dachten, im Irak in \"ihrem\" Land zu leben. Unter dem Titel \"Das Wagnis\" berichten andere von ihren Leistungen als Pioniere der Zionistischen Bewegung in Bagdad oder auch als Agenten fuer den israelischen Geheimdienst, dem die Organisation des damaligen Massenexodus der irakischen Juden (1946-1951) zugeschrieben wird. Im Kapitel \"Nicht laenger unser Land\" versammeln sich jene Erzaehler, die von ihrem Beharren auf das Bleiben im Irak berichten, trotz Schikanen und Verfolgungen. Die letzten von ihnen verliessen den Irak erst 1982. All diese Lebenserzaehlungen offenbaren die Vielschichtigkeit der juedischen Gemeinde -- Geschaeftsleute und Kommunisten, bekannte Musiker und Schriftsteller, irakische Patrioten  und fruehe Zionisten. Wir erfahren von Menschen, die im Irak oder spaeter in Israel, in den USA und Grossbritannien Geschichte geschrieben haben: Die Gebrueder Kuwaity, Salah und Daoud, zum Beispiel, die vielleicht beruehmtesten Musiker des Irak, die ihre Bluetezeit zwischen 1920 und 1940 hatten, und deren Lieder sich bis heute grousser Popularitaet in Irak und Kuwait erfreuen. Die Soehne von Khedouri Abdoudi Zilkha, der das erste Department-Bankensystem in der arabischen Welt gruendete, die Bank Zilkha, die 1951 in New York in Zilkha & Sohns unbenannt wurde. Shlomo Hillel, der fuenf Jahre lange -- ab 1946 -- Mossad-Agent war und die Organisation des Massenexodus der irakischen Juden geleitet hat. Richard Obadiah, der Sohn von Abdulla Obadiah, dem letzten Direktor der Frank-Iny-Schule, der letzten juedische Schule in Irak. Abdullah war bis die 1980er-Jahre einer der bekanntesten irakischen Mathematikprofessoren.   Unter seinen Studenten waren hohe Beamte mehrerer irakischer Regierungen, wie etwa der Saddams, oder der Leiter der nationalen Sicherheit in der Baath Partei, Nazim Kazzar. Von Letzterem, dem die Menschen spaeter den Spitznamen Jazzar, der Schlaechter, gaben, bekam Richard seinen Reisepass ausgehaendigt. Wir erfahren auch von den Kommunisten Salim Fatal und Sami Michael. Fatal wurde 1930 in Bagdad im armen juedischen Viertel Tatran geboren. Seiner Meinung nach sind Armut und Kommunismus die beiden verschwiegenen Kapitel der Geschichte der Juden. Sami Michael (1926 in Bagdad geboren), heute einer der populaersten israelischen Autoren, uebt sogar Kritik an den meisten Israelis, die ueber das Leben der Juden im Irak schreiben. Sie stellen die Realitaet so dar, schreibt Sami Michael, dass sie dem zionistischen Narrativ entspricht, in dem sie sagen, \"dass die zionistische Deutung ihrer Auswanderung die einzig wahre sei\". Fuer ihn ist das purer Mythos, denn \"die irakischen Juden hatten eine aehnliche Einstellung zu Palaestina wie die Juden in Amerika heute: Das Wohlergehen der Juden in Palaestina war uns wichtig, aber wir lebten gerne in unserem Land und wollten es nicht verlassen\".   Leider bedauern nur wenige Autoren im Buch wie Dhia Kachi, der 1952 in Bagdad geboren wurde, dass im Irak keine juedische Gemeinde mehr existiert: Aus zionistischer Sicht sollten ohnehin alle Juden in Israel leben; arabische Nationalisten sind auf Antisemitismus indoktriniert und viele Nachfahren der irakischen Juden wissen die der Gesellschaft, in die sie immigrierten, zu schaetzen. Trotzdem: \"Die Geschichte der irakischen Juden ist mehr als die Flucht von Verfolgten vor dem Zugriff ihrer Verfolger\".       How Do I Order A Copy?    The book is published by Palgrave Macmillan.
