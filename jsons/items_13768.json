Identical to PSYCH-UA 61  Prerequisites: NEURL-UA 100 (Intro to Neuro), and NEURL-UA 220 (Behav & Integ NS); or PSYCH-UA 001 (Intro to Psych) and PSYCH-UA 22 (Perception)  Instructor: Faculty  Semester: Fall; every other year     The objective of this course is to master the fundamental facts and concepts of perceptual psychology and sensory neuroscience, focusing on visual perception, visual neuroscience and computational neuroscience. This is an interdisciplinary field of science, crossing the boundaries between psychology, biology, physics and engineering. This course is intended for neural science majors and psychology majors that are on track for careers in science and medicine. This course is also appropriate for students in the psychology master\u2019s degree program. Topics include: neurophysiology and neuroanatomy; psychophysics; neuroimaging; linear systems theory; signal detection theory; light and the eye; physiology and anatomy of the retina; color vision; brightness and contrast; pattern and texture perception; perception of depth and size; visual motion perception; object recognition; attention and awareness.           Special Topics: Introduction to Theoretical Neuroscience  NEURL-UA 302.011 and 302.012  Prerequisites: NEURL-UA 100 (Intro to Neuro) and MATH-UA 121 (Calculus I)  Instructor: Ma  Semester: Spring  4 points      This course will introduce concepts and techniques related to the modeling of neural systems and behavior at an elementary level. The course will span the breadth of neuroscience, from ions to behavior. However, for each of those areas, we will study only one or two equations, calculations, or models in depth. We will also discuss modern applications of theoretical neuroscience. Throughout the course, we will use both math and numerical simulations. Several tutorials will be integrated into the course: on the programming language Python, scientific notation, differential equations, probability, and matrices.            Special Topics: Biology of Memory - Systems and Diseases  NEURL-UA 302.017  Prerequisites: NEURL-UA 220 (Behav & Integ NS)  Instructor: Alberini  Semester: Spring  4 points     The course will present the fundamentals of the molecular mechanisms underlying memory formation, storage and retrieval. It will discuss how these mechanisms can be used to enhance or disrupt memory storage. The course will review and discuss the most relevant and contemporary publications in the field.          Special Topics: Neuroscience, Popular Press and Government Policy  NEURL-UA 302.025  Prerequisites: NEURL-UA 100 (Intro to Neuro) and BIOL-UA 21 (Molec & Cell Bio I)  Instructor: Kaplow  Semester: Spring  4 points     The main objective of this course is to closely examine the relationship between neural science research, popular media, and government policy. Students will analyze scientific research papers and discuss the dissemination of results to the general public. Students will be assigned a scientific article in the field of neuroscience to present to the class. Students will critique both scientific journal articles and corresponding popular press articles, discussing the strengths and weakness of each article. Topics of discussion will include: How are the innovations in the field of neuroscience communicated to the public? What details are edited and filtered out when communicating neuroscience to the public? What is the right balance for communicating research and should limitations be included? What findings are typically highlighted in popular media and why? Students will also discuss the impact of neuroscience research on shaping government policy. and contemporary publications in the field.            Development and Dysfunction of the Nervous System  NEURL-UA 305  Prerequisites: NEURL-UA 100 (Intro to Neuro) and NEURL-UA 210 (Cell & Molec NB), or permission of the instructor  Instructor: Sanes  Semester: Spring  4 points     This course will explore how the nervous system develops in normal animals, and how genetic and epigenetic factors can disrupt these processes. Lectures on normal developmental mechanisms will be interleaved with those on disorders to provide a solid foundation for our discussions of abnormal events during maturation. The lectures on normal development cover a broad range of topics including differentiation, axon outgrowth, synapse formation, specificity of connections, and plasticity. The lectures on dysfunction include autism, dyslexia, mental retardation, specific language impairment, hearing loss, blindness, ADHD, demyelinating or neurodegenerative disorders, and axon regeneration. The major goals of the course will be to understand the extent to which current theories can explain the etiology of each disorder, and to learn how basic research can best facilitate advances in our knowledge and, ultimately, lead to treatments or cures.
