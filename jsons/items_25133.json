Art, Education, and Community Practice    Welcome to our new, socially oriented Art + Education program at NYU. Fall 2014 will be the first year of this innovative master's program that explores the intersections between contemporary artistic practice, educational theory, and social activism. We are looking for students who are interested in envisioning new ways that artists, educators, designers, community organizers, and social activists can work together, and within community-based settings to propose critical interventions that inspire dialogue and catalyze social change through the arts. Investigate:       What is artistic activism?    How is artistic activism similar to and different from social practice or socially engaged art?    What are the aesthetics and ethics of artistic activism?    How do we know when artistic activism is most effective, toward what ends?       Explore:       Greenwich Village and New York City, the cultural capital of the world, including world renown museums such as The New Museum, MoMA, and the Whitney Museum, along with nearby galleries in the Lower East Side and Chelsea    A comprehensive curriculum in contemporary visual art, educational theory, and social activism that combines theory with practice    A flexible program of study that can be tailored to your interests       Collaborate:       Work with practicing artists and educators in community-based and neighborhood settings around New York City    An internationally renowned and dedicated faculty from across New York University schools and programs    A richly diverse and multicultural community committed to social justice       Connect to Communities Grounded in the work of critical educational theorists including Paolo Freire and bell hooks, this program supports artists and other publicly situated activists to connect visual strategies with the needs of a community. Students learn from artists who do socially engaged work, examining how art and design can open dialogue about a community&rsquo;s history, culture, and social needs. Drawing on community organizing strategies and artistic activism, students are directly involved in putting ideas generated with the community into practice. This hands-on approach leads to a capstone project, which provides an opportunity to design and implement a community-based art project that allows for social transformation. In this program students assume major roles in changing the social, cultural, political, and economic landscape through their artistic practice. This interdisciplinary program prepares students to work within community-based settings, museums, NGOs, or broader public and civic contexts to initiate social change through the arts.    This program does not lead to certification for teaching. One-Year Program with Small Classes Classes are small and personal attention is given to each student throughout the duration of program, from initial advisement through completion of the master's final project.    The program can be completed in as little as 3 semesters or 12 months, as a full-time student. The program can also be completed as a part-time student in two years.    Enrollment    The Art, Education, and Community Practice program serves individuals interested in socially engaged art who want to work outside of or in collaboration with traditional venues (museum, gallery arena, and classrooms). Students come from a wide variety of backgrounds including studio art and design, community-based organizations, social activism, and a variety of education contexts. Graduates may also serve as artists and organizers working as educators, curators, and artists in museums, community-based organizations, and NGOs. The program will initially enroll a total of 5-7 new students in the Fall semester of each year.    For Examples of Student Work    Visit our Art, Education, and Community Practice blog .

Saturday mornings, from 10am-12pm, teens research one of four significant social themes (such as imagining the human body, street art, power and the symbol of the fist, and the water crisis) and discover a rich array of innovative, multidisciplinary approaches through which they can visually express their ideas.    Classes are taught by teams of graduate students completing their Certification in Art Education program at New York University. Together, students and teachers consider ways in which artists can and do influence society, and experiment with techniques that include drawing, painting, printmaking, video, photography, 3-dimensional media, and installation. These workshops challenge students to think outside of traditional artistic media and explore how artistic boundaries and influence can be stretched to include what has historically been excluded. As part of the program students participate in a final exhibition inviting a wide audience of parents, friends, teachers, and NYU faculty, to see their work. High School students do not need a portfolio to apply to the Saturday Art Workshop - classes are free-of-charge, and open to students with all levels of art experience! Curriculum Archive: Fall 2013 Fall 2012 Fall 2011 Fall 2010     Fall 2014 Visionary Studio Themes: Saturday Art Workshop Curriculum    Waste Not, Want Not Consumption and waste are part of our everyday lives. As a culture we produce much that we throw away, from household garbage to toxic industrial waste. Increasingly, technological waste is becoming commonplace as we upgrade our computers and other digital equipment. Since the energy crisis in 1973 the term recycling has become part of our understanding of waste. Where does our garbage go? Artists have responded to the topic in a variety of ways - by making art with recycled materials, visually documenting what happens to toxic waste, as well as raising awareness about the labor that goes behind waste management. This class will look at waste from different social, cultural and political perspectives while giving students a chance to make artwork in a variety of media. Students will each make a final work for exhibition that reflects on the concept of waste from a personal perspective. It&rsquo;s How You Say It Many visual artists play with words and language. In their work, artists explore how we learn about the world we live in and ourselves by combining visual images and text in different ways. Many visual artists experiment with language to create new ways we read or make meaning with text and image. Others play with media forms that combine image and text, such as books, visual poetry, alphabets, or advertising. Increasingly, artists are using text and image or only text to open dialogue about pertinent issues in our world. In this class, students will have a chance to see how artists play with language in a variety of ways and experiment with different forms of art that include text and language. In a culminating work for the exhibition, students will generate their own statement about the world using image and text while experimenting with different art forms such as bookmaking or advertising. Superheroes What if we had special powers that allowed us to do super-human things? What powers and possibilities have superheroes in cartoons and comic strips represented over time and how have they wielded their powers to do good or evil in the world? The superheroes we create can tell us about how we want to be in the world, but also about the problems and concerns of our society. Artist activist have used superheroes to speak about social concerns in communities and world. This class explores how artists, graphic novelists and activists have created a cast of superheroes that reflect real and imagined situations and the ways that we can change the situations to make a better world . Put it on Repeat From vinyl record covers to music videos, artists have worked with music as both subject and medium. How have artists translated sound in visual ways, and helped us see our music with fresh eyes and ears? How has technology influenced the way we make, listen to, and appreciate music and given artists new ways to help us hear and see music and sound? Artists have also used sound to address pressing issues in our society and world from issues of freedom of speech to terrorism. In this class, students will look at a range of artists who work with sound in contemporary ways, and experiment with new ways to make visual art with sound. Self-Portraits: From Rock Paintings to Selfies The selfie is the most common form of picture taking today. We all use our phones and cameras to document who we are and where we&rsquo;ve been. The self-portrait is the oldest form of art - from the first cave paintings to Facebook - humans like to make pictures of themselves! Contemporary artists have used the self portraits to address issues related to cultural identity and politics. How and why do we define ourselves through self-portraits? How and why do artists present themselves in their artwork? This class will look at the diverse ways artists address both personal and social, cultural, and political issues using self-portraits. Students will be able to explore what self-portraits mean to them in today&rsquo;s world.
