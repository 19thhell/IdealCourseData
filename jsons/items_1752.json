Virtually all your college courses require you to write papers or reports, but courses offered by the Expository Writing Program are opportunities to concentrate intensely on the process of writing. The Expository Writing Program assumes that writing is not merely a useful skill but also a way of learning and knowing. Its courses focus on the examination of evidence, the development of ideas, and the clear expression of those ideas in a variety of different kinds of essays. In these writing courses, students routinely move from exploration to argument as they read and make use of various texts\u2014written, visual, experiential\u2014to create a spectrum of persuasive essays. Examined texts become more complex, and the writing tasks more difficult, as students grapple with intriguing questions that lead to richer ideas and more interesting forms of expression. The essays students write become more formal and argumentative as the semester\u2019s work progresses. Additional information, requirements and course descriptions appear on the Expository Writing Program website.     Foreign Language The study of foreign languages is an integral part of a liberal arts education. It nurtures an awareness of the diversity of human culture and serves the practical need for language skills in fields such as government, business, and research. NYU is a particularly exciting setting for language study because of its location in a great cosmopolitan city, its international student body, its many renowned language programs and centers, and its rapidly expanding opportunities for study abroad. To fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum, students must show or attain proficiency in a foreign language through the intermediate level. Ordinarily, this is accomplished by the successful completion of two years of language study in the College, through the second semester of a regular intermediate-level language sequence (see list of courses below). Some languages are also taught in intensive courses, allowing students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year. After two years of college language study or the equivalent demonstrated proficiency, students should have gained a broad competence in a language, but true fluency of written or oral expression will not usually have been developed at this point. For this reason, all students are encouraged to continue their language study beyond the intermediate level. In particular, students studying modern languages are encouraged to immerse themselves in the living culture of a language by studying, traveling, or working abroad. Students of all languages, ancient or modern, are encouraged to continue their studies with elective courses in literature at the advanced level. Exemptions: Students may fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum by presenting outstanding scores on the SAT Subject Test or Advanced Placement Test in a foreign language, or by passing a departmental proficiency examination. For further information on language placement and exemption, and for Advanced Placement Test equivalencies, consult your advisor or the College of Arts and Science Bulletin (available online from the CAS website). Students whose secondary schooling was in a language other than English and other than a language offered in the College, or who complete the International Writing Workshop sequence (EXPOS-UA 4, International Writing Workshop I; and EXPOS-UA 9, International Writing Workshop II), are exempt from the foreign language requirement. Also exempt are students in the B.S./B.E. program. In addition to the foreign languages courses offered for academic credit, the College offers opportunities for students of modern languages to practice their skills in real-world situations outside the classroom. NYU Speaking Freely is a free, non-credit program that allows students to practice their speaking and aural comprehension skills and to explore the linguistically diverse cultures of New York City. For more information about this popular program, contact the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909.\u2028    Foreign Language Courses Listed below are courses covering the second semester of the intermediate level of language study. Intensive courses, which allow students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year, are also listed where available.

For more information on specific language classes, placement, or exemption, please contact the language coordinator, director of language programs, or director of undergraduate studies named in the individual departmental listings. Thanks to an exchange arrangement with Columbia University, students may also enroll in the following languages, offered through the intermediate level and given at Columbia: Armenian, Bengali, Catalan, Czech (Elementary I and II are offered in the College; intermediate-level courses are offered at Columbia), Dutch, Finnish, Georgian, Hungarian, Indonesian, Kannada, Polish, Punjabi, Romanian, Sanskrit, Serbo-Croatian, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Modern Tibetan, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Wolof, and Zulu. For information about these courses, visit the Office of Academic Affairs, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 908 or click here for more information.    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture is the arts, humanities, and social sciences component of the College Core Curriculum. Within each of its components, students are free to pursue their interests through their choice of classes. The structure of the FCC ensures that every student in the College gains a common core of skills and experiences in the liberal arts. In addition to the information below, to learn more about FCC courses, we strongly recommend that you browse past and present syllabuses. Texts and Ideas Texts and Ideas is the name for a diverse group of humanities courses that study challenging, influential texts about big ideas: freedom, the nature of the soul, the place of humans in the natural and animal world, beauty, citizenship, morality, the imagination, the use of the past, and many more. Some courses explore a single theme or a set of closely related ideas; others investigate the relationship between two periods of intellectual history, for example, selected writings in the philosophy and literature of ancient Greece and Rome and their reception in a later era. Texts and Ideas courses also seek to refine students\u2019 ability to write and speak about complex concepts and arguments with clarity, originality, and eloquence. You will be challenged not only to master the content of some of the world\u2019s most influential philosophical texts and works of literature, but to discuss how the ideas in these works have been debated, developed, appropriated, or rejected over time. Cultures and Contexts Cultures and Contexts prepares students for life in a globalized world by introducing them to the ways humans see themselves as members of social, religious, national, and regional groups. Individual courses focus on political, social, or cultural collectives that are distinct from the dominant traditions of contemporary North America, such as central Asia, Russia, Korea, or ancient Egypt; some courses study diaspora formations and emergent traditions. Primary texts are central to every course, with some faculty concentrating on historical documents, others on art, film, or literary texts. Cultures and Contexts courses share a common aim to examine the ways cultures emerge and interact through trade, colonization, immigration, religious proselytization, and representation in various media; how groups define themselves through beliefs, values, and customs; and how the dominant perspective of Western modernity affects comprehension of the ways in which premodern or non-Western peoples experience and imagine their lives.  Societies and the Social Sciences We live in a world molded by massive social, political, and economic transformations, and to be thoughtful, responsible citizens we need to understand them. From the nineteenth century to today, drawing on earlier movements, thinkers have developed new methods for understanding the complexity of these phenomena by studying societal structures and human behavior. Societies and the Social Sciences is our name for a set of courses offered by social science departments across the Faculty of Arts and Science\u2014Anthropology, Social and Cultural Analysis, Economics, Politics, History, Linguistics, Psychology, Religious Studies, and Sociology. Students fulfill the requirement by taking one of a list of designated courses or by majoring or minoring in the social sciences. Expressive Culture Art arouses pleasure, wonder, confusion, curiosity, and many other things. How is art made, and for what purpose? How do artworks convey meaning or feelings? How does social context shape the making of art? In Expressive Culture, students explore the complexities of artistic expression by focusing on one of five media: sounds, images, words, performance, or film. Each course introduces requisite historical, formal, and critical vocabularies; examines fundamental issues associated with interpretation of the arts; and investigates the complex relations between artistic activity and other facets of social and political life. Our teaching is fueled by our passion for fostering life-long appreciation of the arts, and New York City is the ideal place to experience them in all their variety. Whenever possible, faculty draw on the rich cultural resources of the city around us.    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is the mathematics and natural science component of the College Core Curriculum. Rather than providing a routine coverage of facts, FSI courses stress the process and applications of quantitative and scientific thinking. The design of these courses is based on the conviction that science is interesting, accessible, and important for all undergraduates. FSI courses encourage students to approach science as a way of knowing, a quest to understand who we are and our place in the universe. They also provide you with a foundation to make informed decisions\u2014both personal and societal\u2014as citizens of a world that is increasingly influenced by science and technology. No matter what career path you choose, the study of science will enrich your critical thinking skills and expand your appreciation of the natural world. Quantitative Reasoning Mathematics is both a curiosity-driven endeavor and a powerful analytical tool. Mathematics strives to deduce universal rules that govern numbers, geometry, and logic. When applied to the analysis of data, mathematics allows us to derive conclusions, for example, about the likelihood of random events or the effectiveness of medical therapies. In today\u2019s data-driven world we are constantly bombarded with numbers, from projections of the national debt to the likelihood of catching the flu, so citizens of the 21st century need an ability to critically evaluate numerical information. The Core\u2019s Quantitative Reasoning courses provide you with the mathematical foundations and analytical skills to investigate, evaluate, and draw conclusions from numerical evidence. Natural Science I Natural Science I describes a range of courses that examine the foundations of the physical sciences\u2014physics and chemistry. At its core, the physical sciences seek to understand the role of matter and energy in explaining a broad range of phenomena, such as the large scale structure of the universe and the factors that affect the earth\u2019s climate. These investigations require the application of mathematical tools to quantify and predict our complex world. Natural Science I courses examine questions at the cutting edge of scientific investigation: What fundamental insights do scientists hope to gain from the Large Hadron Collider, the largest and most complex scientific experiment ever performed? Why have astronomers propose the unseen existence of dark matter and dark energy? What do investigations into the Earth\u2019s historical climate reveal about the scope of global climate change in the 20th and 21st centuries? Do renewable energy sources provide a feasible global alternative to fossil fuels? Natural Science II Natural Science II encapsulates a variety of courses that examine the broad diversity of life sciences\u2014biology, neuroscience, and physical anthropology. We are currently witnessing an explosion of information in the life sciences, stimulated by the development of new tools such as DNA technologies, computer databases, and brain scanners. These new insights have thrust science into the forefront of social, ethical, and legal debates on such topics as stem cell research, the evidence for evolution, the preservation of biodiversity, and the neurological basis of decision making. Each Natural Science II course uses a thematic approach to introduce students to the foundations and frontiers of scientific investigation in the life sciences.

And secondly, I want to correct a misconception I've heard and read about, namely that Finland is the 'punk mecca of Europe'. We have lots of great bands and records here, but the scene itself isn't healthy. Bands are very jealous of each other, bad mouth each other, etc. Without that the scene would be much better. If some scene is the punk mecca of Europe it's the Italian scene. I've heard so much good about it, that it has to be truly great.    At the moment, there's lots of groups who can't stand each other. Most of the older punks are now into KILLING JOKE, LORDS OF THE NEW CHURCH, etc. They really hate hardcore. Then there's the younger punks who are only into English punk. They hate everything that comes from America (except BLACK FLAG and DKs) because \"they play too fast and don't look punk enough\". And then there are those nazi skins who hate everyone, especially punks. Fortunately, there's not too many of them (only in Tampere are they into fascism; Helsinki skins aren't into that, but they aren't against violence either).    The latest generation of punk bands are getting out of the basement, and are inspired by the big names like TERVEET KADET, RIISTETYT, BASTARDS, KAAOS, and English bands. You can check out some of the newcomers on the \"Hardcore '83\" comp LP, along with the bigger bands. Here's a list of the latest bands: PROSTITUUTIO, AIVOPROTEEESI, SOTATILA, UPPONALLE, MASSACRE, EPIDEMIA, THEOBILUS-BAND, POLIISIVALTO, NEUROOSI, HALLOWEEN, U.C.T., KAAPAUS, PURKAUS, VAPPA KALJA, KLIMAX.    The biggest problem now is the lack of gigs. The reason is simple, punk bands don't draw big crowds, so promoters don't want to take risks in booking them. The biggest gigs take place mostly at Lepakkoluola, in Helsinki. But these only occur 2-6 times a year. There was a big punk show in Rovaniemi in December lots of bands played, but only a handful of people bothered to come. The organizer lost $300. Ultimately, it's up to the bands to get these gigs, but most are too lazy or don't have a manager. APPENDIX though are gigging the most at the moment, and have shown you can get gigs if you hustle. They did a mini tour in Jan (to places where punk bands have never played before), and are planning a bigger one in spring. Propaganda Records is now the only label that's releasing punk records. Poko only have RATTUS, since KOHU-63 broke up and TERVVET KADET went to Propaganda. Johanna Records only have UNICEF, as LAMA split up. Propaganda has all the big names and also organized most of the punk gigs in Helsinki, and put on a three day punk festival last summer. Some time ago, it seemed to be very easy to get on Propaganda; just play as fast as you can and call yourself 'hardcore'. Unfortunately, that made it too easy for the bands and very few have tried putting their own records out. Rock-O-Rama Records in Germany is now releasing most of Propaganda's stuff there (they're the same as the Finnish records, but have different covers and posters except for the BASTARDS \"Siberian Hardcore\" LP, which is solely out in Germany, with English lyrics no less).    Now for some band news:    TERVEET KADET left Poko Records because the label didn't like them too much. So they went to Propaganda, and have done three 12\" records: \"Halloween\" LP, \"Message\" 4 song EP with English vocals, and the latest, \"Verta\" mini LP. They haven't played in their hometown, Tornio, since '82, but have had 4 gigs in Helsinki and other towns. Live, they're not a great stage presence, but the music is great thrash! They have a new drummer now (the old one didn't want to do gigs), who used to be in MAP. MAP Split up after Walde, the guitarist, left the band. He now plays in KUOLEMA.    BASTARDS have changed singers since releasing their first EP, and have done quite a lot of gigs around Finland. They are another example of a hard working band and organized a European tour themselves (Denmark, Germany and Italy). It was successful (not monetarily) in the sense of popularising Finnish punk. In fact they lost quite a bit of money, but don't regret it. Their \"Insane World\" LP is selling real well, as is the \"Siberian Hardcore\" LP. They split up in January just prior to going on a UK tour. Rike, the guitarist, left to join RIISTETYT.    RIISTETYT now have a new line up. The only original member is Lateri, the singer. The newcomers are: Nappi on bass (ex KAAOS), Jaska on drums ex KAAOS) and Rike on guitar. Those same members plus Costello (from POPEDA) form the HOLY DOLLS, who are said to be Finland's LORDS OF THE NEW CHURCH. They've recorded an LP, and it should be out soon. Back to RIISTETYT, their first LP is out in Germany, and the new LP, \"Nightmare In Darkness\", should be out soon. Also coming out is a 12\" EP. The old RIISTETYT line up recorded one of the greatest records ever done here, the \"Skitsofrenia\" mini LP. RIISTETYT will probably do the UK tour the BASTARDS cancelled.    TAMPERE SS did one great EP and a few gigs, but then they split up after the bassist left to join TUOMITTUJEN JUHLA (a new CRASS influenced band).    NUKKETEATTERI have released 2 records on their own label. Their first was a 4 song EP that's very good punk, but could've been better produced. In the fall of '82 they kicked out the drummer and bassist, and took on the singer and bassist of LAAHAUS (who split up last summer). They dropped all their fast numbers and started to play 'progressive punk' (long, slow songs like THEATRE OF HATE), but have now found their own sound. They just released a 12\", which contains some really weird stuff. Now they're looking for a new guitarist, as the old one left because he wants to play normal punk.    RATTUS, at long last, got the new singer they had been searching for. He's an old friend of theirs (ex roadie), not the greatest singer in the world, but has a great stage presence. The first record that Annikki sings on is \"Uskonto On Vaara\" EP, which has Pushead's artwork on the cover, as did the last one. RATTUS will soon also have a collection LP of their best songs out on Rat Cage Records in the US. Also out in the states is their 60 minute cassette on Bad Compilation Tapes, as well as one track on MRR's \"Welcome to 1984\" comp LP (as do TERVEET KADET), which will be out in April.    KAAOS changes its line up all the time. On their new LP, \"Ristiinnaulitto\", there is much more of a variety of stuff than their earlier records (not as fast and chaotic). Now Jakke plays guitar instead of singing, and their recent gigs have been terrible (too much booze in their heads).    VARAUS put out a one sided LP by themselves, and have just released a real hot 7\". They haven't been gigging too much, but are one of the promising young bands in the country. Their line up hasn't changed in almost 2 years.    LAMA, the oldest punk band, split up in December '82, the farewell gig held at Lepakkoluola. This was the day after the very first Finnish punk festival took place in the same locale. That weekend was a great event in Finnish punkdom. Johanna records released LAMA's farewell 45 a half a year after they split up (their worst). That was followed by a 12\" comp of their singles.    KOHU-63's singer, Latta, is in jail now for 6 years, for stabbing a punk. I've heard that the band will try to go on with the bass player singing, but I think they broke up. They released an LP, \"Lissa Verta Historiaan\", with the stupidest lyrics ever put on record, glorifying war, violence and racism.    APPENDIX has been gigging quite a lot in their area, and not much in southern Finland. When they played at the Puntala Rock '83 festival, the bass player got a beer bottle to his head. Their first LP got released in Germany, and they're working on their second now, with the music progressing more into 'rock'.    Some other bands who need mentioning are: KANSAN UUTISET, whose LP, \"Beautiful Dreams\", is out only in Germany. RUTTO, The only punk band here with a female vocalist, whose EP is out on Laja's (of TERVEET KADET) label, Ikbals. They are planning a second one now, which will be of better quality. I'd like to apologize to Pexi of MAHO NEITSYT for not mentioning his band in my first scene report. They have been going for 3 years and have 2 EP's out. Their style is more '77 style, slower punk with funny lyrics. UNICEF's first EP is out now. The band contains 2 ex LAMA members, Jusa and Raitsikka. Don't know how active is the singer, Tino, spend a lot of his time in Norway, and they are on the second \"Really Fast\" comp LP from Sweden. At the moment the bassist and drummer are in the army.    Some interesting bands (but not hardcore) are SEILUN VELJET, who are hard to label. They are very close to punks original ideal to have the music progress but keep the energy and rawness. They have a 3-sided LP, one mini LP and a single. PARAATI contains some Helsinki punk veterans (Epe, ex LAMA, among others). GEISHA is an all female group whose music is very simple and charming, they have 12\" out on Johanna.     SOME OF THE NEWER BANDS BY RISTO ERONEN     TUOMITTUJEN JUHLA  From out of the ashes of MARIONETTI has risen this new band. \"We don't want to be under the so-called 'hardcore' label, because of the lack of ideas in that scene that is common in Finland. Our musical are close to so-called 'thinking punk' bands, like FLUX, CONFLICT, SUBHUMANS, OMEGA TRIBE, CRASS etc. All our productions (literary and musical) will be released on Rapagonda label (nothing to do with Propaganda), which is a non-commercial alternative founded by a group of individuals.\"     DESTRUKTIONS  \"We're fed up because we've seen our name written without the letter \"K\". It's not DESTRUKTIONS, not DESTRUCTIONS. We're on Pax Records next compilation LP and will have an EP out soon to follow up our \"Vox Populi\" LP, which is out in Germany.\"     KUOLEMA  \"We've had many practice places, but have always gotten kicked out. At the moment we've got quite a good place, but it seems we'll be kicked out of there too. When we started none of us could play, but we're getting better. We've had only 2 gigs. Both have been interrupted cos we've been so drunk. We're on a couple of comp tapes as well as \"Hardcore '83\" comp LP. Propaganda would like to put out a cassette LP, but we're not sure. Our influences are CHAOS UK, DISORDER, CRUCIFIX, KAAOS, VARAUS. BASTARDS and RIISTETYT are getting too soft sounding. We love noise more than anything. Hope everything gets better once this fucking winter is over.\"     MELLAKKA  \"The band is from Rauma, which is quite a small place, but there are some people who can't stand us. They think everybody should look the same. We think everybody can be whatever he/she wants to be. Finland should be a free country, but that won't work unless the kids stop fighting each other (we've heard that punks fight each other, but not hear in Rauma).\"     SEKAANNUS  \"We play mid-tempo punk. Religion and people are the main themes. We've got about 20 songs at the moment. Before summer we hope to get an EP out. Sharing it with another band, MASSACRE. It will be on our own label. We have some gigs lined up, so everything's looking quite nice.\"     VAURIO  \"We practice in the upstairs of a children's home, which was given to us by the town of Naantali. We will have a much delayed EP hopefully out soon. Like and Lahti of the BASTARDS were there helping us record it. Everything got real messed up. We want to say this about fanzines: they are a fucking great thing. There are good ones and bad ones, but the main thing is that somebody's out there making them.\"     H.I.C. SYSTEEMI  \"We formed in August, after the second world war, when we didn't know about the third world war. We live in Ylivieska, a small town with reindeer. We make drinking songs. When we are not playing we take care of our relationships to Alko (Finnish liquor shop). As for the peace movement, they are a very serious thing to consider because they have the strength to march in the rain. The army is shit, and we won't go voluntarily. We hope to do an EP on Propaganda, if they want us. Our message to Finnish punks: don't take everything so seriously. There's more than war to sing about.\"      BACK to Finland page     KILL FROM THE HEART Home"}]},

Virtually all your college courses require you to write papers or reports, but courses offered by the Expository Writing Program are opportunities to concentrate intensely on the process of writing. The Expository Writing Program assumes that writing is not merely a useful skill but also a way of learning and knowing. Its courses focus on the examination of evidence, the development of ideas, and the clear expression of those ideas in a variety of different kinds of essays. In these writing courses, students routinely move from exploration to argument as they read and make use of various texts\u2014written, visual, experiential\u2014to create a spectrum of persuasive essays. Examined texts become more complex, and the writing tasks more difficult, as students grapple with intriguing questions that lead to richer ideas and more interesting forms of expression. The essays students write become more formal and argumentative as the semester\u2019s work progresses. Additional information, requirements and course descriptions appear on the Expository Writing Program website.     Foreign Language The study of foreign languages is an integral part of a liberal arts education. It nurtures an awareness of the diversity of human culture and serves the practical need for language skills in fields such as government, business, and research. NYU is a particularly exciting setting for language study because of its location in a great cosmopolitan city, its international student body, its many renowned language programs and centers, and its rapidly expanding opportunities for study abroad. To fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum, students must show or attain proficiency in a foreign language through the intermediate level. Ordinarily, this is accomplished by the successful completion of two years of language study in the College, through the second semester of a regular intermediate-level language sequence (see list of courses below). Some languages are also taught in intensive courses, allowing students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year. After two years of college language study or the equivalent demonstrated proficiency, students should have gained a broad competence in a language, but true fluency of written or oral expression will not usually have been developed at this point. For this reason, all students are encouraged to continue their language study beyond the intermediate level. In particular, students studying modern languages are encouraged to immerse themselves in the living culture of a language by studying, traveling, or working abroad. Students of all languages, ancient or modern, are encouraged to continue their studies with elective courses in literature at the advanced level. Exemptions: Students may fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum by presenting outstanding scores on the SAT Subject Test or Advanced Placement Test in a foreign language, or by passing a departmental proficiency examination. For further information on language placement and exemption, and for Advanced Placement Test equivalencies, consult your advisor or the College of Arts and Science Bulletin (available online from the CAS website). Students whose secondary schooling was in a language other than English and other than a language offered in the College, or who complete the International Writing Workshop sequence (EXPOS-UA 4, International Writing Workshop I; and EXPOS-UA 9, International Writing Workshop II), are exempt from the foreign language requirement. Also exempt are students in the B.S./B.E. program. In addition to the foreign languages courses offered for academic credit, the College offers opportunities for students of modern languages to practice their skills in real-world situations outside the classroom. NYU Speaking Freely is a free, non-credit program that allows students to practice their speaking and aural comprehension skills and to explore the linguistically diverse cultures of New York City. For more information about this popular program, contact the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909.\u2028    Foreign Language Courses Listed below are courses covering the second semester of the intermediate level of language study. Intensive courses, which allow students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year, are also listed where available. Completion of any of the following courses will fulfill the foreign language requirement. Please consult the individual departmental listings for information on prerequisite courses. Arabic, Intermediate II (MEIS-UA 104) Cantonese, Intermediate II (EAST-UA 413) Chinese, Intermediate II (EAST-UA 204) Chinese, Intermediate for Advanced Beginners (EAST-UA 232) Filipino (Tagalog) , Intermediate II (SCA-UA 324) French, Intermediate II (FREN-UA 12) French, Intensive Intermediate (FREN-UA 20) German, Intermediate II (GERM-UA 4) German, Intensive Intermediate (GERM-UA 20) Greek: Homer (CLASS-UA 10) Greek, Modern, Intermediate II (HEL-UA 106) Hebrew, Intermediate II (HBRJD-UA 4) Hindi, Intermediate II (MEIS-UA 408) Irish, Modern, Intermediate II (IRISH-UA 103) Italian, Intermediate II (ITAL-UA 12) Italian, Intensive Intermediate (ITAL-UA 20) Japanese, Intermediate II (EAST-UA 250) Korean, Intermediate II (EAST-UA 257) Latin: Vergil (CLASS-UA 6) Persian, Intermediate II (MEIS-UA 404) Portuguese, Intermediate II (PORT-UA 4) Portuguese, Intensive Intermediate for Spanish Speakers (PORT-UA 21) Quechua, Intermediate II (SPAN-UA 84) Russian, Intermediate II (RUSSN-UA 4) Russian, Grammar and Composition II (RUSSN-UA 6) Spanish, Intermediate II (SPAN-UA 4) Spanish for Spanish Speakers (SPAN-UA 11) Spanish, Intensive Intermediate (SPAN-UA 20) Swahili, Intermediate II (SCA-UA 124) Turkish, Intermediate II (MEIS-UA 504) Urdu, Intermediate II (MEIS-UA 304) Yiddish, Intermediate II (HBRJD-UA 17) Each department offering language instruction in the College has designated a member of its faculty to coordinate its courses and policies. For more information on specific language classes, placement, or exemption, please contact the language coordinator, director of language programs, or director of undergraduate studies named in the individual departmental listings. Thanks to an exchange arrangement with Columbia University, students may also enroll in the following languages, offered through the intermediate level and given at Columbia: Armenian, Bengali, Catalan, Czech (Elementary I and II are offered in the College; intermediate-level courses are offered at Columbia), Dutch, Finnish, Georgian, Hungarian, Indonesian, Kannada, Polish, Punjabi, Romanian, Sanskrit, Serbo-Croatian, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Modern Tibetan, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Wolof, and Zulu. For information about these courses, visit the Office of Academic Affairs, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 908 or click here for more information.    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture is the arts, humanities, and social sciences component of the College Core Curriculum. Within each of its components, students are free to pursue their interests through their choice of classes. The structure of the FCC ensures that every student in the College gains a common core of skills and experiences in the liberal arts. In addition to the information below, to learn more about FCC courses, we strongly recommend that you browse past and present syllabuses. Texts and Ideas Texts and Ideas is the name for a diverse group of humanities courses that study challenging, influential texts about big ideas: freedom, the nature of the soul, the place of humans in the natural and animal world, beauty, citizenship, morality, the imagination, the use of the past, and many more. Some courses explore a single theme or a set of closely related ideas; others investigate the relationship between two periods of intellectual history, for example, selected writings in the philosophy and literature of ancient Greece and Rome and their reception in a later era. Texts and Ideas courses also seek to refine students\u2019 ability to write and speak about complex concepts and arguments with clarity, originality, and eloquence. You will be challenged not only to master the content of some of the world\u2019s most influential philosophical texts and works of literature, but to discuss how the ideas in these works have been debated, developed, appropriated, or rejected over time. Cultures and Contexts Cultures and Contexts prepares students for life in a globalized world by introducing them to the ways humans see themselves as members of social, religious, national, and regional groups. Individual courses focus on political, social, or cultural collectives that are distinct from the dominant traditions of contemporary North America, such as central Asia, Russia, Korea, or ancient Egypt; some courses study diaspora formations and emergent traditions. Primary texts are central to every course, with some faculty concentrating on historical documents, others on art, film, or literary texts. Cultures and Contexts courses share a common aim to examine the ways cultures emerge and interact through trade, colonization, immigration, religious proselytization, and representation in various media; how groups define themselves through beliefs, values, and customs; and how the dominant perspective of Western modernity affects comprehension of the ways in which premodern or non-Western peoples experience and imagine their lives.  Societies and the Social Sciences We live in a world molded by massive social, political, and economic transformations, and to be thoughtful, responsible citizens we need to understand them. From the nineteenth century to today, drawing on earlier movements, thinkers have developed new methods for understanding the complexity of these phenomena by studying societal structures and human behavior. Societies and the Social Sciences is our name for a set of courses offered by social science departments across the Faculty of Arts and Science\u2014Anthropology, Social and Cultural Analysis, Economics, Politics, History, Linguistics, Psychology, Religious Studies, and Sociology. Students fulfill the requirement by taking one of a list of designated courses or by majoring or minoring in the social sciences. Expressive Culture Art arouses pleasure, wonder, confusion, curiosity, and many other things. How is art made, and for what purpose? How do artworks convey meaning or feelings? How does social context shape the making of art? In Expressive Culture, students explore the complexities of artistic expression by focusing on one of five media: sounds, images, words, performance, or film. Each course introduces requisite historical, formal, and critical vocabularies; examines fundamental issues associated with interpretation of the arts; and investigates the complex relations between artistic activity and other facets of social and political life. Our teaching is fueled by our passion for fostering life-long appreciation of the arts, and New York City is the ideal place to experience them in all their variety. Whenever possible, faculty draw on the rich cultural resources of the city around us.    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is the mathematics and natural science component of the College Core Curriculum. Rather than providing a routine coverage of facts, FSI courses stress the process and applications of quantitative and scientific thinking. The design of these courses is based on the conviction that science is interesting, accessible, and important for all undergraduates. FSI courses encourage students to approach science as a way of knowing, a quest to understand who we are and our place in the universe. They also provide you with a foundation to make informed decisions\u2014both personal and societal\u2014as citizens of a world that is increasingly influenced by science and technology. No matter what career path you choose, the study of science will enrich your critical thinking skills and expand your appreciation of the natural world. Quantitative Reasoning Mathematics is both a curiosity-driven endeavor and a powerful analytical tool. Mathematics strives to deduce universal rules that govern numbers, geometry, and logic. When applied to the analysis of data, mathematics allows us to derive conclusions, for example, about the likelihood of random events or the effectiveness of medical therapies. In today\u2019s data-driven world we are constantly bombarded with numbers, from projections of the national debt to the likelihood of catching the flu, so citizens of the 21st century need an ability to critically evaluate numerical information. The Core\u2019s Quantitative Reasoning courses provide you with the mathematical foundations and analytical skills to investigate, evaluate, and draw conclusions from numerical evidence. Natural Science I Natural Science I describes a range of courses that examine the foundations of the physical sciences\u2014physics and chemistry. At its core, the physical sciences seek to understand the role of matter and energy in explaining a broad range of phenomena, such as the large scale structure of the universe and the factors that affect the earth\u2019s climate. These investigations require the application of mathematical tools to quantify and predict our complex world. Natural Science I courses examine questions at the cutting edge of scientific investigation: What fundamental insights do scientists hope to gain from the Large Hadron Collider, the largest and most complex scientific experiment ever performed? Why have astronomers propose the unseen existence of dark matter and dark energy? What do investigations into the Earth\u2019s historical climate reveal about the scope of global climate change in the 20th and 21st centuries? Do renewable energy sources provide a feasible global alternative to fossil fuels? Natural Science II Natural Science II encapsulates a variety of courses that examine the broad diversity of life sciences\u2014biology, neuroscience, and physical anthropology. We are currently witnessing an explosion of information in the life sciences, stimulated by the development of new tools such as DNA technologies, computer databases, and brain scanners. These new insights have thrust science into the forefront of social, ethical, and legal debates on such topics as stem cell research, the evidence for evolution, the preservation of biodiversity, and the neurological basis of decision making. Each Natural Science II course uses a thematic approach to introduce students to the foundations and frontiers of scientific investigation in the life sciences.

And secondly, I want to correct a misconception I've heard and read about, namely that Finland is the 'punk mecca of Europe'. We have lots of great bands and records here, but the scene itself isn't healthy. Bands are very jealous of each other, bad mouth each other, etc. Without that the scene would be much better. If some scene is the punk mecca of Europe it's the Italian scene. I've heard so much good about it, that it has to be truly great.    At the moment, there's lots of groups who can't stand each other. Most of the older punks are now into KILLING JOKE, LORDS OF THE NEW CHURCH, etc. They really hate hardcore. Then there's the younger punks who are only into English punk. They hate everything that comes from America (except BLACK FLAG and DKs) because \"they play too fast and don't look punk enough\". And then there are those nazi skins who hate everyone, especially punks. Fortunately, there's not too many of them (only in Tampere are they into fascism; Helsinki skins aren't into that, but they aren't against violence either).    The latest generation of punk bands are getting out of the basement, and are inspired by the big names like TERVEET KADET, RIISTETYT, BASTARDS, KAAOS, and English bands. You can check out some of the newcomers on the \"Hardcore '83\" comp LP, along with the bigger bands. Here's a list of the latest bands: PROSTITUUTIO, AIVOPROTEEESI, SOTATILA, UPPONALLE, MASSACRE, EPIDEMIA, THEOBILUS-BAND, POLIISIVALTO, NEUROOSI, HALLOWEEN, U.C.T., KAAPAUS, PURKAUS, VAPPA KALJA, KLIMAX.    The biggest problem now is the lack of gigs. The reason is simple, punk bands don't draw big crowds, so promoters don't want to take risks in booking them. The biggest gigs take place mostly at Lepakkoluola, in Helsinki. But these only occur 2-6 times a year. There was a big punk show in Rovaniemi in December lots of bands played, but only a handful of people bothered to come. The organizer lost $300. Ultimately, it's up to the bands to get these gigs, but most are too lazy or don't have a manager. APPENDIX though are gigging the most at the moment, and have shown you can get gigs if you hustle. They did a mini tour in Jan (to places where punk bands have never played before), and are planning a bigger one in spring. Propaganda Records is now the only label that's releasing punk records. Poko only have RATTUS, since KOHU-63 broke up and TERVVET KADET went to Propaganda. Johanna Records only have UNICEF, as LAMA split up. Propaganda has all the big names and also organized most of the punk gigs in Helsinki, and put on a three day punk festival last summer. Some time ago, it seemed to be very easy to get on Propaganda; just play as fast as you can and call yourself 'hardcore'. Unfortunately, that made it too easy for the bands and very few have tried putting their own records out. Rock-O-Rama Records in Germany is now releasing most of Propaganda's stuff there (they're the same as the Finnish records, but have different covers and posters except for the BASTARDS \"Siberian Hardcore\" LP, which is solely out in Germany, with English lyrics no less).    Now for some band news:    TERVEET KADET left Poko Records because the label didn't like them too much. So they went to Propaganda, and have done three 12\" records: \"Halloween\" LP, \"Message\" 4 song EP with English vocals, and the latest, \"Verta\" mini LP. They haven't played in their hometown, Tornio, since '82, but have had 4 gigs in Helsinki and other towns. Live, they're not a great stage presence, but the music is great thrash! They have a new drummer now (the old one didn't want to do gigs), who used to be in MAP. MAP Split up after Walde, the guitarist, left the band. He now plays in KUOLEMA.    BASTARDS have changed singers since releasing their first EP, and have done quite a lot of gigs around Finland. They are another example of a hard working band and organized a European tour themselves (Denmark, Germany and Italy). It was successful (not monetarily) in the sense of popularising Finnish punk. In fact they lost quite a bit of money, but don't regret it. Their \"Insane World\" LP is selling real well, as is the \"Siberian Hardcore\" LP. They split up in January just prior to going on a UK tour. Rike, the guitarist, left to join RIISTETYT.    RIISTETYT now have a new line up. The only original member is Lateri, the singer. The newcomers are: Nappi on bass (ex KAAOS), Jaska on drums ex KAAOS) and Rike on guitar. Those same members plus Costello (from POPEDA) form the HOLY DOLLS, who are said to be Finland's LORDS OF THE NEW CHURCH. They've recorded an LP, and it should be out soon. Back to RIISTETYT, their first LP is out in Germany, and the new LP, \"Nightmare In Darkness\", should be out soon. Also coming out is a 12\" EP. The old RIISTETYT line up recorded one of the greatest records ever done here, the \"Skitsofrenia\" mini LP. RIISTETYT will probably do the UK tour the BASTARDS cancelled.    TAMPERE SS did one great EP and a few gigs, but then they split up after the bassist left to join TUOMITTUJEN JUHLA (a new CRASS influenced band).    NUKKETEATTERI have released 2 records on their own label. Their first was a 4 song EP that's very good punk, but could've been better produced. In the fall of '82 they kicked out the drummer and bassist, and took on the singer and bassist of LAAHAUS (who split up last summer). They dropped all their fast numbers and started to play 'progressive punk' (long, slow songs like THEATRE OF HATE), but have now found their own sound. They just released a 12\", which contains some really weird stuff. Now they're looking for a new guitarist, as the old one left because he wants to play normal punk.    RATTUS, at long last, got the new singer they had been searching for. He's an old friend of theirs (ex roadie), not the greatest singer in the world, but has a great stage presence. The first record that Annikki sings on is \"Uskonto On Vaara\" EP, which has Pushead's artwork on the cover, as did the last one. RATTUS will soon also have a collection LP of their best songs out on Rat Cage Records in the US. Also out in the states is their 60 minute cassette on Bad Compilation Tapes, as well as one track on MRR's \"Welcome to 1984\" comp LP (as do TERVEET KADET), which will be out in April.    KAAOS changes its line up all the time. On their new LP, \"Ristiinnaulitto\", there is much more of a variety of stuff than their earlier records (not as fast and chaotic). Now Jakke plays guitar instead of singing, and their recent gigs have been terrible (too much booze in their heads).    VARAUS put out a one sided LP by themselves, and have just released a real hot 7\". They haven't been gigging too much, but are one of the promising young bands in the country. Their line up hasn't changed in almost 2 years.    LAMA, the oldest punk band, split up in December '82, the farewell gig held at Lepakkoluola. This was the day after the very first Finnish punk festival took place in the same locale. That weekend was a great event in Finnish punkdom. Johanna records released LAMA's farewell 45 a half a year after they split up (their worst). That was followed by a 12\" comp of their singles.    KOHU-63's singer, Latta, is in jail now for 6 years, for stabbing a punk. I've heard that the band will try to go on with the bass player singing, but I think they broke up. They released an LP, \"Lissa Verta Historiaan\", with the stupidest lyrics ever put on record, glorifying war, violence and racism.    APPENDIX has been gigging quite a lot in their area, and not much in southern Finland. When they played at the Puntala Rock '83 festival, the bass player got a beer bottle to his head. Their first LP got released in Germany, and they're working on their second now, with the music progressing more into 'rock'.    Some other bands who need mentioning are: KANSAN UUTISET, whose LP, \"Beautiful Dreams\", is out only in Germany. RUTTO, The only punk band here with a female vocalist, whose EP is out on Laja's (of TERVEET KADET) label, Ikbals. They are planning a second one now, which will be of better quality. I'd like to apologize to Pexi of MAHO NEITSYT for not mentioning his band in my first scene report. They have been going for 3 years and have 2 EP's out. Their style is more '77 style, slower punk with funny lyrics. UNICEF's first EP is out now. The band contains 2 ex LAMA members, Jusa and Raitsikka. Don't know how active is the singer, Tino, spend a lot of his time in Norway, and they are on the second \"Really Fast\" comp LP from Sweden. At the moment the bassist and drummer are in the army.    Some interesting bands (but not hardcore) are SEILUN VELJET, who are hard to label. They are very close to punks original ideal to have the music progress but keep the energy and rawness. They have a 3-sided LP, one mini LP and a single. PARAATI contains some Helsinki punk veterans (Epe, ex LAMA, among others). GEISHA is an all female group whose music is very simple and charming, they have 12\" out on Johanna.     SOME OF THE NEWER BANDS BY RISTO ERONEN     TUOMITTUJEN JUHLA  From out of the ashes of MARIONETTI has risen this new band. \"We don't want to be under the so-called 'hardcore' label, because of the lack of ideas in that scene that is common in Finland. Our musical are close to so-called 'thinking punk' bands, like FLUX, CONFLICT, SUBHUMANS, OMEGA TRIBE, CRASS etc. All our productions (literary and musical) will be released on Rapagonda label (nothing to do with Propaganda), which is a non-commercial alternative founded by a group of individuals.\"     DESTRUKTIONS  \"We're fed up because we've seen our name written without the letter \"K\". It's not DESTRUKTIONS, not DESTRUCTIONS. We're on Pax Records next compilation LP and will have an EP out soon to follow up our \"Vox Populi\" LP, which is out in Germany.\"     KUOLEMA  \"We've had many practice places, but have always gotten kicked out. At the moment we've got quite a good place, but it seems we'll be kicked out of there too. When we started none of us could play, but we're getting better. We've had only 2 gigs. Both have been interrupted cos we've been so drunk. We're on a couple of comp tapes as well as \"Hardcore '83\" comp LP. Propaganda would like to put out a cassette LP, but we're not sure. Our influences are CHAOS UK, DISORDER, CRUCIFIX, KAAOS, VARAUS. BASTARDS and RIISTETYT are getting too soft sounding. We love noise more than anything. Hope everything gets better once this fucking winter is over.\"     MELLAKKA  \"The band is from Rauma, which is quite a small place, but there are some people who can't stand us. They think everybody should look the same. We think everybody can be whatever he/she wants to be. Finland should be a free country, but that won't work unless the kids stop fighting each other (we've heard that punks fight each other, but not hear in Rauma).\"     SEKAANNUS  \"We play mid-tempo punk. Religion and people are the main themes. We've got about 20 songs at the moment. Before summer we hope to get an EP out. Sharing it with another band, MASSACRE. It will be on our own label. We have some gigs lined up, so everything's looking quite nice.\"     VAURIO  \"We practice in the upstairs of a children's home, which was given to us by the town of Naantali. We will have a much delayed EP hopefully out soon. Like and Lahti of the BASTARDS were there helping us record it. Everything got real messed up. We want to say this about fanzines: they are a fucking great thing. There are good ones and bad ones, but the main thing is that somebody's out there making them.\"     H.I.C. SYSTEEMI  \"We formed in August, after the second world war, when we didn't know about the third world war. We live in Ylivieska, a small town with reindeer. We make drinking songs. When we are not playing we take care of our relationships to Alko (Finnish liquor shop). As for the peace movement, they are a very serious thing to consider because they have the strength to march in the rain. The army is shit, and we won't go voluntarily. We hope to do an EP on Propaganda, if they want us. Our message to Finnish punks: don't take everything so seriously. There's more than war to sing about.\"      BACK to Finland page     KILL FROM THE HEART Home"}, {"content": "Columbia Language Exchange, College of Arts and Science | NYU                                                  Navigation       College of Arts and Science                 About Arts and Science | Departments and Programs | The Faculty       About the College | Programs | Students | Admissions | Alumni               Home &gt; Academic Support Services &gt; Columbia Language Exchange         Columbia Language Exchange       NYU students are eligible to enroll in certain language courses offered at Columbia University during each fall and spring semester. Students who wish to enroll in a course must obtain an access code from the Office of Academic Affairs (212-998-8110), located in the Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 908. Graduate students must also receive permission from their home school before they can enroll in a course.      The following language courses at Columbia University are available to NYU students: Armenian, Bengali, Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian, Catalan, Czech (Intermediate-level only), Dutch, Finnish, Hungarian, Indonesian, Polish, Pulaar, Punjabi, Romanian, Sanskrit, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Modern Tibetan, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Wolof, Yoruba (Intermediate-level only) and Zulu .

We will notify you via email once this is done; you can then obtain a Columbia University ID card and email account (see Columbia University\u2019s website for more information).      If, after enrolling in a class, you decide to drop the course, you must immediately inform the Office of Academic Affairs of your change of status. We will then notify Columbia University and they will drop you on their registration system as well. It is not sufficient to drop the class on Albert .                           Welcome!
