The Department is home to a pathology residency program in Anatomic and Clinical Pathology (with a dedicated pathology research track), three graduate training programs in Pathobiology , Molecular Oncology and Immunology , and Immunology and Inflammation , clinical fellowship programs in various subspecialties in pathology, and numerous postdoctoral research opportunities in the areas of experimental pathology, immunology, and molecular oncology.   Our training programs are enriched by our location in a thriving New York City medical center, serving a variety of public and private hospitals; by the local environment in Manhattan, with access to innumerable scientific collaborations at neighboring institutions; by our ties to the NYU main campus, with intellectual resources such as the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences; by our diverse mix of academic pathologists, basic scientists, and translational researchers, and by our collaborative spirit, which reflects a commitment to bring scientists, clinicians, and trainees together to create a thriving intellectual environment.

Happily, our research funding has grown by more than 50% since 2004, with over $20 million in annual research funding awarded to pathology faculty members, and we have acquired 7000 square feet of new laboratory space, bringing our total of new and newly renovated research space to more than 40,000 square feet. These long-term efforts have paid off. In the most recent 2007 index of faculty scholarly productivity for 375 US research universities compiled by the Chronicle of Higher Education, NYU School of Medicine ranks 2nd for Oncology and Cancer Biology and is ranked 7th in Immunology. The 2010 National Research Council Report on graduate programs ranks the Molecular Oncology and Immunology Training Program in the top 20 of its area of study.   Three fundamental principles unify our wide variety of clinical and research training opportunities: a commitment to individual mentoring, an emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration, and an overarching desire to improve human health through patient care, through probing fundamental mechanisms underlying health and disease, and through clinical research.

In 1881 Welch was appointed Professor of Pathologic Anatomy and General Pathology, the first position of its kind in the country. Around the same time, a laboratory, devoted specifically to the study of the \"pathology of many diseases,\" was founded through a gift from Andrew Carnegie at Bellevue Hospital Medical College. With its stated research focus, this laboratory became the first in the United States for teaching and investigation in pathology.

The Department is home to a pathology residency program in Anatomic and Clinical Pathology (with a dedicated pathology research track), three graduate training programs in Pathobiology , Molecular Oncology and Immunology , and Immunology and Inflammation , clinical fellowship programs in various subspecialties in pathology, and numerous postdoctoral research opportunities in the areas of experimental pathology, immunology, and molecular oncology.   Our training programs are enriched by our location in a thriving New York City medical center, serving a variety of public and private hospitals; by the local environment in Manhattan, with access to innumerable scientific collaborations at neighboring institutions; by our ties to the NYU main campus, with intellectual resources such as the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences; by our diverse mix of academic pathologists, basic scientists, and translational researchers, and by our collaborative spirit, which reflects a commitment to bring scientists, clinicians, and trainees together to create a thriving intellectual environment. Among the recipients of Teaching Awards granted each year by the students of the NYU School of Medicine are a number of Pathology faculty members, including David Roth and David Zagzag. \u00a0 \u00a0   Over the past three years, we have added five new research faculty and ten clinical faculty, recruited from premier institutions. Happily, our research funding has grown by more than 50% since 2004, with over $20 million in annual research funding awarded to pathology faculty members, and we have acquired 7000 square feet of new laboratory space, bringing our total of new and newly renovated research space to more than 40,000 square feet. These long-term efforts have paid off. In the most recent 2007 index of faculty scholarly productivity for 375 US research universities compiled by the Chronicle of Higher Education, NYU School of Medicine ranks 2nd for Oncology and Cancer Biology and is ranked 7th in Immunology. The 2010 National Research Council Report on graduate programs ranks the Molecular Oncology and Immunology Training Program in the top 20 of its area of study.   Three fundamental principles unify our wide variety of clinical and research training opportunities: a commitment to individual mentoring, an emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration, and an overarching desire to improve human health through patient care, through probing fundamental mechanisms underlying health and disease, and through clinical research.

In this they are supported by a dedicated core of staff and technicians.

In 1881 Welch was appointed Professor of Pathologic Anatomy and General Pathology, the first position of its kind in the country. Around the same time, a laboratory, devoted specifically to the study of the \"pathology of many diseases,\" was founded through a gift from Andrew Carnegie at Bellevue Hospital Medical College. With its stated research focus, this laboratory became the first in the United States for teaching and investigation in pathology.
