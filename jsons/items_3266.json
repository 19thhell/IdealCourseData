Translated documents should be accompanied by a verification of the accuracy of the translation and back-translation.   If a non-English-speaking subject is enrolled unexpectedly, researchers may rely on an oral translation of the English language consent form, but should take extra care in the informed consent process to ensure that the subject has understood the project. A statement in the research records (and on the English language consent form) should indicate that the translation took place, identify the translator, and document the translator's belief that the subject understands the study and the consent process. If the subject is a patient, a note about the translation should be made in the patient's research records as well. Researchers should use a short form in the subjects native language (some already translated short forms can be found on our web site under the Researchers tab/Informed Consents)   Sometimes a subject understands English but does not read or write English. Again, an impartial witness should document that the subject understands the research and the consent process and consented to participate. If a Subject cannot write their name can document their agreement to participate by an X on the signature line. This should also be witnessed by an impartial witness.   Please contact the IRB if you have any translation-related questions.\u00a0                                                                                        NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}]},

Translated documents should be accompanied by a verification of the accuracy of the translation and back-translation.   If a non-English-speaking subject is enrolled unexpectedly, researchers may rely on an oral translation of the English language consent form, but should take extra care in the informed consent process to ensure that the subject has understood the project. A statement in the research records (and on the English language consent form) should indicate that the translation took place, identify the translator, and document the translator's belief that the subject understands the study and the consent process. If the subject is a patient, a note about the translation should be made in the patient's research records as well. Researchers should use a short form in the subjects native language (some already translated short forms can be found on our web site under the Researchers tab/Informed Consents)   Sometimes a subject understands English but does not read or write English. Again, an impartial witness should document that the subject understands the research and the consent process and consented to participate. If a Subject cannot write their name can document their agreement to participate by an X on the signature line. This should also be witnessed by an impartial witness.   Please contact the IRB if you have any translation-related questions.\u00a0                                                                                        NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}, {"content": "Certificate in French to English Simultaneous Interpreting                                                                                          The NYU School of Professional Studies Website    Faculty    Degrees    Professional Certificates    Upcoming Events        Search Courses     Credit Course     Non-Credit Course          Site    Noncredit Courses    Faculty                                                                       Foreign Languages, Translation, and Interpreting                                                                                                       About                                     Director's Message                       Faculty                       News                                                                                    Admissions                            Academics                                     Graduate Offering                       Noncredit Offerings                                                                                    Career                            Events                                     ATISA Conference                                                                                    Initiatives                                     Startalk Teacher Training                                                                                    Testing                                     Exam Options and Results                       The Testing Process                                                                                                                                              Certificate in French to English Simultaneous Interpreting                                            Academics &rsaquo;                M.S. in Translation            Noncredit Offerings                 Certificate in Arabic          Certificate in Conference Interpreting: Chinese/English          Certificate in French          Certificate in French to English Simultaneous Interpreting          Certificate in Greek \u2014 Modern          Certificate in Italian          Certificate in Japanese          Certificate in Mandarin          Certificate in Middle Eastern Languages          Certificate in Portuguese          Certificate in Russian          Certificate in Scandinavian Languages          Certificate in Spanish          Certificate in Legal Interpreting: Spanish/English          Certificate in Medical Interpreting          Certificate in Translation                                      Ready to Proceed?
