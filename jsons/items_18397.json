Differential equations are at the heart of physics and much of chemistry.  The importance of a differential equation as a technique for determining a function is that if we know the function and possibly some of its derivatives at a particular point, then this information, together with the differential equation, can be used to determine the function over its entire domain.        As an example, consider the differential equation               for a function defined for all . This is an example of a first-order differential equation, since it involves only the first derivative of . Suppose we know that , where is some number.  This information, together with the differential equation, is sufficient to determine for all .        In fact, the equation can be solved essentially by inspection, since there is really only one function whose first derivative is equal to the function itself, and that is . However, it is worth reviewing the systematic procedure for solving the equation. The method is known as separation of variables . The method regards the  function and the variable as independent objects that can  be individually integrated, provided all of the -dependent quantities be put on one side of the equation and all of the -dependent quantities can be put on the other side. This can be easily accomplished by multiplying  both sides by and dividing by , which yields              Now, we are free to integrate both sides using the relations from the previous section:                                where and are two constants of integration. These can be combined into a third constant so that              Solving for yields              where . We see that the solution is proportion to as expected. However, we still have on undetermined constant of integration . In order to determine ,  we use the given information that . Evaluating the solution at , we have . But since , we immediately see that the undetermined constant is , and so the solution we seek that satisfies the given information is                     Next, we will consider an example of a second-order differential equation. A  second-order equation contains the second derivative of and possibly also the first derivative of . As an example, consider the simple differential equation              where is a constant. Suppose we also know that and .  Then, the equation can be solved uniquely for the required function .  The solution of such an equation is simple, since it only involves . All we need to do is integrate twice with respect to on both sides. Integrating twice will, of course, bring in two unknown constants of integration, which is why both the function and its first derivative must be known at a given point . Integrating once gives              and integrating again gives              where and are the constants of integration. Now, using the given information  . But from the solution , so we immediately see that . From the first derivative, we have , but we also know that , so we immediately have that . Using this information, the solution becomes                     As one final example, consider the second-order equation               with and . The solution procedure for such an equation is not as simple as for the first-order equation, so we will not present it here. However,  fortunately this is an equation that can also be solved by inspection. There are two functions that satisfy the property that differentiating them twice returns the function with a minus sign. These functions are and . In fact,  since the equation is linear, we can construct a solution using both   and . Consider the solution              If we differentiate this twice with respect to , we obtain  , so the equation is solved. However, we have two constants of integration and to determine. Again,  we use the given information about and .  Since and , . But since  is given, we see that . Similarly, , hence . But , so we see that .

The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, first published in 1986, describes the temporal evolution of an interface growing in a disordered environment. Solving the equation means computing exact statistics which describe the random fluctuations in the interface growth.   The success came from collaboration between NYU\u2019s Ivan Corwin and the University of Toronto\u2019s Jeremy Quastel and Gideon Amir. At the time of their work on the KPZ equation, Corwin was a doctoral student at Courant and partially supported by a grant from National Science Foundation\u2019s Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE) program. Quastel, a professor at the University of Toronto, received his Ph.D. from Courant in 1990.   Solving the KPZ equation gives researchers another tool to analyze physical disordered systems, with implications in the fields of physics, engineering, materials science, biology, and ecology. The statistics developed in the work will allow for better modeling of such complex systems.   The work also marks the first time mathematicians have obtained an exact solution to a non-linear stochastic partial differential equation--an equation that describes random development in systems dependent on both location and time. In non-linear systems, doubling an input does not necessarily double the output--for example, doubling a patient\u2019s medication may more than double the effect on the body. Non-linear systems are recognized as of great importance, yet relatively little theory has been developed to describe them. The work represents a step in that direction.   Corwin, who obtained his doctorate from Courant in 2011, currently holds the Clay Research Fellowship from the Clay Mathematics Institute as well as the Schramm Memorial Fellowship. He is presently affiliated with Clay, MIT and Microsoft Research New England.
