A course in Macroeconomics is recommended.   This course studies the origins, persistence and transformation of political institutions in Latin America and the way in which such political institutions interact with economic development.   \u2022 Why is Latin America one of the most unequal regions of the world?  \u2022 Why is it much poorer than the United States and Canada?  \u2022 Why did so many countries fall to dictatorship in the 20th Century?  \u2022 Why are Latin American states weak and unable to guarantee basic public services and law and order?  \u2022 How does democracy perform in Latin America?  \u2022 Why have poor economic policies led to repeated episodes of high inflation and unsustainable sovereign debt?   The course will compare countries to determine why some Latin American countries performed better than others. Further, it explores the challenges for Latin America into the future?   The course begins with a broad overview of various political and economic outcomes in Latin America such as development, inequality, state capacity, government business relationships, monetary and fiscal policy, law and order and democracy amongst others. Next, we discuss broad theories about Latin American politics in comparative perspective. We will then use these theories to understand major junctures in Latin American political history such as independence, the rise of authoritarianism and dictatorship, revolution, democratization, and populism and their implications for economic policy and performance.

Taking advantage of behind-the-scenes access to some of the most prestigious museums in the world and their staff, students explore various approaches to interpreting art and develop tools for appreciating their aesthetic experiences. We also look critically at the ways in which museums\u2014through their policies, programs, exhibitions, and architecture\u2014can define regional or national values, shape cultural attitudes, inform social and political views, and even affect one\u2019s understanding of the meaning of a work of art.

Sample syllabus                                                                        History of Environmental Policy - ENVST-UA 9423 or HIST-UA 9423 or POL-UA 9307 - 4 points                               This survey course will focus on the historical development of U.S. federal authority and capacity over public lands and resources, including the germination and expansion of the idea of a coherent public interest with respect to air, water, forests, landscapes, and other environmental attributes. The course will address U.S. environmental policy through several lenses, including (1) a set of two introductory sessions in which students are introduced to key terminology, concepts, and orientations toward the domain of environmental policy; (2) a core series of fourteen sessions through which we survey how historical precedents have shaped contemporary U.S. environmental policies and programs; and (3) a concluding set of three sessions through which we review several unfolding environmental policy topics (e.g., climate change, invasive species, or hydraulic fracturing).   Sample syllabus                                                                      Globalizing Social Activism: Sustainable Development in Urban Areas - UPADM-GP 9217 or SCA-UA 9617 or ENVST-UA 9417 - 4 points                               For the first time in world history, the number of people living in urban areas exceeds the number of people living in rural areas. In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

More than 16 million died, nearly 7 million of them civilians. Another 21 million were wounded and vast stretches of land were contaminated and laid to waste. The map of the world was nearly unrecognizable in its aftermath. Rather than being the war to end all wars it produced the conditions for a far more destructive one some 20 years after its conclusion. America would emerge from the war as the most powerful nation on earth but one unable to shape the peace that President Woodrow Wilson vainly had so sought to shape.   This course will explore the forces leading to America\u2019s involvement in World War I and the tensions it brought to the surface, including those between isolationism and interventionism, national security and personal freedom, labor and capital, women and men, and whites and blacks. After the war some of these tensions would erupt into open conflict and organized movements around race, ethnicity, and immigration among others. The course will rely on a variety of resources, including historical texts, novels, diaries, poems, art, and films along with possible tours of museum exhibitions to give this important episode in the nation\u2019s and the world\u2019s history the relevance and resonance it deserves.

Globalizing Social Activism: Sustainable Development in Urban Areas - UPADM-GP 9217 or SCA-UA 9617 or ENVST-UA 9417 - 4 points                               For the first time in world history, the number of people living in urban areas exceeds the number of people living in rural areas. In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.     Sample syllabus (PDF)                                Politics                                                    American Public Opinion &amp; Pressure Groups - POL-UA 9342 - 4 points                               While not required at NYU Washington, DC, we strongly recommend that students take POL-UA 300 - Power and Politics in America prior to enrolling in this course.   This class will examine the origins of public opinion research, the impact it has on news coverage, political campaigns, public discourse, elected officials, and in many cases, public policy outcomes. You will learn how to read, analyze, and critically-evaluate public opinion research; you will learn about \u201cleading\u201d and \u201ctrailing\u201d research indicators; and you will learn why \u201ccharacter\u201d attributes often matter more than \u201cperformance\u201d attributes and issue position. You will see how political campaigns, lobbyists, public relations professionals and others leverage public opinion to impact perceptions and political, policy and business outcomes. And because this course is being taught in the nation\u2019s capital, where politics and policy converge--and against the backdrop of a close and hard-fought presidential campaign\u2014we will also hear from political professionals from both political parties, congressional staffers, and journalists, who will share their insights about how they apply public opinion research to conduct campaigns, shape policy, report the news, or address business challenges.   There is an existing and established core reading list for this course, which we will use as the foundational reading for the course. Each week\u2019s lecture topic will cover the assigned reading topics and apply them to real-life examples, so that they can be more easily and clearly understood. Young people often tell me how much they enjoy politics, and sometimes ask whether it\u2019s possible for them to make a career doing politics, and what is the best way to make it happen. If you are one of those young people, this course is designed to help show you how to do it.   Classes will begin with a discussion of the reading assignment, and how it might apply to a specific aspect of public opinion research. Following the discussion on the core materials, we will analyze and discuss a political or issue poll (including tracking and other polling from the previous week, since this is the campaign season and there will be many public opinion research instruments released during the semester), and/or a guest lecturer, who could be a public opinion researcher, a campaign operative, a congressional or committee staffer, or a member of the national news media who covers campaigns.     Sample syllabus                                                                        Politics of Latin America - POL-UA 9530 or BPEP-UB 9044 - 4 points                               Only NYU Stern BPE students may register for this course under the BPEP-UB 9044 number. All other students should register under POL-UA 9530. For Non-BPE Stern, this course does not count for Stern credit, though Stern students are welcome to take this course as an elective.   Pre-requisites include successful completion of one of the following courses: (1) Comparative Politics (POL-UA 500) at the Square, (2) International Politics (POL-UA 700) at the Square, or (3) World Politics in London. A course in Macroeconomics is recommended.   This course studies the origins, persistence and transformation of political institutions in Latin America and the way in which such political institutions interact with economic development.   \u2022 Why is Latin America one of the most unequal regions of the world?  \u2022 Why is it much poorer than the United States and Canada?  \u2022 Why did so many countries fall to dictatorship in the 20th Century?  \u2022 Why are Latin American states weak and unable to guarantee basic public services and law and order?  \u2022 How does democracy perform in Latin America?  \u2022 Why have poor economic policies led to repeated episodes of high inflation and unsustainable sovereign debt?   The course will compare countries to determine why some Latin American countries performed better than others. Further, it explores the challenges for Latin America into the future?   The course begins with a broad overview of various political and economic outcomes in Latin America such as development, inequality, state capacity, government business relationships, monetary and fiscal policy, law and order and democracy amongst others. Next, we discuss broad theories about Latin American politics in comparative perspective. We will then use these theories to understand major junctures in Latin American political history such as independence, the rise of authoritarianism and dictatorship, revolution, democratization, and populism and their implications for economic policy and performance.   NYU students at the Washington study away center will be primarily form the College of Arts and Science and the Stern School of Business BS in Business and Political Economy.

The course will address U.S. environmental policy through several lenses, including (1) a set of two introductory sessions in which students are introduced to key terminology, concepts, and orientations toward the domain of environmental policy; (2) a core series of fourteen sessions through which we survey how historical precedents have shaped contemporary U.S. environmental policies and programs; and (3) a concluding set of three sessions through which we review several unfolding environmental policy topics (e.g., climate change, invasive species, or hydraulic fracturing).

Sample syllabus                                                                        History of Environmental Policy - ENVST-UA 9423 or HIST-UA 9423 or POL-UA 9307 - 4 points                               This survey course will focus on the historical development of U.S. federal authority and capacity over public lands and resources, including the germination and expansion of the idea of a coherent public interest with respect to air, water, forests, landscapes, and other environmental attributes. The course will address U.S. environmental policy through several lenses, including (1) a set of two introductory sessions in which students are introduced to key terminology, concepts, and orientations toward the domain of environmental policy; (2) a core series of fourteen sessions through which we survey how historical precedents have shaped contemporary U.S. environmental policies and programs; and (3) a concluding set of three sessions through which we review several unfolding environmental policy topics (e.g., climate change, invasive species, or hydraulic fracturing).   Sample syllabus                                                                      Globalizing Social Activism: Sustainable Development in Urban Areas - UPADM-GP 9217 or SCA-UA 9617 or ENVST-UA 9417 - 4 points                               For the first time in world history, the number of people living in urban areas exceeds the number of people living in rural areas. In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

Can also be counted for Politics major credit (internship with domestic policy focus only)   The seminar is designed to complement the internship fieldwork experience. In it we explore many different aspects of your internship site. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization, including its approach, its policies, and the context in which it operates. We will also discuss more generally the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Finally, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience and as a way to refine your own personal and professional goals.   Students who secure an internship through or with the assistance of NYU Washington, DC must confirm their spot in the program and enroll in the internship class in order to accept the internship.

More than 16 million died, nearly 7 million of them civilians. Another 21 million were wounded and vast stretches of land were contaminated and laid to waste. The map of the world was nearly unrecognizable in its aftermath. Rather than being the war to end all wars it produced the conditions for a far more destructive one some 20 years after its conclusion. America would emerge from the war as the most powerful nation on earth but one unable to shape the peace that President Woodrow Wilson vainly had so sought to shape.   This course will explore the forces leading to America\u2019s involvement in World War I and the tensions it brought to the surface, including those between isolationism and interventionism, national security and personal freedom, labor and capital, women and men, and whites and blacks. After the war some of these tensions would erupt into open conflict and organized movements around race, ethnicity, and immigration among others. The course will rely on a variety of resources, including historical texts, novels, diaries, poems, art, and films along with possible tours of museum exhibitions to give this important episode in the nation\u2019s and the world\u2019s history the relevance and resonance it deserves.

It is about truth and truthiness and how to tell the difference. It will be part overview and lecture on topics central to the course and part active reporting and writing. To take advantage of the unique Washington location and distinct attitude in the city, students will participate in press conferences and go to public hearings on Capitol Hill in reporting roles and then write news-style articles. The class will include a focus on the 2014 midterm elections. Invited guest speakers are from NASA, NOAA, environmental activist groups, energy lobbyists and Washington media.

Globalizing Social Activism: Sustainable Development in Urban Areas - UPADM-GP 9217 or SCA-UA 9617 or ENVST-UA 9417 - 4 points                               For the first time in world history, the number of people living in urban areas exceeds the number of people living in rural areas.

This class will examine the origins of public opinion research, the impact it has on news coverage, political campaigns, public discourse, elected officials, and in many cases, public policy outcomes. You will learn how to read, analyze, and critically-evaluate public opinion research; you will learn about \u201cleading\u201d and \u201ctrailing\u201d research indicators; and you will learn why \u201ccharacter\u201d attributes often matter more than \u201cperformance\u201d attributes and issue position. You will see how political campaigns, lobbyists, public relations professionals and others leverage public opinion to impact perceptions and political, policy and business outcomes. And because this course is being taught in the nation\u2019s capital, where politics and policy converge--and against the backdrop of a close and hard-fought presidential campaign\u2014we will also hear from political professionals from both political parties, congressional staffers, and journalists, who will share their insights about how they apply public opinion research to conduct campaigns, shape policy, report the news, or address business challenges.   There is an existing and established core reading list for this course, which we will use as the foundational reading for the course. Each week\u2019s lecture topic will cover the assigned reading topics and apply them to real-life examples, so that they can be more easily and clearly understood. Young people often tell me how much they enjoy politics, and sometimes ask whether it\u2019s possible for them to make a career doing politics, and what is the best way to make it happen. If you are one of those young people, this course is designed to help show you how to do it.   Classes will begin with a discussion of the reading assignment, and how it might apply to a specific aspect of public opinion research. Following the discussion on the core materials, we will analyze and discuss a political or issue poll (including tracking and other polling from the previous week, since this is the campaign season and there will be many public opinion research instruments released during the semester), and/or a guest lecturer, who could be a public opinion researcher, a campaign operative, a congressional or committee staffer, or a member of the national news media who covers campaigns.     Sample syllabus                                                                        Politics of Latin America - POL-UA 9530 or BPEP-UB 9044 - 4 points                               Only NYU Stern BPE students may register for this course under the BPEP-UB 9044 number. All other students should register under POL-UA 9530. For Non-BPE Stern, this course does not count for Stern credit, though Stern students are welcome to take this course as an elective.   Pre-requisites include successful completion of one of the following courses: (1) Comparative Politics (POL-UA 500) at the Square, (2) International Politics (POL-UA 700) at the Square, or (3) World Politics in London. A course in Macroeconomics is recommended.   This course studies the origins, persistence and transformation of political institutions in Latin America and the way in which such political institutions interact with economic development.   \u2022 Why is Latin America one of the most unequal regions of the world?  \u2022 Why is it much poorer than the United States and Canada?  \u2022 Why did so many countries fall to dictatorship in the 20th Century?  \u2022 Why are Latin American states weak and unable to guarantee basic public services and law and order?  \u2022 How does democracy perform in Latin America?  \u2022 Why have poor economic policies led to repeated episodes of high inflation and unsustainable sovereign debt?   The course will compare countries to determine why some Latin American countries performed better than others. Further, it explores the challenges for Latin America into the future?   The course begins with a broad overview of various political and economic outcomes in Latin America such as development, inequality, state capacity, government business relationships, monetary and fiscal policy, law and order and democracy amongst others. Next, we discuss broad theories about Latin American politics in comparative perspective. We will then use these theories to understand major junctures in Latin American political history such as independence, the rise of authoritarianism and dictatorship, revolution, democratization, and populism and their implications for economic policy and performance.   NYU students at the Washington study away center will be primarily form the College of Arts and Science and the Stern School of Business BS in Business and Political Economy.

The course will address U.S. environmental policy through several lenses, including (1) a set of two introductory sessions in which students are introduced to key terminology, concepts, and orientations toward the domain of environmental policy; (2) a core series of fourteen sessions through which we survey how historical precedents have shaped contemporary U.S. environmental policies and programs; and (3) a concluding set of three sessions through which we review several unfolding environmental policy topics (e.g., climate change, invasive species, or hydraulic fracturing).

Students will learn about the unique history of the city by exploring how it was founded, designed, governed and developed to become an international capitol. We will examine components of culture and intercultural competence as we learn how diverse populations maintain their cultural identity, support their communities and integrate into the fabric of the city. The portrayal of the Washington, DC in film will be presented to help students understand how this reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. The course will also examine how individuals leverage their positions through institutions and organizations to ignite change in areas such as environmental sustainability, political activism, and international causes. Stakeholders from United States and foreign government agencies, domestic and international organizations, the non-profit and for-profit sectors, as well as public and private groups will deliver guest lectures and join interactive discussions. These sessions will be developed in collaboration with faculty from major pathway disciplines for the site and complimented by field experiences including a walking tour and museum visit in Washington, DC. Students will consider the current state of affairs and be challenged to imagine how the future might be different. Respectful, factual, passionate and influential dialogue will be encouraged and expected.

In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

C. From the populism of the Depression era films of Frank Capra to post-WWII paranoia, the cynical films of the post-Watergate era and more recent depictions of media-constructed realities, we explore the ways film reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. At the same time, students learn how filmmakers create meaning through the building blocks of editing and cinematography and the manipulation of audience expectations of genres, stars, and \u201cHollywood endings.\u201d     Sample Syllabus (PDF)                              Gallatin                                                    Internship Seminar &amp; Fieldwork - NODEP-UA 9982 or INDIV-UG 9600 - 4 points                               Can be counted for SCA-UA Internship credit (government and non-profit placements only).

How this relationship between the globe\u2019s sole superpower and a rapidly emerging contender evolves not only will affect their state-to-state interactions but also will affect the daily lives of their citizens, the nations of the Asia-Pacific region, and, inevitably, will have global repercussions. To understand and fully appreciate the current status of US-PRC relations, and in order to envision the possible course this relationship might follow, an examination of their past interactions is necessary. To provide such a foundation, this course will survey major trends, policies, and events that played a role in shaping the Sino-American path to the present and will continue to influence the path to the future.   The format of the course will be discussion. Each week, the class will begin with a general review of the historical context of the period being examined, followed by a student-led discussion of the week\u2019s assigned readings.

It will be part overview and lecture on topics central to the course and part active reporting and writing. Spin is the Washington art of taking something and making it seem truth-y even when it\u2019s not quite factual. This is a user\u2019s guide for reporters and non-journalists alike. How to spot and dodge the misleading, the incomplete truth, along with the history and reasoning behind manipulation of facts. Advice from those who practice spin and those who successfully avoid it and what it\u2019s like to be stuck as a victim of spin. To take advantage of the unique Washington location and distinct attitude in the city, students will participate in press conferences and go to public hearings on Capitol Hill in reporting roles and then write news-style articles. Invited guest speakers are from NASA, NOAA, the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy, environmental activist groups, energy lobbyists and Washington media. The intersection of the media with science, politics and economics on the issue of global warming will be a focal point of this course and how it is all spun.

The course will combine  theory and practice, and will examine case studies from both domestic and international  campaigns. Through presentations and a multi-media framework, we will examine campaign  strategy and media in practice and the key factors and events, like debates, that are part of a  successful strategy and campaign that moves voters.   The format of the course will be multi-dimensional including lectures, discussions, interactive  activities, documentary films, television commercials, insider campaign video, and other  media sources. The instructor will use a keynote presentation format to review the material  and present video clips and commercials to lead and inform class discussions.

This is true not only for Arab governments, but for decision-makers and analysts in the West.   The goal of this course will be to examine the role public opinion is playing in shaping on-going developments in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, the relationships between several Arab states and Iran and Turkey, and efforts to achieve a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.     We will explore the use of up-to-date polling in all these countries to better understand how Arabs: see themselves, view their governments, prioritize their political concerns, and get and use information. We will also examine the misconceptions about Arabs that have long shaped policies that the West has adopted toward the Arab World - leading to the deep divide that defines our current relationship with that region.

C. From the populism of the Depression era films of Frank Capra to post-WWII paranoia, the cynical films of the post-Watergate era and more recent depictions of media-constructed realities, we explore the ways film reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. At the same time, students learn how filmmakers create meaning through the building blocks of editing and cinematography and the manipulation of audience expectations of genres, stars, and \u201cHollywood endings.\u201d     Sample Syllabus (PDF)                              Economics                                                    Financial Crises - ECON-UA 9225 - 4 points                               Prerequisite: Economic Principles I &amp; II (ECON-UA 1 &amp; ECON-UA 2) or equivalents     This course will examine the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, including the hypotheses underlying the origins and propagation of the crisis, and the policy responses that occurred along a variety of dimensions. Topics covered will range from the role of financial institutions (banking and shadow banking) and capital markets, overview of emergency measures taken including monetary and fiscal policy, and regulatory reform both domestic and abroad.   The course will be a combination of lecture, discussion and special meetings with outside participants who have played a role in the financial crisis and policy response.

In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

In studying the governmental powers created and limited by the American Constitution, the course will be broken into three parts, with each section covering one of the three branches of the American political system \u2013 the judicial, legislative, and executive branches. The course will reveal the particular ways our understanding of each branch\u2019s powers have constituted, and been constituted by, American practices of constitutional democracy. Our studies will also have a philosophical component, in exploring the fundamental nature of law and what it means for law to bind political actors. In addition, the course will have a distinctly legal dimension, drawing from Supreme Court opinions to illuminate how constitutional controversies are adjudicated. Through the course, therefore, students will come to see the political, philosophical, and legal features of American constitutional law, and the deep connections between among these components.

It will be part overview and lecture on topics central to the course and part active reporting and writing. Spin is the Washington art of taking something and making it seem truth-y even when it\u2019s not quite factual. This is a user\u2019s guide for reporters and non-journalists alike. How to spot and dodge the misleading, the incomplete truth, along with the history and reasoning behind manipulation of facts. Advice from those who practice spin and those who successfully avoid it and what it\u2019s like to be stuck as a victim of spin. To take advantage of the unique Washington location and distinct attitude in the city, students will participate in press conferences and go to public hearings on Capitol Hill in reporting roles and then write news-style articles. Invited guest speakers are from NASA, NOAA, the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy, environmental activist groups, energy lobbyists and Washington media. The intersection of the media with science, politics and economics on the issue of global warming will be a focal point of this course and how it is all spun.

This is true not only for Arab governments, but for decision-makers and analysts in the West.   The goal of this course will be to examine the role public opinion is playing in shaping on-going developments in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, the relationships between several Arab states and Iran and Turkey, and efforts to achieve a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.     We will explore the use of up-to-date polling in all these countries to better understand how Arabs: see themselves, view their governments, prioritize their political concerns, and get and use information. We will also examine the misconceptions about Arabs that have long shaped policies that the West has adopted toward the Arab World - leading to the deep divide that defines our current relationship with that region.

The course will combine  theory and practice, and will examine case studies from both domestic and international  campaigns. Through presentations and a multi-media framework, we will examine campaign  strategy and media in practice and the key factors and events, like debates, that are part of a  successful strategy and campaign that moves voters.   The format of the course will be multi-dimensional including lectures, discussions, interactive  activities, documentary films, television commercials, insider campaign video, and other  media sources. The instructor will use a keynote presentation format to review the material  and present video clips and commercials to lead and inform class discussions.

Exact description and syllabus will differ slightly.   This course is a gateway into the complex process of public policymaking, involving political and moral choices, along with analytic, administrative, historical, social and even psychological aspects. The course explores how the real world contexts in which public policymaking plays out \u2013 whether at the city, national, or global level \u2013 shape the ends, means and prospects for government action; and how patterns in policymaking in turn channel and shape today\u2019s politics.

This course studies the origins, persistence and transformation of political institutions in Latin America and the way in which such political institutions interact with economic development.   \u2022 Why is Latin America one of the most unequal regions of the world?  \u2022 Why is it much poorer than the United States and Canada?  \u2022 Why did so many countries fall to dictatorship in the 20th Century?  \u2022 Why are Latin American states weak and unable to guarantee basic public services and law and order?  \u2022 How does democracy perform in Latin America?  \u2022 Why have poor economic policies led to repeated episodes of high inflation and unsustainable sovereign debt?   The course will compare countries to determine why some Latin American countries performed better than others. Further, it explores the challenges for Latin America into the future?   The course begins with a broad overview of various political and economic outcomes in Latin America such as development, inequality, state capacity, government business relationships, monetary and fiscal policy, law and order and democracy amongst others.

The course will address U.S. environmental policy through several lenses, including (1) a set of two introductory sessions in which students are introduced to key terminology, concepts, and orientations toward the domain of environmental policy; (2) a core series of fourteen sessions through which we survey how historical precedents have shaped contemporary U.S. environmental policies and programs; and (3) a concluding set of three sessions through which we review several unfolding environmental policy topics (e.g., climate change, invasive species, or hydraulic fracturing).   Sample syllabus                                                                      Globalizing Social Activism: Sustainable Development in Urban Areas - UPADM-GP 9217 or SCA-UA 9617 or ENVST-UA 9417 - 4 points                               For the first time in world history, the number of people living in urban areas exceeds the number of people living in rural areas. In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

More than 16 million died, nearly 7 million of them civilians. Another 21 million were wounded and vast stretches of land were contaminated and laid to waste. The map of the world was nearly unrecognizable in its aftermath. Rather than being the war to end all wars it produced the conditions for a far more destructive one some 20 years after its conclusion. America would emerge from the war as the most powerful nation on earth but one unable to shape the peace that President Woodrow Wilson vainly had so sought to shape.   This course will explore the forces leading to America\u2019s involvement in World War I and the tensions it brought to the surface, including those between isolationism and interventionism, national security and personal freedom, labor and capital, women and men, and whites and blacks. After the war some of these tensions would erupt into open conflict and organized movements around race, ethnicity, and immigration among others. The course will rely on a variety of resources, including historical texts, novels, diaries, poems, art, and films along with possible tours of museum exhibitions to give this important episode in the nation\u2019s and the world\u2019s history the relevance and resonance it deserves.

This class will examine the origins of public opinion research, the impact it has on news coverage, political campaigns, public discourse, elected officials, and in many cases, public policy outcomes. You will learn how to read, analyze, and critically-evaluate public opinion research; you will learn about \u201cleading\u201d and \u201ctrailing\u201d research indicators; and you will learn why \u201ccharacter\u201d attributes often matter more than \u201cperformance\u201d attributes and issue position. You will see how political campaigns, lobbyists, public relations professionals and others leverage public opinion to impact perceptions and political, policy and business outcomes. And because this course is being taught in the nation\u2019s capital, where politics and policy converge--and against the backdrop of a close and hard-fought presidential campaign\u2014we will also hear from political professionals from both political parties, congressional staffers, and journalists, who will share their insights about how they apply public opinion research to conduct campaigns, shape policy, report the news, or address business challenges.   There is an existing and established core reading list for this course, which we will use as the foundational reading for the course. Each week\u2019s lecture topic will cover the assigned reading topics and apply them to real-life examples, so that they can be more easily and clearly understood. Young people often tell me how much they enjoy politics, and sometimes ask whether it\u2019s possible for them to make a career doing politics, and what is the best way to make it happen. If you are one of those young people, this course is designed to help show you how to do it.   Classes will begin with a discussion of the reading assignment, and how it might apply to a specific aspect of public opinion research. Following the discussion on the core materials, we will analyze and discuss a political or issue poll (including tracking and other polling from the previous week, since this is the campaign season and there will be many public opinion research instruments released during the semester), and/or a guest lecturer, who could be a public opinion researcher, a campaign operative, a congressional or committee staffer, or a member of the national news media who covers campaigns.

The course will address U.S. environmental policy through several lenses, including (1) a set of two introductory sessions in which students are introduced to key terminology, concepts, and orientations toward the domain of environmental policy; (2) a core series of fourteen sessions through which we survey how historical precedents have shaped contemporary U.S. environmental policies and programs; and (3) a concluding set of three sessions through which we review several unfolding environmental policy topics (e.g., climate change, invasive species, or hydraulic fracturing).   Sample syllabus                                Public Policy                                                    Globalizing Social Activism: Sustainable Development in Urban Areas - UPADM-GP 9217 or SCA-UA 9617 or ENVST-UA 9417 - 4 points                               For the first time in world history, the number of people living in urban areas exceeds the number of people living in rural areas. In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

Students will learn about the unique history of the city by exploring how it was founded, designed, governed and developed to become an international capitol. We will examine components of culture and intercultural competence as we learn how diverse populations maintain their cultural identity, support their communities and integrate into the fabric of the city. The portrayal of the Washington, DC in film will be presented to help students understand how this reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. The course will also examine how individuals leverage their positions through institutions and organizations to ignite change in areas such as environmental sustainability, political activism, and international causes. Stakeholders from United States and foreign government agencies, domestic and international organizations, the non-profit and for-profit sectors, as well as public and private groups will deliver guest lectures and join interactive discussions. These sessions will be developed in collaboration with faculty from major pathway disciplines for the site and complimented by field experiences including a walking tour and museum visit in Washington, DC. Students will consider the current state of affairs and be challenged to imagine how the future might be different. Respectful, factual, passionate and influential dialogue will be encouraged and expected.

C. From the populism of the Depression era films of Frank Capra to post-WWII paranoia, the cynical films of the post-Watergate era and more recent depictions of media-constructed realities, we explore the ways film reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. At the same time, students learn how filmmakers create meaning through the building blocks of editing and cinematography and the manipulation of audience expectations of genres, stars, and \u201cHollywood endings.\u201d     Sample Syllabus (PDF)                              Gallatin                                                    Internship Seminar &amp; Fieldwork - NODEP-UA 9982 or INDIV-UG 9600 - 4 points                               Can be counted for SCA-UA Internship credit (government and non-profit placements only). Can also be counted for Politics major credit (internship with domestic policy focus only)   The seminar is designed to complement the internship fieldwork experience. In it we explore many different aspects of your internship site. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization, including its approach, its policies, and the context in which it operates. We will also discuss more generally the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Finally, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience and as a way to refine your own personal and professional goals.   Students who secure an internship through or with the assistance of NYU Washington, DC must confirm their spot in the program and enroll in the internship class in order to accept the internship. Students are required to pursue 10 hours/ week in their internships to earn course credit; however NYU Washington, DC advises that students pursue ~20 hrs/ week in internship commitments.

How this relationship between the globe\u2019s sole superpower and a rapidly emerging contender evolves not only will affect their state-to-state interactions but also will affect the daily lives of their citizens, the nations of the Asia-Pacific region, and, inevitably, will have global repercussions. To understand and fully appreciate the current status of US-PRC relations, and in order to envision the possible course this relationship might follow, an examination of their past interactions is necessary. To provide such a foundation, this course will survey major trends, policies, and events that played a role in shaping the Sino-American path to the present and will continue to influence the path to the future.   The format of the course will be discussion. Each week, the class will begin with a general review of the historical context of the period being examined, followed by a student-led discussion of the week\u2019s assigned readings.

It will be part overview and lecture on topics central to the course and part active reporting and writing. Spin is the Washington art of taking something and making it seem truth-y even when it\u2019s not quite factual. This is a user\u2019s guide for reporters and non-journalists alike. How to spot and dodge the misleading, the incomplete truth, along with the history and reasoning behind manipulation of facts. Advice from those who practice spin and those who successfully avoid it and what it\u2019s like to be stuck as a victim of spin. To take advantage of the unique Washington location and distinct attitude in the city, students will participate in press conferences and go to public hearings on Capitol Hill in reporting roles and then write news-style articles. Invited guest speakers are from NASA, NOAA, the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy, environmental activist groups, energy lobbyists and Washington media. The intersection of the media with science, politics and economics on the issue of global warming will be a focal point of this course and how it is all spun.

The course will combine  theory and practice, and will examine case studies from both domestic and international  campaigns. Through presentations and a multi-media framework, we will examine campaign  strategy and media in practice and the key factors and events, like debates, that are part of a  successful strategy and campaign that moves voters.   The format of the course will be multi-dimensional including lectures, discussions, interactive  activities, documentary films, television commercials, insider campaign video, and other  media sources. The instructor will use a keynote presentation format to review the material  and present video clips and commercials to lead and inform class discussions.

This is true not only for Arab governments, but for decision-makers and analysts in the West.   The goal of this course will be to examine the role public opinion is playing in shaping on-going developments in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, the relationships between several Arab states and Iran and Turkey, and efforts to achieve a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.     We will explore the use of up-to-date polling in all these countries to better understand how Arabs: see themselves, view their governments, prioritize their political concerns, and get and use information. We will also examine the misconceptions about Arabs that have long shaped policies that the West has adopted toward the Arab World - leading to the deep divide that defines our current relationship with that region.

Exact description and syllabus will differ slightly.   This course is a gateway into the complex process of public policymaking, involving political and moral choices, along with analytic, administrative, historical, social and even psychological aspects. The course explores how the real world contexts in which public policymaking plays out \u2013 whether at the city, national, or global level \u2013 shape the ends, means and prospects for government action; and how patterns in policymaking in turn channel and shape today\u2019s politics.

Students will learn about the unique history of the city by exploring how it was founded, designed, governed and developed to become an international capitol. We will examine components of culture and intercultural competence as we learn how diverse populations maintain their cultural identity, support their communities and integrate into the fabric of the city. The portrayal of the Washington, DC in film will be presented to help students understand how this reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. The course will also examine how individuals leverage their positions through institutions and organizations to ignite change in areas such as environmental sustainability, political activism, and international causes. Stakeholders from United States and foreign government agencies, domestic and international organizations, the non-profit and for-profit sectors, as well as public and private groups will deliver guest lectures and join interactive discussions. These sessions will be developed in collaboration with faculty from major pathway disciplines for the site and complimented by field experiences including a walking tour and museum visit in Washington, DC.

Encompasses accounting concepts from the point of view of the corporate investor and business management. Accounting procedures are discussed to facilitate the comprehension of the recording, summarizing, and reporting of business transactions. The basic principles of asset valuation and revenue and cost recognition are presented. Various asset, liability, and capital accounts are studied in detail with emphasis on an analytical and interpretive approach. The area of financial accounting is further analyzed through a discussion of the concepts and underlying financial statement analysis and the exposition of funds flow.

C. From the populism of the Depression era films of Frank Capra to post-WWII paranoia, the cynical films of the post-Watergate era and more recent depictions of media-constructed realities, we explore the ways film reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. At the same time, students learn how filmmakers create meaning through the building blocks of editing and cinematography and the manipulation of audience expectations of genres, stars, and \u201cHollywood endings.\u201d     Sample Syllabus (PDF)                              Economics                                                    Financial Crises - ECON-UA 9225 - 4 points                               Prerequisite: Economic Principles I &amp; II (ECON-UA 1 &amp; ECON-UA 2) or equivalents     This course will examine the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, including the hypotheses underlying the origins and propagation of the crisis, and the policy responses that occurred along a variety of dimensions. Topics covered will range from the role of financial institutions (banking and shadow banking) and capital markets, overview of emergency measures taken including monetary and fiscal policy, and regulatory reform both domestic and abroad.   The course will be a combination of lecture, discussion and special meetings with outside participants who have played a role in the financial crisis and policy response.   Sample Syllabus                                Environmental Studies          Note, students can also satisfy Environmental Studies major requirements through the Internship Seminar &amp; Fieldwork course.                                                    Globalizing Social Activism: Sustainable Development in Urban Areas - UPADM-GP 9217 or SCA-UA 9617 or ENVST-UA 9417 - 4 points                               For the first time in world history, the number of people living in urban areas exceeds the number of people living in rural areas. In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

In it we explore many different aspects of your internship site. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization, including its approach, its policies, and the context in which it operates. We will also discuss more generally the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Finally, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience and as a way to refine your own personal and professional goals.

Korea and Vietnam, the foreign policy of the Depression Era and of the Marshall Plan, the Open Door in China, and other aspects of United States policy and policymaking will also be illuminated. The course will demonstrate the value of utilizing multiple levels of analysis to understand the driving forces that underlie historical developments.

In studying the governmental powers created and limited by the American Constitution, the course will be broken into three parts, with each section covering one of the three branches of the American political system \u2013 the judicial, legislative, and executive branches. The course will reveal the particular ways our understanding of each branch\u2019s powers have constituted, and been constituted by, American practices of constitutional democracy. Our studies will also have a philosophical component, in exploring the fundamental nature of law and what it means for law to bind political actors. In addition, the course will have a distinctly legal dimension, drawing from Supreme Court opinions to illuminate how constitutional controversies are adjudicated. Through the course, therefore, students will come to see the political, philosophical, and legal features of American constitutional law, and the deep connections between among these components.

Sample syllabus (PDF)                              Journalism                                                    Methods and Practice: Truthiness, Spin, Media &amp; Politics\u00a0- JOUR-UA 9202 - 4 points                               This will be a hands-on course examining the idea of truth and spin in Washington D.C., politics, governance, journalism, science and society. It will be part overview and lecture on topics central to the course and part active reporting and writing. Spin is the Washington art of taking something and making it seem truth-y even when it\u2019s not quite factual. This is a user\u2019s guide for reporters and non-journalists alike. How to spot and dodge the misleading, the incomplete truth, along with the history and reasoning behind manipulation of facts. Advice from those who practice spin and those who successfully avoid it and what it\u2019s like to be stuck as a victim of spin. To take advantage of the unique Washington location and distinct attitude in the city, students will participate in press conferences and go to public hearings on Capitol Hill in reporting roles and then write news-style articles. Invited guest speakers are from NASA, NOAA, the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy, environmental activist groups, energy lobbyists and Washington media. The intersection of the media with science, politics and economics on the issue of global warming will be a focal point of this course and how it is all spun.

This is true not only for Arab governments, but for decision-makers and analysts in the West.   The goal of this course will be to examine the role public opinion is playing in shaping on-going developments in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, the relationships between several Arab states and Iran and Turkey, and efforts to achieve a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.     We will explore the use of up-to-date polling in all these countries to better understand how Arabs: see themselves, view their governments, prioritize their political concerns, and get and use information. We will also examine the misconceptions about Arabs that have long shaped policies that the West has adopted toward the Arab World - leading to the deep divide that defines our current relationship with that region.

The course will combine  theory and practice, and will examine case studies from both domestic and international  campaigns. Through presentations and a multi-media framework, we will examine campaign  strategy and media in practice and the key factors and events, like debates, that are part of a  successful strategy and campaign that moves voters.   The format of the course will be multi-dimensional including lectures, discussions, interactive  activities, documentary films, television commercials, insider campaign video, and other  media sources. The instructor will use a keynote presentation format to review the material  and present video clips and commercials to lead and inform class discussions.

Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

Exact description and syllabus will differ slightly.   This course is a gateway into the complex process of public policymaking, involving political and moral choices, along with analytic, administrative, historical, social and even psychological aspects. The course explores how the real world contexts in which public policymaking plays out \u2013 whether at the city, national, or global level \u2013 shape the ends, means and prospects for government action; and how patterns in policymaking in turn channel and shape today\u2019s politics.
