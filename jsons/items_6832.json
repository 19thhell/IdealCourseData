It is a portal to many web-based services and tools.  Although NYUHome is also maintained by Information Technology Services, it is a separate service from this ITS website. There is, however, a great deal of cooperation between the two services.    Using a web browser to log into NYUHome, you are able to access NYU Email ,   NYU Calendar , Albert, NYU Classes ,   NYU Lists , classes, administrative and research tools, and more, bringing many of your NYU resources together on one site. You  can also customize your NYUHome screen to fit your needs and interests. Different resources, such as reference searches or a schedule  of campus events, are provided through channels, and you can choose which channels you want to display on your screen.    Accessing NYUHome   To access your NYUHome account for the first time, you will need to activate it using your University ID and your NetID. From any Internet-connected computer, go to http://start.nyu.edu , enter your NetID, and follow the instructions to set up a password and access NYUHome.    To access NYUHome once your service is activated, go to http://home.nyu.edu and sign in using  your NetID and the password you chose. You can access NYUHome and most of the resources it links to from virtually any location in the world  using a web browser.    Getting Help with NYUHome   Search the ServiceLink knowledge base for help and additional information with NYUHome and most of the services accessed through NYUHome. If you can't find the information you need, contact the   IT Service Desk for assistance.    Page last reviewed: July 31, 2014"}]},

It is a portal to many web-based services and tools.  Although NYUHome is also maintained by Information Technology Services, it is a separate service from this ITS website. There is, however, a great deal of cooperation between the two services.    Using a web browser to log into NYUHome, you are able to access NYU Email ,   NYU Calendar , Albert, NYU Classes ,   NYU Lists , classes, administrative and research tools, and more, bringing many of your NYU resources together on one site. You  can also customize your NYUHome screen to fit your needs and interests. Different resources, such as reference searches or a schedule  of campus events, are provided through channels, and you can choose which channels you want to display on your screen.    Accessing NYUHome   To access your NYUHome account for the first time, you will need to activate it using your University ID and your NetID. From any Internet-connected computer, go to http://start.nyu.edu , enter your NetID, and follow the instructions to set up a password and access NYUHome.    To access NYUHome once your service is activated, go to http://home.nyu.edu and sign in using  your NetID and the password you chose. You can access NYUHome and most of the resources it links to from virtually any location in the world  using a web browser.    Getting Help with NYUHome   Search the ServiceLink knowledge base for help and additional information with NYUHome and most of the services accessed through NYUHome. If you can't find the information you need, contact the   IT Service Desk for assistance.
