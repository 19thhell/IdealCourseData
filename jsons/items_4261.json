Sample Syllabus                                                                    Modern Movements in Italian Art, 1860-2012 - ARTH-UA 9850 - 4 points                               This course investigates the scope of Italian artistic ingenuity during the past century and a half and puts it in reference to contemporary art movements. Due to Italy\u2019s strong historical legacy, modern Italian artists and architects have gone through an intense struggle to break from academic models. Initially the new movements, such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau, arrived from outside sources, yet beginning with I Macchiaoli, followed by the Futurists, Neo\u2013 Rationalists, Arte Povera, and Transavanguardia, Italians were frequently originators of the discourses of new artistic movements. The tide of trends periodically seceded from traditions and then returned to them in critical ways, seen in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico or the wistful pavilions of Aldo Rossi. During the past decade Italy has produced several new institutions for contemporary art and architecture, including MART in Rovereto, the Museo del \u2018900 (Museum of the 20th century) in Milan, and MAXXI (Museum of the Arts of the 21st century), devoted specifically to both art and architecture, broadening the historical and critical perspective and providing a stimulus for the art of the future.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

They struggle to direct public debate towards clearer visions of the day\u2019s challenges and to  keep our minds open to wider possibilities and different explanations. They excel at pointing out  the common fallacies of our age. Most often dissenters, in the minority in their own countries,  public intellectuals are deeply committed to independent thinking at (often) considerable  personal sacrifice. Simultaneously observers and participants, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d,  consensus builders and social critics, thinkers and occasionally active politicians, these public  figures are central to modern democratic dialogue. Not surprisingly, considerable controversy  accompanies the appearance of (many) university-trained professionals in the public sphere, and  the discussions they initiate have been characterized quite often by bitter and personal attacks.   This course examines the work and contributions of several prominent intellectuals in crucial  periods of contemporary European history over the 20th and 21st centuries, and considers  their important roles in public debate, policy-making and the political process. Their writings  focus on the important issues of their time \u2013 war and peace, economic instability, dictatorship,  European integration, organized crime, the collapse of European communism and post-industrial  capitalism \u2013 concerns that are still very much of relevance and debate today. Finally, the course  also considers the \u201ctheory\u201d of public intellectuals by looking at the writings on their own place  in society and on the models of participation that others, like them, have offered in the past.   The class has a seminar format with discussion of the principal works of a number of public  intellectuals and their biographies framing the weekly sessions. We will also explore the  historical context of these works and consider, with the advantage of hindsight, the relative  accuracy of the positions assumed in the past \u2013 did they really come close to \u201ctelling the  truth\u201d as we understand it today? The reactions of the public, of political leaders, and of other  prominent individuals are also examined to better consider the impact of these intellectuals\u2019  contributions and to appreciate the measure of their commitment to freedom and open  discussion.

Italy is well-known for being a family centered society.  What are the causes and consequences of this phenomenon? Since the 1960s, the family has  undergone a series of changes, due to the women\u2019s movement, decrease of marriages, fall of  birthrate, etc. Is the family loosing its centrality in Italy? According to some scholars, the family  is still one of the few shared values in Italy. The course will investigate the social function of the  family in Italy, from the political unification of the country to the present. We will also analyze  ideas of femininity and masculinity conveyed by the media and their connections to the idea  of Italianness. The imagined Italian community was constructed on the site of the female body  which was meant to epitomize a series of values such as fertility, health, prosperity, purity,  tradition, etc. The course will also map the condition of women and LGBT people in Italy today.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world.

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. This course will focus on Italian cities, including Florence. Conducted in English.

The approach is multidisciplinary and aims at a comprehensive survey of the music theatre in the context of the Italian cultural heritage. Literary sources, musico-dramatic features, vocal styles are studied in connection with major works that best represent trends and genres in the Italian operatic tradition. Students are expected to master the distinctive characteristics of such genres as favola in musica, intermezzo, opera seria, opera buffa, grand opera, dramma lirico, and the basic elements of Italian versification. Students listen to and watch recorded operas and attend performances in Florence or other Italian cities.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      Photography of Architecture, City and Territory - IPHTI-UT 1210 - 4 points                               City, territory and architecture have been, from the beginning of photography, privileged objects for its practice. Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.     Sample Syllabus                                Politics                                                  Comparative Politics- POL-UA 9500- 4 points                               This course will introduce students to the study of comparative politics, which is defined as the study of domestic politics anywhere in the world. As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.     Sample Syllabus                                                                         Acton Seminar: Policies and Politics of the European Union - POL-UA 9595 - 4 points                               The European Union is a unique and strange entity. It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

The topics covered in the first part will include the US vision of the new international order, the end of the old European balance of power, the Cold War and the division of Europe, the building of the Western alliance, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. The second part of the course will concentrate on contemporary issues ranging from the evolution of NATO to trade relations and the role of the dollar and the euro in the international monetary system.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

We will introduce the travelogue Il Milione (The Travels of Marco Polo), discussing the figure of the famous merchant and traveler Polo. Moreover, analyzing the Decameron of Boccaccio, we will consider the role of merchants and travelers in some of his novelle. We will highlight metaphors of traveling in the tradition of amor cortese (courtly love), stressing some images in the poems of the Sicilian and Tuscan School and in the Stil Novo, reading as well from Dante's Rime and Petrarch's Canzoniere, and not forgetting the Women Poets, such as Gaspara Stampa. Finally, we will discuss fantastic journeying to the Moon and spatial movements in the chivalric epic of the Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto. Through these texts, and constant cross references to the contemporary Italian classics (Calvino and Eco among others), we will study the origins of Italian Literature.

Due to Italy\u2019s strong historical legacy, modern Italian artists and architects have gone through an intense struggle to break from academic models. Initially the new movements, such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau, arrived from outside sources, yet beginning with I Macchiaoli, followed by the Futurists, Neo\u2013 Rationalists, Arte Povera, and Transavanguardia, Italians were frequently originators of the discourses of new artistic movements. The tide of trends periodically seceded from traditions and then returned to them in critical ways, seen in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico or the wistful pavilions of Aldo Rossi. During the past decade Italy has produced several new institutions for contemporary art and architecture, including MART in Rovereto, the Museo del \u2018900 (Museum of the 20th century) in Milan, and MAXXI (Museum of the Arts of the 21st century), devoted specifically to both art and architecture, broadening the historical and critical perspective and providing a stimulus for the art of the future.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

They struggle to direct public debate towards clearer visions of the day\u2019s challenges and to  keep our minds open to wider possibilities and different explanations. They excel at pointing out  the common fallacies of our age. Most often dissenters, in the minority in their own countries,  public intellectuals are deeply committed to independent thinking at (often) considerable  personal sacrifice. Simultaneously observers and participants, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d,  consensus builders and social critics, thinkers and occasionally active politicians, these public  figures are central to modern democratic dialogue. Not surprisingly, considerable controversy  accompanies the appearance of (many) university-trained professionals in the public sphere, and  the discussions they initiate have been characterized quite often by bitter and personal attacks.   This course examines the work and contributions of several prominent intellectuals in crucial  periods of contemporary European history over the 20th and 21st centuries, and considers  their important roles in public debate, policy-making and the political process. Their writings  focus on the important issues of their time \u2013 war and peace, economic instability, dictatorship,  European integration, organized crime, the collapse of European communism and post-industrial  capitalism \u2013 concerns that are still very much of relevance and debate today. Finally, the course  also considers the \u201ctheory\u201d of public intellectuals by looking at the writings on their own place  in society and on the models of participation that others, like them, have offered in the past.   The class has a seminar format with discussion of the principal works of a number of public  intellectuals and their biographies framing the weekly sessions. We will also explore the  historical context of these works and consider, with the advantage of hindsight, the relative  accuracy of the positions assumed in the past \u2013 did they really come close to \u201ctelling the  truth\u201d as we understand it today? The reactions of the public, of political leaders, and of other  prominent individuals are also examined to better consider the impact of these intellectuals\u2019  contributions and to appreciate the measure of their commitment to freedom and open  discussion.

Italy is well-known for being a family centered society.  What are the causes and consequences of this phenomenon? Since the 1960s, the family has  undergone a series of changes, due to the women\u2019s movement, decrease of marriages, fall of  birthrate, etc. Is the family loosing its centrality in Italy? According to some scholars, the family  is still one of the few shared values in Italy. The course will investigate the social function of the  family in Italy, from the political unification of the country to the present. We will also analyze  ideas of femininity and masculinity conveyed by the media and their connections to the idea  of Italianness. The imagined Italian community was constructed on the site of the female body  which was meant to epitomize a series of values such as fertility, health, prosperity, purity,  tradition, etc. The course will also map the condition of women and LGBT people in Italy today.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world.

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. This course will focus on Italian cities, including Florence. Conducted in English.

The approach is multidisciplinary and aims at a comprehensive survey of the music theatre in the context of the Italian cultural heritage. Literary sources, musico-dramatic features, vocal styles are studied in connection with major works that best represent trends and genres in the Italian operatic tradition. Students are expected to master the distinctive characteristics of such genres as favola in musica, intermezzo, opera seria, opera buffa, grand opera, dramma lirico, and the basic elements of Italian versification. Students listen to and watch recorded operas and attend performances in Florence or other Italian cities.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      Photography of Architecture, City and Territory - IPHTI-UT 1210 - 4 points                               City, territory and architecture have been, from the beginning of photography, privileged objects for its practice. Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.     Sample Syllabus                                Politics                                                  Comparative Politics- POL-UA 9500- 4 points                               This course will introduce students to the study of comparative politics, which is defined as the study of domestic politics anywhere in the world. As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.

It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

In this course we will read poetry out loud in order to show how poetry is founded on rhythm and the repetition of phonetic and syntactic elements. This pragmatic approach will not only allow students to improve their pronunciation, but also to understand the poetic genre, the quality of poets\u2019 language, their interest in etymology, metaphor, imagery, etc. Close readings, paraphrase and translations will allow students to considerably improve their mastery of the French language so that they in turn will be able to produce poetry of their own. This course will help them to integrate the phonic, rhythmic and musical dimensions of poetry, as well as learn about its various uses, from the intimate to historical testimonies.

Beginning with the grandeur of Paris during the Belle Epoque and the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and moving to the violence and tragedy of World Wars I and II, this course examines the French modernist art movements of the first part of the 20th century. After identifying the origins of modernism in the late 19th century with Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, we will consider the ways in which Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Primitivism redefined modernism for the 20th century. Working with Dada and Surrealist art works, we will evaluate the relationship between humor, critique, and cultural and political dissension in artistic production. Finally, we will examine the trans-Atlantic currents of Abstraction, looking at Abstract Expressionism, L\u2019Art Informel, and the Nouveau Realistes. Throughout this exploration, we will interrogate how social history, shaped by politics, gender, and race, informed the construction of an artistic modernism in the 20th century.

London on the Thames takes close runner-up position. But more than mythic, popular-culture stage sets, these two great European capitals operate as spectacular rival models in face of real-life, 21st-century dramas. Our course concentrates on a sequence of case studies targeting the evolving architecture and urban plan of Paris. We focus on current thematic debates crucial to its identity, survival and future\u2014tradition contra innovation, continuity contra rupture, preservation contra demolition, obsolescence contra revitalization. We investigate controversies over the low- and high-density city; legislation on building heights, protection of skyline and riverbanks; the interface between historic and experimental building types; the balance between public and private space, residential and mixed-economy neighbourhoods, inner-city rehabilitation and suburban sprawl; intra- and extra-muros transportation systems (road, rail, river, air). As a foil and finale to our Paris studies, we conclude with a critical comparative analysis of contemporary London to illuminate fundamental differences between these two global cities: the rational French model largely tempered by state control against the exuberant English model predominantly driven by ultra-liberal policies. Will the third millennium ideal city emerge as a polymorphic combination of the two approaches? Conducted in English .

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Experimental Theatre Workshop - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points                               This course is designed to allow students to analyze and reenact excerpts from Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays. We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      Literary Classics: French, British, and Post-Colonial Perspectives - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points - under development                               This course can count toward the cultural specialization or elective within the major requirements in Comparative Literature. However, it is recommended that Comparative Literature majors check with their  DUGS to have this course approved for their individual specialization. This course CANNOT be counted as a core comparative literature course.      In this course we focus on four contemporary novels in which the world of the character, the narrator, or the author, is read through the lens of a literary classic. In each case, the reading and rewriting of the primary text involves temporal and spatial displacements (from the 18th to the 20th century, from Europe to the Carribean and to the South Pacific) that generate shifting perspectives and a constant reshuffling of centre and periphery. Between a reverential affiliation to the past and a creative misreading and rewriting of it, these intertextual encounters with \u00ab great \u00bb Western literary works insistently raise the questions of identity, originality, and \u201cwriting back\u201d. Exploring these questions will therefore also involve drawing on comparative, translation, and postcolonial studies.

The French Revolution &amp; Napoleon - HIST-UA 9143 - 4 points                               Lift your eyes as you walk down any street in Paris and you'll soon see a building adorned with the tricolore and the words Libert\u00e9, Egalit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9. Turn a corner and in the distance you'll see the Arc de Triomphe built to the glory of Napoleon's army or the Eiffel tower erected for the centennial of the fall of the Bastille. Even the metro stops, Concorde, Nation, R\u00e9publique, Austerlitz, I\u00e9na, echo with the memory of the years of the French Revolution and the First Empire.  But what historic reality does all this evoke? What led some French people to overthrow their age old Monarchy, turn their backs on the Church and launch into a new era of Republican government? What caused others to resist such changes with all their might? And why did the experiment end within 10 years, giving way to military dictatorship and an Empire which spread French rule across Europe.  This semester we shall explore these issues and others pertaining to the Age of the French Revolution &amp; Napoleon through lectures, readings, discussions and site visits in and around the city of Paris.

Through our study of a wide variety of genres and disciplines, we examine both the theoretical discourses and artistic and literary representations of the human-animal relation. Authors include Montaigne, contemporary novelist Marie Darrieussecq, the fabulist La Fontaine and the filmmaker Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. Drawing from a wide selection of texts and media we explore the multiple forms this relation has taken and the extent to which it touches areas about which we humans, \u201crational animals,\u201d remain particularly sensitive.

Paris of the 19th and early 20th centuries developed into a major urban center, in part because of the promise of liberty that drew people there following the upheavals of the Revolution. The urban renewal that occurred under the Second Empire in the mid-19th century in particular transformed the capital into a modern city of innovation and spectacle. While the official arts reflected the tastes and priorities of successive governments and the emergent bourgeoisie, it was the avant-garde that most marked the city as a site of resistance and daring. In this course we study these different art movements as they relate to the city of Paris, studying the sites, movements, and transformations that helped shape the modern arts. Conducted in French.

Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.

The first half of the course focuses on the political, socio-economic, and cultural history of France in the modern period, from roughly 1870 to the 1980. The second half of the course looks more closely at the contemporary period, focusing on the various \u2018crises\u2019 and transitions that have marked France during the past 20 years. Topics include the challenges of the post-colonial period (immigration, la francophonie, questions of identity), France in and of the European Union, France and globalization, and social issues in current events (the status of women, la banlieue, social exclusion).

The course will offer insights and analyses on the different roles which are played by France and the United States on the issues of youth, women, and Modern Islam in the Arab World and on how their soft power is perceived by the Arab countries and their populations. By addressing the foreign policies that have been articulated in the region, we will also bring into light the dichotomy between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d diplomacy.

In this course, we study the great works of French theatre, from the classics to the very  contemporary, through readings, performances, and visits in and around Paris to the lieux  de m\u00e9moire of the theatre world. Through the study of works by Corneille, Moli\u00e8re, Hugo,  Feydeau, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and others, we consider how Paris has been integral to and  shaped by the world of French theatre. Visits include such prestigious venues as the Com\u00e9die  Fran\u00e7aise, the grands boulevards where Parisians discovered Shakespeare in the age of Sarah  Bernhardt, the remains of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais where Corneille performed his plays, or  Versailles where Moli\u00e8re helped lead the grand spectacle that was life under Louis XIV.

Writing Workshop: Writing Paris - FREN-UA 9968 - 2 points                               Given in the form of a workshop, this course allows students to improve their written expression through the study and practice of a variety of literary registers, mostly drawn from contemporary literature. The workshop associates literary creation and French language instruction with the firm belief that creative writing in French is possible for students at all levels. Its primary objective is the reinforcement of students\u2019 written competencies in French, accomplished through intensive writing sessions with the common theme of Paris. Students are invited to appropriate Paris through various writing activities, inspired by writers such as Baudelaire, Perec, or Modiano, designed to help students capture the city through its movements, its images, and its different facets. The regular practice of creative writing as well as systematic re-writing of all work will allow students to reinforce grammatical structures while expanding vocabulary. Conducted in French.

Each dreams of one day becoming a \u201cgreen\u201d city. Danger also exists in both of these cities, amplified by rumor and fantasy. In this course we will study these phenomena through the analysis of novels, films, television series, artwork, and architecture, to ask how various representations of the city have changed and been managed over time, by diverse social actors and observers.

Due to Italy\u2019s strong historical legacy, modern Italian artists and architects have gone through an intense struggle to break from academic models. Initially the new movements, such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau, arrived from outside sources, yet beginning with I Macchiaoli, followed by the Futurists, Neo\u2013 Rationalists, Arte Povera, and Transavanguardia, Italians were frequently originators of the discourses of new artistic movements. The tide of trends periodically seceded from traditions and then returned to them in critical ways, seen in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico or the wistful pavilions of Aldo Rossi. During the past decade Italy has produced several new institutions for contemporary art and architecture, including MART in Rovereto, the Museo del \u2018900 (Museum of the 20th century) in Milan, and MAXXI (Museum of the Arts of the 21st century), devoted specifically to both art and architecture, broadening the historical and critical perspective and providing a stimulus for the art of the future.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

They struggle to direct public debate towards clearer visions of the day\u2019s challenges and to  keep our minds open to wider possibilities and different explanations. They excel at pointing out  the common fallacies of our age. Most often dissenters, in the minority in their own countries,  public intellectuals are deeply committed to independent thinking at (often) considerable  personal sacrifice. Simultaneously observers and participants, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d,  consensus builders and social critics, thinkers and occasionally active politicians, these public  figures are central to modern democratic dialogue. Not surprisingly, considerable controversy  accompanies the appearance of (many) university-trained professionals in the public sphere, and  the discussions they initiate have been characterized quite often by bitter and personal attacks.   This course examines the work and contributions of several prominent intellectuals in crucial  periods of contemporary European history over the 20th and 21st centuries, and considers  their important roles in public debate, policy-making and the political process. Their writings  focus on the important issues of their time \u2013 war and peace, economic instability, dictatorship,  European integration, organized crime, the collapse of European communism and post-industrial  capitalism \u2013 concerns that are still very much of relevance and debate today. Finally, the course  also considers the \u201ctheory\u201d of public intellectuals by looking at the writings on their own place  in society and on the models of participation that others, like them, have offered in the past.   The class has a seminar format with discussion of the principal works of a number of public  intellectuals and their biographies framing the weekly sessions. We will also explore the  historical context of these works and consider, with the advantage of hindsight, the relative  accuracy of the positions assumed in the past \u2013 did they really come close to \u201ctelling the  truth\u201d as we understand it today? The reactions of the public, of political leaders, and of other  prominent individuals are also examined to better consider the impact of these intellectuals\u2019  contributions and to appreciate the measure of their commitment to freedom and open  discussion.

Italy is well-known for being a family centered society.  What are the causes and consequences of this phenomenon? Since the 1960s, the family has  undergone a series of changes, due to the women\u2019s movement, decrease of marriages, fall of  birthrate, etc. Is the family loosing its centrality in Italy? According to some scholars, the family  is still one of the few shared values in Italy. The course will investigate the social function of the  family in Italy, from the political unification of the country to the present. We will also analyze  ideas of femininity and masculinity conveyed by the media and their connections to the idea  of Italianness. The imagined Italian community was constructed on the site of the female body  which was meant to epitomize a series of values such as fertility, health, prosperity, purity,  tradition, etc. The course will also map the condition of women and LGBT people in Italy today.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world.

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      Photography of Architecture, City and Territory - IPHTI-UT 1210 - 4 points                               City, territory and architecture have been, from the beginning of photography, privileged objects for its practice. Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.

As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.

It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

In this course we will read poetry out loud in order to show how poetry is founded on rhythm and the repetition of phonetic and syntactic elements. This pragmatic approach will not only allow students to improve their pronunciation, but also to understand the poetic genre, the quality of poets\u2019 language, their interest in etymology, metaphor, imagery, etc. Close readings, paraphrase and translations will allow students to considerably improve their mastery of the French language so that they in turn will be able to produce poetry of their own. This course will help them to integrate the phonic, rhythmic and musical dimensions of poetry, as well as learn about its various uses, from the intimate to historical testimonies.

Beginning with the grandeur of Paris during the Belle Epoque and the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and moving to the violence and tragedy of World Wars I and II, this course examines the French modernist art movements of the first part of the 20th century. After identifying the origins of modernism in the late 19th century with Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, we will consider the ways in which Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Primitivism redefined modernism for the 20th century. Working with Dada and Surrealist art works, we will evaluate the relationship between humor, critique, and cultural and political dissension in artistic production. Finally, we will examine the trans-Atlantic currents of Abstraction, looking at Abstract Expressionism, L\u2019Art Informel, and the Nouveau Realistes. Throughout this exploration, we will interrogate how social history, shaped by politics, gender, and race, informed the construction of an artistic modernism in the 20th century.

London on the Thames takes close runner-up position. But more than mythic, popular-culture stage sets, these two great European capitals operate as spectacular rival models in face of real-life, 21st-century dramas. Our course concentrates on a sequence of case studies targeting the evolving architecture and urban plan of Paris. We focus on current thematic debates crucial to its identity, survival and future\u2014tradition contra innovation, continuity contra rupture, preservation contra demolition, obsolescence contra revitalization. We investigate controversies over the low- and high-density city; legislation on building heights, protection of skyline and riverbanks; the interface between historic and experimental building types; the balance between public and private space, residential and mixed-economy neighbourhoods, inner-city rehabilitation and suburban sprawl; intra- and extra-muros transportation systems (road, rail, river, air). As a foil and finale to our Paris studies, we conclude with a critical comparative analysis of contemporary London to illuminate fundamental differences between these two global cities: the rational French model largely tempered by state control against the exuberant English model predominantly driven by ultra-liberal policies. Will the third millennium ideal city emerge as a polymorphic combination of the two approaches? Conducted in English .

This 4 credit course includes a weekly seminar and two full days and one half day (Monday-Friday) for their internship. Internship placements are made by EUSA, an organization partnering with NYU.     The seminar portion of the course explores many different aspects of your internship site. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization, including its approach, its policies, and the context in which it operates. We will also discuss more generally the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Finally, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience and as a way to refine your own personal and professional goals.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Experimental Theatre Workshop - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points                               This course is designed to allow students to analyze and reenact excerpts from Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays. We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      Literary Classics: French, British, and Post-Colonial Perspectives - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points - under development                               This course can count toward the cultural specialization or elective within the major requirements in Comparative Literature. However, it is recommended that Comparative Literature majors check with their  DUGS to have this course approved for their individual specialization. This course CANNOT be counted as a core comparative literature course.      In this course we focus on four contemporary novels in which the world of the character, the narrator, or the author, is read through the lens of a literary classic. In each case, the reading and rewriting of the primary text involves temporal and spatial displacements (from the 18th to the 20th century, from Europe to the Carribean and to the South Pacific) that generate shifting perspectives and a constant reshuffling of centre and periphery. Between a reverential affiliation to the past and a creative misreading and rewriting of it, these intertextual encounters with \u00ab great \u00bb Western literary works insistently raise the questions of identity, originality, and \u201cwriting back\u201d. Exploring these questions will therefore also involve drawing on comparative, translation, and postcolonial studies.

Turn a corner and in the distance you'll see the Arc de Triomphe built to the glory of Napoleon's army or the Eiffel tower erected for the centennial of the fall of the Bastille. Even the metro stops, Concorde, Nation, R\u00e9publique, Austerlitz, I\u00e9na, echo with the memory of the years of the French Revolution and the First Empire.  But what historic reality does all this evoke? What led some French people to overthrow their age old Monarchy, turn their backs on the Church and launch into a new era of Republican government? What caused others to resist such changes with all their might? And why did the experiment end within 10 years, giving way to military dictatorship and an Empire which spread French rule across Europe.  This semester we shall explore these issues and others pertaining to the Age of the French Revolution &amp; Napoleon through lectures, readings, discussions and site visits in and around the city of Paris.

Through our study of a wide variety of genres and disciplines, we examine both the theoretical discourses and artistic and literary representations of the human-animal relation. Authors include Montaigne, contemporary novelist Marie Darrieussecq, the fabulist La Fontaine and the filmmaker Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. Drawing from a wide selection of texts and media we explore the multiple forms this relation has taken and the extent to which it touches areas about which we humans, \u201crational animals,\u201d remain particularly sensitive.

Paris of the 19th and early 20th centuries developed into a major urban center, in part because of the promise of liberty that drew people there following the upheavals of the Revolution. The urban renewal that occurred under the Second Empire in the mid-19th century in particular transformed the capital into a modern city of innovation and spectacle. While the official arts reflected the tastes and priorities of successive governments and the emergent bourgeoisie, it was the avant-garde that most marked the city as a site of resistance and daring. In this course we study these different art movements as they relate to the city of Paris, studying the sites, movements, and transformations that helped shape the modern arts. Conducted in French.

Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation.

The first half of the course focuses on the political, socio-economic, and cultural history of France in the modern period, from roughly 1870 to the 1980. The second half of the course looks more closely at the contemporary period, focusing on the various \u2018crises\u2019 and transitions that have marked France during the past 20 years. Topics include the challenges of the post-colonial period (immigration, la francophonie, questions of identity), France in and of the European Union, France and globalization, and social issues in current events (the status of women, la banlieue, social exclusion).

In this course, we study the great works of French theatre, from the classics to the very  contemporary, through readings, performances, and visits in and around Paris to the lieux  de m\u00e9moire of the theatre world. Through the study of works by Corneille, Moli\u00e8re, Hugo,  Feydeau, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and others, we consider how Paris has been integral to and  shaped by the world of French theatre. Visits include such prestigious venues as the Com\u00e9die  Fran\u00e7aise, the grands boulevards where Parisians discovered Shakespeare in the age of Sarah  Bernhardt, the remains of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais where Corneille performed his plays, or  Versailles where Moli\u00e8re helped lead the grand spectacle that was life under Louis XIV.

Writing Workshop: Writing Paris - FREN-UA 9968 - 2 points                               Given in the form of a workshop, this course allows students to improve their written expression through the study and practice of a variety of literary registers, mostly drawn from contemporary literature. The workshop associates literary creation and French language instruction with the firm belief that creative writing in French is possible for students at all levels. Its primary objective is the reinforcement of students\u2019 written competencies in French, accomplished through intensive writing sessions with the common theme of Paris. Students are invited to appropriate Paris through various writing activities, inspired by writers such as Baudelaire, Perec, or Modiano, designed to help students capture the city through its movements, its images, and its different facets. The regular practice of creative writing as well as systematic re-writing of all work will allow students to reinforce grammatical structures while expanding vocabulary. Conducted in French.

Guided Research and MA Thesis Form             Engl.GA.1083 x-listed with Irish Studies   Literature of Modern Ireland    John Waters   Monday 3:30-6:00pm \u2013Ireland House, Room 101     This course conducts a comprehensive survey of the traditions of writing in Ireland from the plantations of the late sixteenth century to the famine of 1846-50. By tracing the shadow of Irish language literary traditions in and alongside the emerging Irish literary traditions in English, we will consider the interplay of literature and national identity, and the role of literature and other forms of print culture in a variety of social processes, including politicization, the language shift, and textual representations of violence, domestic life, cultural memory, national and international economy, and forms of agency. Major authors including Jonathan Swift, Bishop Berkeley, Edmund Burke, Maria Edgeworth, Sydney Owenson, Thomas Moore, Samuel Ferguson, and James Clarence Mangan are considered, as well as the development of Irish forms of poetry, drama, and prose in English. It is the aim of the course to give students a detailed grasp of Irish literary history before the cataclysmic social changes wrought by the Irish famine, and to introduce students to the concepts and terminology employed in contemporary Irish literary scholarship.           Engl.GA.1957.001   Textuality    Perry Meisel   Monday 6:20-8:20pm\u201419 UP, Room 222     An introduction to literary theory from structuralism, deconstruction, and psychoanalysis to New Historicism and post-colonialism. Readings will include basic texts by Saussure, Barthes, Bakhtin, Derrida, Althusser, Lacan, Foucault, and Fanon. Philosophical tradition from Hegel to Freud will contextualize what is a single movement of thought defined by continuity rather than by ruptures. The course will begin and endwith literary texts, including Shakespeare, to measure what the theoretical tradition brings to both practical criticism and literary and cultural history. Open to both graduate students and advanced undergraduates.           Engl.GA.2075.001 MA Thesis Writing Colloquium Maureen N. McLane Wednesday, 5-7pm An intense yet convivial biweekly seminar for MA students to support them as they pursue research and write their MA Theses. This seminar will feature short writing assignments and deadlines all geared to the completion of the thesis; peer review of drafts; research/library excursions; some brief yet methodologically stimulating readings--from, e.g., Moretti, Bakhtin, inter alia. Students' projects will affect, and be reflected in, the course syllabus. The main project of this seminar is to create an intellectual, sociable community for MA students as they pursue their writing and research. Meeting (on average) every other week, Wed. 5-7 pm, Rm 805, 244 Greene St. First meeting September 3, 2014.           MEDI-GA-2100.002   Old English    Michael Matto Monday 6:20-8:20pm     This course is designed for students who are interested in the language, literature, and culture of England up to the Norman Conquest of 1066. It will provide solid practice in the language and close reading of texts, both canonical and not-quite-canonical, while introducing students to cultural and historical backgrounds, representative secondary material, and the reception of the Middle Ages in the modern era.     Students should contact MARC Administrator Crystal Parsons for registration access.           Engl.GA.2521.001   Cultural Institutions in Restoration England    Bill Blake   Thursday 6:20-8:20pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306     This course will look at British literature of the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries alongside a range of new cultural agendas\u2014from the banding together of a small group of libertine radicals to the formation of an evangelical culture of moral reform; from the invention of \u201chigh\u201d culture to the rise of literary professionalism, even as the arts themselves were changing under the impetus of democratization and liberal values. With a special focus on drama and theatre, primary texts will include plays and critical writings by John Milton, William Davenant, Margaret Cavendish, John Dryden, William Wycherley, Aphra Behn, Thomas Otway, William Congreve, Susanna Centlivre, Joseph Addison, and John Dennis. Our supplemental reading will build on various theoretical formulations\u2014systems theory, discourse analysis, cultural sociology, the history of concepts\u2014to explore how new institutions, new policies, new cultural producers, and new audiences transformed both the forms and practices of public art during this period.           Engl.GA.2661.001 Victorian Studies: The Victorian Nervous/System    Jeff Spear   Thursday 4:00-6:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306     This seminar will explore three overlapping areas of both social and personal anxiety in the Victorian period: class, gender and the permeability of the body and body politic as expressed in, for example, Dracula and Conan Doyle\u2019s The Sign of the Four. We will begin with theory: Taussig on the Nervous/System, Benjamin \u201cOn History,\u201d and Mitchell on \u201cEkphrasis and Other.\u201d The course readings will include work by Carlyle (Past and Present), Carroll, Gaskell North and South)Dickens (Oliver) Ruskin, Collins (No Name),Tennyson, (Maud) D.G. Rossetti, G. Eliot (Mill on the Floss) \u201cGeorge Egerton\u201cand the New Woman. The last week will be devoted to visual and popular culture. Each week will have some contextual critical or historical reading.     The main course requirements are contributions to the weekly discussion board, an oral presentation with bibliography on the reading for one week and a term paper on the model of a journal article. Students who are not planning to apply to a PhD program in English can propose an alternative term project equivalent to the scholarly article project.           Engl.GA.2838.001   The Slave\u2019s Story    Elizabeth McHenry   Thursday 10:00-12:00pm--244 Greene Street, Room 306     \u201cAmerica has the mournful honor of adding a new department to the literature of civilization,\u2014the autobiographies of escaped slaves,\u201d wrote Ephraim Peabody in his 1849 essay, \u201cNarratives of Fugitive Slaves.\u201d \u201cWe know not where one who wishes to write a modern Odyssey could find a better subject than in the adventures of a fugitive slave.\u201d This course will examine these adventures\u2014slave narratives\u2014from their emergence in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century, to their modern counterparts, the contemporary narratives of slavery that echo and are influenced by the genre, as well as the vibrant imaginings of fugitive narratives in contemporary art and film. By looking at the slave\u2019s story as it has been written into the American literary landscape in both the 19th and 20th centuries, we will explore the premise that underlies Peabody\u2019s 1849 statement: how or in what ways does the deployment of slavery as a literary subject make art \u201cmodern\u201d? Our work will revolve in part around examining the tensions that developed in the 19th century for slave narrators between communicating the material conditions of slavery and the dynamics of systems of slavery as they related to the making and unmaking of American citizens, and participating in evolving debates about the scope\u2014social, political, aesthetic\u2014of literary arts. In the second part of the semester we will contrast the tropes and modes of 19th century slave narratives with re-visions of slavery in 20th century texts, to see how, for instance, rebellions and resistance are re-imagined in retrospect and how the forms and meanings of freedom differ from 19th century slave narratives. Student should expect to read or reread several of the most critically acclaimed slave narratives; but a primary interest will be to examine narratives that have received less critical attention, with an eye toward identifying the literary and historical contexts of slave narratives, the complex conditions of their authorship and publication, and their key generic and aesthetic features. How can these lesser-known texts to help us to deconstruct what we think we know about the slave narrative? As twenty-first century scholars of American and African American literature, revisiting the slave narrative will provide a way to question the assessments of twentieth century critics of this genre, including the very fundamental question of whether slave narratives can be conceived of as a coherent literary genre at all.           Engl.GA.2841.001   American Fiction to 1900-1945    Jo Hendin   Thursday 3:30-5:30pm--244 Greene Street, Room 105     American fiction in this period embodies the variety and anxiety of an era of rapid change. How writers and critics attempted to define and respond to the idea of the \u201cnew\u201d or the \u201ctransformed\u201d illuminates specific works of literary art and the cultural contexts in which they were created. In literary practice and critical discourse, passages from realism to naturalism to modernism, and the reinvention of forms in an era of variety and synthesis, help shape the imagination of domestic and political reality. Through readings in fiction and selected critical essays, this course explores an aesthetic of change forged by working artists and analyzed by critics. The course is intended as a survey of forms and practices with an emphasis on modernism and contemporary, eclectic style.           Engl.GA.2900.001 x-listed with Comp Lit   Reading the Global South: Uneven Development, Critical Geography, and Anti-Imperial Thinking    Ana Dopico   Tuesday 1:00-3:00pm\u201419UP, Room 229     This course seeks to create a comparative ground for cultural politics typically separated by language, imperial histories, and neo-colonial maps. It takes up the cultural, political, historical and theoretical consequences of uneven development as an enduring truth of the global order. It engages the politics and economies of imperialism and the history and theory of anti-imperialism. We will consider the idea of the Global South as a topography of uneven development and uneven temporalities, where notions of modernity and periphery are affirmed and contested and where the names and practices of resistance, rebellion, and critique continue to engage not only metropolitan centers but the force of the state. The course looks beyond \u201carea studies\u201d definitions and seeks a materialist and critical geography, turning toward a hemispheric Southern critique that challenged empire, globalization, democratization, neoliberalism and permanent warfare long before the current political moment. We will trace the political and critical genealogies, the disciplinary canonizations, and the popular life of an indispensable contestatory archive\u2014an archive whose long history helps to contextualize and demystify the geopolitics of the present, as well as the politics of the academy. The course is in part designed to offer comparatists and students from varied fields an engagement with texts whose messy political engagements and materialist foundations have lately been rather marginalized by a reaffirmation of theoretical universals.      We will consider how old ideological mappings like third world, underdevelopment, revolution and old imperial and cold wars continue to haunt new articulations of triumphalist or cataclysmic futures and geopolitical destinies. The course traces themes and variations of a global anti-imperialism, its constituencies, and its critical strategies; it stresses how these contestatory narratives have irrevocably altered the cultural politics and cultural markets of international metropoli and international policy. It seeks also to distinguish \u201csouthern\u201d contexts for struggles around feminism, race and labor, and to follow the trajectory of these struggles into a theoretical \u201cmainstream\u201d. Readings establish connections between nationalist struggles, critiques of hegemony, and resistant narratives, looking back over almost a century of foundational texts from Luxemburg to Gramsci, to Mari\u00e1tegui, to Fanon and Memmi and connecting them to the work of writers as varied as Said, Chatterjee, Garc\u00eda Canclini, Pratt, Spivak, Jameson and Appadurai. The course will proceed thematically as a wide survey of history, criticism, and theory but always considering forms of cultural production that often precede and exceed theorization.           Engl.GA.2902.001   Writing Africa    Lucy Graham   Tuesdays 3:30-5:30pm--244 Greene Street, Room 105              This course focuses on a selection of texts about Africa, from the mid twentieth century until the present day. Beginning with African liberation theory, we shall read some of the writings of Leopold Senghor, Frantz Fanon, Amilcar Cabral, Nelson Mandela and Steve Biko. The second part of the course will move on to discuss classic or canonical African novels, such as Chinua Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart (1958) and Ngugi wa Thiong'o\u2019s A Grain of Wheat (1967). In the third section we shall discuss contemporary theorizing of the African postcolony by writers such as Achille Mbembe, and postcolonial metafiction such as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s Half of a Yellow Sun (2006), Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Agualusa\u2019s The Book of Chameleons (2004) and Phaswane Mpe\u2019s Welcome to our Hillbrow (2001). In the final weeks of the course we shall discuss films about Africa, including: The Battle of Algiers (1966), directed by Gillo Pontecorvo and based on the writings of Fanon; Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty\u2019s Hyenas (2004), a bitingly satirical allegory of the effects of the IMF and World Bank in Africa, Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne\u2019s Moolaad\u00e9 (2004); as well as the South African film Hijack Stories (2000), co-written by Oliver Schmitz and Lesego Rampolokeng.           Engl.GA.2957.001   Queer Affect Theory    Jonathan Flatley   Tuesday, 12:00-2:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306      This seminar will examine the relationship between queer theory and the \u201caffective turn\u201d in the humanities and social sciences. The intersection between these two vital areas of scholarly inquiry is perhaps marked most clearly by Eve Sedgwick\u2019s turn toward affect, represented by her essay on shame and queer performativity in Henry James (in the first issue of GLQ, 1993), her co-editing (with Adam Frank) of the work of Silvan Tomkins (Shame and Its Sisters, 1995) and her subsequent work on Melanie Klein, the depressive position, and reparative reading. But understandings of feeling had already been important in some of the writing from which queer theory emerged: Audre Lorde on anger and the erotic in Sister Outsider; Michel Foucault\u2019s critique of the repressive hypothesis and his emphasis on bodies, pleasures and friendship; and writing by Douglas Crimp, Leo Bersani and others on sex, mourning and militancy in relation to AIDS and ACT-UP. After reading these foundational works, we will consider to what extent and with what implications queerness has subsequently been understood as a particular kind or mode of feeling. For instance, in asking whether some experience of melancholia or depression is central to queerness we will read works by Freud, Melanie Klein, Butler, Sedgwick, Crimp, Ann Cvetkovich, Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, and Heather Love. In considering optimism, collectivity, happiness, activism, love, the death drive, utopia, shame and stigma we will also read work by Theresa de Lauretis, Gloria Anzaldua, Sara Ahmed, Lauren Berlant, Lee Edelman, Mel Chen, Deborah Gould, Sianne Ngai, Gilles Deleuze, Jean Luc Nancy, and Paolo Virno. Although we will focus mainly on critical and theoretical works, we will also decide together on a range of aesthetic objects to anchor our discussion through the semester.           Engl.GA.2971.001   Practicum in Digital Humanities: Mapping Archives: Cultural Geographies of New York City    Tom Augst   Tuesday 6:20-8:20pm--244 Greene Street, Room 306     Drawing on materials at NYU Libraries, this course introduces students to concepts, methods, and tools for spatial analysis of the archival record. Exploring digital tools, resources, and research practices for mapping and visualization, the course will focus on interpreting and representing diverse forms of evidence: textual and nontextual, scribal and printed, qualitative and quantitative, institutional and personal. Applying critical and theoretical perspectives, students will participate in a lab component for the course, designed to build competencies in the use of computational methods for understanding and manipulating data in the humanities. Although course exercises and discussions will focus on modeling a collaborative research platform related to New York City, students will have opportunities to develop research goals related to individual areas and periods of scholarly interest.             Engl.GA.2980.001   MA Pro-Seminar    Juliet Fleming   Wednesday 11:00-1:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306     Criticism Practical and Impractical     Practical criticism is a method of close reading designed to enhance our responsiveness to what we read. It develops a knowledge of literary forms, and provides technical language for describing the ways in which writers achieve their effects. As prescribed by I. A. Richards in the 1920s it treats literature as something separate from social and economic spheres and from the personal concerns of its author: had you taken an exam prepared by the followers of Richards at Cambridge you would have been required to produce a close analysis of, organised response to, and finally judgement of three pieces of literary writing that were unnamed and undated. Part of the work of this seminar will be to prepare you for (a modified version of) that exam -- and, beyond that, for a career founded upon your skills of close reading and your ability to recognise the presence and consequences of literary forms, metres, punctuation, rhyme schemes, diction, syntax and layout. In every meeting we will practice reading, talking and writing about literary forms. The other part of our work will be to familiarise ourselves with a different type of close-reading, one that is famously not a method, and that eschews the pleasures of judgment. Deconstruction is the unsatisfactory name for what is, above all, a heightened commitment to reading -- one that refuses the limits of any criticism that would be practical but that nevertheless offers a profound education in thinking about literary texts. Throughout the semester we will use Derrida's writing to lighten, baffle, enrich and deflect our own developing attempts at literary analysis and judgment.           Engl.GA.2980.002   MA Pro-Seminar    Maureen McLane   Wednesday 4:00-6:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306      What is Literature? Why study \u201cit\u201d? How study \u201cit\u201d? Does \u201cliterature\u201d exist? How has it been, how is it now, and how might it yet be studied, imagined, engaged, and/or critiqued? And how might advanced literary study be inflected by other advanced studies\u2014of, for example, media history and ecology, book history, historiography, the human sciences (linguistics, psychoanalysis, anthropology)? This course offers a series of intense experimental gambits: with assigned readings in a variety of methodological and theoretical keys, from a range of historical periods, we will begin to consider where literary study has been, where it is, and where it might be going. We will engage the pleasure of the text and the rigor of the text and may confront as well the displeasure of the text: our task will be to register each of these possibilities.           Engl.GA.3323.001   Topics in Renaissance Lit: Milton    John Guillory   Monday 1:00-3:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306     In this seminar we will be reading through Milton's major poetry and a selection of his prose, in the context of the civil war of mid-century England and with attention to his uniquely influential position in English literary history. In setting out the requisites for reading Milton\u2019s work, I will foreground the contradictory construction of Milton as author: either the last great writer of the Renaissance, a classicist and a Christian, or the first \"modern\" writer, a fierce anti-monarchical revolutionary, closer in his religious views to the radical sectarians than to the Puritan parliamentarians who initiated the war against the King. In addition to Milton\u2019s works, we will read a selection of the most relevant of Milton\u2019s contemporaries, along with a mix of older and more recent literary scholarship. My aim is to understand Milton\u2019s political, theological, and literary positions, as well as the typical misunderstandings of Milton propagated in literary history.           Engl.GA.3536.001   Genres/Concepts/Media: Literature and Knowledge Since the Enlightenment    Cliff Siskin   Monday 3:30-6:00pm---244 Greene Street, Room 306     If you were doing your doctorate in the UK, you would not be taking two years of courses and exams before writing your dissertation; you would just start writing. To take advantage of this difference\u2014and to avoid just replicating or extending your undergraduate experience\u2014you need to figure out what your graduate courses can do for you. This course has two goals. The first is to provide you with three interrelated tools that can help answer the question facing all graduate students: what does it mean to become an expert in literary study? If lawyers know the law, what do we know about the literary and how do we know it? Our first stop will be genre: whatever our chosen period, we experience the literary through a long history of forms\u2014how can we gain and produce knowledge about those forms? How do they work? How do they change? Second is concepts: what do those forms communicate? Can we develop an expert vocabulary for how meaning is constructed and for how those constructions change? We\u2019ll benefit here from seminars with one of the Department\u2019s visiting research faculty, Professor Peter De Bolla of Cambridge, author of a new book on The Architecture of Concepts. Our third stop is the term that has made its way into more and more job descriptions as we advance into the digital: what role should media play in literary study? The course\u2019s second goal is to bring those three tools to bear on a set of texts and authors that will be chosen partly by me and partly by you. Our historical focus should be useful for those with current interests in earlier periods and later ones, for it covers that swath of literary history that links the two: from the late seventeenth century through the Enlightenment and into its legacy in modernity. Please contact me with suggestions for texts that will help you with your specific goals. MA students who are thinking about this course should also get in touch.           Engl.GA.3629.001   Politics in Deconstruction    Geoffrey Bennington   Wednesday 6:20-8:20pm--244 Greene Street, Room 306     Taking its lead from some of Derrida\u2019s later work, this course will set off again from Aristotle\u2019s famous characterization of man as a zoon politikon, and follow the threads of sovereignty and democracy through some of the great texts of political philosophy in the Western tradition. We shall attempt to understand why both of these notions pose such problems for that tradition, and give rise to all manner of complications and paradoxes, which turn out to be definitive of the conceptual space of the political as such. We shall wonder why almost all traditional political philosophers are enamored of sovereignty, while almost none has anything very good to say about democracy. We shall consider the possibility of a non-trivial affinity between the political, the rhetorical, the literary, and animality in their constant tendency to exceed conceptual grasp, and also compare our deconstructive approach to these political questions with some other contemporary theories. Classic authors to be discussed will include Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Bodin, Hobbes, Spinoza, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel and Schmitt; more recent theorists to be considered alongside Derrida may include Agamben, Badiou, Foucault, Hardt and Negri, Lyotard, Mouffe and Ranci\u00e8re.
