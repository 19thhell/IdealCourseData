Description       The mythical figure of Orpheus was celebrated in ancient Greece as the greatest musician and poet ever to have lived as well as one of a handful of mortals who managed to journey to the underworld. In this course we will look at how the myth of Orpheus has been portrayed in the arts from ancient to modern times. We will begin by examining early representations of the myth in Ovid and Virgil before proceeding to more recent interpretations in poetry (Rilke, H.D., Margaret Atwood, Adrienne Rich), theater (Tennessee Williams, Sarah Ruhl), Film (Jean Cocteau, Marcel Camus), Opera (Monteverdi, Gl\u00fcck, Offenbach), and the graphic novel (Neil Gaiman). Finally, we will explore the significance of Orpheus as the consummate artist in relation to the contemporary phenomenon of the popular performer. An important part of our survey will be dedicated to the figure of Orpheus\u2019s lost love, Eurydice, and to the question of how feminist revisions of the myth alter our conceptions of love, heroism, and artistic achievement. Through papers and in-class exercises students will work on developing their abilities to think and write critically about contrasting modes of artistic expression. The task will then be to apply these skills to a final comparative study that examines how a key issue raised by the myth is resolved across different media.

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

Description       The mythical figure of Orpheus was celebrated in ancient Greece as the greatest musician and poet ever to have lived as well as one of a handful of mortals who managed to journey to the underworld. In this course we will look at how the myth of Orpheus has been portrayed in the arts from ancient to modern times. We will begin by examining early representations of the myth in Ovid and Virgil before proceeding to more recent interpretations in poetry (Rilke, H.D., Margaret Atwood, Adrienne Rich), theater (Tennessee Williams, Sarah Ruhl), Film (Jean Cocteau, Marcel Camus), Opera (Monteverdi, Gl\u00fcck, Offenbach), and the graphic novel (Neil Gaiman). Finally, we will explore the significance of Orpheus as the consummate artist in relation to the contemporary phenomenon of the popular performer. An important part of our survey will be dedicated to the figure of Orpheus\u2019s lost love, Eurydice, and to the question of how feminist revisions of the myth alter our conceptions of love, heroism, and artistic achievement. Through papers and in-class exercises students will work on developing their abilities to think and write critically about contrasting modes of artistic expression. The task will then be to apply these skills to a final comparative study that examines how a key issue raised by the myth is resolved across different media.

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

Description       The mythical figure of Orpheus was celebrated in ancient Greece as the greatest musician and poet ever to have lived as well as one of a handful of mortals who managed to journey to the underworld. In this course we will look at how the myth of Orpheus has been portrayed in the arts from ancient to modern times. We will begin by examining early representations of the myth in Ovid and Virgil before proceeding to more recent interpretations in poetry (Rilke, H.D., Margaret Atwood, Adrienne Rich), theater (Tennessee Williams, Sarah Ruhl), Film (Jean Cocteau, Marcel Camus), Opera (Monteverdi, Gl\u00fcck, Offenbach), and the graphic novel (Neil Gaiman). Finally, we will explore the significance of Orpheus as the consummate artist in relation to the contemporary phenomenon of the popular performer. An important part of our survey will be dedicated to the figure of Orpheus\u2019s lost love, Eurydice, and to the question of how feminist revisions of the myth alter our conceptions of love, heroism, and artistic achievement. Through papers and in-class exercises students will work on developing their abilities to think and write critically about contrasting modes of artistic expression. The task will then be to apply these skills to a final comparative study that examines how a key issue raised by the myth is resolved across different media.

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.
