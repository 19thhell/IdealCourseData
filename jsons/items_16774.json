PROPERTY RIGHTS AND URBAN GOVERNANCE IN CHINA     2 Talks:   In Search of a Property Tax Reform Strategy in China by Yu-Hung Hong   and   Closed Neighborhoods in Open Cities: The Political Logic of Spatial Change in Urban China by Meg Elizabeth Rithmire   Friday April 08, 2011  1:15 - 4:00  The Puck Building  Wagner Conference Room, Second Floor  295 Lafayette Street   In Search of a Property Tax Reform Strategy in China   Presenter: Yu-Hung Hong     Abstract:     In the midst of the debates over the proposed property tax reform in China, policymakers  and analysts have not been paying enough attention to one important matter: the  integration of the new property tax with the existing public leasehold system. Because  the Chinese government wants to retain its ownership of land, restructuring the current  land leasing system in China should be considered as a complementary strategy for  the property tax reform. Public land leasing and property taxation are local revenue  sources that can co-exit, supplementing each other as levies on land in form of leasehold  charges and tax. Different combinations of these revenue generating mechanisms will  provide an array of policy options for local governments to raise funds for financing local  infrastructure and services according to varying circumstances. Thus, the design of the  new property tax should not be conducted in isolation. Instead, it must be contemplated  in conjunction with the fiscal roles of current public leasehold system. This presentation  examines possibilities and challenges of combining property taxation and public land  leasing as an integrated approach to reforming China's local fiscal systems in general,  and capturing land value in particular.     About Yu-Hung Hong:     Dr. Yu-Hung Hong is a senior fellow at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. He earned  his Ph.D. in Urban Development and Masters in City Planning from the Department of  Urban Studies and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At  the Lincoln Institute, Dr. Hong focuses his research on issues related to property rights  and obligations, land management tools, and local public finance. Specifically, he is  interested in investigating how land value increments created by public investment  and community collaboration can be recaptured by the government for financing local  infrastructure and social services.     Dr. Hong has been teaching urban public finance since 1996. He is a visiting faculty in  the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT, teaching budgeting, fiscal policy  evaluation, urban public finance in developing countries, and advanced public finance  seminars. He was an assistant professor at the University of Akron in Ohio (1999-2003)  and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in China (1996-1998).     Dr. Hong publishes on topics related to property obligations, public land leasing, land  readjustment, and property taxation. He is the co-editor of nine books: Leasing Public  Land: Policy Debates and International Experiences (2003; translated into Chinese  in 2007); Analyzing Land Readjustment: Economics, Law, and Collective Action  (2007); Land Policies and Their Outcomes (2007); Fiscal Decentralization and Land  Policies (2008); Property Rights and Land Policies (2009); Smart Growth Policies:  An Evaluation of Programs and Outcomes (2009); Local Revenues and Land Policies  (2010); China's Local Public Finance in Transition (2010); and Climate change and  Land Policies (forthcoming).     Closed Neighborhoods in Open Cities: The Political Logic of Spatial Change in Urban China     Presenter: Meg Elizabeth Rithmire     Abstract: What explains variation in local governments' abilities to exert control over the territory within their        purview? Often, despite similar formal regulations governing the use and allocation of urban land, we observe great variation in the    extent to which local governments are able to secure themselves as the sole arbiter of the use, control, and transfer of urban     property rights. This paper utilizes a paired comparison of two cities in China, which has experienced both rapid urbanization and  a restructuring of the urban spatial economy to facilitate market reforms in place of state socialism, to examine the political logic  of urban spatial control. Starting from similar conditions in Northeastern China's rust belt in 1978, the city of Dalian proceeded  faster with opening its economy to global trade and investment while the city of Harbin pursued reinvestment in the state sector and  nurtured small-scale entrepreneurship. Based on interviews, archival research, and spatial data analysis using GIS, I trace how these  cities developed different informal property rights regimes as political strategies to negotiate with constituencies below them to  pursue economic growth as well as social stability. The findings bring to light the spatial dimension of local government plans for  economic growth and redistribution.     About Meg Elizabeth Rithmire:     Meg is now a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard, focusing on Chinese and comparative urban politics. This   talk is from her dissertation, the research for which has been funded by the Fulbright as well as the Chinese Ministry of   Education. In the fall, she will begin a position as an assistant professor in the Business, Government, and International Economy   unit of the Harvard Business School.

Aided with clips, Tang Ying offers an insider&rsquo;s account and critical assessment on a unique docudrama about the bankruptcy of a state-owned factory in Shanghai and the workers&rsquo; effort to reclaim it.   Coffee break   2:30-3:30pm   Zhang Xian ??      &quot;POST-Z(H)OMBISM&rdquo;   A vernacular neologism initially for describing unnatural affectations and excess in the reform-era youth culture, &ldquo;Zhomism&rdquo;has in the past decade become a form of virulent discursive attacks on anything canonical, serious and provocative popular among Chinese cultural critics, who choose to forego aesthetic and ethical considerations. The illustrated talk surveys this cultural terrain and its ambivalent implications for cultural production and consumption in contemporary China, including Zhang Xian and partner Tang Ying&rsquo;s personal involvement in the alternative art and culture scene in Shanghai.   3:30&mdash;4:30pm Reception   ** The talks will be in Chinese with English translation.**   Co-sponsored by China House and the Department of Cinema Studies, TSOA at NYU     China's New Talent Policy: Implications and Impact for China's Development       Wednesday, March 2nd    3:30 PM    41 East 11th Street, rm 741     Presenting:   Wang Huiyao   China has undergone enormous economic changes in the past 30 years and now faces important decisions as it considers how best to sustain this unprecedented level of growth. China's population is aging rapidly and the 225 million migrant workers who have fueled China's economic miracle for the past three decades are now demanding better payment for their work. Further complicating the situation are the growing numbers of college graduates entering the job market: according to the Chinese government, China will have 195 million college-educated people by 2020. In response to these and other policy challenges, the Chinese leadership recently launched a major national talent development plan intended to cultivate, attract and retain highly skilled individuals in many sectors of the Chinese economy. This new plan has far-reaching implications for China's efforts to build an innovation-driven economy by 2020 and offers valuable insights for the global academic, business and policy communities.       Dr. Wang currently is a Visiting Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School and was a Visiting Fellow at Brookings Institution. He has been a senior advisor to the Chinese government at both central and local levels and has served as a Task Force Leader for Global Talents Strategy Study Group of Department of Organization of Central Government He is the Vice Chairman of China Talent Research Society of Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and also an Economic Team Leader for Overseas Experts Advisory Committee of China State Council Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. Dr. Wang has researched extensively on China's talent issues and published several books and papers on the subject, including his recent book National Strategy--Talents Change World which has been recommended by Party Secretary Wang Yang to all provincial government officials to read in Guangdong.

The theory and practice of comparative literary history as theorized by Mario J. Vald&eacute;s and Linda Hutcheon and implemented in two literary history projects on Central-Eastern Europe and Latin America provides a timely incentive for Chinese literary scholars to move research forward beyond the current divergence between a persistent lack of interest in literary history in English scholarship and an inundation of literary histories in Chinese. Not surprisingly, the recent call in China for defamilarization and micro-histories demonstrates the desire to break away from the orthodox model of comprehensive historiography, and a comparative examination of sample literary histories in Chinese may yield insights to be gained from, and further developed on, a reconceptualization of literary history in terms of rupture, diversity and heterogeneity, rather than continuity, singularity and homogeneity.   Yingjin Zhang is Director of Chinese Studies Program and Professor of Chinese and Comparative Literature at University of California-San Diego.

Critical reflections on the making of 'Modern Chinese Philosophy':  an anthropological moment?   Joel Thoraval     Time: 2:00 PM - 4:30 PM, Tuesday, December 1, 2009    Location: The Department of East Asian Studies   715 Broadway, rm. 312   One of the most remarkable manifestations of Confucianism's &quot;Modern Fate&quot; was the creation of particularly compelling philosophical systems during the 20th century.   Taking place in the context of new academic institutions modeled on European universities, the transformation of Confucian thought into a modern philosophical discourse by such thinkers as Mou Zongsan (1909-1995) was motivated by the desire of maintaining the ultimate meaning of neo-Confucian teachings in terms of their ideal of self-cultivation (neisheng). But this academic transformation was also accompanied by difficulties and aporia on   account of barriers that were created to establish Philosophy as a separate discipline, which was consequently cut off from traditional Confucian practices.   In this instance, the &quot;anthropological moment&quot;, in the process of analyzing this phenomenon, designates the possibility of making a detour through the observation of symbolic practices (religious, educational, esthetic) which illuminate both the creativity and the blind spots of modern &quot;Confucian Philosophy.&quot;   Joel Thoraval will try to approach this problem in the light of his own experience which has been a combination of the study of philosophical texts and anthropological field work.

See presentation images and video   This talk is about boundaries and ritual spaces in Liza Lim's compositional practice referencing aspects of Chinese culture such as archaeology, calligraphy, myths and opera performance.   Liza Lim (b.1966) is an Australian composer who writes music marked by visceral energy and vibrant color, often exploring forms of ritual and performance aesthetics drawn from both Asian and Australian Aboriginal sources. In describing her music, she counterpoints terms such as &quot;radiance and shadows&quot; and &quot;violence and meditation&quot;. Her works, which range from operatic and orchestral scores to site-specific installations, have been performed by some of the world's most eminent ensembles. Notably, she was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic to write the orchestral work, Ecstatic Architecture to celebrate the inaugural season of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2004. Recent major commissions have been received from the Festival d'Automne Paris, Salzburg Festival, Bayerischer Rundfunk Orchestra and Lucerne Festival. She was composer-in-residence with the Sydney Symphony (between 2004-06) and has had close artistic partnerships with the Australian ELISION ensemble, Ensemble Intercontemporain Paris and Ensemble fur neue musik Zurich. Her third opera 'The Navigator' was commissioned by the Brisbane and Melbourne International Arts Festivals who presented premiere seasons in 2008. There are upcoming seasons of the opera at the Chekhov International Theatre Festival, Moscow (June 2009) and Festival d'Automne Paris (Dec 2009).   Lim has received major fellowships and awards from the Australia Council, Fromm Foundation, Ian Potter Foundation, DAAD Berlin and won the 2004 Paul Lowin Prize for orchestral composition. She has an extensive publication record with Ricordi (Milan and London). She is currently Professor of Composition and director of the Centre for Research in New Music at the University of Huddersfield, UK.     Of Two Minds: Freud and Revolutionary Spirit in China   A Seminar presented by Wendy Larson   An NYU China House &amp; EAS Event   Time: 1:30-3:30pm, Tuesday, April 7 2009   Location: East Asian Studies conference room 312, 3rd floor, Broadway 715   Please RSVP to ellen.he@nyu.edu to receive reading materials provided by Professor Wendy Larson.   Wendy Larson is Professor of East Asian Languages and Literatures at the University of Oregon, with a specialty in modern Chinese literature and film. Her recent work includes From Ah Q to Lei Feng: Freud and Revolutionary Spirit in 20th Century China (Stanford UP 2008), and &quot;Zhang Yimou's Hero: Dismantling the Myth of Cultural Power&quot; (Journal of Chinese Cinemas V.2 N.3 2008).     &quot;Invincible for Aye!&quot; Melancholy and Wrath, or Towards the Utopia of Purge   A Seminar presented by Wolfgang Kubin ( download article )   An NYU China House &amp; EAS Event   Time: 11:30-2:30pm, Monday, March 30 2009   Location: 20 Cooper Square, Humanities Initiative, 5th Floor, Conference Room 503   In order to be successful, any kind of revolution has to simultaneously fulfill two preconditions: first of all, it has materials such as land and property to be redistributed; secondly, it promises the mass a utopian society. This is so because the revolutionary, who very often is of melancholic, even depressive nature, needs to mobilize the mass by persuading them that they should be either unhappy about or dissatisfied with their current living conditions. In short, he has to produce the wrath of the masses. All revolutions, however, are doomed to fail as soon as all previous property is used up and once the mass discover that the new master is more demanding than the old. This is true not only for East Europe before 1989, but also for China before 1979. After 1979, a rescue for Chinese socialism is even to have more exploitation of natural resources and man power, i.e., to ask help from capitalism. Thus, this talk tries to show how the idea of Utopia is manipulated as a tool by and for China's new ruling power.   Kubin, Wolfgang (in Chinese: Gu Bin) is Professor of Chinese Studies at Bonn University and works as a translator and a writer, too. In 1985 he was appointed professor of Chinese at Bonn University. At first he worked at the Department of Oriental Languages where he was in charge of the Chinese section. Since 1995 he has been the head of the Department of Chinese Studies. Since 1989 he has been editing the journals Orientierungen. Zeitschrift zur Kultur Asiens and minima sinica. Zeitschrift zum chinesischen Geist. Since 2002 he has been writing and editing the history of Chinese literature Geschichte der chinesischen Literatur, which is intended to comprise ten volumes. Wolfgang Kubin focuses on Chinese literature and the intellectual history of imperial and modern China. For his scholarly and literary work as well as in the field of translation he was awarded several prizes and honorary professorships.

A Seminar presented by Cui Zhiyuan   An NYU China House &amp; EAS Event   Time: 1:30-3:30pm, Wednesday March 04 2009   Location: East Asian Studies conference room 312, 3rd floor, Broadway 715   On December 25th 2008, the New York Times published an article titled &quot;Chinese Savings helped Inflate American Bubble&quot;. It reported that Bernanke, Paulson and many American economists were arguing that by having invested more than US$1trillion dollars of its own money into American government bonds and government-backed mortgage debt and repeatedly lowering its interest rates China had actually helped fuelled a historic consumption binge and housing bubble in the United States. The assertion triggered an angry response from the People's Daily. This lecture argues that it is a daunting task to answer the American charge that &quot;you spoiled us&quot;, since it requires both internal adjustment of China's development strategy as well as a reconstruction of the international monetary system.   Cui Zhiyuan is a Professor at the School of Public Policy and Management, Tsinghua University, Beijing. In the spring semester of 2008, he is the Anthony W. and Lulu C.Wang Distinguished Visiting Professor at Cornell University Law School.

Current May Forth studies tend to focus on the evolvement of the ideas such as Science, Democracy and Republic and favor positivism instead of revealing any innovative value of this historical event. This talk will investigate &quot;the East-West Cultural Debate&quot; between The Eastern Miscellany and The New Youth then edited by Du Yaquan and Chen Duxiu, respectively. Du proposed to reconcile the West and East in terms of culture while Chen radically called for &quot;educating the Youth&quot;. Thus I will argue that the May Forth, situated at the beginning of &quot;the Short Twentieth Century&quot;, is indeed an origin of variations between Culture and Politics that unfolds a historical chapter of &quot;the transformation of consciousness&quot; in modern China.

The Institutional Foundations of China's Economic Growth   A Seminar Series   Professor Yang Yao ( Vita )   National School of Development &amp; China Center for Economic Research   Peking University   Place: EAS, 715 Broadway, rm 312   Time: Thursday afternoon 3:00 - 6:15   Format: 1hr 30 min. lecture and 1hr 45 min. discussions   Students who are able to attend every seminar may enroll in it as a 2 credit course, however, students and faculty are invited to sit-in on any seminar that they'd like to attend.   Below is a description of each week's topic:   January 29: Does China Offer An Alternative Model to Economic Development?   Download this lecture   China's economic success along with an authoritarian political system raises the question whether China has created an alternative model for economic development. This seminar answers this question at two levels, one pure economic, and the other political economy. At the economic level, China does not create a new model but has rather followed the standard policy recommendations of neoclassical economics. At the political economy level, China does have created experiences that could offer potential lessons to other developing countries. Researchers can find some growth-enhancing mechanisms from the Chinese experience that apply beyond the borders of political systems. The seminar will identify several areas where such mechanisms are likely to be found.   February 5: Incentives before Institutions:A Chinese Way to Economic Reform   Download this lecture   Recent development literature reiterates Douglass North's thesis that &quot;institutions matter.&quot; However, the Chinese experience shows that it requires more than this thesis if one is serious about making institutions work in developing countries. Local conditions almost always oblige imported institutions to be modified. China's economic reform has often resulted in temporary and mid-way institutions. They worked under the circumstances that created them. In addition, one has to consider how to incentivize government officials to adopt good institutions. The Chinese experience has shown that providing incentives is more important than pursuing institutional purity in economic growth.   February 12: The Ruling Party and Economic Growth   Download this lecture   Why does the CCP, the single dominant power in China, care about economic growth? One explanation resorts to its ideological convictions. Another theory proposes that institutionalization within the party is the key to the explanation. This seminar suggests that looking at the CCP's sources of legitimacy and the Chinese social structure may provide a better understanding on why the CCP cares about economic growth. The lack of procedure-based legitimacy forces the CCP to seek for legitimacy from continuous delivery of outcomes to the society. The Chinese society is a socially equal one, preempting the CCP's intention to court a few strong groups; that is, it is in its self-interests to deliver growth to China as a whole.   February 19: Land Tenure, Productivity, and Farmer Protection   Download this lecture   Land tenure is a contentious issue in current China because it not only has a lot to do with productivity, but also affects farmers' welfare, especially facing government requisition of land. Land is both an economic asset with fungible values and a means which together with labor enables farmers to insure against negative shocks. The current land tenure may have reached a balance between these two functions of land. This seminar will both review the history of Chinese land tenure and provide an account of recent developments in making land a more fungible asset.   February 26: Democratization in the Countryside and Its Impacts   Download this lecture   China has had democratic elections in its villages for more than 20 years. It is a question why an authoritarian state allows for democratic elections in the first place. One possible explanation is that village elections allow the authority to make a credible commitment to ordinary farmers that the state would give up its progressive policies implemented in the commune era. Based on nation-wide surveys, this seminar will provide evidence to show the nature, scope, and impacts of village elections. It will also discuss the prospect of democratization in the country at large.   March 5: Interest Groups, the Disinterested Government, and Economic Growth   Download this lecture   One serious impediment to economic growth in many developing countries is that the government is either captured by a few elites or trapped in divisive interest group politics. One distinctive feature of the Chinese government is that it has been disinterested in interest group politics. This allows it to focus on long-run economic growth of the country. In addition to providing evidence to show that the Chinese government has indeed been disinterested, this seminar will also provide a discussion on the political and social foundations for such a government to emerge in China.   March 12: Demographic Transition, Exports, and China's Growth Perspective   Download this lecture   The Chinese economy is the mirror image of the American economy: While the American economy is driven by innovation, consumption, and services, the Chinese economy is driven by imitation, investment, and manufacturing; while the US runs on huge trade deficits and capital inflows, China runs on huge trade surplus, but also on capital inflows. This seminar argues that the Chinese growth model has a lot to do with its demographics, which means that exports will still serve as a major engine for China's economic growth in the next ten to fifteen years. The mirror symmetry between China and the US may continue. In addition to offering an explanation to China's export-led growth model, this seminar will provide suggestions to break up this symmetry.

Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and the U.S.- Asia Law Institute at the NYU School of Law.        Lecture with:     Yang Yao , Professor and Deputy Director of the China Center for Economic Research (CCER) at Peking University     Topic: Elections, Accountability, and Farmers' Welfare in Chinese Villages     Date: November 30, 2007, 12:00 - 2:00 PM   Click here to listen to part one of the lecture (edited)     Click here to listen to part two                  Village elections have been the most significant development to the political life in rural China since the fall of the commune system in the early 1980s. They have empowered villagers to elect their own village officials and monitor their behavior in their tenure. This development has potentially important implications for villagers&rsquo; welfare. Based on several recent studies, this talk provides strong evidence supporting a positive role of village elections to enhance the accountability of the village officials, increase villagers&rsquo; income capabilities, and help them mitigate the negative effects of unexpected natural shocks and smooth their consumption.   This event is co-sponsored by NYU China House, NYU East Asian Studies Department, and the NYU Law School's US-Asia Law Institute.          Lecture with:    Donald Clarke , Visiting NYU Professor from George Washington University    Topic: The Ecology of Chinese Corporate Governance    Date: November 14, 2007, 5:00 - 7:00 PM           The last several years have seen a proliferation of rules about corporate governance in China. But how significant are the rules if enforcement mechanisms, whether state or non-state, are weak or lacking altogether? China&rsquo;s corporate governance regime relies heavily on the announcement of rules by government authorities and tends to overlook the institutions needed for making those rules meaningful. Lawmakers expect that regulated parties will read the legal texts and voluntarily obey; if they do not, their ignorance or moral failings are blamed, not the lack of enforcement institutions. Nor does the corporate governance regime look to non-governmental institutions for the making and enforcement of rules and standards. A major reason for this is simply political: the political system of China does not yet accept the existence of institutions that are both powerful and independent of the state. For all its progress over the quarter century, the post-Mao Chinese legal system remains an institution of only modest importance in the polity.   This event is co-sponsored by NYU China House and the Pollock Center of Law and Business.         Panel Discussion with:    Kurt Behrendt , Assistant Curator of South Asian Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art      Annette L. Juliano , Professor of Asian Art History, Rutgers University-Newark Campus      Chao-Hui Jenny Liu , Assistant Professor and Faculty Fellow of East Asian Art, New York University    Roderick Whitfield , Visiting Professor 2007-8, Department of History of Art, Yale University      Angela Zito , Associate Professor of Anthropology and Religious Studies, New York University   Topic: Buddhist Art in Context   Date: October 17, 2007, 4:00 - 6:00 PM          Three leading scholars working on Buddhist art in its multiple contexts are presenting their recent research at New York University. The speakers are Kurt Behrendt (The Metropolitan Museum of Art), Annette L. Juliano (Rutgers University), and Roderick Whitfield (Yale University). Their papers address recent advances in the study and presentation of Gandharan Art, Indian influences on the beginnings of Chinese Buddhist art, and the interpretation of smaller atypical Buddhist images from the ancient Chinese capital of Chang&rsquo;an (modern Xi&rsquo;an).   The Symposium will also afford a glimpse of the complexities involved in presenting Buddhist art away from its original context to a public, anticipating three separate exhibitions: two in New York City at The Metropolitan Museum of Art (re-installation from August 10, 2007) and The China Institute (September 20-December 8, 2007); and a third at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, in spring 2008. Chao-Hui Jenny Liu will moderate and Angela Zito (NYU Religious Studies/Anthropology) will serve as Discussant.   The Symposium is organized in collaboration with the Department of Art History at NYU. For more information please click here .            Panel Discussion with:    Dr. Lung-Chi Chen , Department of Environmental Medicine   Dr. Qingshan Qu , Department of Environmental Medicine   Dr. Arnold Stern , Associate Director for the Institute of Community Health and Research   Dr. Bernard Yeung , Professor of Global Business &amp; Director of China House   Topic: Environmental Health in China    Date:    April 26, 2007, 4:00 - 6:00 PM          Environmental pollution is of major concern to China as it undergoes rapid development in its transition to a market economy. To combat the consequences of pollution the Chinese government has established the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) whose function is to define national environmental policies and regulations, collect information about the environment and provide technological advice. Pollution of air, water and ground are significant in almost all areas of China. This has stimulated the government to create demonstration programs for combating pollution in several major cities and river valleys. SEPA is reviewing strategies for minimizing pollution and enforcing regulations to control pollution. Our speakers will inform us about the different types of pollution and suggest remedies for minimizing its consequences. Both the medical and the economic issues related to the pollution will be discussed, particularly in relationship to policy.                Speaker: Jerome Cohen, NYU Professor of Law   Topic:    &ldquo;Normalizing&rdquo; Relations with China, 1966-79: Memoirs of an Academic Participant-Observer  Date:   January 25, 2007, 4 - 6 PM    Click here to listen to the lecture (edited)     Jerome Cohen is the leading American expert on East Asian law and a pioneer in the introduction of East Asian legal systems and perspectives into the American legal curricula. A Professor of Law at NYU and Senior Fellow for Asia Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, Prof. Cohen regularly teaches on Chinese law and society and comparative international law, in particular analyzing how countries with a Confucian tradition relate to the international laws and traditions of the &ldquo;Christian West.&rdquo; Mr. Cohen is often consulted by the U.S. government and NGOs and has served as a trustee of the Asia Society, the China Institute, and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and as the director of the National Committee on U.S. &ndash; China Relations.   Prof. Jerome Cohen will be speaking on the atmosphere in the U.S. and China from 1966 to 1979 and, by recalling his own observations and participation, discuss the development of the American approach to China by taking into consideration the domestic and international legal questions that formed an important part of the policy discussions on both sides as well as their relation to domestic politics in the United States. Prof. Cohen will emphasize the broader and human aspects of these developments rather than their technical legal content and also refer to the implications of these events for our contemporary, unresolved issues with China.              Speaker: Pauline Yu, President, American Council of Learned Societies  Topic:   \"The Chinese Century? American Learning and Chinese Lessons\"  Date:   November 30, 2006, 4 - 6 PM    Click here to listen to the lecture (edited)     Pauline Yu, President of the American Council of Learned Societies, is a former Professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures and Dean of Humanities in the College of Letters and Science at UCLA.

PROPERTY RIGHTS AND URBAN GOVERNANCE IN CHINA     2 Talks:   In Search of a Property Tax Reform Strategy in China by Yu-Hung Hong   and   Closed Neighborhoods in Open Cities: The Political Logic of Spatial Change in Urban China by Meg Elizabeth Rithmire   Friday April 08, 2011  1:15 - 4:00  The Puck Building  Wagner Conference Room, Second Floor  295 Lafayette Street   In Search of a Property Tax Reform Strategy in China   Presenter: Yu-Hung Hong     Abstract:     In the midst of the debates over the proposed property tax reform in China, policymakers  and analysts have not been paying enough attention to one important matter: the  integration of the new property tax with the existing public leasehold system. Because  the Chinese government wants to retain its ownership of land, restructuring the current  land leasing system in China should be considered as a complementary strategy for  the property tax reform. Public land leasing and property taxation are local revenue  sources that can co-exit, supplementing each other as levies on land in form of leasehold  charges and tax. Different combinations of these revenue generating mechanisms will  provide an array of policy options for local governments to raise funds for financing local  infrastructure and services according to varying circumstances. Thus, the design of the  new property tax should not be conducted in isolation. Instead, it must be contemplated  in conjunction with the fiscal roles of current public leasehold system. This presentation  examines possibilities and challenges of combining property taxation and public land  leasing as an integrated approach to reforming China's local fiscal systems in general,  and capturing land value in particular.     About Yu-Hung Hong:     Dr. Yu-Hung Hong is a senior fellow at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. He earned  his Ph.D. in Urban Development and Masters in City Planning from the Department of  Urban Studies and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At  the Lincoln Institute, Dr. Hong focuses his research on issues related to property rights  and obligations, land management tools, and local public finance. Specifically, he is  interested in investigating how land value increments created by public investment  and community collaboration can be recaptured by the government for financing local  infrastructure and social services.     Dr. Hong has been teaching urban public finance since 1996. He is a visiting faculty in  the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT, teaching budgeting, fiscal policy  evaluation, urban public finance in developing countries, and advanced public finance  seminars. He was an assistant professor at the University of Akron in Ohio (1999-2003)  and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in China (1996-1998).     Dr. Hong publishes on topics related to property obligations, public land leasing, land  readjustment, and property taxation. He is the co-editor of nine books: Leasing Public  Land: Policy Debates and International Experiences (2003; translated into Chinese  in 2007); Analyzing Land Readjustment: Economics, Law, and Collective Action  (2007); Land Policies and Their Outcomes (2007); Fiscal Decentralization and Land  Policies (2008); Property Rights and Land Policies (2009); Smart Growth Policies:  An Evaluation of Programs and Outcomes (2009); Local Revenues and Land Policies  (2010); China's Local Public Finance in Transition (2010); and Climate change and  Land Policies (forthcoming).     Closed Neighborhoods in Open Cities: The Political Logic of Spatial Change in Urban China     Presenter: Meg Elizabeth Rithmire     Abstract: What explains variation in local governments' abilities to exert control over the territory within their        purview? Often, despite similar formal regulations governing the use and allocation of urban land, we observe great variation in the    extent to which local governments are able to secure themselves as the sole arbiter of the use, control, and transfer of urban     property rights. This paper utilizes a paired comparison of two cities in China, which has experienced both rapid urbanization and  a restructuring of the urban spatial economy to facilitate market reforms in place of state socialism, to examine the political logic  of urban spatial control. Starting from similar conditions in Northeastern China's rust belt in 1978, the city of Dalian proceeded  faster with opening its economy to global trade and investment while the city of Harbin pursued reinvestment in the state sector and  nurtured small-scale entrepreneurship. Based on interviews, archival research, and spatial data analysis using GIS, I trace how these  cities developed different informal property rights regimes as political strategies to negotiate with constituencies below them to  pursue economic growth as well as social stability. The findings bring to light the spatial dimension of local government plans for  economic growth and redistribution.

The illustrated talk surveys this cultural terrain and its ambivalent implications for cultural production and consumption in contemporary China, including Zhang Xian and partner Tang Ying&rsquo;s personal involvement in the alternative art and culture scene in Shanghai.   3:30&mdash;4:30pm Reception   ** The talks will be in Chinese with English translation.**   Co-sponsored by China House and the Department of Cinema Studies, TSOA at NYU     China's New Talent Policy: Implications and Impact for China's Development       Wednesday, March 2nd    3:30 PM    41 East 11th Street, rm 741     Presenting:   Wang Huiyao   China has undergone enormous economic changes in the past 30 years and now faces important decisions as it considers how best to sustain this unprecedented level of growth. China's population is aging rapidly and the 225 million migrant workers who have fueled China's economic miracle for the past three decades are now demanding better payment for their work. Further complicating the situation are the growing numbers of college graduates entering the job market: according to the Chinese government, China will have 195 million college-educated people by 2020. In response to these and other policy challenges, the Chinese leadership recently launched a major national talent development plan intended to cultivate, attract and retain highly skilled individuals in many sectors of the Chinese economy. This new plan has far-reaching implications for China's efforts to build an innovation-driven economy by 2020 and offers valuable insights for the global academic, business and policy communities.       Dr. Wang currently is a Visiting Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School and was a Visiting Fellow at Brookings Institution. He has been a senior advisor to the Chinese government at both central and local levels and has served as a Task Force Leader for Global Talents Strategy Study Group of Department of Organization of Central Government He is the Vice Chairman of China Talent Research Society of Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and also an Economic Team Leader for Overseas Experts Advisory Committee of China State Council Overseas Chinese Affairs Office.

The theory and practice of comparative literary history as theorized by Mario J. Vald&eacute;s and Linda Hutcheon and implemented in two literary history projects on Central-Eastern Europe and Latin America provides a timely incentive for Chinese literary scholars to move research forward beyond the current divergence between a persistent lack of interest in literary history in English scholarship and an inundation of literary histories in Chinese. Not surprisingly, the recent call in China for defamilarization and micro-histories demonstrates the desire to break away from the orthodox model of comprehensive historiography, and a comparative examination of sample literary histories in Chinese may yield insights to be gained from, and further developed on, a reconceptualization of literary history in terms of rupture, diversity and heterogeneity, rather than continuity, singularity and homogeneity.

Critical reflections on the making of 'Modern Chinese Philosophy':  an anthropological moment?   Joel Thoraval     Time: 2:00 PM - 4:30 PM, Tuesday, December 1, 2009    Location: The Department of East Asian Studies   715 Broadway, rm. 312   One of the most remarkable manifestations of Confucianism's &quot;Modern Fate&quot; was the creation of particularly compelling philosophical systems during the 20th century.   Taking place in the context of new academic institutions modeled on European universities, the transformation of Confucian thought into a modern philosophical discourse by such thinkers as Mou Zongsan (1909-1995) was motivated by the desire of maintaining the ultimate meaning of neo-Confucian teachings in terms of their ideal of self-cultivation (neisheng). But this academic transformation was also accompanied by difficulties and aporia on   account of barriers that were created to establish Philosophy as a separate discipline, which was consequently cut off from traditional Confucian practices.   In this instance, the &quot;anthropological moment&quot;, in the process of analyzing this phenomenon, designates the possibility of making a detour through the observation of symbolic practices (religious, educational, esthetic) which illuminate both the creativity and the blind spots of modern &quot;Confucian Philosophy.&quot;   Joel Thoraval will try to approach this problem in the light of his own experience which has been a combination of the study of philosophical texts and anthropological field work.

See presentation images and video   This talk is about boundaries and ritual spaces in Liza Lim's compositional practice referencing aspects of Chinese culture such as archaeology, calligraphy, myths and opera performance.   Liza Lim (b.1966) is an Australian composer who writes music marked by visceral energy and vibrant color, often exploring forms of ritual and performance aesthetics drawn from both Asian and Australian Aboriginal sources. In describing her music, she counterpoints terms such as &quot;radiance and shadows&quot; and &quot;violence and meditation&quot;. Her works, which range from operatic and orchestral scores to site-specific installations, have been performed by some of the world's most eminent ensembles. Notably, she was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic to write the orchestral work, Ecstatic Architecture to celebrate the inaugural season of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2004. Recent major commissions have been received from the Festival d'Automne Paris, Salzburg Festival, Bayerischer Rundfunk Orchestra and Lucerne Festival. She was composer-in-residence with the Sydney Symphony (between 2004-06) and has had close artistic partnerships with the Australian ELISION ensemble, Ensemble Intercontemporain Paris and Ensemble fur neue musik Zurich. Her third opera 'The Navigator' was commissioned by the Brisbane and Melbourne International Arts Festivals who presented premiere seasons in 2008. There are upcoming seasons of the opera at the Chekhov International Theatre Festival, Moscow (June 2009) and Festival d'Automne Paris (Dec 2009).   Lim has received major fellowships and awards from the Australia Council, Fromm Foundation, Ian Potter Foundation, DAAD Berlin and won the 2004 Paul Lowin Prize for orchestral composition. She has an extensive publication record with Ricordi (Milan and London). She is currently Professor of Composition and director of the Centre for Research in New Music at the University of Huddersfield, UK.     Of Two Minds: Freud and Revolutionary Spirit in China   A Seminar presented by Wendy Larson   An NYU China House &amp; EAS Event   Time: 1:30-3:30pm, Tuesday, April 7 2009   Location: East Asian Studies conference room 312, 3rd floor, Broadway 715   Please RSVP to ellen.he@nyu.edu to receive reading materials provided by Professor Wendy Larson.   Wendy Larson is Professor of East Asian Languages and Literatures at the University of Oregon, with a specialty in modern Chinese literature and film. Her recent work includes From Ah Q to Lei Feng: Freud and Revolutionary Spirit in 20th Century China (Stanford UP 2008), and &quot;Zhang Yimou's Hero: Dismantling the Myth of Cultural Power&quot; (Journal of Chinese Cinemas V.2 N.3 2008).     &quot;Invincible for Aye!&quot; Melancholy and Wrath, or Towards the Utopia of Purge   A Seminar presented by Wolfgang Kubin ( download article )   An NYU China House &amp; EAS Event   Time: 11:30-2:30pm, Monday, March 30 2009   Location: 20 Cooper Square, Humanities Initiative, 5th Floor, Conference Room 503   In order to be successful, any kind of revolution has to simultaneously fulfill two preconditions: first of all, it has materials such as land and property to be redistributed; secondly, it promises the mass a utopian society. This is so because the revolutionary, who very often is of melancholic, even depressive nature, needs to mobilize the mass by persuading them that they should be either unhappy about or dissatisfied with their current living conditions. In short, he has to produce the wrath of the masses. All revolutions, however, are doomed to fail as soon as all previous property is used up and once the mass discover that the new master is more demanding than the old. This is true not only for East Europe before 1989, but also for China before 1979. After 1979, a rescue for Chinese socialism is even to have more exploitation of natural resources and man power, i.e., to ask help from capitalism. Thus, this talk tries to show how the idea of Utopia is manipulated as a tool by and for China's new ruling power.   Kubin, Wolfgang (in Chinese: Gu Bin) is Professor of Chinese Studies at Bonn University and works as a translator and a writer, too. In 1985 he was appointed professor of Chinese at Bonn University. At first he worked at the Department of Oriental Languages where he was in charge of the Chinese section. Since 1995 he has been the head of the Department of Chinese Studies. Since 1989 he has been editing the journals Orientierungen. Zeitschrift zur Kultur Asiens and minima sinica. Zeitschrift zum chinesischen Geist. Since 2002 he has been writing and editing the history of Chinese literature Geschichte der chinesischen Literatur, which is intended to comprise ten volumes.

A Seminar presented by Cui Zhiyuan   An NYU China House &amp; EAS Event   Time: 1:30-3:30pm, Wednesday March 04 2009   Location: East Asian Studies conference room 312, 3rd floor, Broadway 715   On December 25th 2008, the New York Times published an article titled &quot;Chinese Savings helped Inflate American Bubble&quot;. It reported that Bernanke, Paulson and many American economists were arguing that by having invested more than US$1trillion dollars of its own money into American government bonds and government-backed mortgage debt and repeatedly lowering its interest rates China had actually helped fuelled a historic consumption binge and housing bubble in the United States. The assertion triggered an angry response from the People's Daily. This lecture argues that it is a daunting task to answer the American charge that &quot;you spoiled us&quot;, since it requires both internal adjustment of China's development strategy as well as a reconstruction of the international monetary system.   Cui Zhiyuan is a Professor at the School of Public Policy and Management, Tsinghua University, Beijing. In the spring semester of 2008, he is the Anthony W. and Lulu C.Wang Distinguished Visiting Professor at Cornell University Law School.

With Huang Ping, he co-edited &quot;China and Globalization: Washington Consensus, Beijing Consensus or what?&quot; (Beijing, 2005)     Variations between Culture and Politics:   War, Revolution and Cultural Movement in the Era of May Forth   A Seminar presented by Wang Hui   An NYU China House &amp; EAS Event   Time: 1:30-3:30pm, Tuesday March 03 2009   Location: East Asian Studies conference room 312, 3rd floor, Broadway 715   The significance of the May Forth Movement becomes more and more obscure at its ninetieth anniversary. Current May Forth studies tend to focus on the evolvement of the ideas such as Science, Democracy and Republic and favor positivism instead of revealing any innovative value of this historical event. This talk will investigate &quot;the East-West Cultural Debate&quot; between The Eastern Miscellany and The New Youth then edited by Du Yaquan and Chen Duxiu, respectively. Du proposed to reconcile the West and East in terms of culture while Chen radically called for &quot;educating the Youth&quot;. Thus I will argue that the May Forth, situated at the beginning of &quot;the Short Twentieth Century&quot;, is indeed an origin of variations between Culture and Politics that unfolds a historical chapter of &quot;the transformation of consciousness&quot; in modern China.   Wang Hui is a professor of the School of Humanities, Tsinghua University, Beijing. In the past a few years, he was the visiting professor at Universit&agrave; di Bologna, New York University, University of Tokyo and Universit&auml;t Heidelberg, respectively.

The Institutional Foundations of China's Economic Growth   A Seminar Series   Professor Yang Yao ( Vita )   National School of Development &amp; China Center for Economic Research   Peking University   Place: EAS, 715 Broadway, rm 312   Time: Thursday afternoon 3:00 - 6:15   Format: 1hr 30 min. lecture and 1hr 45 min. discussions   Students who are able to attend every seminar may enroll in it as a 2 credit course, however, students and faculty are invited to sit-in on any seminar that they'd like to attend.   Below is a description of each week's topic:   January 29: Does China Offer An Alternative Model to Economic Development?   Download this lecture   China's economic success along with an authoritarian political system raises the question whether China has created an alternative model for economic development. This seminar answers this question at two levels, one pure economic, and the other political economy. At the economic level, China does not create a new model but has rather followed the standard policy recommendations of neoclassical economics. At the political economy level, China does have created experiences that could offer potential lessons to other developing countries. Researchers can find some growth-enhancing mechanisms from the Chinese experience that apply beyond the borders of political systems. The seminar will identify several areas where such mechanisms are likely to be found.   February 5: Incentives before Institutions:A Chinese Way to Economic Reform   Download this lecture   Recent development literature reiterates Douglass North's thesis that &quot;institutions matter.&quot; However, the Chinese experience shows that it requires more than this thesis if one is serious about making institutions work in developing countries. Local conditions almost always oblige imported institutions to be modified. China's economic reform has often resulted in temporary and mid-way institutions. They worked under the circumstances that created them. In addition, one has to consider how to incentivize government officials to adopt good institutions. The Chinese experience has shown that providing incentives is more important than pursuing institutional purity in economic growth.   February 12: The Ruling Party and Economic Growth   Download this lecture   Why does the CCP, the single dominant power in China, care about economic growth? One explanation resorts to its ideological convictions. Another theory proposes that institutionalization within the party is the key to the explanation. This seminar suggests that looking at the CCP's sources of legitimacy and the Chinese social structure may provide a better understanding on why the CCP cares about economic growth. The lack of procedure-based legitimacy forces the CCP to seek for legitimacy from continuous delivery of outcomes to the society. The Chinese society is a socially equal one, preempting the CCP's intention to court a few strong groups; that is, it is in its self-interests to deliver growth to China as a whole.   February 19: Land Tenure, Productivity, and Farmer Protection   Download this lecture   Land tenure is a contentious issue in current China because it not only has a lot to do with productivity, but also affects farmers' welfare, especially facing government requisition of land. Land is both an economic asset with fungible values and a means which together with labor enables farmers to insure against negative shocks. The current land tenure may have reached a balance between these two functions of land. This seminar will both review the history of Chinese land tenure and provide an account of recent developments in making land a more fungible asset.   February 26: Democratization in the Countryside and Its Impacts   Download this lecture   China has had democratic elections in its villages for more than 20 years. It is a question why an authoritarian state allows for democratic elections in the first place. One possible explanation is that village elections allow the authority to make a credible commitment to ordinary farmers that the state would give up its progressive policies implemented in the commune era. Based on nation-wide surveys, this seminar will provide evidence to show the nature, scope, and impacts of village elections. It will also discuss the prospect of democratization in the country at large.   March 5: Interest Groups, the Disinterested Government, and Economic Growth   Download this lecture   One serious impediment to economic growth in many developing countries is that the government is either captured by a few elites or trapped in divisive interest group politics. One distinctive feature of the Chinese government is that it has been disinterested in interest group politics. This allows it to focus on long-run economic growth of the country. In addition to providing evidence to show that the Chinese government has indeed been disinterested, this seminar will also provide a discussion on the political and social foundations for such a government to emerge in China.   March 12: Demographic Transition, Exports, and China's Growth Perspective   Download this lecture   The Chinese economy is the mirror image of the American economy: While the American economy is driven by innovation, consumption, and services, the Chinese economy is driven by imitation, investment, and manufacturing; while the US runs on huge trade deficits and capital inflows, China runs on huge trade surplus, but also on capital inflows. This seminar argues that the Chinese growth model has a lot to do with its demographics, which means that exports will still serve as a major engine for China's economic growth in the next ten to fifteen years. The mirror symmetry between China and the US may continue. In addition to offering an explanation to China's export-led growth model, this seminar will provide suggestions to break up this symmetry.

Lecture with:     Yang Yao , Professor and Deputy Director of the China Center for Economic Research (CCER) at Peking University     Topic: Elections, Accountability, and Farmers' Welfare in Chinese Villages     Date: November 30, 2007, 12:00 - 2:00 PM   Click here to listen to part one of the lecture (edited)     Click here to listen to part two                  Village elections have been the most significant development to the political life in rural China since the fall of the commune system in the early 1980s. They have empowered villagers to elect their own village officials and monitor their behavior in their tenure. This development has potentially important implications for villagers&rsquo; welfare. Based on several recent studies, this talk provides strong evidence supporting a positive role of village elections to enhance the accountability of the village officials, increase villagers&rsquo; income capabilities, and help them mitigate the negative effects of unexpected natural shocks and smooth their consumption.   This event is co-sponsored by NYU China House, NYU East Asian Studies Department, and the NYU Law School's US-Asia Law Institute.          Lecture with:    Donald Clarke , Visiting NYU Professor from George Washington University    Topic: The Ecology of Chinese Corporate Governance    Date: November 14, 2007, 5:00 - 7:00 PM           The last several years have seen a proliferation of rules about corporate governance in China. But how significant are the rules if enforcement mechanisms, whether state or non-state, are weak or lacking altogether? China&rsquo;s corporate governance regime relies heavily on the announcement of rules by government authorities and tends to overlook the institutions needed for making those rules meaningful. Lawmakers expect that regulated parties will read the legal texts and voluntarily obey; if they do not, their ignorance or moral failings are blamed, not the lack of enforcement institutions. Nor does the corporate governance regime look to non-governmental institutions for the making and enforcement of rules and standards. A major reason for this is simply political: the political system of China does not yet accept the existence of institutions that are both powerful and independent of the state. For all its progress over the quarter century, the post-Mao Chinese legal system remains an institution of only modest importance in the polity.   This event is co-sponsored by NYU China House and the Pollock Center of Law and Business.         Panel Discussion with:    Kurt Behrendt , Assistant Curator of South Asian Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art      Annette L. Juliano , Professor of Asian Art History, Rutgers University-Newark Campus      Chao-Hui Jenny Liu , Assistant Professor and Faculty Fellow of East Asian Art, New York University    Roderick Whitfield , Visiting Professor 2007-8, Department of History of Art, Yale University      Angela Zito , Associate Professor of Anthropology and Religious Studies, New York University   Topic: Buddhist Art in Context   Date: October 17, 2007, 4:00 - 6:00 PM          Three leading scholars working on Buddhist art in its multiple contexts are presenting their recent research at New York University. The speakers are Kurt Behrendt (The Metropolitan Museum of Art), Annette L. Juliano (Rutgers University), and Roderick Whitfield (Yale University). Their papers address recent advances in the study and presentation of Gandharan Art, Indian influences on the beginnings of Chinese Buddhist art, and the interpretation of smaller atypical Buddhist images from the ancient Chinese capital of Chang&rsquo;an (modern Xi&rsquo;an).   The Symposium will also afford a glimpse of the complexities involved in presenting Buddhist art away from its original context to a public, anticipating three separate exhibitions: two in New York City at The Metropolitan Museum of Art (re-installation from August 10, 2007) and The China Institute (September 20-December 8, 2007); and a third at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, in spring 2008. Chao-Hui Jenny Liu will moderate and Angela Zito (NYU Religious Studies/Anthropology) will serve as Discussant.   The Symposium is organized in collaboration with the Department of Art History at NYU. For more information please click here .            Panel Discussion with:    Dr. Lung-Chi Chen , Department of Environmental Medicine   Dr. Qingshan Qu , Department of Environmental Medicine   Dr. Arnold Stern , Associate Director for the Institute of Community Health and Research   Dr. Bernard Yeung , Professor of Global Business &amp; Director of China House   Topic: Environmental Health in China    Date:    April 26, 2007, 4:00 - 6:00 PM          Environmental pollution is of major concern to China as it undergoes rapid development in its transition to a market economy. To combat the consequences of pollution the Chinese government has established the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) whose function is to define national environmental policies and regulations, collect information about the environment and provide technological advice. Pollution of air, water and ground are significant in almost all areas of China. This has stimulated the government to create demonstration programs for combating pollution in several major cities and river valleys. SEPA is reviewing strategies for minimizing pollution and enforcing regulations to control pollution. Our speakers will inform us about the different types of pollution and suggest remedies for minimizing its consequences. Both the medical and the economic issues related to the pollution will be discussed, particularly in relationship to policy.                Speaker: Jerome Cohen, NYU Professor of Law   Topic:    &ldquo;Normalizing&rdquo; Relations with China, 1966-79: Memoirs of an Academic Participant-Observer  Date:   January 25, 2007, 4 - 6 PM    Click here to listen to the lecture (edited)     Jerome Cohen is the leading American expert on East Asian law and a pioneer in the introduction of East Asian legal systems and perspectives into the American legal curricula. A Professor of Law at NYU and Senior Fellow for Asia Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, Prof. Cohen regularly teaches on Chinese law and society and comparative international law, in particular analyzing how countries with a Confucian tradition relate to the international laws and traditions of the &ldquo;Christian West.&rdquo; Mr. Cohen is often consulted by the U.S. government and NGOs and has served as a trustee of the Asia Society, the China Institute, and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and as the director of the National Committee on U.S. &ndash; China Relations.   Prof. Jerome Cohen will be speaking on the atmosphere in the U.S. and China from 1966 to 1979 and, by recalling his own observations and participation, discuss the development of the American approach to China by taking into consideration the domestic and international legal questions that formed an important part of the policy discussions on both sides as well as their relation to domestic politics in the United States. Prof. Cohen will emphasize the broader and human aspects of these developments rather than their technical legal content and also refer to the implications of these events for our contemporary, unresolved issues with China.

PROPERTY RIGHTS AND URBAN GOVERNANCE IN CHINA     2 Talks:   In Search of a Property Tax Reform Strategy in China by Yu-Hung Hong   and   Closed Neighborhoods in Open Cities: The Political Logic of Spatial Change in Urban China by Meg Elizabeth Rithmire   Friday April 08, 2011  1:15 - 4:00  The Puck Building  Wagner Conference Room, Second Floor  295 Lafayette Street   In Search of a Property Tax Reform Strategy in China   Presenter: Yu-Hung Hong     Abstract:     In the midst of the debates over the proposed property tax reform in China, policymakers  and analysts have not been paying enough attention to one important matter: the  integration of the new property tax with the existing public leasehold system. Because  the Chinese government wants to retain its ownership of land, restructuring the current  land leasing system in China should be considered as a complementary strategy for  the property tax reform. Public land leasing and property taxation are local revenue  sources that can co-exit, supplementing each other as levies on land in form of leasehold  charges and tax. Different combinations of these revenue generating mechanisms will  provide an array of policy options for local governments to raise funds for financing local  infrastructure and services according to varying circumstances. Thus, the design of the  new property tax should not be conducted in isolation. Instead, it must be contemplated  in conjunction with the fiscal roles of current public leasehold system. This presentation  examines possibilities and challenges of combining property taxation and public land  leasing as an integrated approach to reforming China's local fiscal systems in general,  and capturing land value in particular.     About Yu-Hung Hong:     Dr. Yu-Hung Hong is a senior fellow at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. He earned  his Ph.D. in Urban Development and Masters in City Planning from the Department of  Urban Studies and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At  the Lincoln Institute, Dr. Hong focuses his research on issues related to property rights  and obligations, land management tools, and local public finance. Specifically, he is  interested in investigating how land value increments created by public investment  and community collaboration can be recaptured by the government for financing local  infrastructure and social services.     Dr. Hong has been teaching urban public finance since 1996. He is a visiting faculty in  the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT, teaching budgeting, fiscal policy  evaluation, urban public finance in developing countries, and advanced public finance  seminars. He was an assistant professor at the University of Akron in Ohio (1999-2003)  and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in China (1996-1998).     Dr. Hong publishes on topics related to property obligations, public land leasing, land  readjustment, and property taxation. He is the co-editor of nine books: Leasing Public  Land: Policy Debates and International Experiences (2003; translated into Chinese  in 2007); Analyzing Land Readjustment: Economics, Law, and Collective Action  (2007); Land Policies and Their Outcomes (2007); Fiscal Decentralization and Land  Policies (2008); Property Rights and Land Policies (2009); Smart Growth Policies:  An Evaluation of Programs and Outcomes (2009); Local Revenues and Land Policies  (2010); China's Local Public Finance in Transition (2010); and Climate change and  Land Policies (forthcoming).     Closed Neighborhoods in Open Cities: The Political Logic of Spatial Change in Urban China     Presenter: Meg Elizabeth Rithmire     Abstract: What explains variation in local governments' abilities to exert control over the territory within their        purview? Often, despite similar formal regulations governing the use and allocation of urban land, we observe great variation in the    extent to which local governments are able to secure themselves as the sole arbiter of the use, control, and transfer of urban     property rights. This paper utilizes a paired comparison of two cities in China, which has experienced both rapid urbanization and  a restructuring of the urban spatial economy to facilitate market reforms in place of state socialism, to examine the political logic  of urban spatial control. Starting from similar conditions in Northeastern China's rust belt in 1978, the city of Dalian proceeded  faster with opening its economy to global trade and investment while the city of Harbin pursued reinvestment in the state sector and  nurtured small-scale entrepreneurship. Based on interviews, archival research, and spatial data analysis using GIS, I trace how these  cities developed different informal property rights regimes as political strategies to negotiate with constituencies below them to  pursue economic growth as well as social stability. The findings bring to light the spatial dimension of local government plans for  economic growth and redistribution.     About Meg Elizabeth Rithmire:     Meg is now a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard, focusing on Chinese and comparative urban politics. This   talk is from her dissertation, the research for which has been funded by the Fulbright as well as the Chinese Ministry of   Education. In the fall, she will begin a position as an assistant professor in the Business, Government, and International Economy   unit of the Harvard Business School.     Co-sponsored by China House and NYU Wagner School         THE POLITICS OF CONTEMPORARY CHINESE CINEMA AND CULTURAL CRITICISM      A workshop with TANG YING and ZHANG XIAN, acclaimed Chinese writers, critics, and performance festival organizers.   The Department of Cinema Studies  Tisch School of the Arts  New York University   Friday, March 11th   721 Broadway  Room 652   1:00-2:00pm   Tang Ying ??      &quot;Point of No Return: On the Production Process of Go for Broke (1999)&rdquo;        Tang Ying discusses the vicissitudes in the making of the first &ldquo;independent&rdquo; film within the official Chinese film system. Aided with clips, Tang Ying offers an insider&rsquo;s account and critical assessment on a unique docudrama about the bankruptcy of a state-owned factory in Shanghai and the workers&rsquo; effort to reclaim it.   Coffee break   2:30-3:30pm   Zhang Xian ??      &quot;POST-Z(H)OMBISM&rdquo;   A vernacular neologism initially for describing unnatural affectations and excess in the reform-era youth culture, &ldquo;Zhomism&rdquo;has in the past decade become a form of virulent discursive attacks on anything canonical, serious and provocative popular among Chinese cultural critics, who choose to forego aesthetic and ethical considerations. The illustrated talk surveys this cultural terrain and its ambivalent implications for cultural production and consumption in contemporary China, including Zhang Xian and partner Tang Ying&rsquo;s personal involvement in the alternative art and culture scene in Shanghai.   3:30&mdash;4:30pm Reception   ** The talks will be in Chinese with English translation.**   Co-sponsored by China House and the Department of Cinema Studies, TSOA at NYU     China's New Talent Policy: Implications and Impact for China's Development       Wednesday, March 2nd    3:30 PM    41 East 11th Street, rm 741     Presenting:   Wang Huiyao   China has undergone enormous economic changes in the past 30 years and now faces important decisions as it considers how best to sustain this unprecedented level of growth. China's population is aging rapidly and the 225 million migrant workers who have fueled China's economic miracle for the past three decades are now demanding better payment for their work. Further complicating the situation are the growing numbers of college graduates entering the job market: according to the Chinese government, China will have 195 million college-educated people by 2020. In response to these and other policy challenges, the Chinese leadership recently launched a major national talent development plan intended to cultivate, attract and retain highly skilled individuals in many sectors of the Chinese economy. This new plan has far-reaching implications for China's efforts to build an innovation-driven economy by 2020 and offers valuable insights for the global academic, business and policy communities.

The theory and practice of comparative literary history as theorized by Mario J. Vald&eacute;s and Linda Hutcheon and implemented in two literary history projects on Central-Eastern Europe and Latin America provides a timely incentive for Chinese literary scholars to move research forward beyond the current divergence between a persistent lack of interest in literary history in English scholarship and an inundation of literary histories in Chinese. Not surprisingly, the recent call in China for defamilarization and micro-histories demonstrates the desire to break away from the orthodox model of comprehensive historiography, and a comparative examination of sample literary histories in Chinese may yield insights to be gained from, and further developed on, a reconceptualization of literary history in terms of rupture, diversity and heterogeneity, rather than continuity, singularity and homogeneity.   Yingjin Zhang is Director of Chinese Studies Program and Professor of Chinese and Comparative Literature at University of California-San Diego. His English books include The City in Modern Chinese Literature and Film (1996), Encyclopedia of Chinese Film (1998), China in a Polycentric World (1998), Cinema and Urban Culture in ShanghaiScreening China (2002), Chinese National Cinema (2004), From Underground to Independent (2006), Cinema, Space, and Polylocality in a Globalizing China (2010), and Chinese Film Stars (2010).

Critical reflections on the making of 'Modern Chinese Philosophy':  an anthropological moment?   Joel Thoraval     Time: 2:00 PM - 4:30 PM, Tuesday, December 1, 2009    Location: The Department of East Asian Studies   715 Broadway, rm. 312   One of the most remarkable manifestations of Confucianism's &quot;Modern Fate&quot; was the creation of particularly compelling philosophical systems during the 20th century.   Taking place in the context of new academic institutions modeled on European universities, the transformation of Confucian thought into a modern philosophical discourse by such thinkers as Mou Zongsan (1909-1995) was motivated by the desire of maintaining the ultimate meaning of neo-Confucian teachings in terms of their ideal of self-cultivation (neisheng). But this academic transformation was also accompanied by difficulties and aporia on   account of barriers that were created to establish Philosophy as a separate discipline, which was consequently cut off from traditional Confucian practices.   In this instance, the &quot;anthropological moment&quot;, in the process of analyzing this phenomenon, designates the possibility of making a detour through the observation of symbolic practices (religious, educational, esthetic) which illuminate both the creativity and the blind spots of modern &quot;Confucian Philosophy.&quot;   Joel Thoraval will try to approach this problem in the light of his own experience which has been a combination of the study of philosophical texts and anthropological field work.

See presentation images and video   This talk is about boundaries and ritual spaces in Liza Lim's compositional practice referencing aspects of Chinese culture such as archaeology, calligraphy, myths and opera performance.   Liza Lim (b.1966) is an Australian composer who writes music marked by visceral energy and vibrant color, often exploring forms of ritual and performance aesthetics drawn from both Asian and Australian Aboriginal sources. In describing her music, she counterpoints terms such as &quot;radiance and shadows&quot; and &quot;violence and meditation&quot;. Her works, which range from operatic and orchestral scores to site-specific installations, have been performed by some of the world's most eminent ensembles. Notably, she was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic to write the orchestral work, Ecstatic Architecture to celebrate the inaugural season of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2004. Recent major commissions have been received from the Festival d'Automne Paris, Salzburg Festival, Bayerischer Rundfunk Orchestra and Lucerne Festival. She was composer-in-residence with the Sydney Symphony (between 2004-06) and has had close artistic partnerships with the Australian ELISION ensemble, Ensemble Intercontemporain Paris and Ensemble fur neue musik Zurich. Her third opera 'The Navigator' was commissioned by the Brisbane and Melbourne International Arts Festivals who presented premiere seasons in 2008. There are upcoming seasons of the opera at the Chekhov International Theatre Festival, Moscow (June 2009) and Festival d'Automne Paris (Dec 2009).   Lim has received major fellowships and awards from the Australia Council, Fromm Foundation, Ian Potter Foundation, DAAD Berlin and won the 2004 Paul Lowin Prize for orchestral composition. She has an extensive publication record with Ricordi (Milan and London). She is currently Professor of Composition and director of the Centre for Research in New Music at the University of Huddersfield, UK.     Of Two Minds: Freud and Revolutionary Spirit in China   A Seminar presented by Wendy Larson   An NYU China House &amp; EAS Event   Time: 1:30-3:30pm, Tuesday, April 7 2009   Location: East Asian Studies conference room 312, 3rd floor, Broadway 715   Please RSVP to ellen.he@nyu.edu to receive reading materials provided by Professor Wendy Larson.   Wendy Larson is Professor of East Asian Languages and Literatures at the University of Oregon, with a specialty in modern Chinese literature and film. Her recent work includes From Ah Q to Lei Feng: Freud and Revolutionary Spirit in 20th Century China (Stanford UP 2008), and &quot;Zhang Yimou's Hero: Dismantling the Myth of Cultural Power&quot; (Journal of Chinese Cinemas V.2 N.3 2008).     &quot;Invincible for Aye!&quot; Melancholy and Wrath, or Towards the Utopia of Purge   A Seminar presented by Wolfgang Kubin ( download article )   An NYU China House &amp; EAS Event   Time: 11:30-2:30pm, Monday, March 30 2009   Location: 20 Cooper Square, Humanities Initiative, 5th Floor, Conference Room 503   In order to be successful, any kind of revolution has to simultaneously fulfill two preconditions: first of all, it has materials such as land and property to be redistributed; secondly, it promises the mass a utopian society. This is so because the revolutionary, who very often is of melancholic, even depressive nature, needs to mobilize the mass by persuading them that they should be either unhappy about or dissatisfied with their current living conditions. In short, he has to produce the wrath of the masses. All revolutions, however, are doomed to fail as soon as all previous property is used up and once the mass discover that the new master is more demanding than the old. This is true not only for East Europe before 1989, but also for China before 1979. After 1979, a rescue for Chinese socialism is even to have more exploitation of natural resources and man power, i.e., to ask help from capitalism. Thus, this talk tries to show how the idea of Utopia is manipulated as a tool by and for China's new ruling power.   Kubin, Wolfgang (in Chinese: Gu Bin) is Professor of Chinese Studies at Bonn University and works as a translator and a writer, too. In 1985 he was appointed professor of Chinese at Bonn University. At first he worked at the Department of Oriental Languages where he was in charge of the Chinese section. Since 1995 he has been the head of the Department of Chinese Studies. Since 1989 he has been editing the journals Orientierungen. Zeitschrift zur Kultur Asiens and minima sinica. Zeitschrift zum chinesischen Geist. Since 2002 he has been writing and editing the history of Chinese literature Geschichte der chinesischen Literatur, which is intended to comprise ten volumes. Wolfgang Kubin focuses on Chinese literature and the intellectual history of imperial and modern China. For his scholarly and literary work as well as in the field of translation he was awarded several prizes and honorary professorships.

A Seminar presented by Cui Zhiyuan   An NYU China House &amp; EAS Event   Time: 1:30-3:30pm, Wednesday March 04 2009   Location: East Asian Studies conference room 312, 3rd floor, Broadway 715   On December 25th 2008, the New York Times published an article titled &quot;Chinese Savings helped Inflate American Bubble&quot;. It reported that Bernanke, Paulson and many American economists were arguing that by having invested more than US$1trillion dollars of its own money into American government bonds and government-backed mortgage debt and repeatedly lowering its interest rates China had actually helped fuelled a historic consumption binge and housing bubble in the United States. The assertion triggered an angry response from the People's Daily. This lecture argues that it is a daunting task to answer the American charge that &quot;you spoiled us&quot;, since it requires both internal adjustment of China's development strategy as well as a reconstruction of the international monetary system.   Cui Zhiyuan is a Professor at the School of Public Policy and Management, Tsinghua University, Beijing. In the spring semester of 2008, he is the Anthony W. and Lulu C.Wang Distinguished Visiting Professor at Cornell University Law School.

With Huang Ping, he co-edited &quot;China and Globalization: Washington Consensus, Beijing Consensus or what?&quot; (Beijing, 2005)     Variations between Culture and Politics:   War, Revolution and Cultural Movement in the Era of May Forth   A Seminar presented by Wang Hui   An NYU China House &amp; EAS Event   Time: 1:30-3:30pm, Tuesday March 03 2009   Location: East Asian Studies conference room 312, 3rd floor, Broadway 715   The significance of the May Forth Movement becomes more and more obscure at its ninetieth anniversary. Current May Forth studies tend to focus on the evolvement of the ideas such as Science, Democracy and Republic and favor positivism instead of revealing any innovative value of this historical event. This talk will investigate &quot;the East-West Cultural Debate&quot; between The Eastern Miscellany and The New Youth then edited by Du Yaquan and Chen Duxiu, respectively. Du proposed to reconcile the West and East in terms of culture while Chen radically called for &quot;educating the Youth&quot;. Thus I will argue that the May Forth, situated at the beginning of &quot;the Short Twentieth Century&quot;, is indeed an origin of variations between Culture and Politics that unfolds a historical chapter of &quot;the transformation of consciousness&quot; in modern China.   Wang Hui is a professor of the School of Humanities, Tsinghua University, Beijing. In the past a few years, he was the visiting professor at Universit&agrave; di Bologna, New York University, University of Tokyo and Universit&auml;t Heidelberg, respectively.

The Institutional Foundations of China's Economic Growth   A Seminar Series   Professor Yang Yao ( Vita )   National School of Development &amp; China Center for Economic Research   Peking University   Place: EAS, 715 Broadway, rm 312   Time: Thursday afternoon 3:00 - 6:15   Format: 1hr 30 min. lecture and 1hr 45 min. discussions   Students who are able to attend every seminar may enroll in it as a 2 credit course, however, students and faculty are invited to sit-in on any seminar that they'd like to attend.   Below is a description of each week's topic:   January 29: Does China Offer An Alternative Model to Economic Development?   Download this lecture   China's economic success along with an authoritarian political system raises the question whether China has created an alternative model for economic development. This seminar answers this question at two levels, one pure economic, and the other political economy. At the economic level, China does not create a new model but has rather followed the standard policy recommendations of neoclassical economics. At the political economy level, China does have created experiences that could offer potential lessons to other developing countries. Researchers can find some growth-enhancing mechanisms from the Chinese experience that apply beyond the borders of political systems. The seminar will identify several areas where such mechanisms are likely to be found.   February 5: Incentives before Institutions:A Chinese Way to Economic Reform   Download this lecture   Recent development literature reiterates Douglass North's thesis that &quot;institutions matter.&quot; However, the Chinese experience shows that it requires more than this thesis if one is serious about making institutions work in developing countries. Local conditions almost always oblige imported institutions to be modified. China's economic reform has often resulted in temporary and mid-way institutions. They worked under the circumstances that created them. In addition, one has to consider how to incentivize government officials to adopt good institutions. The Chinese experience has shown that providing incentives is more important than pursuing institutional purity in economic growth.   February 12: The Ruling Party and Economic Growth   Download this lecture   Why does the CCP, the single dominant power in China, care about economic growth? One explanation resorts to its ideological convictions. Another theory proposes that institutionalization within the party is the key to the explanation. This seminar suggests that looking at the CCP's sources of legitimacy and the Chinese social structure may provide a better understanding on why the CCP cares about economic growth. The lack of procedure-based legitimacy forces the CCP to seek for legitimacy from continuous delivery of outcomes to the society. The Chinese society is a socially equal one, preempting the CCP's intention to court a few strong groups; that is, it is in its self-interests to deliver growth to China as a whole.   February 19: Land Tenure, Productivity, and Farmer Protection   Download this lecture   Land tenure is a contentious issue in current China because it not only has a lot to do with productivity, but also affects farmers' welfare, especially facing government requisition of land. Land is both an economic asset with fungible values and a means which together with labor enables farmers to insure against negative shocks. The current land tenure may have reached a balance between these two functions of land. This seminar will both review the history of Chinese land tenure and provide an account of recent developments in making land a more fungible asset.   February 26: Democratization in the Countryside and Its Impacts   Download this lecture   China has had democratic elections in its villages for more than 20 years. It is a question why an authoritarian state allows for democratic elections in the first place. One possible explanation is that village elections allow the authority to make a credible commitment to ordinary farmers that the state would give up its progressive policies implemented in the commune era. Based on nation-wide surveys, this seminar will provide evidence to show the nature, scope, and impacts of village elections. It will also discuss the prospect of democratization in the country at large.   March 5: Interest Groups, the Disinterested Government, and Economic Growth   Download this lecture   One serious impediment to economic growth in many developing countries is that the government is either captured by a few elites or trapped in divisive interest group politics. One distinctive feature of the Chinese government is that it has been disinterested in interest group politics. This allows it to focus on long-run economic growth of the country. In addition to providing evidence to show that the Chinese government has indeed been disinterested, this seminar will also provide a discussion on the political and social foundations for such a government to emerge in China.   March 12: Demographic Transition, Exports, and China's Growth Perspective   Download this lecture   The Chinese economy is the mirror image of the American economy: While the American economy is driven by innovation, consumption, and services, the Chinese economy is driven by imitation, investment, and manufacturing; while the US runs on huge trade deficits and capital inflows, China runs on huge trade surplus, but also on capital inflows. This seminar argues that the Chinese growth model has a lot to do with its demographics, which means that exports will still serve as a major engine for China's economic growth in the next ten to fifteen years. The mirror symmetry between China and the US may continue. In addition to offering an explanation to China's export-led growth model, this seminar will provide suggestions to break up this symmetry.

Lecture with:     Yang Yao , Professor and Deputy Director of the China Center for Economic Research (CCER) at Peking University     Topic: Elections, Accountability, and Farmers' Welfare in Chinese Villages     Date: November 30, 2007, 12:00 - 2:00 PM   Click here to listen to part one of the lecture (edited)     Click here to listen to part two                  Village elections have been the most significant development to the political life in rural China since the fall of the commune system in the early 1980s. They have empowered villagers to elect their own village officials and monitor their behavior in their tenure. This development has potentially important implications for villagers&rsquo; welfare. Based on several recent studies, this talk provides strong evidence supporting a positive role of village elections to enhance the accountability of the village officials, increase villagers&rsquo; income capabilities, and help them mitigate the negative effects of unexpected natural shocks and smooth their consumption.   This event is co-sponsored by NYU China House, NYU East Asian Studies Department, and the NYU Law School's US-Asia Law Institute.          Lecture with:    Donald Clarke , Visiting NYU Professor from George Washington University    Topic: The Ecology of Chinese Corporate Governance    Date: November 14, 2007, 5:00 - 7:00 PM           The last several years have seen a proliferation of rules about corporate governance in China. But how significant are the rules if enforcement mechanisms, whether state or non-state, are weak or lacking altogether? China&rsquo;s corporate governance regime relies heavily on the announcement of rules by government authorities and tends to overlook the institutions needed for making those rules meaningful. Lawmakers expect that regulated parties will read the legal texts and voluntarily obey; if they do not, their ignorance or moral failings are blamed, not the lack of enforcement institutions. Nor does the corporate governance regime look to non-governmental institutions for the making and enforcement of rules and standards. A major reason for this is simply political: the political system of China does not yet accept the existence of institutions that are both powerful and independent of the state. For all its progress over the quarter century, the post-Mao Chinese legal system remains an institution of only modest importance in the polity.   This event is co-sponsored by NYU China House and the Pollock Center of Law and Business.         Panel Discussion with:    Kurt Behrendt , Assistant Curator of South Asian Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art      Annette L. Juliano , Professor of Asian Art History, Rutgers University-Newark Campus      Chao-Hui Jenny Liu , Assistant Professor and Faculty Fellow of East Asian Art, New York University    Roderick Whitfield , Visiting Professor 2007-8, Department of History of Art, Yale University      Angela Zito , Associate Professor of Anthropology and Religious Studies, New York University   Topic: Buddhist Art in Context   Date: October 17, 2007, 4:00 - 6:00 PM          Three leading scholars working on Buddhist art in its multiple contexts are presenting their recent research at New York University. The speakers are Kurt Behrendt (The Metropolitan Museum of Art), Annette L. Juliano (Rutgers University), and Roderick Whitfield (Yale University). Their papers address recent advances in the study and presentation of Gandharan Art, Indian influences on the beginnings of Chinese Buddhist art, and the interpretation of smaller atypical Buddhist images from the ancient Chinese capital of Chang&rsquo;an (modern Xi&rsquo;an).   The Symposium will also afford a glimpse of the complexities involved in presenting Buddhist art away from its original context to a public, anticipating three separate exhibitions: two in New York City at The Metropolitan Museum of Art (re-installation from August 10, 2007) and The China Institute (September 20-December 8, 2007); and a third at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, in spring 2008. Chao-Hui Jenny Liu will moderate and Angela Zito (NYU Religious Studies/Anthropology) will serve as Discussant.   The Symposium is organized in collaboration with the Department of Art History at NYU. For more information please click here .            Panel Discussion with:    Dr. Lung-Chi Chen , Department of Environmental Medicine   Dr. Qingshan Qu , Department of Environmental Medicine   Dr. Arnold Stern , Associate Director for the Institute of Community Health and Research   Dr. Bernard Yeung , Professor of Global Business &amp; Director of China House   Topic: Environmental Health in China    Date:    April 26, 2007, 4:00 - 6:00 PM          Environmental pollution is of major concern to China as it undergoes rapid development in its transition to a market economy. To combat the consequences of pollution the Chinese government has established the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) whose function is to define national environmental policies and regulations, collect information about the environment and provide technological advice. Pollution of air, water and ground are significant in almost all areas of China. This has stimulated the government to create demonstration programs for combating pollution in several major cities and river valleys. SEPA is reviewing strategies for minimizing pollution and enforcing regulations to control pollution. Our speakers will inform us about the different types of pollution and suggest remedies for minimizing its consequences. Both the medical and the economic issues related to the pollution will be discussed, particularly in relationship to policy.                Speaker: Jerome Cohen, NYU Professor of Law   Topic:    &ldquo;Normalizing&rdquo; Relations with China, 1966-79: Memoirs of an Academic Participant-Observer  Date:   January 25, 2007, 4 - 6 PM    Click here to listen to the lecture (edited)     Jerome Cohen is the leading American expert on East Asian law and a pioneer in the introduction of East Asian legal systems and perspectives into the American legal curricula. A Professor of Law at NYU and Senior Fellow for Asia Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, Prof. Cohen regularly teaches on Chinese law and society and comparative international law, in particular analyzing how countries with a Confucian tradition relate to the international laws and traditions of the &ldquo;Christian West.&rdquo; Mr. Cohen is often consulted by the U.S. government and NGOs and has served as a trustee of the Asia Society, the China Institute, and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and as the director of the National Committee on U.S. &ndash; China Relations.   Prof. Jerome Cohen will be speaking on the atmosphere in the U.S. and China from 1966 to 1979 and, by recalling his own observations and participation, discuss the development of the American approach to China by taking into consideration the domestic and international legal questions that formed an important part of the policy discussions on both sides as well as their relation to domestic politics in the United States. Prof. Cohen will emphasize the broader and human aspects of these developments rather than their technical legal content and also refer to the implications of these events for our contemporary, unresolved issues with China.              Speaker: Pauline Yu, President, American Council of Learned Societies  Topic:   \"The Chinese Century? American Learning and Chinese Lessons\"  Date:   November 30, 2006, 4 - 6 PM    Click here to listen to the lecture (edited)     Pauline Yu, President of the American Council of Learned Societies, is a former Professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures and Dean of Humanities in the College of Letters and Science at UCLA.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

The first part examines competing approaches to international politics, explains their basic concepts and rationales, and evaluates their explanatory insights. The principal objective of this part is for students to develop an appreciation of the ways in which various theoretical perspectives lead to different understandings of the structures and practices of world politics. The second part offers students an advanced understanding of US-China relations, focusing on the post-Cold War period, with a special emphasis on issues of security, human rights and economy. This part is intended to provide the means for students to develop their own theoretically informed analyses of major issues in US-China relations, such us how China\u2019s membership in the WTO affects American economy, including the quality of employment opportunities in the United States.

As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban  development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use fieldbased studies and Geographic Information System  (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core  component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several  NYU sites globally and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.                                Global China Studies                                                    20th Century Chinese Writers in a Global Context - GCHN-SHU 207 - 4 points                               The literary scene in the 20th centuryChinese-speaking world is diverse in sound and script, vast in the scope of subject matters, and challenging for those migrant or exilic minds whose creative energy is driven by their critical insight to the world around them. Working in,outside, and between places like mainlandChina, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, America, and France, Chinese-language writers may have in mind an imagined community of fellow countrymen when they write. Oftentimes, however, they may also ask provocative questions about nationalism, linguistic loyalty, and authenticity as Anglophone, Francophone, or bilingual writers living in the West. From andacross multiple cultural margins, they speak to probe the nature of modernity, cultural contact, and otherness amid the global flows of labor and ideas. How do Lu Xun, Lao She, Ha Jin, Alai, and Gao Xingjian represent China on the world stage and find their place in this picture? Where in their works can we find stylistic and cultural hybridization? How do novels and stories by Zhang Ailing, Bai Xianyong, Maxine Hong Kingston, Gish Jen, and Shirley Lim cement or deconstruct the conventional ground on which we compare Eastern and Western civilizations? What kind of an alternative literary geography, and worldview, do these writers offer?                                                                      Worldwide Chinese Diaspora - GCHN-SHU 251 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the history and complexities of worldwide Chinese migrations and diasporic communities, including change over time and evolving global diasporic relationships and interactions. A signature Global Network University course, it may be coordinated with parallel courses held at other sites in the network, so that student research on the multiple inflections of the Chinese experience of diaspora globally is both collaborative and comparative.                                Humanities                                                    Empires in World History - HUMN-SHU 269 - 4 points                               Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a polity that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture. Any examination of the variety of human cultures must take account of the political structures within which people tried to make their way, sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. Empires\u2013polities which maintained and enhanced social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people\u2013have been one of the most common and durable forms of political association. This course will focus on the comparative study of empires from ancient Rome and China to the present, and upon the variety of ways in which empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. The study of empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is natural and necessary. Students in this course will explore historians' approaches to studying empires. We will investigate how empires were held together\u2013and where they were weak\u2013 from perspectives that focus on political, cultural, and economic connections over long distances and long time periods. Readings will include historical scholarship on the Roman,Chinese, Mongol, Ottoman, Habsburg, Russian, French, British, German, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities.

The forms and uses of new communications technologies, including digital imaging, sound, video, animation, and basic web development, are explored in a laboratory context of hands-on experimentation, readings, and discussion. Principles of interpersonal communications, media theory, and human factors are introduced. Weekly assignments, team and independent projects, and project reports are required.                                                                      Animation and Dynamic Surfaces - INTM-SHU 211 - 4 points                               Contemporary animation is no longer constrained to the single flat screen; it can now be seen on surfaces of any shape and size. This course takes students from traditional animation techniques to contemporary outputs. In the first part of the course students will learn the process of character design as well as script and storyboard development to create two animated shorts. The course then examines outputs afforded by new technologies, such as interactivity, multiple screens and projection mapping. Software includes DragonFrame (for stop motion capture), Adobe After Effects and Premiere (for digital compositing, animating, and sequencing), as well MadMapper (for projection mapping), and Processing (for interactivity). Drawing skills are not necessary for this course, however students will keep a personal sketchbook.                                                                      Developing Web - INTM-SHU 231 - 4 points                               The Web now permeates most aspects of modern existence, and as a result, web development has become an indispensable skill complementary to many diverse disciplines. Students in this course will gain fluency in essential web languages and development approaches through a series of creative yet practical exercises aimed at touching on many important aspects of today\u2019s multi-faceted World Wide Web \u2013 by building responsive websites, engaging games, and rich internet applications for the desktop, mobile devices, and Arduino microcontroller. Design principles will be explored through corresponding HTML and CSS structures, and will be based on a consideration for typography, images, audio and video. Dynamic data and interaction will be investigated through client-side scripting techniques using JavaScript, including the popular jQuery library. User generated content and the importance of content management will be reflected on through server-side scripting techniques utilizing the PHP based WordPress platform. Data storage and retrieval will be made possible through the application of MySQL databases and the HTML5 Local Storage specification. And universal data exchange formats, JSON and XML, will be part of an ongoing experimentation with third party APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) such as Flickr, Freebase, Google Maps, Twitter, Xively &amp; YouTube.

Networks and Dynamics - MATH-SHU 160 - 4 points                               This is a post-calculus mathematics course that is designed to prepare students to enter a broad set of majors, from natural sciences through social sciences. The preliminary goal is to address the following challenge: today\u2019s science and world at large requires us to understand how the dynamical interactions between individual units in a complex network give rise to collective behavior, be it genetic network that makes us who we are, neural network underlying our brain functions, social network of friends through Facebook or WeChat. The language for providing a scientific understanding of such systems is the mathematics of network theory, linear algebra, and differential equations. These topics are integrated to provide a unifying course that introduces analysis methods and mathematical models for understanding dynamical network behavior. Computer simulations will be a major component of this hands-on course. Prerequisite: Grade of C or better in MATH-SHU 121 and MATH-SHU 140. Not open to students who have taken MATH-SHU 264.

It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                                                      Growing Shanghai, Shrinking Detroit - CCSF-SHU 124 - 4 points                               Less than a century ago, the Paris-of-the-East Shanghai and the Paris-of-the-West Detroit belonged to the most modern, booming metropolises in the world, until both cities declined. Today, the global city of Shanghai has revived its old glory days, while Detroit officially filed for bankruptcy in July this year. In this course, we take Shanghai and Detroit as case studies to examine the challenges and consequences of our fast-urbanizing world. We will explore the historical and economic factors influencing the transformation of these cities, as well as look at how its citizens are experiencing these sweeping changes.
