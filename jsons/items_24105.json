This is a selective guide to some of the resources available for researching New York City Subcultures and Scenes. This page will be your gateway to books, journal articles, and web resources.    Here are a few other subject guides that will be of interest to you:           New York City                   Anthropology                   Psychology                   Sociology                    Comments (0)                                         Avery Fisher Center                 The Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media (AFC) is located on the 2 nd floor of Bobst Library. Our collections include over 28,000 videos (with U.S. and foreign cinema, drama and music performances, documentaries, art films, and more) and over 76,000 sound recordings (featuring music from a broad spectrum of classical, traditional, and popular artists and genres, from throughout the world and across history). Our viewing and listening facilities support a variety of analog and digital formats. Here is just a sampling of the films documenting subcultures that are available at the AFC:     Blank generation; Dancing barefoot - Directed by Ivan Kral Call Number: DVD 4187 Blank generation tells the story of punk music in New York City in the mid-70s and documents the moment in musical history when diversity blossomed. Dancing barefoot traces the musical journey of Ivan Kral (the Patti Smith Group).  Style wars - Directed by Tony Silver Call Number: VCA 6270 A documentary exploration of the subculture of New York's young graffiti writers and breakdancers, showing their activities and aspirations and the social and aesthetic controversies surrounding New York graffiti. Dramatizes conflicts between graffitists and the city, as well as among the graffitists themselves.  The ballad of Greenwich Village: culture and counter-culture - Directed by Karen Kramer Call Number: DVD 7093 The artists, rebels, and bohemians who came to New York's Greenwich Village over many decades changed the face of American culture through their art and politics. This film portrays the important political and social movements that began in the Village: the first interracial jazz club, the earliest Socialist newspapers from before World War I, the Stonewall Rebellion. This unique history includes anecdotes from many famous writers, musicians and performers who got their start in the Village. Interweaves past and present, with 16mm footage, archival photographs, Hollywood movies, cartoons, informative interviews and scenes of contemporary village life. Accompanied by a lively soundtrack that ranges from ragtime to bebop to folk music, the film celebrates what was America's first bohemia.  Deadheads: an American subculture - Directed by Emily Edwards Call Number: VCA 6828 This program examines the Deadhead subculture, individuals who follow the Grateful Dead from concert to concert: what kinds of people are attracted to this culture, and what attracts them to it, what social forms do Deadheads resist, what forms shape their behavior, what separates them from the mainstream? The program also examies the workings of a subculture from within.            Comments (0)                                         So, What is a Subculture Anyway?                   Skateboarders. Goths. Club kids. Punks. Steampunks. Beats. Breakdancers. Hip Hop Heads. Deadheads. Phishheads. Slam poets. Jedis in Washington Square Park...just to name a few!   Subcultures are everywhere--some are more visible than others. But what is a subcutlure? What are we talking about? Here's the Oxford English Dictionary definition:   Subculture: an identifiable subgroup within a society or group of people, especially one characterized by beliefs or interests at variance with those of the larger group; the distinctive ideas, practices, or way of life of such a subgroup.

Try the Fales Library &amp; Special Collections here at Bobst! For example:    The Riot Grrrl Collection is an attempt to document the evolution of the Riot Grrrl movement, particularly in the years between 1989 and 1996. Because Riot Grrrl was (and is) both a political and a cultural movement, its output was diverse, including writing, music, performance, film, activism, photography, video, and original art, as well as documentation of activism and performance. This research collection will provide primary resources for scholars who are interested in feminism, punk activism, queer theory, gender theory, DIY culture, and music history.                          The Downtown Collection , which began in 1993, is an attempt to document the downtown arts scene that evolved in SoHo and the Lower East Side during the 1970s through the early 1990s. During this time, an explosion of artistic creativity radically challenged and changed tradition literature, music, theater, performance, film, activism, dance, photography, video, and other art practices.   The Downtown Collection includes the personal papers of artists, filmmakers, writers and performers; archives of art galleries, theatre groups, and art collectives; and collections relating to AIDS activism and off-off- Broadway theater.

Why Reference?   Reference materials are excellent resources for providing an overview of the subject you are researching.  They will provide well-known facts on literary authors and their works; historical and political events that may have impacted their work; the society and culture in which they lived and worked and/or may have based their work upon; as well as the impact of their work on future generations. They are trustworthy and reliable, giving you the correct information you will need for your research papers and presentations.   Reference books, either in print or electronic format, will also provide you with keywords and terms to use in your searches through Bobcat or the library databases. If you are searching for a research topic, using the overview on a subject that a reference source provides can spark the idea for a researchable thesis question.

Maurer Call Number: HV6085 .M38 Non-circulating ISBN: 0813114055   Contemporary youth culture an international encyclopedia - Priya Parmar and Shirley R. Steinberg, Call Number: Electronic resource Youth as a unique group is a 20th century idea. The changes wrought worldwide by World War II, propelled adolescence to a status and identity that coincided with unparalleled economic growth. While developmental psychologists refined their theories of normal growth and maturation, society and the media were at work constructing youth as consumers,thereby liberating them from traditional family controls. An increasingly smaller world impinges mightily on the culture of youth. An international and inter-disciplinary roster of experts shed light by exploring such topics as hip hop culture; punk culture; social justice movements; video games; political activism; language and identity; post-feminism; television; rites of passage; heterosexuality and homosexuality; race and ethnicity; social class; poetry and literature; visual art; conceptions of beauty and body image; academics; sports; drugs; families; refugee youth; the Internet; youth journalism; fashion; and violence.

Subculture - Dick Hebdige This book is an attempt to subject the various youth-protest movements of Britain in the last 15 years to the sort of Marxist, structuralist, semiotic analytical techniques propagated by, above all, Roland Barthes. The book is recommended whole-heartedly to anyone who would like fresh ideas about some of the most stimulating music of the rock era - The New York Times   The Subcultures Reader - Ken Gelder (Editor); Sarah Thornton (Editor) Introducing new, contemporary essays and critique to sit alongside classic and canonical texts on subculture, The Subcultures Reader is the only collected work of its kind in the field, bringing together the most valuable and stimulating writings from the Chicago School to the present day.   Police culture: adapting to the strains of the job - Eugene Paoline Call Number: HV8138 .P367 2014 A highly identifiable topic of discussion among scholars and practitioners alike is police culture. Unfortunately, a large degree of vagueness and confusion also comes with this concept, as a variety of definitions, perspectives, and levels of aggregation are used to describe the ways in which officers cope with the problems and conditions faced out on the street and inside the police department.   Where the music takes you: the social psychology of music subcultures - Pamela M. Hunt Today's students access a variety of media to keep abreast of new and up-and-coming musical artists. Where the Music Takes You: The Social Psychology of Music Subcultures turns this interest into a successful vehicle for educating readers about some of the most fundamental sociological and methodological concepts, including rituals, symbols, ethnography, participant observation, and symbolic interactionist theory.   Subcultures: Cultural Histories and Social Practice - Ken Gelder This book presents a cultural history of subcultures, covering a remarkable range of subcultural forms and practices. It begins with London\u2019s \u2018Elizabethan underworld\u2019, taking the rogue and vagabond as subcultural prototypes: the basis for Marx\u2019s later view of subcultures as the lumpenproletariat, and Henry Mayhew\u2019s view of subcultures as \u2018those that will not work\u2019. Subcultures are always in some way non-conforming or dissenting. They are social - with their own shared conventions, values, rituals, and so on \u2013 but they can also seem \u2018immersed\u2019 or self-absorbed.   The psychology of sub-culture in sport and physical activity: critical perspectives - Robert J. Schinke Call Number: Electronic resource The Psychology of Sub-Culture in Sport and Physical Activity will be ideal reading for sport and exercise academics and practitioners, advanced students of applied sport psychology, and related fields such as sport science, critical studies, sociology, cultural studies and social anthropology.   After Subculture - Andy Bennett; Keith Kahn-Harris (Editor) The concept of \"subculture\" has long been of significant importance in research on youth, style, deviance and popular culture. Although in more recent years subculture has been the subject of sustained critique, it still provides a valuable point of reference for study and research. This text offers students an up-to-date and wide-ranging account of new developments in youth culture research that reject, refine or reinvent the concept of subculture. Bringing together key theoretical statements with illuminating analyses of particular aspects of youth culture - popular music, clubbing, body modification, the internet, etc. - this is an ideal introduction to a diverse and wide-ranging field.   Club Cultures: Music, Media and Subcultural Capital - Sarah Thornton Thornton paints a picture of of club cultures as \u201ctaste cultures\u201d brought together by micro-media (such as flyers and listings), transformed into self-conscious \u201csubcultures\u201d by niche media (like the music and style press), and sometimes recast as \u201cmovements\u201d with the aid of mass media (like tabloid front pages). She also analyses the changing status of the medium of recording, from a marginal, second-class entertainment in the 1950s to the much celebrated, dominant form of clubs and raves in the 1990s. Drawing from the work of Pierre Bourdieu, Thornton coins the term \u201csubcultural capital\u201d to make sense to the distinctions made by \u201ccool\u201d youth, paying particular attention to their disparagement of the \u201cmainstream\u201d against which they measure their alternative cultural worth.   The Post-Subcultures Reader - David Muggleton (Editor); Rupert Weinzierl (Editor) Once it was just Mods and Rockers or Hippies and Skinheads. Now we have Riot Grrls and Rappers; Modern Primitives and Metalheads; Goths, Clubcultures and Fetishists; Urban Tribes, New Age Travellers and Internet fan groups. In a global society with a rapid proliferation of images, fashions and lifestyles, it is -unsurprisingly - becoming increasingly difficult to pinpoint what 'subculture' actually means. Enthusiastically adopted by the media and academia, 'subculture' may be a convenient way to describe more unconventional aspects of youth culture, but it does little to help us comprehend the diverse range of youth groups in today's so-called 'postmodern' world. How can we begin to rethink, reformulate and replace outdated notions of 'subcultures' to make them applicable to the experiences of youth in the twenty-first century? And to what extent does this involve the challenging of past orthodoxies about spectacular subcultural styles?

This usage works on most databases, but check 'Help' sections for supported search syntax. Capitalize AND, OR, NOT so the database knows this is a command.   Boolean: (using operators: AND, OR, NOT)    graffiti AND new york city searches for occurrences of both words within scope defined.   graffiti OR street art searches for one or all, but both are not required.   graffiti NOT banksy searches for occurrences of the words &lsquo;graffiti&rsquo; without use of the word &lsquo;banksy.&rsquo;   ( graffiti NOT banksy ) AND street art searches for occurrences of the words &lsquo;graffiti&rsquo; without use of the word &lsquo;banksy,&rsquo; then also requires the words &lsquo;street art.&rsquo;     Truncation:   art * searches for art, arts, artistic, artful, etc.     Wildcard:   m ? n searches for man and men.                                              Google Scholar                 Google Scholar is a time-saving, scholarly search interface accessible from within the Google interface. With Google Scholar, you can access peer-reviewed journal articles, books and book sections. For literature searching, specialized databases have more functionality and access more comprehensive results, but Google Scholar is a good tool                            Comments (0)                                         Search other catalogs                        Need to find something we don't have here at Bobst?

Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um)  is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author  of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.         Students, in the process of learning, acquire ideas from many sources and exchange ideas and opinions with classmates, professors, and others. This occurs in reading, writing, and discussion. Students are expected&mdash;often required&mdash;to build their own work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do. Giving credit to someone whose work has helped one is courteous and honest; in fact, not to give such credit is a crime. Plagiarism is the severest form of academic fraud. Plagiarism is theft.       More specifically, plagiarism is presenting as your own:                   a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks;    a paraphrased passage from another writer's work;    facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet;    another student's work with your name on it;    a purchased paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill.       Other forms of academic fraud include:       \"collaborating\" between two or more students who then submit the same paper under their individual names.    submitting the same paper for two or more courses without the knowledge and the expressed permission of all teachers involved.    giving permission to another student to use your work for a class.       Proper acknowledgement marks the difference. It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.

This is a selective guide to some of the resources available for researching New York City Subcultures and Scenes. This page will be your gateway to books, journal articles, and web resources.    Here are a few other subject guides that will be of interest to you:           New York City                   Anthropology                   Psychology                   Sociology                    Comments (0)                                         Avery Fisher Center                 The Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media (AFC) is located on the 2 nd floor of Bobst Library. Our collections include over 28,000 videos (with U.S. and foreign cinema, drama and music performances, documentaries, art films, and more) and over 76,000 sound recordings (featuring music from a broad spectrum of classical, traditional, and popular artists and genres, from throughout the world and across history). Our viewing and listening facilities support a variety of analog and digital formats. Here is just a sampling of the films documenting subcultures that are available at the AFC:     Blank generation; Dancing barefoot - Directed by Ivan Kral Call Number: DVD 4187 Blank generation tells the story of punk music in New York City in the mid-70s and documents the moment in musical history when diversity blossomed. Dancing barefoot traces the musical journey of Ivan Kral (the Patti Smith Group).  Style wars - Directed by Tony Silver Call Number: VCA 6270 A documentary exploration of the subculture of New York's young graffiti writers and breakdancers, showing their activities and aspirations and the social and aesthetic controversies surrounding New York graffiti. Dramatizes conflicts between graffitists and the city, as well as among the graffitists themselves.  The ballad of Greenwich Village: culture and counter-culture - Directed by Karen Kramer Call Number: DVD 7093 The artists, rebels, and bohemians who came to New York's Greenwich Village over many decades changed the face of American culture through their art and politics. This film portrays the important political and social movements that began in the Village: the first interracial jazz club, the earliest Socialist newspapers from before World War I, the Stonewall Rebellion. This unique history includes anecdotes from many famous writers, musicians and performers who got their start in the Village. Interweaves past and present, with 16mm footage, archival photographs, Hollywood movies, cartoons, informative interviews and scenes of contemporary village life. Accompanied by a lively soundtrack that ranges from ragtime to bebop to folk music, the film celebrates what was America's first bohemia.  Deadheads: an American subculture - Directed by Emily Edwards Call Number: VCA 6828 This program examines the Deadhead subculture, individuals who follow the Grateful Dead from concert to concert: what kinds of people are attracted to this culture, and what attracts them to it, what social forms do Deadheads resist, what forms shape their behavior, what separates them from the mainstream? The program also examies the workings of a subculture from within.            Comments (0)                                         So, What is a Subculture Anyway?                   Skateboarders. Goths. Club kids. Punks. Steampunks. Beats. Breakdancers. Hip Hop Heads. Deadheads. Phishheads. Slam poets. Jedis in Washington Square Park...just to name a few!   Subcultures are everywhere--some are more visible than others. But what is a subcutlure? What are we talking about? Here's the Oxford English Dictionary definition:   Subculture: an identifiable subgroup within a society or group of people, especially one characterized by beliefs or interests at variance with those of the larger group; the distinctive ideas, practices, or way of life of such a subgroup.

Try the Fales Library &amp; Special Collections here at Bobst! For example:    The Riot Grrrl Collection is an attempt to document the evolution of the Riot Grrrl movement, particularly in the years between 1989 and 1996. Because Riot Grrrl was (and is) both a political and a cultural movement, its output was diverse, including writing, music, performance, film, activism, photography, video, and original art, as well as documentation of activism and performance. This research collection will provide primary resources for scholars who are interested in feminism, punk activism, queer theory, gender theory, DIY culture, and music history.                          The Downtown Collection , which began in 1993, is an attempt to document the downtown arts scene that evolved in SoHo and the Lower East Side during the 1970s through the early 1990s. During this time, an explosion of artistic creativity radically challenged and changed tradition literature, music, theater, performance, film, activism, dance, photography, video, and other art practices.   The Downtown Collection includes the personal papers of artists, filmmakers, writers and performers; archives of art galleries, theatre groups, and art collectives; and collections relating to AIDS activism and off-off- Broadway theater.

Why Reference?   Reference materials are excellent resources for providing an overview of the subject you are researching.  They will provide well-known facts on literary authors and their works; historical and political events that may have impacted their work; the society and culture in which they lived and worked and/or may have based their work upon; as well as the impact of their work on future generations. They are trustworthy and reliable, giving you the correct information you will need for your research papers and presentations.   Reference books, either in print or electronic format, will also provide you with keywords and terms to use in your searches through Bobcat or the library databases. If you are searching for a research topic, using the overview on a subject that a reference source provides can spark the idea for a researchable thesis question.

Maurer Call Number: HV6085 .M38 Non-circulating ISBN: 0813114055   Contemporary youth culture an international encyclopedia - Priya Parmar and Shirley R. Steinberg, Call Number: Electronic resource Youth as a unique group is a 20th century idea. The changes wrought worldwide by World War II, propelled adolescence to a status and identity that coincided with unparalleled economic growth. While developmental psychologists refined their theories of normal growth and maturation, society and the media were at work constructing youth as consumers,thereby liberating them from traditional family controls. An increasingly smaller world impinges mightily on the culture of youth. An international and inter-disciplinary roster of experts shed light by exploring such topics as hip hop culture; punk culture; social justice movements; video games; political activism; language and identity; post-feminism; television; rites of passage; heterosexuality and homosexuality; race and ethnicity; social class; poetry and literature; visual art; conceptions of beauty and body image; academics; sports; drugs; families; refugee youth; the Internet; youth journalism; fashion; and violence.

Click the link for call numbers and more information.     Subculture - Dick Hebdige This book is an attempt to subject the various youth-protest movements of Britain in the last 15 years to the sort of Marxist, structuralist, semiotic analytical techniques propagated by, above all, Roland Barthes. The book is recommended whole-heartedly to anyone who would like fresh ideas about some of the most stimulating music of the rock era - The New York Times   The Subcultures Reader - Ken Gelder (Editor); Sarah Thornton (Editor) Introducing new, contemporary essays and critique to sit alongside classic and canonical texts on subculture, The Subcultures Reader is the only collected work of its kind in the field, bringing together the most valuable and stimulating writings from the Chicago School to the present day.   Police culture: adapting to the strains of the job - Eugene Paoline Call Number: HV8138 .P367 2014 A highly identifiable topic of discussion among scholars and practitioners alike is police culture. Unfortunately, a large degree of vagueness and confusion also comes with this concept, as a variety of definitions, perspectives, and levels of aggregation are used to describe the ways in which officers cope with the problems and conditions faced out on the street and inside the police department.   Where the music takes you: the social psychology of music subcultures - Pamela M. Hunt Today's students access a variety of media to keep abreast of new and up-and-coming musical artists. Where the Music Takes You: The Social Psychology of Music Subcultures turns this interest into a successful vehicle for educating readers about some of the most fundamental sociological and methodological concepts, including rituals, symbols, ethnography, participant observation, and symbolic interactionist theory.   Subcultures: Cultural Histories and Social Practice - Ken Gelder This book presents a cultural history of subcultures, covering a remarkable range of subcultural forms and practices. It begins with London\u2019s \u2018Elizabethan underworld\u2019, taking the rogue and vagabond as subcultural prototypes: the basis for Marx\u2019s later view of subcultures as the lumpenproletariat, and Henry Mayhew\u2019s view of subcultures as \u2018those that will not work\u2019. Subcultures are always in some way non-conforming or dissenting. They are social - with their own shared conventions, values, rituals, and so on \u2013 but they can also seem \u2018immersed\u2019 or self-absorbed.   The psychology of sub-culture in sport and physical activity: critical perspectives - Robert J. Schinke Call Number: Electronic resource The Psychology of Sub-Culture in Sport and Physical Activity will be ideal reading for sport and exercise academics and practitioners, advanced students of applied sport psychology, and related fields such as sport science, critical studies, sociology, cultural studies and social anthropology.   After Subculture - Andy Bennett; Keith Kahn-Harris (Editor) The concept of \"subculture\" has long been of significant importance in research on youth, style, deviance and popular culture. Although in more recent years subculture has been the subject of sustained critique, it still provides a valuable point of reference for study and research. This text offers students an up-to-date and wide-ranging account of new developments in youth culture research that reject, refine or reinvent the concept of subculture. Bringing together key theoretical statements with illuminating analyses of particular aspects of youth culture - popular music, clubbing, body modification, the internet, etc. - this is an ideal introduction to a diverse and wide-ranging field.   Club Cultures: Music, Media and Subcultural Capital - Sarah Thornton Thornton paints a picture of of club cultures as \u201ctaste cultures\u201d brought together by micro-media (such as flyers and listings), transformed into self-conscious \u201csubcultures\u201d by niche media (like the music and style press), and sometimes recast as \u201cmovements\u201d with the aid of mass media (like tabloid front pages). She also analyses the changing status of the medium of recording, from a marginal, second-class entertainment in the 1950s to the much celebrated, dominant form of clubs and raves in the 1990s. Drawing from the work of Pierre Bourdieu, Thornton coins the term \u201csubcultural capital\u201d to make sense to the distinctions made by \u201ccool\u201d youth, paying particular attention to their disparagement of the \u201cmainstream\u201d against which they measure their alternative cultural worth.   The Post-Subcultures Reader - David Muggleton (Editor); Rupert Weinzierl (Editor) Once it was just Mods and Rockers or Hippies and Skinheads. Now we have Riot Grrls and Rappers; Modern Primitives and Metalheads; Goths, Clubcultures and Fetishists; Urban Tribes, New Age Travellers and Internet fan groups. In a global society with a rapid proliferation of images, fashions and lifestyles, it is -unsurprisingly - becoming increasingly difficult to pinpoint what 'subculture' actually means. Enthusiastically adopted by the media and academia, 'subculture' may be a convenient way to describe more unconventional aspects of youth culture, but it does little to help us comprehend the diverse range of youth groups in today's so-called 'postmodern' world. How can we begin to rethink, reformulate and replace outdated notions of 'subcultures' to make them applicable to the experiences of youth in the twenty-first century? And to what extent does this involve the challenging of past orthodoxies about spectacular subcultural styles?

Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um)  is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author  of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.         Students, in the process of learning, acquire ideas from many sources and exchange ideas and opinions with classmates, professors, and others. This occurs in reading, writing, and discussion. Students are expected&mdash;often required&mdash;to build their own work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do. Giving credit to someone whose work has helped one is courteous and honest; in fact, not to give such credit is a crime. Plagiarism is the severest form of academic fraud. Plagiarism is theft.       More specifically, plagiarism is presenting as your own:                   a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks;    a paraphrased passage from another writer's work;    facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet;    another student's work with your name on it;    a purchased paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill.       Other forms of academic fraud include:       \"collaborating\" between two or more students who then submit the same paper under their individual names.    submitting the same paper for two or more courses without the knowledge and the expressed permission of all teachers involved.    giving permission to another student to use your work for a class.       Proper acknowledgement marks the difference. It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.
