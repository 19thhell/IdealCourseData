Below are examples and contact information for questions.   Special Note: To produce the most effective communications and have the greatest impact, it's recommended that a department hire a professional graphic designer to create its materials.        Layouts   In general, the following recommendations should be considered when designing print and online communications. The design of NYU communications reflect on the reputation of the University.     Simple Layouts  Complex layouts are harder to read, scan, and analyze. Layouts that are clutter free are more professional and allow the reader to understand quickly the key benefits and call to action of the communications   Information Hierarchy  Using composition, scale, typography, and images, you can design layouts that help the reader navigate the page from most important to least important information.   Use of White Space  Too often we cover every inch of a page with text. This results in publications that are intimidating and difficult to read. White space is essential to readability. It makes the various elements stand out.   NYU Visual Identity  The use of the NYU logo and the color violet speak volumes about your communication. It gives visual clues to the reader as to whom the communication is coming from, how important it is, and how much attention they should give it. Please have a look at the Logo Basics Guide for recommended usage.              Images   Our digital archive of photographic images includes high-resolution versions for print and low-resolution versions for websites. The library is currently online at picturebank.nyu.edu . For questions concerning photos, please contact Jane Burke at the Photo Bureau.                                   Typography   Gotham is the only font used in the logo and all secondary-level logotypes. It can be used in conjunction with other fonts but should be the primary font for units within the central administration of NYU. As a machine font default, Arial is recommended for letters and HTML docs.        The Gotham type font family can be purchased directly from the type foundry, Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones, online at typography.com . At this time the University does not have an institutional license.                                 The following attributes contributed to the selection of Gotham as NYU's primary font:     In and of the City: Vernacular sans serif designed in Greenwich Village     Influence: Architectural and commercial signage in New York City     Modern: Strikes a contemporary and forthright tone     Clear and Optimistic: Suggests the energy and exuberance of NYU and NYC     Versatile: Offers a range of weights and styles for a variety of messages                Editorial Style   For information on capitalization, punctuation, and abbreviation, please see The Chicago Manual of Style , the University's standard reference. For spelling, word division, and helpful usage notes, refer to Merriam-Webster's Online .   In addition, we are glad to answer your specific questions at urpa.stylguide@nyu.edu .                                                                           Why should I hire a professional graphic designer?                               Professional graphic designer's can, in the long run, save time and money by using their education and special training to produce communications that are effective and that have real impact. They can also help set up templates that clients can use to produce ongoing communications without having rehire the designer do it.                                                                Why was Gotham chosen for the NYU font?                                   Influenced by architectural and commercial signage in New York City, this type style strikes a modern and forthright tone in keeping with a prominent aspect of the NYU mission, that of being \u201cin and of the city.\u201d A range of weights and styles is available in the Gotham family, lending it versatility and adaptability to a variety of messaging needs.                                                              Why do I need to purchase the Gotham font? Isn'\u0092t there an institutional license?                               The University was unable to negotiate an institutional license from the type foundry. Because of NYU\u2019s size, it was difficult to calculate the scope of use necessary to include in the license. You can purchase an individual or group license of Gotham by going to typography.com .                                                                Can I substitute another font for Gotham?                               You can not substitute Gotham in the NYU logo or any of its secondary-level logotypes. For MS Word documents and MS Powerpoint presentations you can substitute Arial, the computer default font available on your PC or Mac.                                                              What do I need to know about using stock images?                               Stock images break down into two main types, royalty-free and rights-managed. For royalty-free images, you are allowed nearly unlimited use after the license fee is paid. With rights-managed images, your right to use the image is typically restricted, with limitations placed on things such as duration of use, geographic region, and industry as established by your license agreement.
