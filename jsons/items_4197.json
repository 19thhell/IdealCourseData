Our adventures in New      York City and beyond help enrich us as martial artists and students, and deepen      the bonds of our community. Social events, training retreats, tournaments, and informal      meet ups allow instructors, alumni, senior students, and complete novices to get      to know each other and friendships that will last long after college. Here are a      few perennial favorites:                  Midnight Meander Through Central Park                                     The iconic sights of New York's Central Park are famous around the world, but how      many have seen those same vistas after night falls? Students new to the city always      find the experience especially striking, but even lifelong New Yorkers will see      a side of park they never knew.                          Film and Food                     The club holds social gatherings attended by members, instructors, and alumni several       times each semester in Kimmel. We show martial arts themed movies and always have       plenty of food. Details of upcoming parties can be found on the OrgSync page.                         Summer Training Trip                                     Each summer 20 members of the martial arts club travel to an inn amid the Catskills      Mountains of upstate New York to spend four days living and training together away      from the day to day distractions of regular life.                          Scavenger Hunt                     Running around solving puzzles and getting to know the nooks and crannies of locations       like West Village, Times Square, Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, the Metropolitan Museum,       and many other places besides is great fun, especially if you're feeling competitive.       The club always makes time for a scavenger hunt or two each year.                         Ozawa Tournament                                     Dedicated to karate pioneer Ozawa Osamu, the Ozawa Cup International Karate Tournament      is the largest independent tournament in the world open to all styles of traditional      karate.
