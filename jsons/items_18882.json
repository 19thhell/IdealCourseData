A Surgical Technologist is an integral member of the surgical team who works closely with the surgeon, anesthesiologist and registered nurse, delivering direct patient care before, during and after surgery.   The certified technologist may seek employment in the operating room, as a private scrub for a surgeon,  in the delivery room, central service, cardiac catheterization and surgi-centers.   The Program   It is a one year program, divided into two six-month semesters, with classes starting in September and March.   During the first semester, classes are held M-F from 5:30pm-9:30pm with (2) Saturdays a month from 9am - 5pm.   The second semester each student is in the clinical area 4 days a week from 7am-3pm and in the classroom one day a week. Scheduled hours for the classroom time may vary. The first semester is devoted to classroom study in aseptic technique fundamentals of operating room technology.   The latter portion of this semester is spent introducing the student to common basic surgical procedures.   The second semester is spent in the operating room to develop practical expertise and students are evaluated on their performance.

A Surgical Technologist is an integral member of the surgical team who works closely with the surgeon, anesthesiologist and registered nurse, delivering direct patient care before, during and after surgery.   The certified technologist may seek employment in the operating room, as a private scrub for a surgeon,  in the delivery room, central service, cardiac catheterization and surgi-centers.   The Program   It is a one year program, divided into two six-month semesters, with classes starting in September and March.   During the first semester, classes are held M-F from 5:30pm-9:30pm with (2) Saturdays a month from 9am - 5pm.   The second semester each student is in the clinical area 4 days a week from 7am-3pm and in the classroom one day a week. Scheduled hours for the classroom time may vary. The first semester is devoted to classroom study in aseptic technique fundamentals of operating room technology.   The latter portion of this semester is spent introducing the student to common basic surgical procedures.   The second semester is spent in the operating room to develop practical expertise and students are evaluated on their performance.
