He is the immediate past president of the New York State Bar Association (NYSBA), the largest voluntary state bar association in the country. During his one-year term as President, Mr. Standard focused on maintaining and improving access to justice for all, maintaining the independence and accountability of lawyers and judges-including speaking out for the need to maintain the separation and independence of our three branches of government-increasing pro bono awareness, adding to the diversity of the profession, examining the challenges of leading a balanced life in the law, preservation of and respect for the rule of the law and our constitutional rights and the efficacy of the bar exam in measuring lawyer competency.   Prior to joining EBG, Mr. Standard was special counsel at Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius in New York City, and before that he served as assistant general counsel, Labor Relations, Environmental and Benefit Plans, at Consolidated Edison Company of New York City.

Standard also is a popular public speaker, both nationally and internationally.       Interview with Alumnus/Alumna of the Month   Kenneth G. Standard LLM \u201971   What is your area of specialization and how did you come to work in this area?  I work at Epstein Becker &amp; Green (EBG), which is a national general practice firm of about 375 lawyers in 11 offices spanning the US. I am EBG's general counsel, a position I previously filled in both the corporate and government sectors prior to1989 when I began to concentrate in labor and employment counseling and litigation. My other principal roles at EBG are to lead its national diversity effort and assist in our client and practice development efforts. At present, I spend limited time working with EBG clients on labor and employment matters.   You have worked in-house, at a firm, and in the public sector. What kind of learning curve can an attorney expect when moving from one sector of the industry to another?  A very steep one, which is challenging, sometimes stressful, and always stimulating!   How has the labor and employment field changed over the past 10 years?  The substantive law continues to evolve through statute and through judicial interpretation. As in other areas of the law, trials are increasingly rare.   What are some of the benefits of diversity in law firms?  In my experience, the benefits are the same as in all other human endeavors: diversity of background is accompanied by diversity of experience and thinking, which leads to broader and more varied analysis and better problem resolution.   How did the LLM program at NYU School of Law prepare you for the career you have had?  When I enrolled in the NYU School of Law LLM program, I was transitioning from a pure litigation background to a position as a counselor at Bristol-Myers, a pharmaceutical that researched, developed, manufactured and marketed products for hospitals and other institutions, physicians, and individual consumers. All phases of developing and bringing the products to market were regulated by various federal, state and local agencies. My Law School courses in food, drug and cosmetic law, anti-trust law, the Robinson-Patman Act, government contracting, and unfair competition, among others, helped me make the transition from litigator to counselor in a company operating in heavily-regulated industries of which I had little previous knowledge. In fact, at Bristol-Myers I advanced within 3 years from Staff Attorney to Division Counsel and then to Division Counsel and Vice-President.   Can you tell us about the importance of maintaining the separation of the three branches of government and why you are so passionate about this?  Too often we forget the importance of the basic principles on which our nation was founded, and it leads to trouble. A recent example is the Terri Schiavo case that was so prominent scant months ago. The personalized attacks on judges performing their duties and the threats and attempts to punish the judiciary by reducing their funding and limiting their jurisdiction and discretion struck me as demagogic and short-sighted and required that I, and others with public voices, speak up in defense of our judiciary. Periodically, passions seem to overcome good judgment and many among us resort to the pursuit of simplistic solutions to complex problems that, if followed, would have tragic consequences. Those of us who believe in the separation of powers principle must vigilantly defend it, and encourage others to join us, for this is a recurring issue.   What is the most rewarding aspect of your job?  The ability to practice law in a collegial atmosphere with a firm that is open to new ideas and has a strong commitment to maintaining and increasing its unusually high level of diversity.   Who are your role models in the legal profession?  My late sister, Muriel, who was almost 16 years my senior, spent most of her adult life working for the national office of the NAACP and from my early school years I regularly heard about and/or met NAACP lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston. I was always led to believe that I could follow in their footsteps. My legal career has taken a different route from theirs and my professional opportunities, while limited, have nonetheless been greater than theirs, thanks in great part to their efforts. In my own way, however, I have, through my hiring practices and my mentoring and volunteer life, worked towards making our profession and society a more open and just one, focused on individual merit rather than heritage or preconception.   How do you find the time to participate in so many civic and professional volunteer activities while managing a very busy work load at your firm?  It's at great sacrifice to my personal life. I believe, however, that if one is given the ability to improve the lives of others, along with that goes an obligation to use that ability. Fortunately, my wife and I married in the interim between my graduation from Harvard College and my entering Harvard Law School and she is very understanding and supportive. In addition, our three children are adults now and need less of my time. I will say that my heaviest public service did not occur until our youngest child became an adolescent. Thus, I did have time to participate in our children's school and scouting activities, to coach their baseball and basketball teams, and to participate in a variety of their other events. In addition, I usually made it home for dinner and was able to help with school work one or two nights a week. I also was able to spend several weeks over the course of the year on family vacations, as well as occasionally taking the whole family with me on business trips.   If you could choose another profession to be in, what would it be?  I find it difficult to imagine myself in another profession. However, I have discovered that I am an effective communicator and leader and enjoy being with young people, so I might have enjoyed being a teacher. In fact, I had been a regular volunteer lecturer at many historic black colleges and universities before I became so heavily involved in leadership positions at the Harvard Club of New York City, and the New York City, New York State, and American Bar Associations.   What advice would you give to current students?  Be sure practicing law is what you want to do. Law is a demanding profession and requires great commitment. That commitment, I believe, should include going beyond giving clients good and loyal service and encompass seeking to preserve and strengthen the rule of law and seeking to improve our society in general. If you have that commitment you can make a great difference in many lives and earn terrific psychic rewards as well as enjoy financial security.

Standard .   Kenneth G. Standard LLM \u201971 is a member of Epstein Becker &amp; Green (EBG) in the labor and employment practice. In addition to his duties as a member of the firm, Standard serves as general counsel and heads EBG's national diversity committee that includes members from each of its 11 offices nationwide. He is the immediate past president of the New York State Bar Association (NYSBA), the largest voluntary state bar association in the country. During his one-year term as President, Mr. Standard focused on maintaining and improving access to justice for all, maintaining the independence and accountability of lawyers and judges-including speaking out for the need to maintain the separation and independence of our three branches of government-increasing pro bono awareness, adding to the diversity of the profession, examining the challenges of leading a balanced life in the law, preservation of and respect for the rule of the law and our constitutional rights and the efficacy of the bar exam in measuring lawyer competency.   Prior to joining EBG, Mr. Standard was special counsel at Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius in New York City, and before that he served as assistant general counsel, Labor Relations, Environmental and Benefit Plans, at Consolidated Edison Company of New York City. Standard is also a former director of the Office of Legal Services of the New York City school system, and was vice-president and senior counsel of the products division of the Bristol-Myers Company. In addition to his extensive counseling experience, Standard has handled as lead or sole counsel more than 40 matters to decision in federal, state, and local trial and appellate courts and administrative agencies.   Standard serves as a director of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York City and as a member of its Board's executive, finance and audit, and governance committees. He has served on numerous other committees during his time as a board member and currently is the chairman of the board of the VNSNY Family Care Services sub.

Along with his duties as chair of the House of Delegates during his year as president-elect, Standard co-chaired the President's Committee on Access to Justice, formed to help improve access to the courts for all members of our society. As a member of the New York City Bar Association, Standard has served as chair or member of various committees, and he is a former voting member of Empire Blue Cross-Blue Shield.

Standard also is a popular public speaker, both nationally and internationally.       Interview with Alumnus/Alumna of the Month   Kenneth G. Standard LLM \u201971   What is your area of specialization and how did you come to work in this area?  I work at Epstein Becker &amp; Green (EBG), which is a national general practice firm of about 375 lawyers in 11 offices spanning the US. I am EBG's general counsel, a position I previously filled in both the corporate and government sectors prior to1989 when I began to concentrate in labor and employment counseling and litigation. My other principal roles at EBG are to lead its national diversity effort and assist in our client and practice development efforts. At present, I spend limited time working with EBG clients on labor and employment matters.   You have worked in-house, at a firm, and in the public sector. What kind of learning curve can an attorney expect when moving from one sector of the industry to another?  A very steep one, which is challenging, sometimes stressful, and always stimulating!   How has the labor and employment field changed over the past 10 years?  The substantive law continues to evolve through statute and through judicial interpretation. As in other areas of the law, trials are increasingly rare.   What are some of the benefits of diversity in law firms?  In my experience, the benefits are the same as in all other human endeavors: diversity of background is accompanied by diversity of experience and thinking, which leads to broader and more varied analysis and better problem resolution.   How did the LLM program at NYU School of Law prepare you for the career you have had?  When I enrolled in the NYU School of Law LLM program, I was transitioning from a pure litigation background to a position as a counselor at Bristol-Myers, a pharmaceutical that researched, developed, manufactured and marketed products for hospitals and other institutions, physicians, and individual consumers. All phases of developing and bringing the products to market were regulated by various federal, state and local agencies. My Law School courses in food, drug and cosmetic law, anti-trust law, the Robinson-Patman Act, government contracting, and unfair competition, among others, helped me make the transition from litigator to counselor in a company operating in heavily-regulated industries of which I had little previous knowledge. In fact, at Bristol-Myers I advanced within 3 years from Staff Attorney to Division Counsel and then to Division Counsel and Vice-President.   Can you tell us about the importance of maintaining the separation of the three branches of government and why you are so passionate about this?  Too often we forget the importance of the basic principles on which our nation was founded, and it leads to trouble. A recent example is the Terri Schiavo case that was so prominent scant months ago. The personalized attacks on judges performing their duties and the threats and attempts to punish the judiciary by reducing their funding and limiting their jurisdiction and discretion struck me as demagogic and short-sighted and required that I, and others with public voices, speak up in defense of our judiciary. Periodically, passions seem to overcome good judgment and many among us resort to the pursuit of simplistic solutions to complex problems that, if followed, would have tragic consequences. Those of us who believe in the separation of powers principle must vigilantly defend it, and encourage others to join us, for this is a recurring issue.   What is the most rewarding aspect of your job?  The ability to practice law in a collegial atmosphere with a firm that is open to new ideas and has a strong commitment to maintaining and increasing its unusually high level of diversity.   Who are your role models in the legal profession?  My late sister, Muriel, who was almost 16 years my senior, spent most of her adult life working for the national office of the NAACP and from my early school years I regularly heard about and/or met NAACP lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston. I was always led to believe that I could follow in their footsteps. My legal career has taken a different route from theirs and my professional opportunities, while limited, have nonetheless been greater than theirs, thanks in great part to their efforts. In my own way, however, I have, through my hiring practices and my mentoring and volunteer life, worked towards making our profession and society a more open and just one, focused on individual merit rather than heritage or preconception.   How do you find the time to participate in so many civic and professional volunteer activities while managing a very busy work load at your firm?  It's at great sacrifice to my personal life. I believe, however, that if one is given the ability to improve the lives of others, along with that goes an obligation to use that ability. Fortunately, my wife and I married in the interim between my graduation from Harvard College and my entering Harvard Law School and she is very understanding and supportive. In addition, our three children are adults now and need less of my time. I will say that my heaviest public service did not occur until our youngest child became an adolescent. Thus, I did have time to participate in our children's school and scouting activities, to coach their baseball and basketball teams, and to participate in a variety of their other events. In addition, I usually made it home for dinner and was able to help with school work one or two nights a week. I also was able to spend several weeks over the course of the year on family vacations, as well as occasionally taking the whole family with me on business trips.   If you could choose another profession to be in, what would it be?  I find it difficult to imagine myself in another profession. However, I have discovered that I am an effective communicator and leader and enjoy being with young people, so I might have enjoyed being a teacher. In fact, I had been a regular volunteer lecturer at many historic black colleges and universities before I became so heavily involved in leadership positions at the Harvard Club of New York City, and the New York City, New York State, and American Bar Associations.   What advice would you give to current students?  Be sure practicing law is what you want to do. Law is a demanding profession and requires great commitment. That commitment, I believe, should include going beyond giving clients good and loyal service and encompass seeking to preserve and strengthen the rule of law and seeking to improve our society in general. If you have that commitment you can make a great difference in many lives and earn terrific psychic rewards as well as enjoy financial security.

Additional information  may be obtained from departmental advisers and from the College  Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130.      Honors      Dean's Honors List    A Dean's Honors List  is compiled at the end of each academic year, in June. This is an  honors roll of matriculated students who have achieved an average of  3.65 or higher for that academic year (September to May) in at least  28 graded points. To be listed, a student must not have any grades of  Incomplete or N at the time the list is compiled. Note that  grade point averages are carried to two decimal places (but are not  rounded off).      Honorary Societies  in Arts and Science    Any student seeking to  join a departmental scholastic honorary society is required to  maintain, as a minimum scholastic requirement for election to  membership, a general average of 3.50, as well as an average in the  major subject of 3.50. Students should consult with departmental  advisers in regard to the specific requirements for the various  departmental honor societies.      Phi Beta Kappa    Phi Beta Kappa  celebrates and advocates excellence in the liberal arts and sciences.      The Phi Beta Kappa  Society invites for induction the most outstanding arts and science  students in America's leading colleges and universities. NYU's  College of Arts and Science chapter, the Beta of New York, was  established in 1858. In terms of seniority, it ranks as the 15th  oldest chapter of the Society.      Each April, the faculty  members of the Beta chapter automatically review the academic  performance of all students in the College for eligibility for  election to Phi Beta Kappa.      Eligibility for  Graduation With Latin Honors    To be graduated with honors, a student must have at least 64 points earned in courses from CAS, GSAS and selected Tisch departments. All graded courses taken while enrolled either in the College or in another school of NYU will be used in computing the grade point average on which Latin honors are based, as long as the 64 point residency requirement is met. Pass/\"P\" grades are not counted; grades received in courses taken at other institutions are also not counted. The student must also have a clean record of conduct.      Effective with the September 2008 graduating class, the GPA cutoffs for each category are determined by the combined GPA distribution from the preceding academic year, all graduation moments included. The cutoff for summa cum laude is the GPA included within the top 5 percent of the previous year's graduating class. The cutoff for magna cum laude is the GPA included within the next 10 percent of the previous year's class. The cutoff for cum laude is the GPA included within the next 15 percent of the previous year's class. For example, the necessary GPA level for summa cum laude for students graduating in September 2008 will be based on the GPA cutoff for the top 5 percent of the combined graduates from September 2007, January 2008, and May 2008.          Departmental Honors    Students who have  completed at least 64 points of graded work in the College may be  awarded degrees with departmental honors if they complete the  designated honors sequence in a department and maintain the requisite  grade point average. There are three levels: honors, high honors, and  highest honors.      Students seeking  admission to and graduation with departmental honors are expected to  have a minimum grade point average of 3.65, both overall and in the  major. Departments may exercise some flexibility in admissions, as  follows. In rare cases where a candidate for admission to a  departmental honors program falls short of the expected minimum GPA,  the director of undergraduate studies or the director of departmental  honors may petition the director of college honors for an exception.  In all cases, once admitted, students are expected to maintain the  GPA at the stipulated level in order to graduate with departmental  honors. Should there be an exceptional circumstance in which the  stipulated GPA is not maintained, the director of college honors may  be petitioned for an exception. If the case is compelling, the latter  will inform the registrar's office of the waiver.      Honors programs must,  minimally, be a two-term (8-point) experience that includes a  capstone research project. The capstone project, which typically  culminates in a thesis, should reflect sustained original research  over two semesters. The scope and length of a thesis will vary by  discipline, but the thesis is typically 40 to 60 pages in length. All students completing  departmental honors must make public presentations of their work,  preferably at the CAS Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) held at  the end of the academic year, or in a departmental forum (e.g., oral  defenses or presentations) held in conjunction with the URC.      Students with double  majors in discrete, unrelated disciplines must complete honors  programs in each major for which they seek honors. Students with  double majors in interdisciplinary or related fields may, if the two  departments concur, convene a joint honors committee to establish an  interdisciplinary research program of course work that culminates in  a single thesis. Similarly, in the case of joint majors, the relevant  departments must work out an agreement on the requirements for honors  and on the supervision and evaluation of students' theses or  projects.      Presidential Honors  Scholars    Membership in the  Presidential Honors Scholars at the College of Arts and Science  offers outstanding students the opportunity to receive special  advising from College faculty and staff, to challenge themselves in  honors courses and through independent research, to study away, to  take advantage of New York City's cultural resources, and to  develop leadership skills through community service. Scholars  comprise a distinguished group of undergraduates; only the top 10  percent of the entering class are chosen, and students who apply for  entry after they have matriculated must demonstrate not only  superlative academic achievements but also a consistent record of  leadership and service to the community.      Freshmen appointed on  the basis of their high school records participate in a Scholars  Seminar. They meet regularly for lectures and discussions and  participate in a wide variety of cocurricular activities. These  include the Scholars Lecture Series, cultural events in the city,  social events, and community service projects. Scholars also register  for a Freshman Honors Seminar. During the January intersession,  freshman scholars travel with faculty mentors to Villa La Pietra in  Florence, Italy. Sophomore scholars also participate in a study away  spring break, choosing a destination that most closely relates to  their academic or personal interests. During their junior or senior  year, scholars spend an entire semester (or year) studying at one of  NYU's programs or exchanges away. In their junior and senior years,  they also enroll in the honors track of their chosen major. In  addition, Presidential Honors Scholars are committed to volunteering  and serving in the community.      Membership in the  Scholars Program is renewable annually, depending on the quality of  the scholar's academic records and his or her level of  participation in the program. All scholars are expected to be  full-time students and maintain a grade point average of at least  3.65. Students who are not designated as Presidential Honors Scholars  for the freshman year are invited to apply for membership at the end  of the spring semester.      Further information is  available from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver  Center, Room 909 (212-998-8140) or from the Office of Undergraduate  Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor (212-998-4540).         Martin Luther King,  Jr., Scholars Program    Since its inception in  1987, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Scholars Program has awarded over  400 need-based and merit scholarships to incoming freshmen at NYU.  These students present records of outstanding academic achievement,  leadership, and commitment to the principles of community service,  humanitarianism, and social progress. MLK Scholars help to plan and  participate in academic and cultural events that draw on the vast  resources of New York University and New York City. They explore  cultural diversity through domestic and international travel and take  the lead in helping others through community service.      Women in Science  Program    The Women in Science  (WINS) Program selects and supports a core group of talented,  motivated women from each entering class who are interested in a  career path focused on science and math research. These women, WINS  Scholars, will have the opportunity to participate in a program of  study, research, and mentoring specifically tailored to their chosen  academic path. WINS Scholars are offered certain specialized courses  and invitations to events with notable women in the science and math  professions, as well as both a financial scholarship and a research  stipend. Information is available from the College's  Preprofessional Center (Silver Center, Room 901; 212-998-8160).      Lewis Rudin City  Scholars    Rudin Scholars are  outstanding entering freshmen selected from public and parochial high  schools in all five boroughs of New York City. In addition to their  scholarship, the scholars participate in academic and cultural  activities in New York City. The program is named in honor of the  late real estate developer Lewis Rudin, former president of the  Association for a Better New York and an NYU alumnus and trustee.
