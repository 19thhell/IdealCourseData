Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, ritual, belief, gender, individuality, and community. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9544 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain\u2014At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America Prof. Suarez-Galban (NYU Madrid)  syllabus Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9548 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Prague, in the Heart of Central Europe Prof. Mucha (NYU Prague)  syllabus The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East, many scholars see a distinct Central European culture based on historical, social, and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity, the result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic, and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of history. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures, such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe, and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel, and Dvorak, to mention at least some. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of Prague, students examine primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9549 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Woods (NYU London) The idea of British national identity has been built around a sense of united statehood within the confines of the four nations comprising the United Kingdom, ruling overseas territories. As such, it conveyed a sense of a multi-national empire ruled by monarchs, but developing over time into a benign, democratic, constitutional monarchy, generally through peaceful, not revolutionary change. The British have seen themselves historically as freedom-loving, independent, industrial, tolerant, Protestant and individualistic. These myths of national image have been forged partly through conflict with other nations over many centuries and reflect a nationalistic pride in military success and the maintenance of the largest empire the world has ever seen. Changes since 1945 have seen the collapse of that empire, membership in the European Union, large-scale immigration, changing gender politics, and the devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This has inevitably led to major challenges to traditional British views of their national identity. Includes fieldtrips to key sites. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Edelstein (NYU Florence) In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Carrigy (NYU Sydney)  syllabus How   has Australian cinema engaged with significant and often contested   historical, political and cultural events in the nation\u2019s past? We take a   critical perspective on the history of colonisation in Australia, the   legacies of the Stolen Generations, the controversies surrounding   Australia\u2019s role in World War One and the Vietnam War, as well as   Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbors, through   films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about   the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo   (2009). We also consider films that have employed innovative narrative   and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past   and the present such as Two Laws (1982) and The Tracker (2002).   Students develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts   of cinema studies and a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers   have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched   detail, allegory, and archives across a diverse range of examples,   including restorations, revivals, and re-imaginings of Australian cinema   history such as the controversial restoration of Wake in Fright (1971)   as an Australian classic; the reconstruction of Australia\u2019s first   feature film, The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906); and the revived   interest in Ozploitation after the release of Not Quite Hollywood   (2008). Spring 2014 SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 9510 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Russia\u2014Between East and West Prof. Salamon (NYU Prague)  syllabus The complex evolution of Russian cultural identity explored in juxtaposition to parallel developments of other Eastern European cultures, highlighting the emergence of individual and collective self struggling for freedom of self-determination within the context of societies which for cultural, religious, or political reasons hinder such aspirations, and examined through some of the principal textual and artistic images representative of traditions that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads of Eastern Europe.

SPRING 2014  CORE -UA 9554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Palmer (NYU Florence)   syllabus  Through the study of primary texts, we examine how Italians registered their own similarities and differences within a national context, and how they regarded the tourists, students, soldiers, and immigrants who have come in increasing numbers to Italy. We also consider the accounts of foreign visitors to Italy from the eighteenth-century until today, both from the perspective of western tourists seeking \u201cculture\u201d and through the eyes of immigrants from Eastern Europe, North Africa, and beyond. The Italian city, and in particular Florence, will serve as our primary unit of measurement for investigating Italy. To this end, we visit a number of sites in Florence and in Tuscany in order to conduct fieldwork to structure and inform our scholarly conversations and written work. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 9554, Cultures and Contexts: Italy Prof. Cao (NYU Florence)  syllabus Examines how Italian identity has been transformed through encounters with foreigners. These were not only invading armies and colonizing powers but also artists and scholars, travelers, and tourists. We explore how the Greek, Arab, Byzantine, and Jewish presences reshaped Italian civilization up to the Renaissance, focusing on their cultural consequences from a number of perspectives, from science to language, to political thought, to art and architecture. A field trip to Ravenna (capital of the Western Roman Empire, then of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, and later of the Byzantine Exarchate) offers a vantage point to appreciate the many layers of Italian cultural history. Florence is used as a primary source for the history of Grand Tour as well as the recent development of mass tourism in Italy, and is the setting for a fieldwork project to chart the cultural impact and memory of foreigners in the city.

SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 9750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Metcalf (NYU Washington)  syllabus Film and American Politics: Introduces students to the formal study of film while exploring the changing popular vision of American politics that is seen in films about Washington, D. C. From the populism of the Depression era films of Frank Capra to post-WWII paranoia, the cynical films of the post-Watergate era and more recent depictions of media-constructed realities, we explore the ways film reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. At the same time, students learn how filmmakers create meaning through the building blocks of editing and cinematography and the manipulation of audience expectations of genres, stars, and \u201cHollywood endings.\u201d           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

Totalitarian ideologies which were used in European political discourse in the twentieth century to explain major historical changes have changed forever the relationship between the state and its citizens. The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.

Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, ritual, belief, gender, individuality, and community. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9544 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain\u2014At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America Prof. Suarez-Galban (NYU Madrid)  syllabus Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9548 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Prague, in the Heart of Central Europe Prof. Mucha (NYU Prague)  syllabus The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East, many scholars see a distinct Central European culture based on historical, social, and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity, the result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic, and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of history. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures, such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe, and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel, and Dvorak, to mention at least some. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of Prague, students examine primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9549 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Woods (NYU London) The idea of British national identity has been built around a sense of united statehood within the confines of the four nations comprising the United Kingdom, ruling overseas territories. As such, it conveyed a sense of a multi-national empire ruled by monarchs, but developing over time into a benign, democratic, constitutional monarchy, generally through peaceful, not revolutionary change. The British have seen themselves historically as freedom-loving, independent, industrial, tolerant, Protestant and individualistic. These myths of national image have been forged partly through conflict with other nations over many centuries and reflect a nationalistic pride in military success and the maintenance of the largest empire the world has ever seen. Changes since 1945 have seen the collapse of that empire, membership in the European Union, large-scale immigration, changing gender politics, and the devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This has inevitably led to major challenges to traditional British views of their national identity. Includes fieldtrips to key sites. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Edelstein (NYU Florence) In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Carrigy (NYU Sydney)  syllabus How   has Australian cinema engaged with significant and often contested   historical, political and cultural events in the nation\u2019s past? We take a   critical perspective on the history of colonisation in Australia, the   legacies of the Stolen Generations, the controversies surrounding   Australia\u2019s role in World War One and the Vietnam War, as well as   Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbors, through   films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about   the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo   (2009). We also consider films that have employed innovative narrative   and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past   and the present such as Two Laws (1982) and The Tracker (2002).   Students develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts   of cinema studies and a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers   have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched   detail, allegory, and archives across a diverse range of examples,   including restorations, revivals, and re-imaginings of Australian cinema   history such as the controversial restoration of Wake in Fright (1971)   as an Australian classic; the reconstruction of Australia\u2019s first   feature film, The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906); and the revived   interest in Ozploitation after the release of Not Quite Hollywood   (2008).

SPRING 2014  CORE -UA 9554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Palmer (NYU Florence)   syllabus  Through the study of primary texts, we examine how Italians registered their own similarities and differences within a national context, and how they regarded the tourists, students, soldiers, and immigrants who have come in increasing numbers to Italy. We also consider the accounts of foreign visitors to Italy from the eighteenth-century until today, both from the perspective of western tourists seeking \u201cculture\u201d and through the eyes of immigrants from Eastern Europe, North Africa, and beyond. The Italian city, and in particular Florence, will serve as our primary unit of measurement for investigating Italy. To this end, we visit a number of sites in Florence and in Tuscany in order to conduct fieldwork to structure and inform our scholarly conversations and written work. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 9554, Cultures and Contexts: Italy Prof. Cao (NYU Florence)  syllabus Examines how Italian identity has been transformed through encounters with foreigners. These were not only invading armies and colonizing powers but also artists and scholars, travelers, and tourists. We explore how the Greek, Arab, Byzantine, and Jewish presences reshaped Italian civilization up to the Renaissance, focusing on their cultural consequences from a number of perspectives, from science to language, to political thought, to art and architecture. A field trip to Ravenna (capital of the Western Roman Empire, then of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, and later of the Byzantine Exarchate) offers a vantage point to appreciate the many layers of Italian cultural history. Florence is used as a primary source for the history of Grand Tour as well as the recent development of mass tourism in Italy, and is the setting for a fieldwork project to chart the cultural impact and memory of foreigners in the city.

SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 9750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Metcalf (NYU Washington)  syllabus Film and American Politics: Introduces students to the formal study of film while exploring the changing popular vision of American politics that is seen in films about Washington, D. C. From the populism of the Depression era films of Frank Capra to post-WWII paranoia, the cynical films of the post-Watergate era and more recent depictions of media-constructed realities, we explore the ways film reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. At the same time, students learn how filmmakers create meaning through the building blocks of editing and cinematography and the manipulation of audience expectations of genres, stars, and \u201cHollywood endings.\u201d           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Center for European and Mediterranean Studies    | New York University                                   Skip to page Content.

Totalitarian ideologies which were used in European political discourse in the twentieth century to explain major historical changes have changed forever the relationship between the state and its citizens. The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.
