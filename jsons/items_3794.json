Perelman Department of Dermatology is located within the Skin and Cancer Unit at\u00a0240 East 38th Street in New York, NY. Established in the 1970s, the Unit has developed into one of the nation's most distinguished clinical research centers in dermatology. Our mission is to advance the understanding of the mechanisms of skin disease acquired through basic and clinical research and apply them by utilizing novel therapeutic interventions. The Unit is primarily responsible for carrying out clinical trials relating to inflammatory skin diseases, skin cancer, infections, and auto-immune illnesses.     Clinical trials are research studies designed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of new therapies for diseases in human subjects. This not only advances the potential treatment options for patients suffering from skin disease, but also promotes greater understanding into the possible causes and natural evolution of acute and chronic illnesses.     Clinical studies conducted at the Unit may be funded through a variety of sources including government agencies such as the FDA (Food and Drug Administration, NIH (National Institutes of Health), and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), pharmaceutical companies, disease specific foundations such as the National Psoriasis Foundation, the National Alopecia Areata Foundation, the Lupus Foundation, etc, and philanthropic individuals and organizations.     Often, clinical trials performed at the NYU\u00a0Clinical Studies\u00a0Unit result in data and new knowledge that provide the necessary information required for approval of drugs for use in the United States and worldwide. Individuals in our clinical trials may participate in a variety of trial types and designs. They may involve medications or interventions designed to prevent, diagnose, or treat the wide variety of diseases that afflict the skin, hair, nails, and mucous membranes.     Throughout our long history, we have performed all phases of human clinical trials. These are often referred to as Phase 1, 2, 3, or 4 and relate to the degree of prior information that is available for a specific drug or treatment. Phase 1 and 2 trials aim to establish safety and evaluate a drug\u2019s interaction in the human body , while phase 3 trials establish effectiveness and further study the safety of new treatments. Phase 4 studies usually involve existing, approved mediations that may be used in new ways.     Our\u00a0Clinical Studies\u00a0Unit focuses primarily on clinical trials in individuals suffering from common skin illnesses such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis/eczema, alopecia (hair loss), acne, skin cancer, and skin infections. Rarer diseases including autoimmune illnesses like skin lupus, pemphigus vulgaris, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are also studied.     The safety of our patients is of utmost importance to us. Patients are carefully monitored by study physicians and all clinical trials are approved of by our Institutional Review Board. Prior to entering into a clinical trial, patients generally meet with a member of our unit to discuss the study design and their suitability and eligibility to participate. Should an investigational trial be appropriate, individual will be presented with an informed consent package for them to review and sign. This will give the prospective patient information about the study, investigational drug or therapy, patient\u2019s rights and their responsibilities as a partner in their participation in this important scientific endeavor.

Hochman, Harold Snyder Family Professor of Cardiology. The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center is designed to facilitate all aspects of patient-based clinical research and education. \u00a0This includes coordination of multicenter trials; support of the infrastructure for clinical research trials; as well as education of faculty, fellows and junior trainees in clinical research methodology. Since its inception, the Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center has coordinated dozens of investigator initiated and multicenter cardiovascular clinical research trials at NYU Langone Medical Center and throughout the world.   The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center Associate Director is Dr. Harmony Reynolds and Dr. Stuart Katz serves as the Director of Clinical Research Training. The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center is also comprised of cardiology investigators, grants manager, project managers, research coordinators, and project support staff.\u00a0   The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center at NYU School of Medicine encompasses a\u00a0 Clinical Coordinating Center \u00a0which is leading a large international randomized trial, ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches), funded by\u00a0 The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute . The purpose of the ISCHEMIA trial is to determine the best management strategy for higher-risk patients with stable ischemic heart disease. This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with a target enrollment of ~8000 patients with at least moderate ischemia on stress imaging, from approximately 400 sites. Patients will be assigned at random to a routine invasive strategy (INV) with cardiac catheterization (cath) followed by revascularization plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) or to a conservative strategy (CON) of OMT, with cath and revascularization reserved for those who fail OMT.   A multicenter, randomized, international study enrolling patients with stable ischemic heart disease and advanced chronic kidney disease (ISCHEMIA-CKD trial) has also been funded by NHLBI and is directed by Dr. Sripal Bangalore, director of Cath Lab Research. The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center\u2019s Clinical Coordinating Center will lead this trial, the largest treatment strategy trial in patients with stable ischemic heart disease and chronic kidney disease.   The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center is involved in the conduct of other randomized clinical trials, observational cohort studies and registries of patients with ischemic heart disease, hypertension, heart failure, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, as well as percutaneous treatment of valvular heart disease.   The NYU Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center has previously led two international multi-center, randomized clinical trials of a novel pharmacologic agent in cardiogenic shock. In addition, this Center served as the\u00a0 Clinical Coordinating Center \u00a0for another large international multicenter trial, the\u00a0 Occluded Artery Trial (OAT), \u00a0funded by The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute under Dr. Hochman\u2019s direction as Study Chair. \u00a0This was a landmark study which involved 2201 patients and 217 centers worldwide, completed in June 2011. This study specifically looked at whether opening an occluded infarct related artery (IRA) with percutaneous coronary intervention 3 to 28 days after an acute myocardial infarction in high-risk asymptomatic patients would reduce the rate death, MI or hospitalization for class IV heart failure. This trial and the prior NHLBI Dr Hochman led, SHOCK, led to new recommendations in the ACC/AHA and ESC practice guidelines.\u00a0   The CCRC maintains special expertise in heart disease in women, particularly ischemic heart disease without obstructive CAD, a longstanding interest of Drs. Reynolds and Hochman. They previously published a study showing plaque rupture or ulceration in nearly 40% of women with MI without angiographically obstructive CAD. This study was funded by a Doris Duke Charitable Foundation award to Dr. Reynolds. A multi-center follow up study including a larger sample of men and women will launch soon. In addition, patients with moderate-severe ischemia and without obstructive CAD will be evaluated using serial symptom assessment and stress imaging in the multi-center, international CIAO-ISCHEMIA study.\u00a0   \u00a0Drs. Reynolds and Stuart Katz are collaborating with the NYU Dysautonomia Center to investigate the role of autonomic nervous system function in tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition predominantly affects women. In addition, the CCRC offers special expertise in assessment of platelet function and the relationship between platelet function and outcomes via a laboratory directed by Dr. Jeffrey Berger and funded by NHLBI, AHA and the Doris Duke Foundation.   Recent and ongoing studies for which NYU Langone is an enrolling center include NHLBI funded trials such as CABANA, Pyridostigmine in heart failure, FREEDOM, VIRGO, BARI 2D, Reveal, TACT, TOPCAT industry trials such as CoreValve, ABSORB, RENALGUARD, COAPT, FOURIER, REDUCE-IT, MICRA, proMRI, TRILOGY, PROTECT, Tecos, STABILITY, EXCEL, EXSCEL, and EVEREST II, among others.\u00a0   The CCRC also houses the cardiovascular outcomes group led by Dr. Bangalore. The cardiovascular outcomes group is involved in outcomes based clinical research in the areas of hypertension, acute coronary syndromes, stable CAD, lipid disorders, thrombosis and platelet function and heart failure with the use of local, regional, national and international registries and databases. The outcomes group provides study design and statistical analysis support to fellows and faculty.

Clinical studies conducted at the Unit may be funded through a variety of sources including government agencies such as the FDA (Food and Drug Administration, NIH (National Institutes of Health), and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), pharmaceutical companies, disease specific foundations such as the National Psoriasis Foundation, the National Alopecia Areata Foundation, the Lupus Foundation, etc, and philanthropic individuals and organizations.     Often, clinical trials performed at the NYU\u00a0Clinical Studies\u00a0Unit result in data and new knowledge that provide the necessary information required for approval of drugs for use in the United States and worldwide. Individuals in our clinical trials may participate in a variety of trial types and designs. They may involve medications or interventions designed to prevent, diagnose, or treat the wide variety of diseases that afflict the skin, hair, nails, and mucous membranes.     Throughout our long history, we have performed all phases of human clinical trials. These are often referred to as Phase 1, 2, 3, or 4 and relate to the degree of prior information that is available for a specific drug or treatment. Phase 1 and 2 trials aim to establish safety and evaluate a drug\u2019s interaction in the human body , while phase 3 trials establish effectiveness and further study the safety of new treatments. Phase 4 studies usually involve existing, approved mediations that may be used in new ways.     Our\u00a0Clinical Studies\u00a0Unit focuses primarily on clinical trials in individuals suffering from common skin illnesses such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis/eczema, alopecia (hair loss), acne, skin cancer, and skin infections. Rarer diseases including autoimmune illnesses like skin lupus, pemphigus vulgaris, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are also studied.     The safety of our patients is of utmost importance to us. Patients are carefully monitored by study physicians and all clinical trials are approved of by our Institutional Review Board. Prior to entering into a clinical trial, patients generally meet with a member of our unit to discuss the study design and their suitability and eligibility to participate. Should an investigational trial be appropriate, individual will be presented with an informed consent package for them to review and sign. This will give the prospective patient information about the study, investigational drug or therapy, patient\u2019s rights and their responsibilities as a partner in their participation in this important scientific endeavor.

Hochman, Harold Snyder Family Professor of Cardiology. The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center is designed to facilitate all aspects of patient-based clinical research and education. \u00a0This includes coordination of multicenter trials; support of the infrastructure for clinical research trials; as well as education of faculty, fellows and junior trainees in clinical research methodology. Since its inception, the Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center has coordinated dozens of investigator initiated and multicenter cardiovascular clinical research trials at NYU Langone Medical Center and throughout the world.   The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center Associate Director is Dr. Harmony Reynolds and Dr. Stuart Katz serves as the Director of Clinical Research Training. The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center is also comprised of cardiology investigators, grants manager, project managers, research coordinators, and project support staff.\u00a0   The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center at NYU School of Medicine encompasses a\u00a0 Clinical Coordinating Center \u00a0which is leading a large international randomized trial, ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches), funded by\u00a0 The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute . The purpose of the ISCHEMIA trial is to determine the best management strategy for higher-risk patients with stable ischemic heart disease. This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with a target enrollment of ~8000 patients with at least moderate ischemia on stress imaging, from approximately 400 sites. Patients will be assigned at random to a routine invasive strategy (INV) with cardiac catheterization (cath) followed by revascularization plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) or to a conservative strategy (CON) of OMT, with cath and revascularization reserved for those who fail OMT.   A multicenter, randomized, international study enrolling patients with stable ischemic heart disease and advanced chronic kidney disease (ISCHEMIA-CKD trial) has also been funded by NHLBI and is directed by Dr. Sripal Bangalore, director of Cath Lab Research. The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center\u2019s Clinical Coordinating Center will lead this trial, the largest treatment strategy trial in patients with stable ischemic heart disease and chronic kidney disease.   The Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center is involved in the conduct of other randomized clinical trials, observational cohort studies and registries of patients with ischemic heart disease, hypertension, heart failure, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, as well as percutaneous treatment of valvular heart disease.   The NYU Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center has previously led two international multi-center, randomized clinical trials of a novel pharmacologic agent in cardiogenic shock. In addition, this Center served as the\u00a0 Clinical Coordinating Center \u00a0for another large international multicenter trial, the\u00a0 Occluded Artery Trial (OAT), \u00a0funded by The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute under Dr. Hochman\u2019s direction as Study Chair. \u00a0This was a landmark study which involved 2201 patients and 217 centers worldwide, completed in June 2011. This study specifically looked at whether opening an occluded infarct related artery (IRA) with percutaneous coronary intervention 3 to 28 days after an acute myocardial infarction in high-risk asymptomatic patients would reduce the rate death, MI or hospitalization for class IV heart failure. This trial and the prior NHLBI Dr Hochman led, SHOCK, led to new recommendations in the ACC/AHA and ESC practice guidelines.\u00a0   The CCRC maintains special expertise in heart disease in women, particularly ischemic heart disease without obstructive CAD, a longstanding interest of Drs. Reynolds and Hochman. They previously published a study showing plaque rupture or ulceration in nearly 40% of women with MI without angiographically obstructive CAD. This study was funded by a Doris Duke Charitable Foundation award to Dr. Reynolds. A multi-center follow up study including a larger sample of men and women will launch soon. In addition, patients with moderate-severe ischemia and without obstructive CAD will be evaluated using serial symptom assessment and stress imaging in the multi-center, international CIAO-ISCHEMIA study.\u00a0   \u00a0Drs. Reynolds and Stuart Katz are collaborating with the NYU Dysautonomia Center to investigate the role of autonomic nervous system function in tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition predominantly affects women. In addition, the CCRC offers special expertise in assessment of platelet function and the relationship between platelet function and outcomes via a laboratory directed by Dr. Jeffrey Berger and funded by NHLBI, AHA and the Doris Duke Foundation.   Recent and ongoing studies for which NYU Langone is an enrolling center include NHLBI funded trials such as CABANA, Pyridostigmine in heart failure, FREEDOM, VIRGO, BARI 2D, Reveal, TACT, TOPCAT industry trials such as CoreValve, ABSORB, RENALGUARD, COAPT, FOURIER, REDUCE-IT, MICRA, proMRI, TRILOGY, PROTECT, Tecos, STABILITY, EXCEL, EXSCEL, and EVEREST II, among others.\u00a0   The CCRC also houses the cardiovascular outcomes group led by Dr. Bangalore. The cardiovascular outcomes group is involved in outcomes based clinical research in the areas of hypertension, acute coronary syndromes, stable CAD, lipid disorders, thrombosis and platelet function and heart failure with the use of local, regional, national and international registries and databases. The outcomes group provides study design and statistical analysis support to fellows and faculty.

As one example, translational research studies have uncovered ways to remove amyloid from the human brain. We are now testing these anti-amyloid therapeutic strategies to confirm their disease modifying effects. We plan to expand and streamline our capability to conduct phase I trials of innovative drugs that arise from our translational research findings.   NYU investigators have contributed directly to the clinical development of all currently approved treatments for AD, particularly memantine, the first in a novel class of Alzheimer's disease medications that block overactive brain receptors. Landmark longitudinal research on the course of AD yielded the first characterizations of the symptomatology and entire course of AD leading to recognition of MCI as an early stage of AD and a target for early treatment, which will be a major focus of CCN research.   Furthermore, pioneering research on psychosocial interventions has provided an evidence base for the value of counseling and support for caregivers to reduce the impact of AD on both family members and patients. Trials are underway to address the cognitive deficits of dementia but also behavioral ones that often create management issues.   As one in a consortium of designated Alzheimer\u2019s disease Centers (ADCs) of the National Institutes of Health and of the National Parkinson\u2019s Disease Foundation, our CCN provides clinical resources to its investigators to speed development of more effective treatment and psychosocial management strategies for AD and PD.
