Description       Globalization is often described as the process through which the world gets integrated. It represents a higher stage in the development of capitalism, after the end of classical imperialism, in which innovations in mass-mediated technology, finance speculation, and warfare take the place of the industrial one. Yet, just as it signals a worldwide restructuring of economic production, globalization also represents a radical change in political and cultural life. In the age of globalization, how do we imagine, express, and orient our sense of belonging in and resistance to this new world order? This research seminar introduces students to canonical works of globalization theory, tracing the genealogy of the concept across the social sciences and the humanities, paying special attention to presuppositions regarding culture and critique that underlie it, as well as the new aesthetic forms it has engendered in literature and the visual arts. We will ask: What are the competing definitions of globalization? How does globalization develop between the West and so-called Third World? What becomes of culture in the wake of mass consumerism and the spread of global communication technologies? Readings will range from sociological and ethnographic perspectives on globalization (David Harvey, Saskia Sassen, Anna Tsing) to humanistic inquiries into its impact on culture (Fredric Jameson, Arjun Appadurai, Kwame Anthony Appiah). In the course of honing our critical thinking about globalization, students will write three short essays and a final research paper in which they will produce their own analysis of globalization through a study of multiple sources.
