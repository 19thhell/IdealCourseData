Spearheaded by the Institute of Play , the Hive Learning Networks , the Urban Libraries Council , the Institute of Museum and Library Services , the Association of Science &ndash; Technology Centers , and other collaborative partners, these groups seek out creative and relevant ways to engage young people&rsquo;s interests, community awareness, and shape their educational outcomes. They have pioneered after-school and summer programs, YOUmedia drop-in sites, Learning Labs , and two schools as part of a growing set of innovations designed to educate youth for the 21 st century.       The Connecting Youth: Digital Learning Research Project is a longitudinal, multi-method study of the youth, educators, and organizations involved in these innovations. The project&rsquo;s team of twenty-plus researchers hails from universities across the country and brings diverse disciplinary lenses such as sociology, education, information and technology studies, and psychology to bear on our research questions. These include (but are not limited to) the following:    Student-level:       What are the characteristics of youth participating in the study programs and schools (e.g., demographics, socioeconomic status and academic performance)?    How do participants interact with and access digital media and communication technologies in their everyday lives?    How do participants' attitudes, behaviors, and competencies in the area of digital technology and learning change?    How do changes in behaviors and attitudes toward digital technology and learning vary based on program characteristics (e.g. size, cost, pedagogical style and type of activity offered) as well as student characteristics (e.g., gender, race and parent education)?       Educator and organizational-level:       How are the programs understood and implemented in schools and partnering cultural organizations?    What resources do educators draw on in accomplishing their work and what barriers and obstacles do they identify?    To what extent is institutional change evident in relationship to the programs and the networks of innovations that they aim to promote?       The purpose of this research has been to document activities and outcomes associated with these programs, use the findings to provide ongoing feedback to these implementing organizations for formative program improvement, as well as publish scholarship to improve academic and public understanding of the potential role of digital media in supporting youth development and educational outcomes.

Spearheaded by the Institute of Play , the Hive Learning Networks , the Urban Libraries Council , the Institute of Museum and Library Services , the Association of Science &ndash; Technology Centers , and other collaborative partners, these groups seek out creative and relevant ways to engage young people&rsquo;s interests, community awareness, and shape their educational outcomes. They have pioneered after-school and summer programs, YOUmedia drop-in sites, Learning Labs , and two schools as part of a growing set of innovations designed to educate youth for the 21 st century.       The Connecting Youth: Digital Learning Research Project is a longitudinal, multi-method study of the youth, educators, and organizations involved in these innovations.

How do participants interact with and access digital media and communication technologies in their everyday lives?    How do participants' attitudes, behaviors, and competencies in the area of digital technology and learning change?    How do changes in behaviors and attitudes toward digital technology and learning vary based on program characteristics (e.g. size, cost, pedagogical style and type of activity offered) as well as student characteristics (e.g., gender, race and parent education)?       Educator and organizational-level:       How are the programs understood and implemented in schools and partnering cultural organizations?    What resources do educators draw on in accomplishing their work and what barriers and obstacles do they identify?    To what extent is institutional change evident in relationship to the programs and the networks of innovations that they aim to promote?       The purpose of this research has been to document activities and outcomes associated with these programs, use the findings to provide ongoing feedback to these implementing organizations for formative program improvement, as well as publish scholarship to improve academic and public understanding of the potential role of digital media in supporting youth development and educational outcomes.

variation in behaviors, attitudes, and competencies around digital media and learning among participants in educational initiatives developed by the Institute of Play (IoP), the HIVE Learning Networks in New York City and Chicago, YOUmedia sites, and Learning Labs. Recent research suggests that complementing schooling through programs that occur in informal learning spaces (e.g. libraries, museums, or out-of-school programs) is instrumental for cultivating youth&rsquo;s specialized interests, educational dispositions and civic identities. Implementing organizations in this study work with cultural institutions to provide innovative after-school and summer programs, and operate two schools (one each in NYC and Chicago), that use game design and digital learning to enhance young people&rsquo;s interests, community awareness, and shape their educational outcomes. The purpose of this research is to document activities and outcomes associated with these programs, specifically, how these programs are actually implemented and whether participation changes the behaviors and attitudes youth exhibit around schooling and digital media use. This study also seeks to identify how educators understand and implement their educational visions.
