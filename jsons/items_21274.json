The Writing Center is a part of NYU's Expository Writing Program in the College of Arts and Science. It is a place where one-on-one teaching and learning occur, as students work closely with EWP faculty at every stage of the writing process and on any piece of writing except for exams.           Return to top of page                     Making an Appointment           All Writing Center sessions are 40-45 minutes long. Try to schedule your appointment in advance of the due date for your paper so that you will have ample time to revise after the session.            Schedule an Appointment Online           Washington Square : nyu.mywconline.com Brooklyn Campus : nyupoly.mywconline.com           If you havent used the Writing Center before, you will be prompted to register. Then you will be able to log in and make your appointment.           You may schedule one appointment per week, up to two weeks ahead of time, using our online system. Undergraduate NYU students will have priority, though we also reserve sessions each week for graduate students, faculty, and alumni. Please call 2129988866 if you have questions.           Walk-in Appointments           All NYU students are eligible for walk-in sessions, even those who have had an appointment earlier in the week. All students who want additional time beyond one session per week should use walk-in sessions.           To get a walk-in session, come to the Writing Center and put your name on the waiting list. When a cancellation or no-show occurs, a session becomes available. The waiting list operates on a first-come, first-serve basis.            Return to top of page                     Getting the Most Out of Your Appointment           How to Prepare for Your Session                      If you are working on a draft, bring two copies of it , one for you and one for the consultant.            If your writing concern is related to a particular assignment, bring the assignment.            If you want to discuss feedback you have received from a teacher, bring a copy of the comments.            If you have notes, previous writing, a particular text, and/or research materials related to your draft, bring those items to the session.                     Prior to the session, reread your draft and your assignment to determine what particular question, concern, or issue you would like to take up during the session.           What You Can Expect           Well ask for your input at the start of every session. This gives you a chance to help set the agenda for the session.           During your session, you will think, write, and talk about the writing that is on the page and the writing that isnt yet there. We will prompt you to think actively, to compose new writing, and to discuss your thoughts about your paper and your writing process.           We will treat you with respect and respond fully to your concerns. At the same time, because we are just as interested in your long-term development as we are in your paper, we may ask you to try out a new strategy. Our aim is two-fold: to help you with your concerns about the paper at hand and to suggest to you something new about the craft of writing, both of which you can take with you.            Return to top of page                     Our Bottom Line           We are writing consultants, not proofreaders, editors, ghostwriters, or graders of your paper.                      You should not expect us to read through your paper and fix it. We will not correct your paper for you. We will make suggestions about style as we come to understand your meaning. In cases where we think sentence structure needs review, we will address specific rules with you.            We will not tell you what your idea is or how to read a particular piece of evidence . We will prompt you to rethink and complicate your idea, and we will help you to develop ways to clarify, deepen, and refine your readings of evidence.            We will not assess the validity of a grade you have received.                     Students who use the Writing Center should be reasonably fluent in English. Writing Center teachers are not trained to work with non-fluent students for whom English is a second language. If we determine that your fluency falls below our level of expertise, we may direct you to the American Language Institute for further assistance.            Return to top of page                     Our Attendance and Cancellation Policies           Because the Writing Center is often busy we have strict attendance and cancellation policies.                      If you need to cancel the night before your appointment, you can modify or delete it prior to 11:59 pm by logging into the Writing Center at nyu.mywconline.com .            If you need to cancel on the day of your appointment, you must call the Writing Center at 2129988866.            If you miss more than one scheduled appointment but forget to cancel it, you will not be allowed to visit the Writing Center again during the semester.            If you are more than ten minutes late for your appointment, you will lose your session to a student on the waiting list.

L. Doctorow           The NYU Creative Writing Program, among the most distinguished programs in the country, is a leading national center for the study of writing and literature. The undergraduate and graduate programs provide students with an opportunity to develop their craft while working closely with some of the finest poets and novelists writing today. The Creative Writing Program now occupies a lovely townhouse on West 10th Street in the same Greenwich Village neighborhood where so many writers have lived and worked.

The Writing Center is a part of NYU's Expository Writing Program in the College of Arts and Science. It is a place where one-on-one teaching and learning occur, as students work closely with EWP faculty at every stage of the writing process and on any piece of writing except for exams.           Return to top of page                     Making an Appointment           All Writing Center sessions are 40-45 minutes long. Try to schedule your appointment in advance of the due date for your paper so that you will have ample time to revise after the session.            Schedule an Appointment Online           Washington Square : nyu.mywconline.com Brooklyn Campus : nyupoly.mywconline.com           If you havent used the Writing Center before, you will be prompted to register. Then you will be able to log in and make your appointment.           You may schedule one appointment per week, up to two weeks ahead of time, using our online system. Undergraduate NYU students will have priority, though we also reserve sessions each week for graduate students, faculty, and alumni. Please call 2129988866 if you have questions.           Walk-in Appointments           All NYU students are eligible for walk-in sessions, even those who have had an appointment earlier in the week. All students who want additional time beyond one session per week should use walk-in sessions.           To get a walk-in session, come to the Writing Center and put your name on the waiting list. When a cancellation or no-show occurs, a session becomes available. The waiting list operates on a first-come, first-serve basis.            Return to top of page                     Getting the Most Out of Your Appointment           How to Prepare for Your Session                      If you are working on a draft, bring two copies of it , one for you and one for the consultant.            If your writing concern is related to a particular assignment, bring the assignment.            If you want to discuss feedback you have received from a teacher, bring a copy of the comments.            If you have notes, previous writing, a particular text, and/or research materials related to your draft, bring those items to the session.                     Prior to the session, reread your draft and your assignment to determine what particular question, concern, or issue you would like to take up during the session.           What You Can Expect           Well ask for your input at the start of every session. This gives you a chance to help set the agenda for the session.           During your session, you will think, write, and talk about the writing that is on the page and the writing that isnt yet there. We will prompt you to think actively, to compose new writing, and to discuss your thoughts about your paper and your writing process.           We will treat you with respect and respond fully to your concerns. At the same time, because we are just as interested in your long-term development as we are in your paper, we may ask you to try out a new strategy. Our aim is two-fold: to help you with your concerns about the paper at hand and to suggest to you something new about the craft of writing, both of which you can take with you.            Return to top of page                     Our Bottom Line           We are writing consultants, not proofreaders, editors, ghostwriters, or graders of your paper.                      You should not expect us to read through your paper and fix it. We will not correct your paper for you. We will make suggestions about style as we come to understand your meaning. In cases where we think sentence structure needs review, we will address specific rules with you.            We will not tell you what your idea is or how to read a particular piece of evidence . We will prompt you to rethink and complicate your idea, and we will help you to develop ways to clarify, deepen, and refine your readings of evidence.            We will not assess the validity of a grade you have received.                     Students who use the Writing Center should be reasonably fluent in English. Writing Center teachers are not trained to work with non-fluent students for whom English is a second language. If we determine that your fluency falls below our level of expertise, we may direct you to the American Language Institute for further assistance.            Return to top of page                     Our Attendance and Cancellation Policies           Because the Writing Center is often busy we have strict attendance and cancellation policies.                      If you need to cancel the night before your appointment, you can modify or delete it prior to 11:59 pm by logging into the Writing Center at nyu.mywconline.com .            If you need to cancel on the day of your appointment, you must call the Writing Center at 2129988866.            If you miss more than one scheduled appointment but forget to cancel it, you will not be allowed to visit the Writing Center again during the semester.            If you are more than ten minutes late for your appointment, you will lose your session to a student on the waiting list.

The undergraduate and graduate programs provide students with an opportunity to develop their craft while working closely with some of the finest poets and novelists writing today. The Creative Writing Program now occupies a lovely townhouse on West 10th Street in the same Greenwich Village neighborhood where so many writers have lived and worked.

Writing the Essay assignments and discussions are shaped to invite students to incorporate these experiences into their class work.           WTE: CCC. Students combine Writing the Essay with Texts and Ideas , gaining a richer understanding of the ideas and authors in the CCC course through discussions and the development of essays.

Variously known as the I, the self, the persona (performed or feigned) or the identity we make or somehow possess, subjectivity as a subject suits writing because it is never fixed. Concern for the self is not, however, a self-centered pursuit. It has served as a medium through which readers and writers have been able to live deeply as historical agents and spiritual beings. Respect for self has flourished since antiquity. The ancients thought self-knowledge was fundamental to everything else, and conscientiousness is understood today as a cornerstone of citizenship. In this seminar we will acquaint ourselves with some landmark texts in the history of the mutable I, observing many artful variations made by key writers in the tradition of reflective autobiography. We will learn how to read these predecessors by moving with their rhythms or by accompanying them in cinematic time. Readings and visual materials have been chosen to be fun, challenging and various. They provide a selective foundation for what might be called the tradition of the individual person as he or she comes to self-awareness. Our readings serve as occasions for written imitation, reflection and improvisation. We will also rely on them as touchstones for our own writing practice.           While readings and films about the self often operate through closeness and disclosure, the best of them are also philosophical and scientific, thereby supporting our balanced objective of working reflectively and working interpretively. Our writing projects will span a variety of positions between a greater self beyond our own selfs mere self (what the poet Paul Valry once called some self miraculously superior to Myself ), and a more distanced assessment of selected, constructed selves from history and literary history.           Some of our readings are already known to us faintly, thanks to the diligent passivity of our cultural subconscious: Augustines Confessions, the first book of Prousts multi-volume oeuvre , Swanns Way ; Nella Larsens slender masterpiece from the Harlem Renaissance period, Passing; literary innovations by modern masters such as Luigi Pirandello, J.L. Borges, Natalia Ginzburg, and John Barth; and thoughtful analyses of performed and counterfeited selves by Judith Butler and R.D. Laing. Beguiling cinematic visions of erased, unreal, elusive, split, vague and plural selves come to us through Bernardo Bertolucci, Ingmar Bergman and Luis Buuel and in Stan Brakhages cinematic adventures into our inner, psychic life.

EXPOS-UA 15 A Spectrum of Essays: Reconceiving Artfulness and its Risks           Credits: 4 Instructor: Bruce Bromley, EWP Prequisite: Portfolio review           At the height of her fame as a mind that reimagines what essays and novels can do, Virginia Woolf presses her fellow makers and readers to consider that every moment is the centre and meeting place of an extraordinary number of perceptions which have not yet been expressed, showing us how life is always and inevitably much richer than we who try to express it. Like Woolf and her contemporaries, we belong to a world where feelings which used to come simple and separate do so no longer, where beauty is part ugliness; amusement part disgust; pleasure part pain. Emotions which used to enter the mind whole are now broken up on the threshold. These claims mean that we need to reconceive the very notion of threshold, along with the forms by which makers, in the disciplines available to us, structure the experience of living in relation to any boundary. How we ponder artfulness, Woolf implies, requires expansion, as so many influences which play . . . a large part in life have thus far escaped the novelist and her colleaguesamong them,the power of music, the stimulus of light, the effect on us of the shape of trees or the play of colour. To re-see the shapes whereby we express our contact with life will blur the boundaries between customarily separate art forms, Woolf implies, and involve us in the risks inherent in any attempt to make over, to make again, to make anew. What can the risks in play here teach us? At the service of contemplating that question, we will read work by Jennifer Egan, Rainer Maria Rilke, W.G. Sebald, and Woolf herself. We will listen to music that rethinks what sound, ordered into patterns, can make manifest. We will watch films by Pedro Almodvar, Fran&#1195;ois Ozon, Grant Gee, and Fran&#1195;ois Girard. And we will work at crafting essays that honor our attempts to amplify what shaped thinking can communicate. By November 8, 2014, please email Bruce Bromley at bdb2@nyu.edu to inquire how to submit what you think of as your finest essay, which will function as your portfolio review. Notice of selection will occur within eight days of your first contact.
