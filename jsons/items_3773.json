What they struggled with? What they are struggling with now? Growing up in science  is a conversation series at New York University that is not about science, but about becoming and being a scientist. How do you deal with your own and others' expectations, and with impostor syndrome? How do you keep yourself motivated? Faculty members will share their stories of struggles, failures, insecurities, doubts, angsts, and weaknesses. We will then invite you to join a conversation about the human factors that are universal undercurrents of working in academia but that too often remain unspoken.     Dates for the current academic year are in the table on the right. We meet in Meyer Hall Room 815 from 5 to 6 pm , unless announced otherwise. Everybody is welcome! Announcements will be sent to the event mailing lists of the Center for Neural Science, the Department of Psychology, and the Neuroscience Institute.     Growing up in Science  was started and is coordinated by Neural Science/Psychology professors Wei Ji Ma (weijima@nyu.edu) and Cristina Alberini (ca60@nyu.edu). Please email them your questions and feedback!     GUIS on the road     Wei Ji Ma has also hosted Growing Up in Science events at other places: Radboud University (Nijmegen, the Netherlands, Jul 8, 2014), Cold Spring Harbor Computational Vision course (Jul 21, 2014), Cambridge University (Oct 2, 2014), Beijing University (Jan 2, 2015), the University of Groningen (March 19, 2015), and Baylor College of Medicine (March 24, 2015).
