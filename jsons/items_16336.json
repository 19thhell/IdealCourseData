intersection of five great cultural and civilizational regions: the Arab world at the center; the African world to the southwest; the Mediterranean world to the northwest; the Iranian and Central Asian worlds to the northeast; and the Indian Ocean world to the southeast.   The historical and cultural interactions and exchanges between these regions have generated engaging areas for study in both the humanities and social sciences. The flow of people, ideas, and commodities through the Gulf has made it a cosmopolitan and culturally hybrid setting for many centuries. The historical archives testify to this richness, which can also be gleaned from the local cuisine, the mix of many spoken languages, and the diversity of people who now live in the Gulf region.   Today, Abu Dhabi is at the center of the most strategically important region of the world. At least sixty percent of the world's proven fossil fuel reserves are located in the Gulf region, and some of the most vexing political conflicts are not too far away. As a result, Abu Dhabi represents a natural setting for studying the complex cultural, political, and economic dynamics of the Arab world, South and Central Asia, and Europe.   The Arab Crossroads concentration allows students to study this important region from a number of disciplinary perspectives: Economics, History, Political Science, Literature, and Philosophy. In addition to coursework, students have the opportunity to travel to some of the countries in these regions and experience first-hand the issues that are raised in class.

Beginning with early Western travelers&rsquo; imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. In this course we investigate the rich and complex history of al-Andalus, focusing on the changing relationships between Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities.

We learn about Arab seafaring and trade in the Indian Ocean and the creation of the &quot;Arabian Seas.&quot; We read the narratives of Arab merchants, such as Suleiman the Merchant and Abu Hassan al-Sirafi who came to China from the Gulf in the 9th and the 10th centuries, and the great travelogue by Abu Abdallah Ibn Battuta, who traveled to China all the way from North Africa in the 14th century. We study the history of the corresponding periods in Chinese history&mdash;the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, and to complement the Arab travelogues, read the narrative of Ma Huan, the Chinese Muslim who sailed from China to Mecca and other cities in the region in the 15th century. The class visits Quanzhou, better known as Zaytoon, a city dominated by Arabs for several centuries, and other port cities in the Yangzi Delta and north in the Grand Canal on the way to Beijing.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

ACS-AD 206X Jews in the Muslim World in the Middle Ages                                                                              This course examines the history and culture of the Jews in the medieval Islamic world, beginning with the historiographical debate about this contentious subject. The syllabus moves from the early encounter between Islam and the Jews at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, discussing the Qur&rsquo;an and other foundational texts, to the legal and actual status of the Jews. We will examine how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish (and Islamic) life, and how changes in the economy affected developments in Jewish law. The course will also examine the organization and functions of the Jewish community and will address the large question of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. We will also read literary sources showing how deeply influenced the Jews were by Arabic culture. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Christian minority in the Islamic world and with that of Jews living in Medieval Latin Europe.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence.

Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality. Major themes under exploration will comprise the question of the veil, the structure of the family, the use of sexual pleasures, the debates around female genital cutting, the conflicts over reproduction, and the politics of sexual identity. Writers include Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Ann Laura Stoler, Lisa Pollard, Joseph Massad, Leila Abu-Lughod, Chandra Mohanty, Mehammed Mack, Beatriz Preciado, Joan Wallach Scott, Saba Mahmood, Farha Ghannam, Homa Hoodfar, Afsaneh Najmabadi, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Marcia Inhorn, Madawi al Rasheed, Douglas Northrop, Silvia Federici, and Goran Therborn.    *Note: Former title of this course was &#39;Arabs, Sex, and Modernity&#39;.

The novels are our guides in order to understand the multiple layers of a city, and to build knowledge about the relationship between literature and social life. We read works by Naguib Mahfouz, Sunalla Ibrahim, Huda Barakat, Hanan Al Sheikh, Tawfic Yussuf Awad, Sinan Antoun, and Ghassan Kanafani. We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.

Gulf countries have witnessed an unprecedented construction boom since the beginning of oil exploitation. New cities have been built and old cities have been renewed, often with the help of such world-class architects as Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, and Constantinos Doxiadis. In Abu Dhabi, infrastructures, public buildings, and residential projects have been designed by Roger Taillibert, Benjamin Thompson, Norman Foster, and Zaha Hadid, to name but a few. Students contribute to writing the story of modern architecture in the city. They visit and document remarkable buildings, explore local archives, and reconstitute the trajectories of architectural forms and patterns. The final project is an architectural guide designed for students, faculty, and the Abu Dhabi community.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields. The course culminates in an extended research proposal for a capstone project.

Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, Muslim and &lsquo;pagan&rsquo; realms co-exist uneasily in the original cycle of tales that often confront their protagonists with such differences as a problem. Even the possession of supernatural powers recurs in the tales in the form of an accusation made against perceived outsiders (the Maghrebi magician, the Jewish professional, the Sapphic witch). The reception of the Nights tales in Europe, Marina Warner contends in Stranger Magic, animated the new sciences of anthropology and psychology, suggesting alternative modes of modernity less strictly beholden to Enlightenment reason. Cultural difference peaked the interest of the translators who brought the Nights to Europe and pioneered travelogues and ethnographies of the Levant, Egypt and Arabia. Their writings would serve as points of departure for seminal works on the engagement with cultural difference and its representation, Appiah&rsquo;s Cosmopolitanism and Said&rsquo;s Orientalism. Texts studied include Galland&rsquo;s history of the coffee trade, folktales, histories, travelogues, ethnographies, polemics, and literary and cinematic retellings.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

We examine these questions through the lens of history, exploring how these societies&mdash;and their schools&mdash;have changed across time. We place special emphasis upon education in the U.A.E., interspersing our classes with site visits to schools, state agencies, and non-governmental organizations. At the end of the course, we ask what other national school systems might learn from the U.A.E.&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, opportunity, and danger.

This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

During the semester, students will read from a wide variety of literary genres including love poetry, popular epics, travelers&rsquo; accounts, geographical works and sufi mystical treatises from many different regions of the Muslim world, ranging from West Africa to South East Asia. Exploring the movement of people, goods, and ideas within works of literature and tracing the formation, circulation and transformation of Islamicate literary genres, the course focuses on the ways that literary works mediate between local, translocal, and global identities.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region. Focusing on issues of gender, religion and nation, the course pays particular attention to the development of the Maqam system, ritual practices of religious minorities, and the popular musical styles that mobilize social movements.

The Arabic authors were heirs to the entire Greek philosophical legacy and took it in a number of important and innovative directions, some of which have remained with us to the present day. Topics broached include knowledge, certitude, and the rules of rational debate; the metaphysical distinction between essence and existence and the attendant notions of necessity and contingency; the medieval analysis of the soul, the psychic faculties, and moral psychology; and the role of religion in society and the analysis of religious claims within philosophy.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &quot;Arab exceptionalism&quot;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth.

POLSC-AD 159X Public Policy Challenges in the Middle East                                                                                         Public policy is a major facet of the political economy of states and societies. It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life. Each student is expected to complete a final research project exploring the core questions posed by the course.

THEAT-AD 134JX Theater in the Arab World                                                                                         This class examines recent trends in contemporary Arab theatre, contextualizing these within a broader history of Arab performance including film. Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus&rsquo;s Historical Miniatures, &lsquo;Udwan&rsquo;s The Trial of the Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus&rsquo;s The Elephant, Diyab&rsquo;s Strangers Don&rsquo;t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki&rsquo;s use of the halqa and Wannus&rsquo; inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus&rsquo;s and Farag&rsquo;s use of the Arabian Nights Tales, Al-Hakim&rsquo;s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim&rsquo;s use of Greek myth).

intersection of five great cultural and civilizational regions: the Arab world at the center; the African world to the southwest; the Mediterranean world to the northwest; the Iranian and Central Asian worlds to the northeast; and the Indian Ocean world to the southeast.   The historical and cultural interactions and exchanges between these regions have generated engaging areas for study in both the humanities and social sciences. The flow of people, ideas, and commodities through the Gulf has made it a cosmopolitan and culturally hybrid setting for many centuries. The historical archives testify to this richness, which can also be gleaned from the local cuisine, the mix of many spoken languages, and the diversity of people who now live in the Gulf region.   Today, Abu Dhabi is at the center of the most strategically important region of the world. At least sixty percent of the world's proven fossil fuel reserves are located in the Gulf region, and some of the most vexing political conflicts are not too far away. As a result, Abu Dhabi represents a natural setting for studying the complex cultural, political, and economic dynamics of the Arab world, South and Central Asia, and Europe.   The Arab Crossroads concentration allows students to study this important region from a number of disciplinary perspectives: Economics, History, Political Science, Literature, and Philosophy. In addition to coursework, students have the opportunity to travel to some of the countries in these regions and experience first-hand the issues that are raised in class.

Beginning with early Western travelers&rsquo; imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region. Through ethnography, literature, film and fieldwork, we will explore such topics as Orientalism and its legacy; constructs of youth, gender, family and tribe; poetry and mediation; generational and social change; oil, development and globalization; transnational labor, migration and diaspora; Indian Ocean networks; pilgrimage and piety; the Islamic Revival; faith, medicine, and bioethics; displacement and dispossession; refugees and human rights; and the Arab uprisings.

The transformation of poetic form and the emergence of modern genres, such as drama, the novel, and the short story, will be examined in relation to classical Arabic and European genres. We will also discuss the relationship between aesthetic developments and their historical, political, and intellectual contexts.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise.

How is &ldquo;the past&rdquo; recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage.

This was especially the case during the eight centuries from 711&ndash;1492 when various parts of the Iberian peninsula were ruled over by Muslims. In this course we look both at how what are today Morocco and Spain were connected in this period in both history and imagination, and at how the Spanish colonial presence in Morocco in the 20th century played a important role in the Spanish civil war.

We learn about Arab seafaring and trade in the Indian Ocean and the creation of the &quot;Arabian Seas.&quot; We read the narratives of Arab merchants, such as Suleiman the Merchant and Abu Hassan al-Sirafi who came to China from the Gulf in the 9th and the 10th centuries, and the great travelogue by Abu Abdallah Ibn Battuta, who traveled to China all the way from North Africa in the 14th century. We study the history of the corresponding periods in Chinese history&mdash;the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, and to complement the Arab travelogues, read the narrative of Ma Huan, the Chinese Muslim who sailed from China to Mecca and other cities in the region in the 15th century. The class visits Quanzhou, better known as Zaytoon, a city dominated by Arabs for several centuries, and other port cities in the Yangzi Delta and north in the Grand Canal on the way to Beijing.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The syllabus moves from the early encounter between Islam and the Jews at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, discussing the Qur&rsquo;an and other foundational texts, to the legal and actual status of the Jews. We will examine how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish (and Islamic) life, and how changes in the economy affected developments in Jewish law. The course will also examine the organization and functions of the Jewish community and will address the large question of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. We will also read literary sources showing how deeply influenced the Jews were by Arabic culture. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Christian minority in the Islamic world and with that of Jews living in Medieval Latin Europe.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

We begin by discussing the basic science and availability of energy sources, the state of technology, the functioning of energy markets, the challenges of coping with global climate change and the key role of the oil reserves in the Middle East. The second part of the course focuses on the history of oil in the Middle East and its impact on societies in the region.

ACS-AD 232X Society and Politics of Saudi Arabia                                                                              This course is an introduction to the study of Saudi Arabia and can be taken as a gateway course to the Arab Crossroads concentration. Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

ACS-AD 233X War and Media in the Middle East                                                                                                    This course examines two simultaneous processes in the Middle East since the mid-20th century: 1) how war has become mediatized, and 2) how media has been militarized. Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

ACS-AD 234X Arabs, X and Modernity                                                                              This course explores the centrality of sex to the construction of modernity through case studies drawn primarily from the Arab world. Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality. Major themes under exploration will comprise the question of the veil, the structure of the family, the use of sexual pleasures, the debates around female genital cutting, the conflicts over reproduction, and the politics of sexual identity. Writers include Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Ann Laura Stoler, Lisa Pollard, Joseph Massad, Leila Abu-Lughod, Chandra Mohanty, Mehammed Mack, Beatriz Preciado, Joan Wallach Scott, Saba Mahmood, Farha Ghannam, Homa Hoodfar, Afsaneh Najmabadi, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Marcia Inhorn, Madawi al Rasheed, Douglas Northrop, Silvia Federici, and Goran Therborn.    *Note: Former title of this course was &#39;Arabs, Sex, and Modernity&#39;.

The novels are our guides in order to understand the multiple layers of a city, and to build knowledge about the relationship between literature and social life. We read works by Naguib Mahfouz, Sunalla Ibrahim, Huda Barakat, Hanan Al Sheikh, Tawfic Yussuf Awad, Sinan Antoun, and Ghassan Kanafani. We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.

ACS-AD 263J Modern Architecture in Abu Dhabi                                                                                                    This course is an exploration of modern architecture in the city. Gulf countries have witnessed an unprecedented construction boom since the beginning of oil exploitation. New cities have been built and old cities have been renewed, often with the help of such world-class architects as Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, and Constantinos Doxiadis. In Abu Dhabi, infrastructures, public buildings, and residential projects have been designed by Roger Taillibert, Benjamin Thompson, Norman Foster, and Zaha Hadid, to name but a few. Students contribute to writing the story of modern architecture in the city. They visit and document remarkable buildings, explore local archives, and reconstitute the trajectories of architectural forms and patterns. The final project is an architectural guide designed for students, faculty, and the Abu Dhabi community.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields. The course culminates in an extended research proposal for a capstone project.

COREP-AD 01W Culture and Difference :1001 Nights                                                                   This course focuses on questions of religious and cultural difference through the 1001 Nights and related texts. Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, Muslim and &lsquo;pagan&rsquo; realms co-exist uneasily in the original cycle of tales that often confront their protagonists with such differences as a problem. Even the possession of supernatural powers recurs in the tales in the form of an accusation made against perceived outsiders (the Maghrebi magician, the Jewish professional, the Sapphic witch). The reception of the Nights tales in Europe, Marina Warner contends in Stranger Magic, animated the new sciences of anthropology and psychology, suggesting alternative modes of modernity less strictly beholden to Enlightenment reason. Cultural difference peaked the interest of the translators who brought the Nights to Europe and pioneered travelogues and ethnographies of the Levant, Egypt and Arabia. Their writings would serve as points of departure for seminal works on the engagement with cultural difference and its representation, Appiah&rsquo;s Cosmopolitanism and Said&rsquo;s Orientalism. Texts studied include Galland&rsquo;s history of the coffee trade, folktales, histories, travelogues, ethnographies, polemics, and literary and cinematic retellings.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

We examine these questions through the lens of history, exploring how these societies&mdash;and their schools&mdash;have changed across time. We place special emphasis upon education in the U.A.E., interspersing our classes with site visits to schools, state agencies, and non-governmental organizations. At the end of the course, we ask what other national school systems might learn from the U.A.E.&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, opportunity, and danger.

By examining pre-cinematic artistic practices, aesthetic traditions, cinematic styles, political economies of media, and social change, the course provides a context for understanding productions from major industries in Cairo, Chennai, and Mumbai alongside work by independent filmmakers and new media collectives from throughout the regions. Students are encouraged to attend film festivals and engage in original research with the NYUAD Library special collection of MENASA film.

This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

During the semester, students will read from a wide variety of literary genres including love poetry, popular epics, travelers&rsquo; accounts, geographical works and sufi mystical treatises from many different regions of the Muslim world, ranging from West Africa to South East Asia. Exploring the movement of people, goods, and ideas within works of literature and tracing the formation, circulation and transformation of Islamicate literary genres, the course focuses on the ways that literary works mediate between local, translocal, and global identities.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region. Focusing on issues of gender, religion and nation, the course pays particular attention to the development of the Maqam system, ritual practices of religious minorities, and the popular musical styles that mobilize social movements.

The Arabic authors were heirs to the entire Greek philosophical legacy and took it in a number of important and innovative directions, some of which have remained with us to the present day. Topics broached include knowledge, certitude, and the rules of rational debate; the metaphysical distinction between essence and existence and the attendant notions of necessity and contingency; the medieval analysis of the soul, the psychic faculties, and moral psychology; and the role of religion in society and the analysis of religious claims within philosophy.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &quot;Arab exceptionalism&quot;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth. The course seeks to link the Arab Middle East to broader questions of political organization and accountability.    Recommended Prerequisites: Introduction to Comparative Politics (POLSC-AD 150).

It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life. Each student is expected to complete a final research project exploring the core questions posed by the course.

THEAT-AD 134JX Theater in the Arab World                                                                                         This class examines recent trends in contemporary Arab theatre, contextualizing these within a broader history of Arab performance including film. Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus&rsquo;s Historical Miniatures, &lsquo;Udwan&rsquo;s The Trial of the Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus&rsquo;s The Elephant, Diyab&rsquo;s Strangers Don&rsquo;t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki&rsquo;s use of the halqa and Wannus&rsquo; inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus&rsquo;s and Farag&rsquo;s use of the Arabian Nights Tales, Al-Hakim&rsquo;s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim&rsquo;s use of Greek myth).

Beginning with early Western travelers&rsquo; imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region. Through ethnography, literature, film and fieldwork, we will explore such topics as Orientalism and its legacy; constructs of youth, gender, family and tribe; poetry and mediation; generational and social change; oil, development and globalization; transnational labor, migration and diaspora; Indian Ocean networks; pilgrimage and piety; the Islamic Revival; faith, medicine, and bioethics; displacement and dispossession; refugees and human rights; and the Arab uprisings.

Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality. Major themes under exploration will comprise the question of the veil, the structure of the family, the use of sexual pleasures, the debates around female genital cutting, the conflicts over reproduction, and the politics of sexual identity.

COREI-AD 41J Protecting the World&#39;s Health: Triumphs and Challenges                                                                                                    This course offers students an introduction to the key principles and practices of public health using four epidemics as learning tools: the eradication of smallpox, the AIDs epidemic, polio eradication efforts and the global epidemic of tobacco use. These four examples offer excellent learning templates for exploring public health because of their diversity: one has ended (smallpox), one is current near eradication (polio), one is an infectious disease for which no vaccine exists (AIDS) and one is a fully preventable human-manufactured epidemic (tobacco). The course will include a mix of lecture, class exercises, the role of games in health education, CSI-like investigation approaches, guest lectures and site visits based in Washington, DC. Students become familiar with how an epidemic emerges, steps taken to measure an epidemic&#39;s scope and distribution, how epidemiologists-the detectives of public health-go about determining the source of an epidemic, the role research plays in answering questions with respect to source and cure, how public health leaders work to arrest an epidemic and the interplay between society, culture, politics and health.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

CORES-AD 16 Family and Kinship                                                                              Being part of a family and of being related, or kin, to other human beings is a universal human experience; it is fundamental to our sense of ourselves. Yet what we mean by family or by kinship changes dramatically across societies and through time. This course introduces social scientific approaches to and methods for understanding and analyzing this diversity; it therefore asks students to explore the relationship between the universal and what is specific to particular societies and cultures.

It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples, and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.

The course begins with a discussion of some basic data used to analyze the relationships between macroeconomic aggregates such as production, inflation, and unemployment. Next, determinants of long run growth in national per capita incomes are discussed followed by a discussion of economic booms and recessions. The course concludes with descriptions of the tensions inherent in the formulation of monetary and fiscal macroeconomic policies and the pitfalls and opportunities afforded to nations within the context of an emergent global economy.    *Students NYUNY: This course counts for Societies and Social Sciences (College Core) credit;

We place the crisis in historical context of the Great Depression and of the emerging market financial crises such as those that occurred in Latin American and East Asia. We contrast the European and American experiences. The course allows students to develop an analytical framework to understand the interactions of the housing market, the credit system, and the labor market. The policy responses are analyzed within the context of the political-economic environment.

Similarities and differences between the patterns that have occurred in many of the sub-Saharan economies and those of other countries and in other times will be discussed. Emphasis is given to the range of factors involved: history, politics, demographics, urban planning, climate change, and economics. Accra is a particularly interesting location for this course as Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to become independent following World War II, and its leadership was advised by one of the leading development economists, Nobel Prize winner Arthur Lewis, who gave considerable attention to the role of cities in the development process. The course also considers the important roles played by slavery, the structural adjustment programs, and the colonial urban planning policies drawing out their implications for Ghana&#39;s economic development and its urbanization. A number of site visits to other cities will be included.    Note: Students in the NYUNY Metropolitan Studies Dept: This course counts for the major and minor    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra. Decision will be made by October 15.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

We examine these questions through the lens of history, exploring how these societies&mdash;and their schools&mdash;have changed across time. We place special emphasis upon education in the U.A.E., interspersing our classes with site visits to schools, state agencies, and non-governmental organizations. At the end of the course, we ask what other national school systems might learn from the U.A.E.&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, opportunity, and danger.

EDUC-AD 115J International Peacebuilding and the Role of Education                                                                                         This course explores how state and non-state actors pursue peace and security, and the role of education in this process. We explore international peacebuilding, including peacekeeping, institution building, and humanitarian aid. We examine how specific education initiatives such as peace education, education for democracy, Education for All, and citizenship education fit into these strategies. We also examine how education may be used to disrupt peacebuilding. Case studies may include Syria, Afghanistan, Israel/Palestine, Guatemala, UAE, and the United States. Guest speakers are invited from relevant organizations to speak about their responsibilities; students prepare questions to interview the guests.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

EDUC-AD 116J Inequality and Education                                                                   The course will examine how schools are implicated in the reproduction of inequality in countries throughout the world. Although policy makers often regard education as a means to promote greater equality and opportunity, empirical evidence suggests that more often than not, a child&rsquo;s background predicts how well they will perform in school and what types of employment opportunities will be available to them later in life. However, some nations do a better job than others in using education to expand opportunity. Understanding why some nations continue to have schools that struggle in their efforts to serve minorities and the poor children, and why other nations are experiencing greater success in this endeavor is the central aim of this course. We will also consider the ways in which teachers, students, parents and their allies, have used educational settings and the educational process as a focal point for resistance to social and cultural reproduction, and various forms of oppression and discrimination. The role of social identities related to class, race, language and ethnicity in shaping the experiences of students and teachers in the reproduction process, will be a primary focus of the course readings and class discussions.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

It seeks to answer three fundamental questions: what are the underlying causes of revolution; how and why do revolutions migrate or undergo cultural translation; and to what extent have revolutions become the catalyst for societal (dis/re)organization in modernity. Readings include historical documents as well as theoretical works by Burke, Marx, Lenin, Lukacs, Arendt, Fanon, Debray, and Marcuse.

LAW-AD 114J Punishment in Politics, Law and Society                                                                              This seminar investigates the state&rsquo;s power to punish. We read foundational works from philosophy, sociology, political science, and law to explore why states punish, how they punish, and whom they punish. We focus on the modern American approach to punishment, including its use of mass incarceration and the death penalty. We analyze U.S. Supreme Court cases in light of the fundamental purposes of punishment, and compare penal practices around the world. Though subject to change, activities outside the classroom may include attending arraignment court, observing a sentencing hearing, and visiting a correctional facility.

Its subject matter is no longer limited to the &ldquo;foreign relations&rdquo; of nations. International law continues to deal with how states deal with one another. It includes, as it has for centuries, rules on when it is legal for states to go to war against each other as well as how war is conducted, for example. But international law today includes some rules about how a government is expected to behave toward its own citizens as well as towards foreign investors who establish businesses within its territory. It also includes rules that govern non-state actors, such as international organizations like the United Nations, and others that are used by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are devoted to particular causes, such as Amnesty International. Contemporary international law is found not only in the rules that states make with respect to one another (as under treaties). It is also found in some pronouncements made or some actions taken by international organizations and international courts, like the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court (both located in The Hague, the Netherlands).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The changing nature and media of contemporary globalized lawyering, and web-based access to what were traditionally arcane written sources of law, also renders a multi-media approach to the syllabus desirable. Reported cases will be mixed with film, television, and web-based depictions of legal norms. The course will examine the history, philosophy, method and disciplines of civil and common law. The course will provide students with a critical understanding of legal concepts, an introduction to the divisions of legal doctrine and an understanding of the most pressing issues facing the profession and governments today.

MDENV-AD 115 The Global Debate on Green Growth                                                                    In March 2012, the OECD published its influential Environmental Outlook Report to 2050, confirming that the world is faced with an explosive new cocktail of geopolitical challenges: population explosion, environmental degradation, the failure to stop climate change, and the increased competition over limited natural resources. In response, governments are increasingly turning to renewables and high tech to diversify their energy mix and to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in order to stimulate stagnant economies and create new jobs. Ironically, the transition to a low fossil fuel economy through the use of RES and high tech applications has led to the creation of new global race over limited resources, such as rare earths, and this competition has already given rise to a series of fresh global political and economic realities, tensions, and disputes. We will examine how major industrial powers are approaching the asymmetric threat of climate change; the nature of contemporary resource competition; the way policy decisions are influenced by political rhetoric and public opinion; and the overall economic and political impact of climate change on international relations.

MDURB-AD 122J Cities and Consumption                                                                              Consumption of objects, images, and places is central to the culture and economy of modern life. The class addresses three questions: Why do we want things? How do physical places organize our consumer desires? And how does place become an object of consumption? This class explores how the relationship between consumption and cities has developed by examining three key moments: world fairs and the invention of the department store in the late nineteenth century; the rise of malls in the mid-20th century and the contemporary period of digital commerce and the global commodity city. Readings include Thorstein Veblen&rsquo;s Theory of the Leisure Class, Karl Marx&rsquo;s essay on commodity fetishism, Max Weber&rsquo;s essays on economy and society, Georg Simmel&rsquo;s Metropolis and Mental Life and selections from Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s Arcades project. We relate these texts to changing forms of consumption in different settings, from Argentina to China and the United States. Site visits in Buenos Aires help deepen our analysis of cities and consumption, and illuminate our surroundings.

Topics include: the basics of cooperative and non-cooperative game theory; basic solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and the core; and the extensions of these solutions to dynamic games and situations of incomplete information. Students are exposed to a variety of simple games with varied and useful applications: zero-sum games; the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma; coordination games; the Battle of the Sexes; repeated games; and elementary signaling games. The course relies on a wide array of example applications of game theory in the social sciences.

The course is divided into two parts. Part 1 studies non-cooperative game theory: Nash equilibrium in static games; extensions such as subgame perfection for dynamic games of complete information; Bayesian Nash equilibrium for static games with incomplete information; and sequential equilibrium (with refinements) for dynamic games with incomplete information. Applications to the social sciences include strategic choice of electoral platforms, collusion, lobbying, bargaining, and signaling. Part 2 studies cooperative game theory, including common solution concepts such as the core and the stable set, as well as hybrid topics such as coalition and network formation, or mechanism design. Applications include: political party formation; dynamic agenda-setting; the construction and implementation of voting rules; and the study of social networks.

The course focuses on individual decision makers in the world of politics (citizens, voters, legislators, executives, judges) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape political outcomes. Students study the formal modeling of political behavior and analyze the theories of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action). The course also explores how political institutions, such as electoral rules or the design of legislatures, can structure the interactions of these actors. The course relies on cases and examples and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to illustrate how these models of political behavior and institutions can shed light on current political events.

This makes the political economy of development a central area of research. While a student with an introductory background to political economy will have familiarity with theories based on voting, this course stresses a variety of other factors, such as the security of property rights, the creation of market and non-market institutions, lobbying and rent-seeking, collective action, social conflict, corruption, and the political economy of redistribution. Examples from historical experience as well as modern developing countries are used throughout the course.

In John Rawls&rsquo;s words, justice &ldquo;is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient or well-&shy;\u2010arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.&rdquo; To what extent are our contemporary social, political, and economic institutions just? How would we know?  In this course, we explore three fundamental questions about the ideal of a just society and what place the values of liberty and equality occupy in such a society:  1. Which liberties must a just society protect? Liberty of expression? Liberty of religion? Sexual liberty? Economic liberty? Political liberty?  2. What sorts of equality should a just society ensure? Equality of opportunity? Of economic outcome? Political equality? Equality for different religious and cultural groups?  3. Can a society ensure both liberty and equality? Or are these warring political values?

Students review literature and press examples of how Arab and Western media, popular culture, and political commentary portray each other. They design and execute a public opinion survey of U.S. and Arab attitudes in order to better understand how each side sees the other&mdash;using the poll-driven data to measure the gaps in understanding. The course also includes a televised town hall discussion with the students as participants engaging each other and peers from across the region in an examination of the topic.

Students learn to manage and analyze such data and to deploy statistical techniques that are common in these applications, with an emphasis on how to translate social science theory into empirical research. Topics include review of basic regression analysis, building multivariate analytical models, and regression analysis with limited dependent variables. The course emphasizes practical training in these skills as well as evaluation, replication, and critical analysis of research conducted in the social science literature. The course assumes knowledge of the material covered in Statistics for Social and Behavioral Sciences and is designed as alternative for students in the social sciences who are not taking Introduction to Econometrics.

Beginning with a review of sets and functions, the course covers key topics in univariate calculus and introduces the notation associated with basic linear algebra. The course is not a study of pure mathematics and so results are presented without rigorous proofs. Instead, the course provides an introduction to mathematics as the lingua franca of modern social sciences, and focuses on employing mathematics to formulate and communicate theories within the social sciences.    *Note: This course is only open to students who started before 2015.

SOCSC-AD 201 Mathematics for Social Sciences II                                                        Building on Calculus or Mathematics for Social Scientists I, this course provides a further reaching study of mathematics immediately relevant for social science majors. Beginning with a review of univariate calculus and optimization, the discussion moves to the basics of linear algebra, multivariate calculus and tools related to the constrained optimization of functions. The last set of topics includes introductions to comparative statics and discrete-time dynamic optimization. Note that this course is not a study of pure mathematics and so results are presented without rigorous proofs. Instead, the course focuses on employing mathematics to formulate and communicate theories within the social sciences, and illustrates the usefulness of mathematical results directly in terms of applications to models of optimizing agents.   *Prerequisites: Mathematics for Social Scientists I (SOCSC-AD 101) or Calculus (MATH-AD 110 ) or Calculus with Applications 1 (MATH-AD 111)                                                                      Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Maximilian Mihm                                           -             TR, 9:55-11:10 AM                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Pablo Hernandez-Lagos                                           -             MW, 2:35-3:50 PM (Sem1)                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Olivier Bochet                                           -             MW, 1:10-2:25 PM (Sem2)                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Olivier Bochet                                           -             MW, 3:35-4:50                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Olivier Bochet                                           -             MW, 9:15-10:30 am                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Jonathan Rogers                                           -             TR, 10:40-11:55 am                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Olivier Bochet                                           -             MW, 9:15-10:30 am                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

This course surveys (a) the history of the capitalist system from Dutch and British hegemony through the American 20th century, the growth of corporations, various approaches to economic development, and the current opening up of the world to new economic powers, and (b) the related political history of European colonialism, nationalism, postcolonial societies, the Cold War, and the emerging multipolar world of today. It considers the nature of crises and social change, efforts to establish stability in the face of conflicts and disruptions, and possible futures open to the contemporary world.

SRPP-AD 111 Social Policy                                                                   The aim of this course is to study human conditions, social arrangements, and social processes which are sites of social, political, cultural, and moral contestations in contemporary societies. They are perceived as &lsquo;social problems&rsquo; and divide public opinion about the appropriate ways to protect society from their deleterious effects. Lectures first focus on sociological perspectives on social problems and examine the role of social structure and social processes in their production and reproduction. Subsequent lectures focus on exploring selected social problems such as: suicide, suicide terrorism, euthanasia, aging, genocide, incest, genomics, and religious fundamentalism. The selected social problems are examined in a global perspective, focusing on contemporary industrialized societies.

After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life. Each student is expected to complete a final research project exploring the core questions posed by the course.

How can education be used as a tool to promote global social justice and prosperity? This course explores these questions by first examining various theoretical perspectives on globalization, then analyzing several major themes associated with globalization and education. Case studies from Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and North America provide concrete examples of how global forces are changing the content and context of education internationally.

SRPP-AD 115J Social Networks                                                                              Social networks are the subject of some of the most exciting recent advances in the natural and social sciences. This course provides an introduction to the major discoveries in the field of social networks, particularly advances during the last decade. It also provides students with an introduction to the methods and software used to analyze and visualize social networks. Topics include the small-world puzzle (six degrees of separation), the strength of weak ties, centrality, complexity, thresholds (&lsquo;tipping points&rsquo;), and the spread of diseases and fads. Case studies used in the course include topics such as the contagion of suicides, social influence on musical taste, sexual relationships among adolescents, interorganizational networks, and the network structure of the internet. Course readings are an engaging blend of popular social science texts, journal articles, and scientific papers.

SRPP-AD 116 Revolutions and Social Change                                                        Revolutions mean purposive and contentious efforts to re-engineer whole societies according to the visions of justice and progress. What social theories better explain these exuberant, extraordinary events? How did the revolutionaries, their strategies, and programs evolve during the modern epoch? What typically happened after taking power? Why are there so many wars and revolutionary dictatorships? This course introduces the recent theoretical advances in understanding contentious mass politics in relation to the formation of modern states, democratization, socialism, and nationalism. Empirical examples include: the American Independence of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1789; the communist revolutions in Russia and China; the anti-colonial movements of the 20th century in India, South Africa and Cuba; and the youth revolts of 1968 in the West, 1979 in Iran, 1989 in the Soviet bloc, and the newest rebellions of the 2010s in the Middle East.

SRPP-AD 117 Religion and Society                                             In this seminar, students explore the diverse and dynamic manifestations of religion in social life&mdash;as a personal and collective experience, an individual and group identity, and a code for moral behavior&mdash;and examine how these social uses of religion impact various spheres of society. After considering classic social theories of religion, we will look at substantive cases from the United States, Egypt, Iran, China, and Venezuela to investigate how and why religious meanings and identities come to matter (or not) in arenas of gender equality, political mobilization, nation-state structures, everyday intergroup interactions, and the law and punishment. Overall, this course aims to provide students with the theoretical frameworks and substantive background necessary to analyze the workings of religion and religious identity in modern societies.

It encompasses: the history of each social condition; a review of research in each area and micro and macro (governmental) approaches to these problems. Students have the opportunity to visit agencies, to meet with professionals and consumers of service and to compare the government and American public policy response to these problems with that of their home country. Presentations are made by guest speakers who are experts in each of these areas.

The course is practice oriented: we will use a lot of examples, you will create your own survey design, and we will spend more than a quarter of the course learning Stata. At the end of this course you will be able to design and implement your own, high quality survey. Moreover, you will question much of the data that is collected by others because you know all the things that can go wrong in the process. For this course I assume that you are comfortable with basic statistics. This course may be substituted with a Methods Elective course.

While there is no uniform consensus yet, most sociologists emphasize the social constructedness of race and the dynamism of ethnicity. Sociologists question whether either term captures any objective or enduring reality, and choose instead to highlight historical and geographic variations in how the concepts play out in real life. Much social science research lends considerable empirical support to our notions about the dynamic nature and social constructedness of both ideas. In this course, we will focus on the socio-political development of early as well as reigning ideas about race AND the racialization uses to which ethnic differences have been put by those vested in creating and maintaining racial orders. This course is inherently comparative, but will draw most extensively from research and theories derived from the study of those societies in which racialization has been key to national development. This course connects ideas about race and ethnicity to patterns of assimilation, citizenship, class formation, state formation, empire, economic development, and stratification.

SRPP-AD 122 Entrepreneurship                                                        Whether as heroes or agents of creative destruction, entrepreneurs and their innovations have had a transformative influence on modern economic growth and the wealth of nations. The first part of the seminar introduces the classical and contemporary writings on the rise of entrepreneurial capitalism in the West and the global diffusion of modern entrepreneurial spirit and firm. Classical approaches pioneered the study of modern entrepreneurship in its rational  orientation to profit-making through innovative activity. Contemporary approaches shift the emphasis away from analysis of individual attributes and agency to focus on examining the role of social networks, organizational forms, and institutional environment in facilitating entrepreneurial activity. In the part of the seminar, we focus on research on entrepreneurship using secondary sources and data available through the internet.

SRPP-AD 123 Science and Society                                             Social scientists who study science often make a simple, but controversial claim: that science is fundamentally shaped by social forces. This premise challenges contemporary understanding of science as producing true, objective knowledge that is independent of culture and social structure. We study debates about the nature of science versus religion, Western versus non-Western knowledge, and the physical versus social sciences in order to form our own conclusions about the relationship between science and society.

However, how gender is organized varies between societies and across time. This course draws upon research from sociology, economics, psychology, and anthropology to examine gender, providing information on how gender is organized in various parts of the world. Topics include how male and female children are socialized, women&rsquo;s and men&rsquo;s roles in the family, trends in women&rsquo;s education and employment, the sex gap in pay, and how gender is affected by public policies.

Using New York City as our laboratory, we explore some of the ways in which wealth and power are created and maintained, as well as examining some of the social consequences of high levels of inequality for families and communities. Readings and lectures explore the social and political economy of inequality through the work of contemporary social science. We will deepen our understanding of key issues through field trips, films, guest lectures, and meetings with key leaders in the world of finance and business, government, and nongovernmental groups working to alleviate some of the most serious consequences of poverty and inequality in New York.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Human rights have a history that is national, regional, and international. Part I of the course presents an overview of the theory, history, and legal frameworks of the international human rights movement. Part II will explore these themes through the lens of the Argentinian experience. Students will study human rights violations during the Dirty War and national and international responses that sought to expose abuses, marshal human rights institutions to take action against them. We also will examine efforts within Argentina over the last 30 years to balance reconciliation and accountability for past abuses. In Part III, we will examine current human rights challenges facing governments, civil society groups, international organizations, and businesses today.

But in the Middle East states and national cultures are at the same time ancient and recently created. Here the complex processes of state-formation are still current, and the United Arab Emirates, which is barely forty years old, serves a rich and richly varied example for the comparative understanding of state-building, cultural imagination, and economic development.

SRPP-AD 140X Women and Work in the Gulf                                                                   This course critically examines how women feature in contemporary debates about employment, development, and nationalism in the context of the Gulf Cooperative Council countries. The first section of the course provides a philosophical foundation for debates about women, work, and difference based on feminist theories. In particular, we will explore postcolonial perspectives on feminism and difference, feminist Marxist critiques of capitalism, and feminist Islamist critiques of modernity. The second part of the course provides an overview of how women in the Gulf feature in contemporary discourses as participants in &ldquo;globally competitive&rdquo; economies, mothers of &ldquo;future generations of citizens&rdquo;, and symbols of &ldquo;tradition and culture&rdquo;. The third part of the course provides an overview of the public policy and legal frameworks shaping women&rsquo;s work. In particular, this section of the course explores how different categories of &ldquo;women&rdquo; are produced through public policy programs such as workforce nationalization, education policy, social policy, and the interplay of national and international laws governing domestic work, human trafficking, and domestic abuse. The course will host a number of academics, activists, and policymakers involved in policies shaping women&rsquo;s work experiences in the Gulf.

It begins with an exploration of theoretical and conceptual perspectives on urbanization and welfare state policies, then moves on to examine illustrative cases from global north and south cities that challenge and complicate reigning theories and concepts. The course begins with an historical and contemporary analysis of urban poverty in Global North cities (New York, Paris and London), then moves on to an examination of emergent urban poverty patterns and cases in rapidly-changing &ldquo;semi-peripheral&rdquo; regions (China, for example), and finally explores urban poverty in a wide variety of Global South cities (spanning Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia). The course will use examples from the U.S. to explore certain key topics/concepts for debate, such as &ldquo;underclass,&rdquo; &ldquo;informality,&rdquo; &ldquo;feminization of poverty,&rdquo; &ldquo;culture of poverty,&rdquo; &ldquo;prison industrial complex,&rdquo; and &ldquo;neo-liberal welfare state retrenchment.&rdquo; Students will be asked to compare and contrast historical and contemporary patterns of urban poverty across global north and south regions, with a focus on the limits and possibilities of social policies (state- and non-state-sponsored) for addressing urban distress.

SRPP-AD 142 Renewable Energy Law and Policy                                                                              Energy&rsquo;s role in global climate change is increasing its importance. This course focuses on two major and interrelated themes: climate change and energy. The class will look at implications of new climate change and renewable energy mandates for the electric power sector. Energy is considered a prerequisite for economic growth and poverty alleviation. Electricity demand almost doubled from 1990 to 2011, and is projected to grow 81% from 2011 to 2035 in the existing policies scenario. Over 70% of the increased energy demand is from developing countries. At this time some two billion people (one third of world&rsquo;s population) have no access to electricity. Population growth (United Nations predicts world population growth from 6.7 billion in 2011 to 8.7 billion by 2035) and increasing standards of living (the UN Population Division projects 70 % people will be living in urban areas by 2050) for many people in developing countries will cause enormous growth in energy demand. Many poorer countries lack this essential capacity. Meeting the energy needs of developing countries without compromising the environment is a challenge. Advancement of innovative energy solutions and implementation of smart policies to make the transition to clean energy in ways that fulfill growing needs and improve economy without hurting environment is very much needed. This introductory level course on renewable energy examines the historical and legal origins of energy regulations and emerging policies. The course provides an introduction to the renewable sources and basic terms and concepts, regulatory trends and other emerging issues. The primary focus of the course will be on renewable energy policies and laws of the developing countries. We will spend considerable time with Africa, Small Island States, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and examples from other countries. The centerpiece of this course is to focus on a specific renewable energy project (in a developing country) completed with international cooperation and assistance. The course will also focus on global institutions and policymaking, the divide between industrialized countries and developing countries, the nexus between global climate change and renewable energy, sustainable energy sources, and challenges that global policymakers will face in future. The course will look at the wide variety of local and regional laws, regulatory techniques, and policy objects. The class will embark on a week- long trip to a developing country to study renewable energy project and to get hands-on experience of power generation from a renewable energy facility.    * Note: This course will be counted towards a Political Science elective (International Politics) only for Spring 2015.

What we eat, how we recycle, or when we disclose personal information on the internet are all examples of choices largely determined by public policies. This course is an introduction to public policy, why it is important, and how it involves simultaneous ethical, political, and problem-solving processes. The course introduces students to the ways in which a variety actors and institutions at the national and transnational levels interactively contribute to public policy. The course is divided into two parts. The first part provides an overview of the basic concepts underlying the public policy process and the second part provides critical perspectives on public policy-making in theory and practice.

This course introduces students to the main concepts of the public health field and the critical links between global health and social and economic development. Lectures explore major themes in global health, including the social determinants of health, the global distribution of disease burden and risk factors, key measures to address the disease burden in cost-effective ways, and the role of health systems and diverse global actors in responding to the health needs of populations worldwide. The course is global in coverage, but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries and on the health of the poor.
