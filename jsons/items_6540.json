Description       Application : http://gallatin.nyu.edu/dam/gallatin/documents/forms/Courseapp-PRACT-UG1401.pdf Description : How do you make a film\u2014or any piece of art\u2014with a succinct point of view and an original voice? How does the artist take his or her individual, private vision and transform it into a finished work of art that best expresses these ideas? This practicum will look at the method and practice of filmmaking as a case study for the artistic process more generally. It will offer students a sense of how to move from initial inspiration to finished product: a look at the way that the creative process develops in this most collective of artistic forms. It will also provide a space for students to share work in progress and to think together about the ways in which art is made. Students will workshop their material through a series of multidisciplinary exercises (i.e. painting the emotions that they wish to express with their words, photographing the central themes of their work, writing tangential stories in their characters' lives) with the aim of clarifying their ideas and expanding the prism through which they approach their work. Special sessions will introduce students to fine artists and others in the filmmaking industry, including filmmakers, actors, agents, and photographers.

Gilbert, All Rights Reserved.        Introduction     This course, unlike many other courses, depends entirely upon who we are and where we start from. This is not so much a syllabus as it is a design to facilitate process. From the references, the personal exploring, and the activities of a community of creators, we hope to reveal something more of ourselves and our own creative process so that as teachers we can facilitate the creative growth and activity of our students. In the class you are a composer, a poet, a music maker, an improviser. These will be the activities that will form the daily substance of our meetings. From the topics below and from our own experience and reading, other topics will develop. What this course becomes, what we become, will be unique to this class and this journey.     Preliminary Topics    NOTHINGNESS AND SILENCE   AN INNER JOURNEY   IMPROVISATION   SPONTANEITY   ORIGINALITY   INNER MUSIC, IMAGINATION AND AUDIATION   LISTENING AS CREATIVE RESPONSE   MAKING MUSIC AND MUSIC MAKING   CREATIVE PROCESS AND THE CLASSROOM   CREATIVE TEACHING AND CREATIVE LEARNING     EQUIPMENT   Yourself---dressed for adventure, a portable sound recorder, an instrument, a blank book.     TERM PROJECT    1. Develop a creative project which will draw upon your personal resources and talents, and which will challenge you to grow conceptually and in acquiring additional or new skills.    OR    1. Develop a research paper which focuses on some aspect of creativity suggested by this course, your experience, and your reading.   2. Keep a journal of the class activity, the reading, and your own reflection on your creative process and activity. This journal is for your eyes only. For the class, provide a critique of the process of journal keeping as a means of personal inquiry.      EVALUATION    Students will be evaluated on class participation, requested written assignments, and term project.     ASSIGNED READINGS    1. Hemingway.&quot;A Clean, Well Lighted Place&quot;   2.

Students will workshop their material through a series of multidisciplinary exercises (i.e. painting the emotions that they wish to express with their words, photographing the central themes of their work, writing tangential stories in their characters' lives) with the aim of clarifying their ideas and expanding the prism through which they approach their work. Special sessions will introduce students to fine artists and others in the filmmaking industry, including filmmakers, actors, agents, and photographers.

Gilbert, All Rights Reserved.        Introduction     This course, unlike many other courses, depends entirely upon who we are and where we start from. This is not so much a syllabus as it is a design to facilitate process. From the references, the personal exploring, and the activities of a community of creators, we hope to reveal something more of ourselves and our own creative process so that as teachers we can facilitate the creative growth and activity of our students. In the class you are a composer, a poet, a music maker, an improviser. These will be the activities that will form the daily substance of our meetings. From the topics below and from our own experience and reading, other topics will develop. What this course becomes, what we become, will be unique to this class and this journey.     Preliminary Topics    NOTHINGNESS AND SILENCE   AN INNER JOURNEY   IMPROVISATION   SPONTANEITY   ORIGINALITY   INNER MUSIC, IMAGINATION AND AUDIATION   LISTENING AS CREATIVE RESPONSE   MAKING MUSIC AND MUSIC MAKING   CREATIVE PROCESS AND THE CLASSROOM   CREATIVE TEACHING AND CREATIVE LEARNING     EQUIPMENT   Yourself---dressed for adventure, a portable sound recorder, an instrument, a blank book.     TERM PROJECT    1. Develop a creative project which will draw upon your personal resources and talents, and which will challenge you to grow conceptually and in acquiring additional or new skills.    OR    1. Develop a research paper which focuses on some aspect of creativity suggested by this course, your experience, and your reading.   2. Keep a journal of the class activity, the reading, and your own reflection on your creative process and activity. This journal is for your eyes only. For the class, provide a critique of the process of journal keeping as a means of personal inquiry.      EVALUATION    Students will be evaluated on class participation, requested written assignments, and term project.     ASSIGNED READINGS    1. Hemingway.&quot;A Clean, Well Lighted Place&quot;   2.

The undergraduate and graduate programs provide students with an opportunity to develop their craft while working closely with some of the finest poets and novelists writing today. The Creative Writing Program now occupies a lovely townhouse on West 10th Street in the same Greenwich Village neighborhood where so many writers have lived and worked. The Lillian Vernon Creative Writers House allows writers--established and emerging--to share their work in an inspiring setting. We invite you to join a supportive and serious community of writers engaged in an exceptional program of study.
