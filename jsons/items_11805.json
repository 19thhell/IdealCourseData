Purpose     The Fales Library/Special Collections serves as the repository for special collections materials in the Bobst Library at New York University, supporting research by a wide range of scholars including undergraduates, graduates, faculty, and other researchers whose work relies on primary resource materials, including rare books, manuscripts, media, and archives. The Library has three conspectus level five collections, The Fales Collection of English and American Literature , which documents developments in prose fiction from 1740 to the present; The Downtown Collection , which documents the NYC Downtown art scene from 1974-present, (please click here to see the Collection Development Policy for the Downtown Collection); and The Food and Cookery Collection , which documents American food history with a focus on New York City, (please click here to see the collection development policy for the Food Studies Collection.     The Fales Collection's primary users are members of the departments of English, Comparative Literature, and History. Other researchers who use the Library's materials include members of the departments of German, Food Studies, Cinema Studies, Performance Studies, Gender Studies, American Studies, and Tisch School of the Arts. Other users of the collections include scholars nationwide and worldwide.     Fales defines its mission as follows: To acquire, preserve, and provide access to a wide range of primary research materials in their original formats, including books, manuscripts, media, archives, and other items in support of the educational and research activities of its various constituencies. In addition to the Fales Collection, Downtown Collection, and Food Studies Collection, the Fales Library houses the other general special collections of the NYU Libraries. These are addressed in separate sections below.     II. Scope  The Fales Library is committed to preserving the creative work of artists and writers in their original formats, paying close attention to the book as a physical object and other media in their original state when possible. Materials preserved in the Library are meant to be used for scholarly research that requires use of the original editions or works in original formats. These collections complement the collection policies in the general stacks by supplying rare or fine editions of texts and original copies of media or by prospectively collecting works that will become important historical evidence.  Fales Library of American and English Fiction   General Guidelines   Novels and other works of fiction that document styles, genres, and themes of fiction expressed in narrative form. In general, fiction is collected from ca. 1740 to the present. Other materials will be acquired for authors who are collected in depth, such as plays, poetry, adaptations, or for the modern period, cartoons, filmscripts.   Retrospective collecting   Attention is given to &quot;filling in gaps&quot; in &quot;major&quot; author collections to assure completeness of first editions or significant editions of an author's work. Lesser known authors' works of fiction in the same period are added, especially those that give an impression of publishing trends and literary styles. Preference is given to first editions of works in original bindings. If this is not applicable or not possible, rebound copies of good quality may be purchased.   Prospective collecting   Contemporary authors are collected based on a list of authors whose work is deemed representative of trends and styles in contemporary fiction. All new books by these authors are purchased as they are published to assure comprehensiveness. Following reviews and current writers, other texts are purchased that document trends in fiction. Works by both experimental authors and more popular authors are collected for these purposes.   Primary and Secondary literature   Preference is given to the acquisition of primary materials, that is, first editions of works or other significant editions. Following precedents within Fales, significant new scholarly editions of works are acquired as are publications of letters, diaries, sketch books, and other primary sources. Biographies of note will be acquired. Critical works will not be acquired. It is assumed these materials will be purchased for the general stack collection.   Contributions to other works   Contributions by authors to other texts, such as introductions, collaborative works, prefaces, etc. will be collected depending on the level at which an individual author is collected.   Language   By its very nature the Fales library collects literature almost exclusively in English. The primary language of biographies, memoirs, and critical works collected is also English.   Geographical Aspects   The Fales Library collects English fiction, covering the literatures of England and the United States; and to a lesser extent Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Africa, and the Caribbean.   Chronological Aspects   Pre-1800: In general, little is added to the pre-1800 collection. Fales holds a strong collection of epistolary and gothic novels, but is overshadowed by other major collections in the area.   1801-1900: This is the period of most retrospective acquisitions. Works by major and lesser- known authors are acquired to fill gaps. Rare or scarce other works of fiction are acquired to give a profile of fiction in the period.   1901-1945: Special emphasis is being given currently to lesser-known authors of the Edwardian period, essentially extending the comprehensive holdings of Victorian fiction into the 20th century. Major authors of the period are well represented. Works of popular fiction are especially being added.   1945-present: Post-war fiction is being purchased to fill in gaps of major British and American authors. Fales does not attempt to be comprehensive in contemporary fiction.   Preference is given to works by New York writers, experimental writing and new narrative from beyond New York, and authors representative of trends in mainstream fiction.   B. Manuscripts and Archives   English and American Fiction   The Fales Collection has significant holdings of manuscripts and documents by English and American authors. The Fales Manuscript Collection, built largely by DeCoursey Fales, holds some 15,000 items, mostly from the Victorian and Edwardian period, including strong holdings of Sir Walter Scott. Other authors' papers include E.L. Doctorow, M. L. Rosenthal, Jerome Charyn, and Elizabeth Robins. Additions are made selectively.   Performing Arts Materials   Theater and film collections relating to the downtown scene, off-off Broadway theater, and experimental film and video are collected, especially as they relate to the development of fictional narratives in the &quot;downtown&quot; art scene.   New York Writers and History   The work of New York writers is an area of focus for collecting manuscripts, with a special focus on Village writers. New York materials include, but are not limited to, fiction writers. The papers of William Zinsser and Al Silverman, both important New York writers whose work is not primarily fiction, form a nucleus for New York non-fiction writers. New York History is collected when appropriate opportunities arise. The Richard Maass Collection of Westchester County and New York State serves as a core for such acquisitions.   Special Collections   Other special collections within the Fales Library include the general rare book collections from the NYU Library and several named collections.   Library of Congress Collection   Contains books of value in all fields. As important materials are identified in the stacks, they are transferred to this collection. In general, for material to be transferred it must be 1) valuable, 2) in its original binding or an appropriate early binding, 3) be significant as an artifact. Transfer of general stacks materials to Special Collections is recommended by selectors for final decision by the Fales Librarian. Rare materials from the NYU Heights campus, formerly known as the Dewey Collection, have been catalogued and re-classed into the LC collection.   Adkins Collection   The Nelson Adkins Collection of American Literature is housed off-site and serviced through the Fales Library. It contains over 8,000 volumes of American books ranging from college song books to volumes of fiction and poetry. The Adkins Collection is fully catalogued and searchable through BobCat. Nothing is added to the collection.   The Alfred C. Berol Collection of Lewis Carroll   The Berol Collection is the third largest collection of Lewis Carroll materials in the world, including over 700 letters, manuscripts, drawings, and photographs, plus another several hundred printed items. Funds for additions are limited. In general only new editions of Alice in Wonderland and ephemeral Alice parodies are added.   The Robert Frost Library   The Robert Frost Library, from his house at 35 Brewster Street, Cambridge, Mass., was presented to NYU in 1964. It is a complete collection of nearly 2,000 books formerly owned by Frost and nothing is added to it.   Erich Maria Remarque Library   The Remarque Library houses the personal library of Remarque. Additions each year are copies of new editions of Remarque's novels and gifts of secondary literature made by the Remarque Archiv in Osnabruck.   David Kapp Collection   The Kapp Collection of Don Quixote is not added to.   Special Collections Reference   The BSCREF collection represents rare book and special collections reference sources held in Fales or Special collections which have been catalogued and shelved in the reading room to assist staff and patrons using original materials. The collection contains specific rare book sources and author bibliographies. Additions are made to the collection to keep it current. There is some duplication with the general stacks, though this is kept to a minimum. Books held in this collection are consulted on a regular basis by special collections staff.   Hebraica and Judaica collections   The Kaplan and Rosenthal collections are added to only by donation.   Levy Collection of Dime Novels   We do not actively add dime novels, though the Levy collection contains over 15,000 American dime novels from the latter half of the 19th century.   III. Types of materials   Fales collects books, journals, newspapers, yearbooks, annuals, manuscripts, archives, ephemeral materials, film, video, and a variety of other original materials. Emphasis is placed on acquiring items in their original states. Authors' books should be acquired in their first appearance. In general this means the first edition in the country of the author, though precedence is given to the first appearance in print. Collected editions of works are purchased for major authors. Scholarly editions of works are also added for major authors. Facsimiles are purchased, but sparingly. Most facsimiles should be purchased by the general stacks. (See the English Literature policy statement.)   IV. Strengths and Weaknesses   Strengths   The strengths of the collection lie in its extensive 19th century British fiction holdings, which compare favorably with those at the University of California, Los Angeles and the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The American holdings are very strong for the same period, though not as strong as the British. Detective fiction, Gothic novels, popular fiction of the Edwardian period (1900-1914), African American novels, proletarian fiction, and the works of 19th-century women writers are especially well-represented in the holdings. In addition, the Berol Collection of Lewis Carroll material is an outstanding resource for the study of Carroll.   Weaknesses   The major weakness of the collection is its lack of 19th-century journals, which are increasingly requested by users. Other areas that could be strengthened include experimental fiction since 1945, 18th-century novels, and popular fiction since 1945.   V. Preservation   Because the collection is primarily composed of 19th- and 20th-century novels, a large portion of the holdings are in danger of becoming brittle. Some materials have been microfilmed, others deacidified. There is much work to be done to rehouse and preserve the collection. A rough estimate indicates that ca. 75% of the collection needs some kind of preservation treatment from the simplest protective covering of dust jackets to full conservation treatment of historically important bindings.   VI. Transfer Criteria for Moving General Stacks Materials to Special Collections   The following criteria govern the transfer of general stacks materials to Special Collections. If a book meets one or more of these criteria, it can be routed to Special Collections for review. Special collections staff will evaluate the book and decide on a case-by-case basis whether to transfer the book or return it to the general collection.   English and American Books        All books printed before 1801.           Books printed in the Western Hemisphere before 1821. (Rare Americana is determined largely according to those dates when printing was introduced in each state. A list of these dates, by state, is appended.)           Confederate imprints, 1861-1865.           English and American drama before 1851.           Landmark books in the history of learning (usually 1st editions).           Books of famous printers such as Baskerville, Elsevier, etc.           Private Press Books by such presses as Ashendene, Chiswick, Cuala, Kelmscott, Merrymount, Peter Pauper, etc.           Limited edition titles (usually 500 copies or less) are collected according to the importance of the author or illustrator. They are not collected per se and will be added to Special Collections only if the text is of special interest or if the author is a writer collected by the Fales Library.           Autographed books (signed by author, artist) or association copies (personal copies of famous people).           Miniature books with textual value. (Miniature books are not collected as such, and will be added to Special Collections only if the text is of scholarly interest.)           Hebrew Books published anywhere in America before 1865.          Americana   In addition to the criteria above, any books published in America     before 1821 will be considered for inclusion in special collections.    There are exceptions, and their cut-off dates are as follows:                          ALABAMA (1840)    KANSAS (1875)    OHIO (1840)          ARIZONA (1890)    KENTUCKY (1830)    OKLAHOMA (1875)          ARKANSAS (1870)    MINNESOTA (1865)    PENNSYLVANIA (1830, except Philadelphia)          CALIFORNIA (1875)    MISSISSIPPI (1840)    SOUTH DAKOTA (1890)          COLORADO (1876)    MISSOURI (1850)    TENNESSEE (1840)          FLORIDA (1860)    MONTANA (1890)    TEXAS (1860)          HAWAII (1860)    NEBRASKA (1875)    UTAH (1890)          IDAHO (1890)    NEVADA (1890)    WASHINGTON (1875)          ILLINOIS (1850; Chicago, 1871)    NEW MEXICO ((1875)    WEST VIRGINIA (1830)          INDIANA (1850)    NEW YORK (1850 outside NYC; 1830 for Hudson     River towns)    WISCONSIN (1850)          IOWA (1860)    NORTH DAKOTA (1850)    WYOMING (1890)          Foreign Language Materials   German:     Any German texts before 1840 or pro- or anti-fascist primary source     materials about WWI or WWII.     French:     Any French Revolutionary materials.     VI. Deaccession Policy for the Fales Library &amp; Special Collections   Introduction   The deaccession of materials in special collections is governed by different principles from those for general research collections. Because of the primacy of preserving special collections materials in their original format and, concomitant with that, the role of special collections as repositories for cultural history, the Fales Library will carefully assess all materials before accepting them to lessen the likelihood of deaccession. This said, there are valid reasons why materials in special collections may be deaccessioned.   Acknowledging these points, The Rare Book and Manuscripts Section of the Association of College and Research Libraries included a lengthy set of guidelines for deaccession of materials in Standards for Ethical Conduct for Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Librarians, with Guidelines for Institutional Practice in Support of the Standards, 2d edition, 1992. The following policy for deaccession of materials from the Fales Library and Special Collections incorporates and upholds the standards established by RBMS for the ethical deaccessioning of materials from special collections.   Guidelines for the Deaccession of Materials   1. In the deaccession of rare books and manuscripts, the Fales Library will weigh carefully the interests of the public for which it holds the collections in trust, the interests of the scholarly and cultural community, and the Fales Library's own mission.   2. The Fales Library will consider any legal restrictions, the necessity for possession of valid title, and the donor's intent in the broadest sense.   3. Procedures for the deaccession or disposal of materials will be at least as rigorous as those for purchasing and should be governed by the same basic principles. The decision to dispose of materials must be made only after full and scrupulous consideration of the public interest and the needs of researchers; the process of deaccession will be carried out in as open and public a manner as possible.   4. Mandatory restrictions on disposition which accompanied a donation will be observed unless it can be shown clearly by appropriate legal procedures that adherence to them is impossible or substantially detrimental to the New York University. When statements of donor's preferences accompany an acquisition, any departure from them will be carefully considered and negotiated with the donor or the donor's heirs or settled by appropriate legal procedures.   5. Responsibility to the needs and reputation of the Fales Library requires that, in preparing for and accomplishing any deaccession, the Fales Library will take care to define and publicly state the purpose of the deaccession and the intended use of monetary or other proceeds of the deaccession, to avoid any procedure which may detract from the Library's reputation for honesty and responsible conduct, and to carry out the entire process in a way which will not detract from public perception of its responsible stewardship.   The following points must be taken into consideration:     The Fales Library will insure that the method of deaccession will result in furthering the agreed purpose of the deaccession, whether this be monetary gain or more appropriate placement of scholarly resources.      The Fales Library will disclose to the potential new owner or intermediary agent any action, such as the retention of a photocopy of the material, which may affect the monetary or scholarly value of the material.      To the fullest extent possible, the Fales Library will make public information on the disposition of deaccessioned materials.      The Fales Library will not allow materials from its collections to be acquired privately by any library employee, officer, or volunteer, unless they are sold publicly and with complete disclosure of their history.      Due consideration should be given to the library community in general when disposing of items. Sales to, or exchanges between, institutions will be explored as well as disposal through the trade.

Sales to, or exchanges between, institutions will be explored as well as disposal through the trade.     VIII. Other Resources   Because of its location within New York City, the Fales Library is complemented by several other major collections of rare materials and primary sources for the study of literature and the contemporary arts. Included among these other collections are the Pierpont Morgan Library, The New York Public Library, The Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Columbia University, The New-York Historical Society Library.   \u00a0"}]},

Hebraica and Judaica collections   The Kaplan and Rosenthal collections are added to only by donation.   Levy Collection of Dime Novels   We do not actively add dime novels, though the Levy collection contains over 15,000 American dime novels from the latter half of the 19th century.   III. Types of materials   Fales collects books, journals, newspapers, yearbooks, annuals, manuscripts, archives, ephemeral materials, film, video, and a variety of other original materials. Emphasis is placed on acquiring items in their original states. Authors' books should be acquired in their first appearance. In general this means the first edition in the country of the author, though precedence is given to the first appearance in print. Collected editions of works are purchased for major authors. Scholarly editions of works are also added for major authors. Facsimiles are purchased, but sparingly. Most facsimiles should be purchased by the general stacks. (See the English Literature policy statement.)   IV. Strengths and Weaknesses   Strengths   The strengths of the collection lie in its extensive 19th century British fiction holdings, which compare favorably with those at the University of California, Los Angeles and the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The American holdings are very strong for the same period, though not as strong as the British. Detective fiction, Gothic novels, popular fiction of the Edwardian period (1900-1914), African American novels, proletarian fiction, and the works of 19th-century women writers are especially well-represented in the holdings. In addition, the Berol Collection of Lewis Carroll material is an outstanding resource for the study of Carroll.   Weaknesses   The major weakness of the collection is its lack of 19th-century journals, which are increasingly requested by users. Other areas that could be strengthened include experimental fiction since 1945, 18th-century novels, and popular fiction since 1945.   V. Preservation   Because the collection is primarily composed of 19th- and 20th-century novels, a large portion of the holdings are in danger of becoming brittle. Some materials have been microfilmed, others deacidified. There is much work to be done to rehouse and preserve the collection. A rough estimate indicates that ca. 75% of the collection needs some kind of preservation treatment from the simplest protective covering of dust jackets to full conservation treatment of historically important bindings.   VI. Transfer Criteria for Moving General Stacks Materials to Special Collections   The following criteria govern the transfer of general stacks materials to Special Collections. If a book meets one or more of these criteria, it can be routed to Special Collections for review. Special collections staff will evaluate the book and decide on a case-by-case basis whether to transfer the book or return it to the general collection.   English and American Books        All books printed before 1801.           Books printed in the Western Hemisphere before 1821. (Rare Americana is determined largely according to those dates when printing was introduced in each state. A list of these dates, by state, is appended.)           Confederate imprints, 1861-1865.           English and American drama before 1851.           Landmark books in the history of learning (usually 1st editions).           Books of famous printers such as Baskerville, Elsevier, etc.           Private Press Books by such presses as Ashendene, Chiswick, Cuala, Kelmscott, Merrymount, Peter Pauper, etc.           Limited edition titles (usually 500 copies or less) are collected according to the importance of the author or illustrator. They are not collected per se and will be added to Special Collections only if the text is of special interest or if the author is a writer collected by the Fales Library.           Autographed books (signed by author, artist) or association copies (personal copies of famous people).           Miniature books with textual value. (Miniature books are not collected as such, and will be added to Special Collections only if the text is of scholarly interest.)           Hebrew Books published anywhere in America before 1865.          Americana   In addition to the criteria above, any books published in America     before 1821 will be considered for inclusion in special collections.    There are exceptions, and their cut-off dates are as follows:                          ALABAMA (1840)    KANSAS (1875)    OHIO (1840)          ARIZONA (1890)    KENTUCKY (1830)    OKLAHOMA (1875)          ARKANSAS (1870)    MINNESOTA (1865)    PENNSYLVANIA (1830, except Philadelphia)          CALIFORNIA (1875)    MISSISSIPPI (1840)    SOUTH DAKOTA (1890)          COLORADO (1876)    MISSOURI (1850)    TENNESSEE (1840)          FLORIDA (1860)    MONTANA (1890)    TEXAS (1860)          HAWAII (1860)    NEBRASKA (1875)    UTAH (1890)          IDAHO (1890)    NEVADA (1890)    WASHINGTON (1875)          ILLINOIS (1850; Chicago, 1871)    NEW MEXICO ((1875)    WEST VIRGINIA (1830)          INDIANA (1850)    NEW YORK (1850 outside NYC; 1830 for Hudson     River towns)    WISCONSIN (1850)          IOWA (1860)    NORTH DAKOTA (1850)    WYOMING (1890)          Foreign Language Materials   German:     Any German texts before 1840 or pro- or anti-fascist primary source     materials about WWI or WWII.

Deaccession Policy for the Fales Library &amp; Special Collections   Introduction   The deaccession of materials in special collections is governed by different principles from those for general research collections. Because of the primacy of preserving special collections materials in their original format and, concomitant with that, the role of special collections as repositories for cultural history, the Fales Library will carefully assess all materials before accepting them to lessen the likelihood of deaccession. This said, there are valid reasons why materials in special collections may be deaccessioned.   Acknowledging these points, The Rare Book and Manuscripts Section of the Association of College and Research Libraries included a lengthy set of guidelines for deaccession of materials in Standards for Ethical Conduct for Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Librarians, with Guidelines for Institutional Practice in Support of the Standards, 2d edition, 1992. The following policy for deaccession of materials from the Fales Library and Special Collections incorporates and upholds the standards established by RBMS for the ethical deaccessioning of materials from special collections.   Guidelines for the Deaccession of Materials   1. In the deaccession of rare books and manuscripts, the Fales Library will weigh carefully the interests of the public for which it holds the collections in trust, the interests of the scholarly and cultural community, and the Fales Library's own mission.   2. The Fales Library will consider any legal restrictions, the necessity for possession of valid title, and the donor's intent in the broadest sense.   3. Procedures for the deaccession or disposal of materials will be at least as rigorous as those for purchasing and should be governed by the same basic principles. The decision to dispose of materials must be made only after full and scrupulous consideration of the public interest and the needs of researchers; the process of deaccession will be carried out in as open and public a manner as possible.   4. Mandatory restrictions on disposition which accompanied a donation will be observed unless it can be shown clearly by appropriate legal procedures that adherence to them is impossible or substantially detrimental to the New York University. When statements of donor's preferences accompany an acquisition, any departure from them will be carefully considered and negotiated with the donor or the donor's heirs or settled by appropriate legal procedures.   5. Responsibility to the needs and reputation of the Fales Library requires that, in preparing for and accomplishing any deaccession, the Fales Library will take care to define and publicly state the purpose of the deaccession and the intended use of monetary or other proceeds of the deaccession, to avoid any procedure which may detract from the Library's reputation for honesty and responsible conduct, and to carry out the entire process in a way which will not detract from public perception of its responsible stewardship.   The following points must be taken into consideration:     The Fales Library will insure that the method of deaccession will result in furthering the agreed purpose of the deaccession, whether this be monetary gain or more appropriate placement of scholarly resources.      The Fales Library will disclose to the potential new owner or intermediary agent any action, such as the retention of a photocopy of the material, which may affect the monetary or scholarly value of the material.      To the fullest extent possible, the Fales Library will make public information on the disposition of deaccessioned materials.      The Fales Library will not allow materials from its collections to be acquired privately by any library employee, officer, or volunteer, unless they are sold publicly and with complete disclosure of their history.      Due consideration should be given to the library community in general when disposing of items. Sales to, or exchanges between, institutions will be explored as well as disposal through the trade.

Other Resources   Because of its location within New York City, the Fales Library is complemented by several other major collections of rare materials and primary sources for the study of literature and the contemporary arts. Included among these other collections are the Pierpont Morgan Library, The New York Public Library, The Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Columbia University, The New-York Historical Society Library.   \u00a0"}, {"content": "Bulletin Course Descriptions | English | NYU                                               Back to Home           Printer Friendly                     Course Descriptions (GSAS Bulletin) Proseminars    Workshop on Professional Practices ENGL-GA 3980 Fitzpatrick, Parihk, Augst. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15.

Purpose     The Fales Library/Special Collections serves as the repository for special collections materials in the Bobst Library at New York University, supporting research by a wide range of scholars including undergraduates, graduates, faculty, and other researchers whose work relies on primary resource materials, including rare books, manuscripts, media, and archives. The Library has three conspectus level five collections, The Fales Collection of English and American Literature , which documents developments in prose fiction from 1740 to the present; The Downtown Collection , which documents the NYC Downtown art scene from 1974-present, (please click here to see the Collection Development Policy for the Downtown Collection); and The Food and Cookery Collection , which documents American food history with a focus on New York City, (please click here to see the collection development policy for the Food Studies Collection.     The Fales Collection's primary users are members of the departments of English, Comparative Literature, and History. Other researchers who use the Library's materials include members of the departments of German, Food Studies, Cinema Studies, Performance Studies, Gender Studies, American Studies, and Tisch School of the Arts. Other users of the collections include scholars nationwide and worldwide.     Fales defines its mission as follows: To acquire, preserve, and provide access to a wide range of primary research materials in their original formats, including books, manuscripts, media, archives, and other items in support of the educational and research activities of its various constituencies. In addition to the Fales Collection, Downtown Collection, and Food Studies Collection, the Fales Library houses the other general special collections of the NYU Libraries. These are addressed in separate sections below.     II. Scope  The Fales Library is committed to preserving the creative work of artists and writers in their original formats, paying close attention to the book as a physical object and other media in their original state when possible. Materials preserved in the Library are meant to be used for scholarly research that requires use of the original editions or works in original formats. These collections complement the collection policies in the general stacks by supplying rare or fine editions of texts and original copies of media or by prospectively collecting works that will become important historical evidence.  Fales Library of American and English Fiction   General Guidelines   Novels and other works of fiction that document styles, genres, and themes of fiction expressed in narrative form. In general, fiction is collected from ca. 1740 to the present. Other materials will be acquired for authors who are collected in depth, such as plays, poetry, adaptations, or for the modern period, cartoons, filmscripts.   Retrospective collecting   Attention is given to &quot;filling in gaps&quot; in &quot;major&quot; author collections to assure completeness of first editions or significant editions of an author's work. Lesser known authors' works of fiction in the same period are added, especially those that give an impression of publishing trends and literary styles. Preference is given to first editions of works in original bindings. If this is not applicable or not possible, rebound copies of good quality may be purchased.   Prospective collecting   Contemporary authors are collected based on a list of authors whose work is deemed representative of trends and styles in contemporary fiction. All new books by these authors are purchased as they are published to assure comprehensiveness. Following reviews and current writers, other texts are purchased that document trends in fiction. Works by both experimental authors and more popular authors are collected for these purposes.   Primary and Secondary literature   Preference is given to the acquisition of primary materials, that is, first editions of works or other significant editions. Following precedents within Fales, significant new scholarly editions of works are acquired as are publications of letters, diaries, sketch books, and other primary sources. Biographies of note will be acquired. Critical works will not be acquired. It is assumed these materials will be purchased for the general stack collection.   Contributions to other works   Contributions by authors to other texts, such as introductions, collaborative works, prefaces, etc. will be collected depending on the level at which an individual author is collected.   Language   By its very nature the Fales library collects literature almost exclusively in English. The primary language of biographies, memoirs, and critical works collected is also English.   Geographical Aspects   The Fales Library collects English fiction, covering the literatures of England and the United States; and to a lesser extent Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Africa, and the Caribbean.   Chronological Aspects   Pre-1800: In general, little is added to the pre-1800 collection. Fales holds a strong collection of epistolary and gothic novels, but is overshadowed by other major collections in the area.   1801-1900: This is the period of most retrospective acquisitions. Works by major and lesser- known authors are acquired to fill gaps. Rare or scarce other works of fiction are acquired to give a profile of fiction in the period.   1901-1945: Special emphasis is being given currently to lesser-known authors of the Edwardian period, essentially extending the comprehensive holdings of Victorian fiction into the 20th century. Major authors of the period are well represented. Works of popular fiction are especially being added.   1945-present: Post-war fiction is being purchased to fill in gaps of major British and American authors. Fales does not attempt to be comprehensive in contemporary fiction.   Preference is given to works by New York writers, experimental writing and new narrative from beyond New York, and authors representative of trends in mainstream fiction.   B. Manuscripts and Archives   English and American Fiction   The Fales Collection has significant holdings of manuscripts and documents by English and American authors. The Fales Manuscript Collection, built largely by DeCoursey Fales, holds some 15,000 items, mostly from the Victorian and Edwardian period, including strong holdings of Sir Walter Scott. Other authors' papers include E.L. Doctorow, M. L. Rosenthal, Jerome Charyn, and Elizabeth Robins. Additions are made selectively.   Performing Arts Materials   Theater and film collections relating to the downtown scene, off-off Broadway theater, and experimental film and video are collected, especially as they relate to the development of fictional narratives in the &quot;downtown&quot; art scene.   New York Writers and History   The work of New York writers is an area of focus for collecting manuscripts, with a special focus on Village writers. New York materials include, but are not limited to, fiction writers. The papers of William Zinsser and Al Silverman, both important New York writers whose work is not primarily fiction, form a nucleus for New York non-fiction writers. New York History is collected when appropriate opportunities arise. The Richard Maass Collection of Westchester County and New York State serves as a core for such acquisitions.   Special Collections   Other special collections within the Fales Library include the general rare book collections from the NYU Library and several named collections.   Library of Congress Collection   Contains books of value in all fields. As important materials are identified in the stacks, they are transferred to this collection. In general, for material to be transferred it must be 1) valuable, 2) in its original binding or an appropriate early binding, 3) be significant as an artifact. Transfer of general stacks materials to Special Collections is recommended by selectors for final decision by the Fales Librarian. Rare materials from the NYU Heights campus, formerly known as the Dewey Collection, have been catalogued and re-classed into the LC collection.   Adkins Collection   The Nelson Adkins Collection of American Literature is housed off-site and serviced through the Fales Library. It contains over 8,000 volumes of American books ranging from college song books to volumes of fiction and poetry. The Adkins Collection is fully catalogued and searchable through BobCat. Nothing is added to the collection.   The Alfred C. Berol Collection of Lewis Carroll   The Berol Collection is the third largest collection of Lewis Carroll materials in the world, including over 700 letters, manuscripts, drawings, and photographs, plus another several hundred printed items. Funds for additions are limited. In general only new editions of Alice in Wonderland and ephemeral Alice parodies are added.   The Robert Frost Library   The Robert Frost Library, from his house at 35 Brewster Street, Cambridge, Mass., was presented to NYU in 1964. It is a complete collection of nearly 2,000 books formerly owned by Frost and nothing is added to it.   Erich Maria Remarque Library   The Remarque Library houses the personal library of Remarque. Additions each year are copies of new editions of Remarque's novels and gifts of secondary literature made by the Remarque Archiv in Osnabruck.   David Kapp Collection   The Kapp Collection of Don Quixote is not added to.   Special Collections Reference   The BSCREF collection represents rare book and special collections reference sources held in Fales or Special collections which have been catalogued and shelved in the reading room to assist staff and patrons using original materials. The collection contains specific rare book sources and author bibliographies. Additions are made to the collection to keep it current. There is some duplication with the general stacks, though this is kept to a minimum. Books held in this collection are consulted on a regular basis by special collections staff.   Hebraica and Judaica collections   The Kaplan and Rosenthal collections are added to only by donation.   Levy Collection of Dime Novels   We do not actively add dime novels, though the Levy collection contains over 15,000 American dime novels from the latter half of the 19th century.   III. Types of materials   Fales collects books, journals, newspapers, yearbooks, annuals, manuscripts, archives, ephemeral materials, film, video, and a variety of other original materials. Emphasis is placed on acquiring items in their original states. Authors' books should be acquired in their first appearance. In general this means the first edition in the country of the author, though precedence is given to the first appearance in print. Collected editions of works are purchased for major authors. Scholarly editions of works are also added for major authors. Facsimiles are purchased, but sparingly. Most facsimiles should be purchased by the general stacks. (See the English Literature policy statement.)   IV. Strengths and Weaknesses   Strengths   The strengths of the collection lie in its extensive 19th century British fiction holdings, which compare favorably with those at the University of California, Los Angeles and the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The American holdings are very strong for the same period, though not as strong as the British. Detective fiction, Gothic novels, popular fiction of the Edwardian period (1900-1914), African American novels, proletarian fiction, and the works of 19th-century women writers are especially well-represented in the holdings. In addition, the Berol Collection of Lewis Carroll material is an outstanding resource for the study of Carroll.   Weaknesses   The major weakness of the collection is its lack of 19th-century journals, which are increasingly requested by users. Other areas that could be strengthened include experimental fiction since 1945, 18th-century novels, and popular fiction since 1945.   V. Preservation   Because the collection is primarily composed of 19th- and 20th-century novels, a large portion of the holdings are in danger of becoming brittle. Some materials have been microfilmed, others deacidified. There is much work to be done to rehouse and preserve the collection. A rough estimate indicates that ca. 75% of the collection needs some kind of preservation treatment from the simplest protective covering of dust jackets to full conservation treatment of historically important bindings.   VI. Transfer Criteria for Moving General Stacks Materials to Special Collections   The following criteria govern the transfer of general stacks materials to Special Collections. If a book meets one or more of these criteria, it can be routed to Special Collections for review. Special collections staff will evaluate the book and decide on a case-by-case basis whether to transfer the book or return it to the general collection.   English and American Books        All books printed before 1801.           Books printed in the Western Hemisphere before 1821. (Rare Americana is determined largely according to those dates when printing was introduced in each state. A list of these dates, by state, is appended.)           Confederate imprints, 1861-1865.           English and American drama before 1851.           Landmark books in the history of learning (usually 1st editions).           Books of famous printers such as Baskerville, Elsevier, etc.           Private Press Books by such presses as Ashendene, Chiswick, Cuala, Kelmscott, Merrymount, Peter Pauper, etc.           Limited edition titles (usually 500 copies or less) are collected according to the importance of the author or illustrator. They are not collected per se and will be added to Special Collections only if the text is of special interest or if the author is a writer collected by the Fales Library.           Autographed books (signed by author, artist) or association copies (personal copies of famous people).           Miniature books with textual value. (Miniature books are not collected as such, and will be added to Special Collections only if the text is of scholarly interest.)           Hebrew Books published anywhere in America before 1865.          Americana   In addition to the criteria above, any books published in America     before 1821 will be considered for inclusion in special collections.    There are exceptions, and their cut-off dates are as follows:                          ALABAMA (1840)    KANSAS (1875)    OHIO (1840)          ARIZONA (1890)    KENTUCKY (1830)    OKLAHOMA (1875)          ARKANSAS (1870)    MINNESOTA (1865)    PENNSYLVANIA (1830, except Philadelphia)          CALIFORNIA (1875)    MISSISSIPPI (1840)    SOUTH DAKOTA (1890)          COLORADO (1876)    MISSOURI (1850)    TENNESSEE (1840)          FLORIDA (1860)    MONTANA (1890)    TEXAS (1860)          HAWAII (1860)    NEBRASKA (1875)    UTAH (1890)          IDAHO (1890)    NEVADA (1890)    WASHINGTON (1875)          ILLINOIS (1850; Chicago, 1871)    NEW MEXICO ((1875)    WEST VIRGINIA (1830)          INDIANA (1850)    NEW YORK (1850 outside NYC; 1830 for Hudson     River towns)    WISCONSIN (1850)          IOWA (1860)    NORTH DAKOTA (1850)    WYOMING (1890)          Foreign Language Materials   German:     Any German texts before 1840 or pro- or anti-fascist primary source     materials about WWI or WWII.     French:     Any French Revolutionary materials.     VI. Deaccession Policy for the Fales Library &amp; Special Collections   Introduction   The deaccession of materials in special collections is governed by different principles from those for general research collections. Because of the primacy of preserving special collections materials in their original format and, concomitant with that, the role of special collections as repositories for cultural history, the Fales Library will carefully assess all materials before accepting them to lessen the likelihood of deaccession. This said, there are valid reasons why materials in special collections may be deaccessioned.   Acknowledging these points, The Rare Book and Manuscripts Section of the Association of College and Research Libraries included a lengthy set of guidelines for deaccession of materials in Standards for Ethical Conduct for Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Librarians, with Guidelines for Institutional Practice in Support of the Standards, 2d edition, 1992. The following policy for deaccession of materials from the Fales Library and Special Collections incorporates and upholds the standards established by RBMS for the ethical deaccessioning of materials from special collections.   Guidelines for the Deaccession of Materials   1. In the deaccession of rare books and manuscripts, the Fales Library will weigh carefully the interests of the public for which it holds the collections in trust, the interests of the scholarly and cultural community, and the Fales Library's own mission.   2. The Fales Library will consider any legal restrictions, the necessity for possession of valid title, and the donor's intent in the broadest sense.   3. Procedures for the deaccession or disposal of materials will be at least as rigorous as those for purchasing and should be governed by the same basic principles. The decision to dispose of materials must be made only after full and scrupulous consideration of the public interest and the needs of researchers; the process of deaccession will be carried out in as open and public a manner as possible.   4. Mandatory restrictions on disposition which accompanied a donation will be observed unless it can be shown clearly by appropriate legal procedures that adherence to them is impossible or substantially detrimental to the New York University. When statements of donor's preferences accompany an acquisition, any departure from them will be carefully considered and negotiated with the donor or the donor's heirs or settled by appropriate legal procedures.   5. Responsibility to the needs and reputation of the Fales Library requires that, in preparing for and accomplishing any deaccession, the Fales Library will take care to define and publicly state the purpose of the deaccession and the intended use of monetary or other proceeds of the deaccession, to avoid any procedure which may detract from the Library's reputation for honesty and responsible conduct, and to carry out the entire process in a way which will not detract from public perception of its responsible stewardship.   The following points must be taken into consideration:     The Fales Library will insure that the method of deaccession will result in furthering the agreed purpose of the deaccession, whether this be monetary gain or more appropriate placement of scholarly resources.      The Fales Library will disclose to the potential new owner or intermediary agent any action, such as the retention of a photocopy of the material, which may affect the monetary or scholarly value of the material.      To the fullest extent possible, the Fales Library will make public information on the disposition of deaccessioned materials.      The Fales Library will not allow materials from its collections to be acquired privately by any library employee, officer, or volunteer, unless they are sold publicly and with complete disclosure of their history.      Due consideration should be given to the library community in general when disposing of items. Sales to, or exchanges between, institutions will be explored as well as disposal through the trade.

Sales to, or exchanges between, institutions will be explored as well as disposal through the trade.     VIII. Other Resources   Because of its location within New York City, the Fales Library is complemented by several other major collections of rare materials and primary sources for the study of literature and the contemporary arts. Included among these other collections are the Pierpont Morgan Library, The New York Public Library, The Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Columbia University, The New-York Historical Society Library.   \u00a0"}, {"content": "Bulletin Course Descriptions | English | NYU                                               Back to Home           Printer Friendly                     Course Descriptions (GSAS Bulletin) Proseminars    Workshop on Professional Practices ENGL-GA 3980 Fitzpatrick, Parihk, Augst. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15.

We live in the era of Big Data, with storage and transmission capacity measured not just in terabytes but in petabytes (where peta -   denotes a quadrillion, or a thousand trillion). Data collection is   constant and even insidious, with every click and every \u201clike\u201d stored   somewhere for something. This book reminds us that data is anything but   \u201craw,\u201d that we shouldn\u2019t think of data as a natural resource but as a   cultural one that needs to be generated, protected, and interpreted. The   book\u2019s essays describe eight episodes in the history of data from the   predigital to the digital. Together they address such issues as the ways   that different kinds of data and different domains of inquiry are   mutually defining; how data are variously \u201ccooked\u201d in the processes of   their collection and use; and conflicts over what can\u2014or can\u2019t\u2014be   \u201creduced\u201d to data. Contributors discuss the intellectual history of data   as a concept; describe early financial modeling and some unusual   sources for astronomical data; discover the prehistory of the database   in newspaper clippings and index cards; and consider contemporary   \u201cdataveillance\u201d of our online habits as well as the complexity of   scientific data curation.

Williams Publisher's Page                        A Companion to the History of the English Language   By Haruko Momma (Co-edited with Michael Matto)   A Companion to the History of the English Language addresses the linguistic, cultural, social, and literary approaches to language study. The first text to offer a complete survey of the field, this volume provides the most up-to-date insights of leading international scholars. \u2022 An accessible reference to the history of the English language \u2022 Comprises more than sixty essays written by leading international scholars \u2022 Aids literature students in incorporating language study into their work \u2022 Includes an historical survey of the English language, from its Germanic and Indo- European beginnings to modern British and American English \u2022 Enriched with maps, diagrams, and illustrations from historical publications \u2022 Introduces the latest scholarship in the field    Publisher\u2019s page           Always Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture   By Lisa Gitelman   In Always Already New, Lisa Gitelman explores the newness of new media while she asks what it means to do media history. Using the examples of early recorded sound and digital networks, Gitelman challenges readers to think about the ways that media work as the simultaneous subjects and instruments of historical inquiry. Presenting original case studies of Edison's first phonographs and the Pentagon's first distributed digital network, the ARPANET, Gitelman points suggestively toward similarities that underlie the cultural definition of records (phonographic and not) at the end of the nineteenth century and the definition of documents (digital and not) at the end of the twentieth. As a result, Always Already New speaks to present concerns about the humanities as much as to the emergent field of new media studies. Records and documents are kernels of humanistic thought, after all\u2014part of and party to the cultural impulse to preserve and interpret. Gitelman's argument suggests inventive contexts for \"humanities computing\" while also offering a new perspective on such traditional humanities disciplines as literary history.    Making extensive use of archival sources, Gitelman describes the ways in which recorded sound and digitally networked text each emerged as local anomalies that were yet deeply embedded within the reigning logic of public life and public memory. In the end Gitelman turns to the World Wide Web and asks how the history of the Web is already being told, how the Web might also resist history, and how using the Web might be producing the conditions of its own historicity. Publisher\u2019s page           Ambiguities of Witnessing: Law and Literature in the Time of a Truth Commission   By Mark Sanders   The first book to explore the complex relationship between law and literature in testimony to crimes of apartheid before South Africa\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Ambiguities of Witnessing closely analyzes key individual testimonies. Whereas most existing books on this and other truth commissions are weighed down by abstract legal and philosophical discussion, this book does justice to witnesses\u2019 public testimony in a fascinating and theoretically sophisticated investigation of questions of human rights, mourning, forgiveness, and reparation. Framed by the personal, Ambiguities of Witnessing also meditates on what it means for the writer to respond to this epochal event in the history of post-apartheid South Africa.    Publisher\u2019s page           An Ethics of Betrayal: The Politics of Otherness in Emergent U.S. Literatures and Culture   By Crystal Parikh   In An Ethics of Betrayal, Crystal Parikh investigates the theme and tropes of betrayal and treason in Asian American and Chicano/Latino literary and cultural narratives. In considering betrayal from an ethical perspective, one grounded in the theories of Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida, Parikh argues that the minority subject is obligated in a primary, preontological, and irrecusable relation of responsibility to the Other. Episodes of betrayal and treason allegorize the position of this subject, beholden to the many others who embody the alterity of existence and whose demands upon the subject result in transgressions of intimacy and loyalty. In this first major comparative study of narratives by and about Asian Americans and Latinos, Parikh considers writings by Frank Chin, Gish Jen, Chang-rae Lee, Eric Liu, Am\u00e9rico Parades, and Richard Rodriguez, as well as narratives about the persecution of Wen Ho Lee and the rescue and return of Elian Gonz\u00e1lez. By addressing the conflicts at the heart of filiality, the public dimensions of language in the constitution of minority \"community,\" and the mercenary mobilizations of \"model minority\" status, An Ethics of Betrayal seriously engages the challenges of conducting ethnic and critical race studies based on the uncompromising and unromantic ideas of justice, reciprocity, and ethical society. Publisher\u2019s page            Antigone on the Contemporary World Stage   By Erin B. Mee (co-edited with Helene P. Foley)   Antigone on the Contemporary World Stage is the first book to analyse what happens to Sophocles' play as it is adapted and (re)produced around the world, and the first to focus specifically on Antigone in performance. The essays, by an international gathering of noted scholars from a wide range of disciplines, highlight the numerous ways in which social, political, historical, and cultural contexts transform the material, how artists and audiences in diverse societies including Argentina, The Congo, Finland, Haiti, India, Japan, and the United States interact with it, and the variety of issues it has been used to address.      Publisher's page                  Balladeering, Minstrelsy, and the Making of British Romantic Poetry   By Maureen N. McLane   This is a new history and theory of British poetry between 1760 and 1830, focusing on the relationship between Romantic poetry and the production, circulation, and textuality of ballads. By discussing the ways in which eighteenth-century cultural and literary researches flowed into and shaped key canonical works, Maureen McLane argues that Romantic poetry\u2019s influences went far beyond the merely literary. Breathing new life into the work of eighteenth-century balladeers and antiquarians, she addresses the revival of the ballad, the figure of the minstrel, and the prevalence of a \u201cminstrelsy complex\u201d in Romanticism. Furthermore, she envisages a new way of engaging with Romantic poetics, encompassing both \u201coral\u201d and \u201cliterary\u201d modes of poetic construction, and anticipates the role that technology might play in a media-driven twenty-first century. The study will be of great interest to scholars and students of Romantic poetry, literature, and culture.  Publisher\u2019s page           Citizen Shakespeare: Freemen and Aliens in the Language of the Plays   By John Michael Archer   Shakespeare lived his professional life amid the London streets and died a prominent figure in the town of Stratford. The language of his plays is shot through with the concerns of London \"freemen\" and their wives, the diverse commercial class that nevertheless excluded adult immigrants from country towns and northern Europe alike. This book combines London historiography, close reading, and recent theories of citizen subjectivity to demonstrate for the first time that Shakespeare's plays embody citizen and alien identities despite their aristocratic settings. The book points out where the city shadows the country scenes of the major comedies, shows how London's trades animate the \"civil butchery\" of the history plays, and explains why England's metropolis becomes the fractured Rome of tragedy.    Publisher\u2019s page           Course in General Linguistics   By Perry Meisel (translated by Wade Baskin and co-edited with Haun Saussy)   The founder of modern linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure inaugurated semiology, structuralism, and deconstruction and made possible the work of Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Lacan, thus enabling the development of French feminism, gender studies, New Historicism, and postcolonialism. Based on Saussure\u2019s lectures, Course in General Linguistics (1916) traces the rise and fall of the historical linguistics in which Saussure was trained, the synchronic or structural linguistics with which he replaced it, and the new look of diachronic linguistics that followed this change. Most important, Saussure presents the principles of a new linguistic science that includes the invention of semiology, or the theory of the \u201csignifier,\u201d the \u201csignified,\u201d and the \u201csign\u201d that they combine to produce.     This is the first critical edition of Course in General Linguistics to appear in English and restores Wade Baskin\u2019s original translation of 1959, in which the terms \u201csignifier\u201d and \u201csignified\u201d are introduced into English in this precise way. Baskin renders Saussure clearly and accessibly, allowing readers to experience his shift of the theory of reference from mimesis to performance and his expansion of poetics to include all media, including the life sciences and environmentalism. An introduction situates Saussure within the history of ideas and describes the history of scholarship that made Course in General Linguistics legendary. New endnotes enlarge Saussure\u2019s contexts to include literary criticism, cultural studies, and philosophy.        Publisher\u2019s page           Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation   By John Guillory   John Guillory challenges the most fundamental premises of the canon   debate by resituating the problem of canon formation in an entirely new   theoretical framework. The result is a book that promises to recast not   only the debate about the literary curriculum but also the controversy   over \"multiculturalism\" and the current \"crisis of the humanities.\"   Employing concepts drawn from Pierre Bourdieu's sociology, Guillory   argues that canon formation must be understood less as a question of the   representation of social groups than as a question of the distribution   of \"cultural capital\" in the schools, which regulate access to literacy,   to the practices of reading and writing. Publisher's Page           Culture in Camouflage: War, Empire, and Modern British Literature   By Patrick Deer   Culture in Camouflage aims to remap the history of British war culture by insisting on the centrality and importance of the literature of the Second World War. The book offers the first comprehensive account of the emergence of modern war culture, arguing that its exceptional forms and temporalities force us to reappraise British cultural modernity. The book explores how writers like Ford Madox Ford, Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, T.E. Lawrence, Winston Churchill,Elizabeth Bowen, Virginia Woolf, James Hanley, Rex Warner, Alexander Baron, Keith Douglas, Henry Green, and Graham Greene contested the dominant narratives of war projected by an enormously powerful and persuasive mass media and culture industry. Patrick Deer reads war literature as one element in an expanded cultural field, which also includes popular culture and mass communications, the productions of war planners and military historians, projections of new technologies of violence, the fantasies and theories of strategists, and the material culture of total war. Modern war cultures, Deer contends, are defined by their drive to normalize conflict and war-making, by their struggle to colonize the entire wartime cultural field, and by their claim to monopolize representations and interpretation of the conflict. But the mobilization of cultural formations during wartime reveals, at times glaringly, the constitutive contradictions at the heart of modern ideas of culture. The Great War failed to produce a popular war culture on the home front, producing instead an extraordinary literature of protest, yet the strategists struggled to regain their oversight over both the enemy across no man's land, and the minds and bodies of their own mass conscript armies. The interwar years saw a massive effort to make strategic fantasies a reality; if the technology of imperial air power or mobile armoured warfare did not yet exist, culture could be mobilized to shore up the ramshackle war machine. During World War Two a fully fledged British war culture emerged triumphant in time of national crisis, offering the vision of a fully mobilized island fortress, a loyal empire, and a modernized war machine ready to wage a futuristic war of space and movement. This was the struggle that British World War Two writers confronted with extraordinary courage and creativity.    Publisher\u2019s page           Digital Literary Studies: Corpus Approaches to Poetry, Prose, and Drama   By David L. Hoover, Jonathan Culpeper, and Kieran O'Halloran   Digital Literary Studies presents a broad and varied picture of the promise and potential of methods and approaches that are crucially dependent upon the digital nature of the literary texts it studies and the texts and collections of texts with which they are compared. It focuses on style, diction, characterization, and interpretation of single works and across larger groups of texts, using both huge natural language corpora and smaller, more specialized collections of texts created for specific tasks, and applies statistical techniques used in the narrower confines of authorship attribution to broader stylistic questions. It addresses important issues in each of the three major literary genres, and intentionally applies different techniques and concepts to poetry, prose, and drama. It aims to present a provocative and suggestive sample intended to encourage the application of these and other methods to literary studies.     Hoover, Culpeper, and O\u2019Halloran push the methods, techniques, and concepts in new directions, apply them to new groups of texts or to new questions, modify their nature or method of application, and combine them in innovative ways.      Publisher's page           Elinor James   By Paula McDowell   This volume makes available for the first time the complete surviving works of the London printer-author Elinor James (c.1645-1719). Uniquely in the history of early modern women, James wrote, printed and distributed more than ninety pamphlets and broadsides addressing political, religious and commercial concerns. Written over a period of 35 years, her works provide us with a running commentary on the major national events of a tumultuous period such as the Revolution of 1688, the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, and the Jacobite uprisings in 1715-16. During her lifetime, England saw the succession of six different monarchs. James petitioned all of them and claimed to have obtained audiences with three. In 1689 she was gaoled in Newgate prison, accused of disseminating seditious material condemning William III for accepting the English crown.    James's texts address a staggeringly broad range of concerns. She petitioned Parliament concerning legislation affecting the printing trades and petitioned fellow printers concerning labour relations in London printing houses. She petitioned City authorities on issues such as the enforcement of bylaws or who to vote for in City and parliamentary elections. It is hoped that by making available all of James's known works, this volume will inspire the collective efforts of scholars from many different disciplines to decipher her references to contemporary events, issues and persons, as well as prompting further discoveries of as yet unidentified works.    Publisher\u2019s page              Epic Traditions in the Contemporary World: The Poetics of Community   By Susanne Wofford (co-edited with Margaret Beissinger and Jane Tylus)   The epic tradition has been part of many different cultures throughout human history. This noteworthy collection of essays provides a comparative reassessment of epic and its role in the ancient, medieval, and modern worlds, as it explores the variety of contemporary approaches to the epic genre. Employing theoretical perspectives drawn from anthropology, literary studies, and gender studies, the authors examine familiar and less well known oral and literary traditions\u2014ancient Greek and Latin, Arabic, South Slavic, Indian, Native American, Italian, English, and Caribbean\u2014demonstrating the continuing vitality of the epic tradition.    Juxtaposing work on the traditional canon of western epics with scholarship on contemporary epics from various parts of the world, these essays cross the divide between oral and literary forms that has long marked the approach to the genre. With its focus on the links among narrative, politics, and performance, the collection creates a new dialogue illustrating the sociopolitical significance of the epic tradition. Taken together, the essays raise compelling new issues for the study of epic, as they examine concerns such as national identity, gender, pedagogy, and the creation of the canon.    Publisher\u2019s page           Feeling Beauty: The Neuroscience of Aesthetic Experience   By G. Gabrielle Starr                         In Feeling Beauty, G. Gabrielle Starr   argues that understanding the neural underpinnings of aesthetic   experience can reshape our conceptions of aesthetics and the arts.   Drawing on the tools of both cognitive neuroscience and traditional   humanist inquiry, Starr shows that neuroaesthetics offers a new model   for understanding the dynamic and changing features of aesthetic life,   the relationships among the arts, and how individual differences in   aesthetic judgment shape the varieties of aesthetic experience.     Starr, a scholar of the humanities and a researcher in the   neuroscience of aesthetics, proposes that aesthetic experience relies on   a distributed neural architecture\u2014a set of brain areas involved in   emotion, perception, imagery, memory, and language. More important, it   emerges from networked interactions, intricately connected and   coordinated brain systems that together form a flexible architecture   enabling us to develop new arts and to see the world around us   differently. Focusing on the \u201csister arts\u201d of poetry, painting, and   music, Starr builds and tests a neural model of aesthetic experience   valid across all the arts. Asking why works that address different   senses using different means seem to produce the same set of feelings,   she examines particular works of art in a range of media, including a   poem by Keats, a painting by van Gogh, a sculpture by Bernini, and   Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations. Starr\u2019s innovative, interdisciplinary   analysis is true to the complexities of both the physical instantiation   of aesthetics and the realities of artistic representation. Publisher's Page                        Fieldworks: From Place to Site in Postwar Poetics   By Lytle Shaw   Fieldworks offers a historical account of the social, rhetorical, and material attempts to ground art and poetry in the physicality of a site. Arguing that place-oriented inquiries allowed poets and artists to develop new, experimental models of historiography and ethnography, Lytle Shaw draws out the shifting terms of this practice from World War II to the present through a series of illuminating case studies. Beginning with the alternate national genealogies unearthed by William Carlos Williams in Paterson and Charles Olson in Gloucester, Shaw demonstrates how subsequent poets sought to ground such inquiries in concrete social formations\u2014to in effect live the poetics of place: Gary Snyder in his back-to-the-land familial compound, Kitkitdizze; Amiri Baraka in a black nationalist community in Newark; Robert Creeley and the poets of Bolinas, California, in the capacious \u201cnow\u201d of their poet-run town. Turning to the work of Robert Smithson\u2014who called one of his essays an \u201cappendix to Paterson,\u201d and who in turn has exerted a major influence on poets since the 1970s\u2014Shaw then traces the emergence of site-specific art in relation both to the poetics of place and to the larger linguistic turn in the humanities, considering poets including Clark Coolidge, Bernadette Mayer, and Lisa Robertson. By putting the poetics of place into dialog with site-specificity in art, Shaw demonstrates how poets and artists became experimental explicators not just of concrete locations and their histories, but of the discourses used to interpret sites more broadly. It is this dual sense of fieldwork that organizes Shaw\u2019s groundbreaking history of site-specific poetry. Publisher's Page           Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies   By Elizabeth McHenry   Over the past decade the popularity of black writers including E. Lynn Harris and Terry McMillan has been hailed as an indication that an active African American reading public has come into being. Yet this is not a new trend; there is a vibrant history of African American literacy, literary associations, and book clubs. Forgotten Readers reveals that neglected past, looking at the reading practices of free blacks in the antebellum north and among African Americans following the Civil War. It places the black upper and middle classes within American literary history, illustrating how they used reading and literary conversation as a means to assert their civic identities and intervene in the political and literary cultures of the United States from which they were otherwise excluded. Forgotten Readers expands our definition of literacy and urges us to think of literature as broadly as it was conceived of in the nineteenth century. Elizabeth McHenry delves into archival sources, including the records of past literary societies and the unpublished writings of their members. She examines particular literary associations, including the Saturday Nighters of Washington, D.C., whose members included Jean Toomer and Georgia Douglas Johnson. She shows how black literary societies developed, their relationship to the black press, and the ways that African American women\u2019s clubs\u2014which flourished during the 1890s\u2014encouraged literary activity. In an epilogue, McHenry connects this rich tradition of African American interest in books, reading, and literary conversation to contemporary literary phenomena such as Oprah Winfrey\u2019s book club. Forgotten Readers redirects contemporary thinking about the origins of African American literature and adds a vital element to scholarship on the history of the book. Publisher\u2019s page           Frank O&rsquo;Hara: The Poetics of Coterie   By Lytle Shaw   O\u2019Hara\u2019s poems are famously filled with proper names\u2014from those of his immediate friends and colleagues in the New York writing and art worlds (John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, Grace Hartigan, Willem de Kooning, and many musicians, dancers, and filmmakers) to a broad range of popular cultural and literary heroes (Apollinaire to Jackie O). But rather than understand O\u2019Hara\u2019s most commonly referenced names as a fixed and insular audience, Shaw argues that he uses the ambiguities of reference associated with the names to invent a fluid and shifting kinship structure\u2014one that opened up radical possibilities for a gay writer operating outside the structure of the family.    As Shaw demonstrates, this commitment to an experimental model of association also guides O\u2019Hara\u2019s art writing. Like his poetry, O\u2019Hara\u2019s art writing too has been condemned as insular, coterie writing. In fact, though, he was alone among 1950s critics in his willingness to consider abstract expressionism not only within the dominant languages of existentialism and formalism but also within the cold war political and popular cultural frameworks that anticipate many of the concerns of contemporary art historians. Situating O\u2019Hara within a range of debates about art\u2019s possible relations to its audience, Shaw demonstrates that his interest in coterie is less a symptomatic offshoot of his biography than a radical literary and artistic invention.    Publisher\u2019s page           From Philology to English Studies: Language and Culture in the Nineteenth Century   By Haruko Momma   The study of English language and literature in Britain changed dramatically between the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. From Philology to English Studies explores the contribution of philology to this evolution. Haruko Momma charts both the rise and fall of philology from antiquity to the late eighteenth century, and the impact of modern philology on the study of modern languages and literatures. Focusing in detail on the work of key philologists in the nineteenth century, Momma considers how they shaped European discourse and especially vernacular studies in Britain: William Jones' discovery of Sanskrit in British India gave rise to Indo-European studies; Max M\u00fcller's study of this same language helped spread the Aryan myth to the English-speaking world; the OED achieved its greatness as a post-national lexicon through the editorship of the Scottish dialectologist. Publisher's Page           Genres of the Credit Economy: Mediating Value in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Britain   By Mary Poovey   How did banking, borrowing, investing, and even losing money\u2014in other words, participating in the modern financial system\u2014come to seem like routine activities of everyday life? Genres of the Credit Economy addresses this question by examining the history of financial instruments and representations of finance in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain. Chronicling the process by which some of our most important conceptual categories were naturalized, Mary Poovey explores complex relationships among forms of writing that are not usually viewed together, from bills of exchange and bank checks, to realist novels and Romantic poems, to economic theory and financial journalism. Taking up all early forms of financial and monetary writing, Poovey argues that these genres mediated for early modern Britons the operations of a market system organized around credit and debt. By arguing that genre is a critical tool for historical and theoretical analysis and an agent in the events that formed the modern world, Poovey offers a new way to appreciate the character of the credit economy and demonstrates the contribution historians and literary scholars can make to understanding its operations. Much more than an exploration of writing on and around money, Genres of the Credit Economy offers startling insights about the evolution of disciplines and the separation of factual and fictional genres.    Publisher\u2019s page           Graffiti and the Writing Arts of Early Modern England   By Juliet Fleming   Graffiti and the Writing Arts of Early Modern England is an   excavation of a series of previously unknown or disregarded writing   practices. Our modern assumptions regarding written expression have   limited our examination of the history of writing and literacy to that   which has been preserved in print or manuscript. In a work of tremendous   originality and intellectual daring, Fleming brings detailed historical   scholarship into dialogue with the challenge of contemporary theory to   explore a lost realm where writing practices moved off the boundaries of   the page to fill windows, body surfaces, ceramics, ceilings, and walls. Developing   and drawing on an archive that has until now been closed to literary   scholars, Fleming argues that the whitewashed wall was the primary   writing apparatus of the early modern English, recovers the tattoo   practices of sixteenth-century Europeans, and demonstrates how to read   the poetic burden of early modern crockery. Her book is a work of   cultural history that provides a startling new perspective on early   modern writing, one that swerves from the preoccupations of generations   of scholars in order to transform the fundamental terms of literary   inquiry.

Publisher\u2019s page           Heart Beats: Everyday Life and the Memorized Poem   By Catherine Robson   Many people in Great Britain and the United States can recall elderly relatives who remembered long stretches of verse learned at school decades earlier, yet most of us were never required to recite in class. Heart Beats is the first book to examine how poetry recitation came to assume a central place in past curricular programs, and to investigate when and why the once-mandatory exercise declined. Telling the story of a lost pedagogical practice and its wide-ranging effects on two sides of the Atlantic, Catherine Robson explores how recitation altered the ordinary people who committed poems to heart, and changed the worlds in which they lived. Heart Beats begins by investigating recitation's progress within British and American public educational systems over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and weighs the factors that influenced which poems were most frequently assigned. Robson then scrutinizes the recitational fortunes of three short works that were once classroom classics: Felicia Hemans's \"Casabianca,\" Thomas Gray's \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,\" and Charles Wolfe's \"Burial of Sir John Moore after Corunna.\" To conclude, the book considers W. E. Henley's \"Invictus\" and Rudyard Kipling's \"If--,\" asking why the idea of the memorized poem arouses such different responses in the United States and Great Britain today. Focusing on vital connections between poems, individuals, and their communities, Heart Beats is an important study of the history and power of memorized poetry. Publisher's Page           Heartbreakers: Women and Violence in Contemporary Culture and Literature   By Josephine Gattuso Hendin   From   Medea to Goneril to Sharon Stone's ice-pick murderer, the violent woman   has fascinated readers and audiences. Josephine Hendin looks at this   figure and argues that a violent woman is a grenade pitched toward both   conservative and liberal views of women.                                 Publisher's Page           How Soon is Now? Medieval Texts, Amateur Readers, and The Queerness of Time   By Carolyn Dinshaw   How Soon Is Now? performs a powerful critique of modernist temporal regimes through its revelatory exploration of queer ways of being in time as well as of the potential queerness of time itself. Carolyn Dinshaw focuses on medieval tales of asynchrony and on engagements with these medieval temporal worlds by amateur readers centuries later. In doing so, she illuminates forms of desirous, embodied being that are out of sync with ordinarily linear measurements of everyday life, that involve multiple temporalities, that precipitate out of time altogether. Dinshaw claims the possibility of a fuller, denser, more crowded now that theorists tell us is extant but that often eludes our temporal grasp. Whether discussing Victorian men of letters who parodied the Book of John Mandeville, a fictionalized fourteenth-century travel narrative, or Hope Emily Allen, modern coeditor of the early-fifteenth-century Book of Margery Kempe, Dinshaw argues that these and other medievalists outside the academy inhabit different temporalities than modern professionals operating according to the clock. How Soon Is Now? clears space for amateurs, hobbyists, and dabblers who approach medieval worlds from positions of affect and attachment, from desires to build other kinds of worlds. Unruly, untimely, they urge us toward a disorderly and asynchronous collective Publisher's page           Imaginary Worlds in Medieval Books: Exploring the Manuscript Matrix   By Martha Rust   This book envisions the confines of medieval manuscripts as the potential territory of many virtual worlds: realms that readers call forth through their imaginative interactions with a book\u2019s material features. Each component of a medieval manuscript--its alphabetical characters, pages, images, text, gloss--offers an avenue of involvement with the world of books, and with the worldsin books. The explorations presented here follow those paths in a selection of manuscripts and texts produced in late-medieval Britain, tracing the fortunes of characters who become subject to and sometimes subjects in the very books the read and write.    Publisher\u2019s page           In Visible Movement   By Tom&aacute;s Urayo&aacute;n Noel   The first book-length study specifically devoted to Nuyorican poetry, In Visible Movement    is unique in its historical and formal breadth, ranging from the   foundational poets of the 1960s and 1970s to a variety of contemporary   poets emerging in and around the Nuyorican Poets Cafe \u201cslam\u201d scene of   the 1990s and early 2000s. It also unearths a largely unknown corpus of   poetry performances, reading over forty years of Nuyorican poetry at the   intersection of the printed and performed word, underscoring the   poetry\u2019s links to vernacular and Afro-Puerto Rican performance cultures,   from the island\u2019s oral poets to the New York sounds and rhythms of   Latin boogaloo, salsa, and hip-hop. With depth and insight, Urayo\u00e1n Noel   analyzes various canonical Nuyorican poems by poets such as Pedro   Pietri, Victor Hern\u00e1ndez Cruz, Miguel Algar\u00edn, Miguel Pi\u00f1ero, Sandra   Mar\u00eda Esteves, and Tato Laviera. He discusses historically overlooked   poets such as Lorraine Sutton, innovative poets typically read outside   the Nuyorican tradition such as Frank Lima and Edwin Torres, and a   younger generation of Nuyorican-identified poets including Willie   Perdomo, Mar\u00eda Teresa Mariposa Fern\u00e1ndez, and Emanuel Xavier, whose work   has received only limited critical consideration. The result is a   stunning reflection of how New York Puerto Rican poets have addressed   the complexity of identity amid diaspora for over forty years.           Land/Scape/Theater   By Una Chaudhuri (Co-edited with Elinor Fuchs)   Land/Scape/Theater proposes landscape as a necessary paradigm for understanding modern theater's increasingly spatialized aesthetic as well as its engagement with the cultural meanings of place and space.    Embracing subjects as diverse as the \"landscape dramaturgy\" of Suzan-Lori Parks, Artaud's trip to the Sierra Madre,Gertrude Stein's landscape theory and practice, Guillermo Gomez-Pe\u00f1a's \"border subjects,\" and Bayreuth and Disneyland as cultic sites, Land/Scape/Theater draws on a broad range of theory, dramatic texts, and performance. All aspects of modern theater, these essays suggest, including the bedrock Aristotelian constituents of plot and character, have a landscape dimension that often goes unrecognized.    With its broad theoretical range and cross-disciplinary reach, Land/Scape/Theater will interest theater theorists and practitioners and cultural studies specialists, including historians of landscape. Theater students, scholars, teachers, directors, designers, and actors will find here a new framework and a new vocabulary for understanding both theater and the larger culture.    Publisher\u2019s page           London Calling: How Black and Asian Writers Imagined a City   By Sukhdev Sandhu   From the 11th century, when one commentator claimed the capital was being over-run with Moors, to the garage MCs and street poets of today \u2013 this book tells the story of life in London for black and Asian people from the seventeenth century until today. London Calling tells the story of black and Asian literary London, tracing the escapades, fortune making, and self-expansion of these forgotten writers. It is a joyful and often rapturous work, a love letter to the capital, a teeming and complex mix of social and cultural history seen through the imagination and experience of great black and Asian writers. London Calling gets to the heart of the immigration impulse, and evokes the dreams and adventures of those who have sought refuge and asylum in the cradle of Empire. The book is populated by runaway slaves, lotharios, imams, boxer-pimps, rajahs and colonial revolutionaries, and discusses writers as diverse in style and time as the 18th-century grocer-aesthete Ignatius Sancho right through to Rushdie, Kureishi and yardie chronicler Victor Headley. The result is an exciting work, brimming with life, as it spotlights a rich but neglected literary tradition, and brings to life a gaping void in the city's history. Placing the multiculturalism of today's capital in its historical context, Sukhdev Sandhu shows that it is no new phenomenon, and that just as London has been the making of many black writers, they too have been the making of London.    Publisher's page           Lyric Generations: Poetry and the Novel in the Long Eighteenth Century   By Gabrielle Starr   Eighteenth\u2014century British literary history is traditionally characterized by two central and seemingly discrete movements: the rise of the novel and the development of Romantic lyric poetry. In fact, recent scholarship reveals that these genres are inextricably bound: constructions of interiority developed in novels changed ideas about what literature could mean and do, encouraging the new focus on private experience and self\u2014perception developed in lyric poetry.    In Lyric Generations Gabrielle Starr rejects the usual genealogy of lyric poetry in which Romantic poets are thought to have built solely and directly upon the works of Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton. She argues instead that novelists such as Richardson, Haywood, Behn and others, while drawing upon earlier lyric conventions, ushered in a new language of self\u2014expression and community that profoundly affected the aesthetic goals of lyric poets. Examining the works of Cowper, Smith, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats in light of their competitive dialogue with the novel, Starr advances a literary history that considers formal characteristics as products of historical change. In a world increasingly defined by prose, poets adapted the new forms, characters, and moral themes of the novel in order to reinvigorate poetic practice. Publisher\u2019s page           Men in Wonderland: The Lost Girlhood of the Victorian Gentleman   By Catherine Robson   Fascination with little girls pervaded Victorian culture. For many, girls represented the true essence of childhood or bygone times of innocence; but for middle-class men, especially writers, the interest ran much deeper. In Men in Wonderland, Catherine Robson explores the ways in which various nineteenth-century British male authors constructed girlhood, and analyzes the nature of their investment in the figure of the girl. In so doing, she reveals the link between the idealization of little girls and a widespread fantasy of male development--a myth suggesting that men become masculine only after an initial feminine stage, lived out in the protective environment of the nursery. Little girls, argues Robson, thus offer an adult male the best opportunity to reconnect with his own lost self.    Tracing the beginnings of this myth in the writings of Romantics Wordsworth and De Quincey, Robson identifies the consolidation of this paradigm in numerous Victorian artifacts, ranging from literary works by Dickens and Barrett Browning, to paintings by Frith and Millais, to reports of the Royal Commission on Children's Employment. She analyzes Ruskin and Carroll's \"high noon\" of girl worship and investigates the destruction of the fantasy in the closing decades of the century, when social concerns about the working girl sexualized the image of young females.    Men in Wonderland contributes to a growing interest in the nineteenth century's construction of childhood, sexuality, and masculinity, and illuminates their complex interconnections with a startlingly different light. Not only does it complicate the narratives of pedophilic desire that are generally used to explain figures like Ruskin and Carroll, but it offers a new understanding of the Victorian era's obsession with loss, its rampant sentimentality, and its intense valorization of the little girl at the expense of mature femininity.    Publisher\u2019s page           Middle English Literature: A Cultural History   By Christopher Cannon   Polity, 2008. This book provides a boldly original account of Middle English literature from the Norman Conquest to the beginning of the sixteenth century. It argues that these centuries are, in fundamental ways, the momentous period in our literary history, for they are the long moment in which the category of literature itself emerged as English writing began to insist, for the first time, that it floated free of any social reality or function. This book also charts the complex mechanisms by which English writing acquired this power in a series of linked close readings of both canonical and more obscure texts. It encloses those readings in five compelling accounts of much broader cultural areas, describing, in particular, the productive relationship of Middle English writing to medieval technology, insurgency, statecraft and cultural place, concluding with an in depth account of the particular arguments, emphases and techniques English writers used to claim a wholly new jurisdiction for their work. Both this history and its readings are everywhere informed by the most exciting developments in recent Middle English scholarship as well as literary and cultural theory. It serves as an introduction to all these areas as well as a contribution, in its own right, to each of them. Publisher\u2019s page           Modernisms: A Literary Guide   By Peter Nicholls   University of California, 2009. The recent enthusiasm for things postmodern has often produced a caricature of Modernism as monolithic and reactionary. Peter Nicholls argues instead that the distinctive feature of Modernism is its diversity. Through a lively analysis of each of Modernism's main literary movements, he explores the connections between the new stylistic developments and the shifting politics of gender and authority.\u2028\u2028Nicholls introduces a wealth of literary experimentation, beginning with Baudelaire and Mallarm\u00e9 and moving forward to the first avant-gardes. Close readings of key texts monitor the explosive histories of Futurism, Expressionism, Cubism, Dada, and Surrealism, histories that allow Anglo-American Modernism to be seen in a strikingly different light. In revealing Modernism's broad and varied terrain, Nicholls evokes the richness of a cultural moment that continues to shape our own. Publisher\u2019s page           My Poets   By Maureen N. McLane   \u201cOh! there are spirits of the air,\u201d wrote Percy Bysshe Shelley. In this stunningly original book, Maureen N. McLane channels the spirits and voices that make up the music in one poet\u2019s mind. Weaving criticism and memoir, My Poets explores a life reading and a life read. McLane invokes not necessarily the best poets, nor the most important poets (whoever these might be), but those writers who, in possessing her, made her. \u201cI am marking here what most marked me,\u201d she writes. Ranging from Chaucer to H.D. to William Carlos Williams to Louise Gl\u00fcck to Shelley (among others), McLane tracks the \u201cgrowth of a poet\u2019s mind,\u201d as Wordsworth put it in The Prelude. In poetical prose both probing and incantatory, McLane has written a radical book of experimental criticism. Susan Sontag called for an \u201cerotics of interpretation\u201d: this is it. Part Bildung, part dithyramb, part exegesis, My Poets extends an implicit invitation to you, dear reader, to consider who your \u201cmy poets,\u201d or \u201cmy novelists,\u201d or \u201cmy filmmakers,\u201d or \u201cmy pop stars,\u201d might be. Publisher's Page           Negative Liberties: Morrison, Pynchon, and the Problem of Liberal Ideology   By Cyrus R. K. Patell   Since the nineteenth century, ideas centered on the individual, on Emersonian self-reliance, and on the right of the individual to the pursuit of happiness have had a tremendous presence in the United States\u2014and even more so after the Reagan era. But has this presence been for the good of all? In Negative Liberties Cyrus R. K. Patell revises important ideas in the debate about individualism and the political theory of liberalism. He does so by adding two new voices to the current discussion\u2014Toni Morrison and Thomas Pynchon\u2014to examine the different ways in which their writings embody, engage, and critique the official narrative generated by U.S. liberal ideology.    Pynchon and Morrison reveal the official narrative of individualism as encompassing a complex structure of contradiction held in abeyance. This narrative imagines that the goals of the individual are not at odds with the goals of the family or society and in fact obscures the existence of an unholy truce between individual liberty and forms of oppression. By bringing these two fiction writers into a discourse dominated by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Isaiah Berlin, John Rawls, George Kateb, Robert Bellah, and Michael Sandel, Patell unmasks the ways in which contemporary U.S. culture has not fully shed the oppressive patterns of reasoning handed down by the slaveholding culture from which American individualism emerged. With its interdisciplinary approach, Negative Liberties will appeal to students and scholars of American literature, culture, sociology, and politics.    Publisher\u2019s page           Nineteenth-Century Lives   By Laurence S. Lockridge   In Nineteenth-Century Lives ten distinguished critics and biographers consider what it means to narrate a life. Their illustrative texts are largely taken from nineteenth-century biography, autobiography and the novel, but narrative is the broader genre that unites their various inquiries. The principal issues, theoretical and practical, are framed by Margaret Atwood, J. Hillis Miller and Phyllis Rose. 'The biographer, like the novelist, is a constructor of narratives; it's just that the ground rules are a little different,' writes Atwood. Among the matters they debate are the boundaries of fact and fiction, the professed power of the narrator, and the figurative underpinings of autobiography. But many of these essays are delightful and provocative biographical and autobiographical excursions in themselves. Atwood describes her early fear of biography, Morton Cohen narrates an exciting bit of detective work into the life of Lewis Carroll, and John Rosenberg gives a vivid and frequently revisionary reading of many aspects of Darwin's life. Other critics - Carl Woodring, Richard Altick, Norman Kelvin, Margaret Stetz, and Robert Kiely - consider related topics: the autobiographical poem as Bildungsroman, the nineteenth-century art biography, the relationship of William Morris's life to the structural principles of his art, the guilt-ridden fiction of the 1890s, and a seemingly marginal character in fiction, the 'nobody'.    Publisher\u2019s page           On Eloquence   By Denis Donoghue   On Eloquence questions the common assumption that eloquence is merely a subset of rhetoric, a means toward a rhetorical end. Denis Donoghue, an eminent and prolific critic of the English language, holds that this assumption is erroneous. While rhetoric is the use of language to persuade people to do one thing rather than another, Donoghue maintains that eloquence is \u201cgratuitous, ideally autonomous, in speech and writing an upsurge of creative vitality for its own sake.\u201d He offers many instances of eloquence in words, and suggests the forms our appreciation of them should take.    Donoghue argues persuasively that eloquence matters, that we should indeed care about it. \u201cBecause we should care about any instances of freedom, independence, creative force, sprezzatura,\u201d he says, \u201cespecially when we live\u2014perhaps this is increasingly the case\u2014in a culture of the same, featuring official attitudes, stereotypes of the officially enforced values, sedated language, a politics of pacification.\u201d A noteworthy addition to Donoghue\u2019s long-term project to reclaim a disinterested appreciation of literature as literature, this volume is a wise and pleasurable meditation on eloquence, its unique ability to move or give pleasure, and its intrinsic value. Publisher\u2019s page           Plague Writing in Early Modern England   By Ernest B. Gilman   University of Chicago, 2009. During the seventeenth century, England was beset by three epidemics of the bubonic plague, each outbreak claiming between a quarter and a third of the population of London and other urban centers. Surveying a wide range of responses to these epidemics\u2014sermons, medical tracts, pious exhortations, satirical pamphlets, and political commentary\u2014Plague Writing in Early Modern England brings to life the many and complex ways Londoners made sense of such unspeakable devastation. Ernest B. Gilman argues that the plague writing of the period attempted unsuccessfully to rationalize the catastrophic and that its failure to account for the plague as an instrument of divine justice fundamentally threatened the core of Christian belief. Gilman also trains his critical eye on the works of Jonson, Donne, Pepys, and Defoe, which, he posits, can be more fully understood when put into the context of this century-long project to \u201cwrite out\u201d the plague. Ultimately, Plague Writing in Early Modern England is more than a compendium of artifacts of a bygone era; it holds up a distant mirror to reflect our own condition in the age of AIDS, super viruses, multidrug resistant tuberculosis, and the hovering threat of a global flu pandemic. Publisher's page           Private Affairs: Critical Ventures in the Culture of Social Relations   By Phillip Brian Harper   In Private Affairs, Phillip Brian Harper explores the social and cultural significance of the private, proposing that, far from a universal right, privacy is limited by one's racial-and sexual-minority status. Ranging across cinema, literature, sculpture, and lived encounters-from Rodin's The Kiss to Jenny Livingston's Paris is Burning-Private Affairs demonstrates how the very concept of privacy creates personal and sociopolitical hierarchies in contemporary America. Publisher\u2019s page           Republic of Intellect: The Friendly Club of New York City and the Making of American Literature   By Bryan Waterman   In the 1790s, a single conversational circle -- the Friendly Club -- united New York City's most ambitious young writers, and in Republic of Intellect, Bryan Waterman uses an innovative blend of literary criticism and historical narrative to re\u2014create the club's intellectual culture. The story of the Friendly Club reveals the mutually informing conditions of authorship, literary association, print culture, and production of knowledge in a specific time and place -- the tumultuous, tenuous world of post\u2014revolutionary New York City. More than any similar group in the early American republic, the Friendly Club occupied a crossroads -- geographical, professional, and otherwise -- of American literary and intellectual culture.    Waterman argues that the relationships among club members' novels, plays, poetry, diaries, legal writing, and medical essays lead to important first examples of a distinctively American literature and also illuminate the local, national, and transatlantic circuits of influence and information that club members called \"the republic of intellect.\" He addresses topics ranging from political conspiracy in the gothic novels of Charles Brockden Brown to the opening of William Dunlap's Park Theatre, from early American debates on gendered conversation to the publication of the first American medical journal. Voluntary association and print culture helped these young New Yorkers, Waterman concludes, to produce a broader and more diverse post\u2014revolutionary public sphere than scholars have yet recognized. Publisher\u2019s page           Securing the Commonwealth: Debt, Speculation, and Writing in the Making of Early America   By Jennifer J. Baker   Securing the Commonwealth examines how eighteenth\u2014century American writers understood the highly speculative financial times in which they lived. Spanning a century of cultural and literary life, this study shows how the era's literature commonly depicted an American ethos of risk taking and borrowing as the peculiar product of New World daring and the exigencies of revolution and nation building.    Some of the century's most important writers, including Cotton Mather, Benjamin Franklin, Royall Tyler, Charles Brockden Brown, and Judith Sargent Murray, believed that economic and social commonwealth -- and one's commitment to that commonwealth -- might be grounded in indebtedness and financial insecurity. These writers believed a cash\u2014poor colony or nation could not only advance itself through borrowing but also gain reputability each time it successfully paid off a loan. Equally important, they believed that debt could promote communality: precarious public credit structures could exact popular commitment; intricate financial networks could bind individuals to others and to their government; and indebtedness itself could evoke sympathy for the suffering of others.    Close readings of their literary works reveal how these writers imagined that public life might be shaped by economic experience, and how they understood the public life of literature itself. Insecure times strengthened their conviction that writing could be publicly serviceable, persuading readers to invest in their government, in their fellow Americans, and in the idea of America itself.    Publisher\u2019s page           The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Women's Writing   By Carolyn Dinshaw (Co-edited with David Wallace)   The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Women's Writing seeks to recover the lives and particular experiences of medieval women by concentrating on various kinds of texts: the texts they wrote themselves as well as texts that attempted to shape, limit, or expand their lives. The first section investigates the roles traditionally assigned to medieval women (as virgins, widows, and wives); it also considers female childhood and relations between women. The second section explores social spaces, including textuality itself: for every surviving medieval manuscript bespeaks collaborative effort. It considers women as authors, as anchoresses 'dead to the world', and as preachers and teachers in the world staking claims to authority without entering a pulpit. The final section considers the lives and writings of remarkable women, including Marie de France, Heloise, Joan of Arc, Julian of Norwich, Margery Kempe, and female lyricists and romancers whose names are lost, but whose texts survive.    Publisher\u2019s page           The Clerk's Tale: Young Men and Moral Life in Nineteenth-Century America   By Thomas Augst   Thousands of men left their families for the bustling cities of nineteenth-century America, where many of them found work as clerks. The Clerk's Tale recounts their remarkable story, describing the struggle of aspiring businessmen to come of age at the dawn of the modern era. How did these young men understand the volatile world of American capitalism and make sense of their place within it?    Thomas Augst follows clerks as they made their way through the boarding houses, parlors, and offices of the big city. Tracing the course of their everyday lives, Augst shows how these young men used acts of reading and writing to navigate the anonymous world of market culture and claim identities for themselves within it. Clerks, he reveals, calculated their prospects in diaries, composed detailed letters to friends and family, attended lectures by key thinkers of the day, joined libraries where they consumed fiction, all while wrestling with the boredom of their work. What results, then, is a poignant look at the literary practices of ordinary people and an affecting meditation on the moral lives of men in antebellum America.    Publisher\u2019s page           The Idea of English Ethnicity   By Robert J.C. Young   In this major contribution to debates about English identity, leading theorist Robert J.C. Young argues that Englishness was never really about England at all. In the nineteenth century, it was rather developed as a form of long-distance identity for the English diaspora around the world. Young shows how the effects of this continue to reverberate today, nationally and globally. Publisher\u2019s page           The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel   By Elaine Freedgood   While the Victorian novel famously describes, catalogs, and inundates the reader with things, the protocols for reading it have long enjoined readers not to interpret most of what crowds its pages. The Ideas in Things explores apparently inconsequential objects in popular Victorian texts to make contact with their fugitive meanings. Developing an innovative approach to analyzing nineteenth-century fiction, Elaine Freedgood here reconnects the things readers unwittingly ignore to the stories they tell.    Building her case around objects from three well-known Victorian novels\u2014the mahogany furniture in Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s Jane Eyre, the calico curtains in Elizabeth Gaskell\u2019s Mary Barton, and \u201cNegro head\u201d tobacco in Charles Dickens\u2019s Great Expectations\u2014Freedgood argues that these things are connected to histories that the novels barely acknowledge, generating darker meanings outside the novels\u2019 symbolic systems. A valuable contribution to the new field of object studies in the humanities, The Ideas in Things pushes readers\u2019 thinking about things beyond established concepts of commodity and fetish. Publisher\u2019s page           The New Asian City: Three-Dimensional Fictions of Space and Urban Form   By Jini Kim Watson     Under Jini Kim Watson\u2019s scrutiny, the Asian Tiger metropolises of Seoul,   Taipei, and Singapore reveal a surprising residue of the colonial   environment. Drawing on a wide array of literary, filmic, and political   works, and juxtaposing close readings of the built environment, Watson   demonstrates how processes of migration and construction in the   hypergrowth urbanscapes of the Pacific Rim crystallize the psychic and   political dramas of their colonized past and globalized present.   Tracing the way newly constructed spaces\u2014including expressways,   high-rises, factory zones, and department stores\u2014become figured within   cultural texts, The New Asian City explores how urban   transformations were rationalized, perceived, and fictionalized. Watson   shows how literature, film, and poetry have described and challenged   contemporary Asian metropolises, especially around the formation of   gendered and laboring subjects in these new spaces. She suggests that by   embracing the postwar growth-at-any-cost imperative, they have   buttressed the nationalist enterprise along neocolonial lines.       The New Asian City provides an innovative approach to how we   might better understand the gleaming metropolises of the Pacific Rim. In   doing so, it demonstrates how reading cultural production in   conjunction with built environments can enrich our knowledge of the   lived consequences of rapid economic and urban development. Publisher's page           The Scandal of the State: Women, Law, and Citizenship in Postcolonial India   By Rajeswari Sunder Rajan   The Scandal of the State is a revealing study of the relationship between the postcolonial, democratic Indian nation-state and Indian women\u2019s actual needs and lives. Well-known for her work combining feminist theory and postcolonial studies, Rajeswari Sunder Rajan shows how the state is central to understanding women\u2019s identities and how, reciprocally, women and \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d affect the state\u2019s role and function. She argues that in India law and citizenship define for women not only the scope of political rights but also cultural identity and everyday life. Sunder Rajan delineates the postcolonial state in implicit contrast with the \u201cenlightened,\u201d postfeminist neoliberal state in the West. Her analysis wrestles with complex social realities, taking into account the influence of age, ethnicity, religion, and class on individual and group identities as well as the shifting, heterogeneous nature of the state itself. The Scandal of the State develops through a series of compelling case studies, each of which centers around an incident exposing the contradictory position of the Indian state vis-\u00e0-vis its female citizens and, ultimately, the inadequacy of its commitment to women\u2019s rights. Sunder Rajan focuses on the custody battle over a Muslim child bride, the compulsory sterilization of mentally retarded women in state institutional care, female infanticide in Tamilnadu, prostitution as labor rather than crime, and the surrender of the female outlaw Phoolan Devi. She also looks at the ways the Uniform Civil Code presented many women with a stark choice between allegiance to their religion and community or the secular assertion of individual rights. Rich with theoretical acumen and activist passion, The Scandal of the State is a powerful critique of the mutual dependence of women and the state on one another in the specific context of a postcolonial modernity. Publisher\u2019s page           The Story of A: The Alphabetization of America from The New England Primer to The Scarlet Letter   By Patricia Crain   Richly illustrated with often antic images from alphabet books and primers, The Story of A relates the history of the alphabet as a genre of text for children and of alphabetization as a social practice in America, from early modern reading primers to the literature of the American Renaissance.   Offering a poetics of alphabetization and explicating the alphabet's tropes and rhetorical strategies, the author demonstrates the far-reaching cultural power of such apparently neutral statements as \u201cA is for apple.\u201d The new market for children's books in the eighteenth century established for the \u201crepublic of ABC\u201d a cultural potency equivalent to its high-culture counterpart, the \u201crepublic of letters,\u201d while shaping its child-readers into consumers. As a central rite of socialization, alphabetization schooled children to conflicting expectations, as well as to changing models of authority, understandings of the world, and uses of literature.   In the nineteenth century, literacy became a crucial aspect of American middle-class personality and subjectivity. Furnishing the readers and writers needed for a national literature, the alphabetization of America between 1800 and 1850 informed the sentimental-reform novel as well as the self-consciously aesthetic novel of the 1850s. Through readings of conduct manuals, reading primers, and a sentimental bestseller, the author shows how the alphabet became embedded in a maternal narrative, which organized the world through domestic affections.   Nathaniel Hawthorne, by contrast, insisted on the artificiality of the alphabet and its practices in his antimimetic, hermetic The Scarlet Letter, with its insistent focus on the letter A. By understanding this novel as part of the network of alphabetization, The Story of A accounts for its uniquely persistent cultural role. The author concludes, in an epilogue, with a reading of postmodern alphabets and their implications for the future of literacy.   Publisher\u2019s page           The Work of Writing: Literature and Social Change 1700-1830   By Clifford Siskin   \"The Work of Writing is a deeply mature piece of scholarship involving dozens upon dozens of authors from all over the long eighteenth century. Not only is its sense of the 'textual' very broad, ranging from literature, to philosophy (which, Siskin argues, once occupied the disciplinary space that Literature does today), to economics and sociology, but in requiring that we wake up and think about enlightenment processes of cultural formation, it is itself exemplary of that process. Thinking very hard and on every page, it passes its own test in an exhilarating manner.\" -- Stuart Curran, University of Pennsylvania    \"The Work of Writing establishes Cliff Siskin as one of our most subtle and theoretically sophisticated scholars of Romantic cultural studies and the New Historicism. This book, breath\u2014taking in its range, documents the growing professionalisation of writing in England in the eighteenth\u2014century, as well as the ways in which both nationalist and entrepreneurial impulses worked to exclude women writers from the new category of 'professional writer' in the nineteenth century.\" -- Anne K. Mellor, University of California, Los Angeles Publisher\u2019s page           This Is Enlightenment   By Clifford Siskin (co-edited with William Warner)   Debates about the nature of the Enlightenment date to the eighteenth century, when Imanual Kant himself addressed the question, \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d The contributors to this ambitious book offer a paradigm-shifting answer to that now-famous query: Enlightenment is an event in the history of mediation. Enlightenment, they argue, needs to be engaged within the newly broad sense of mediation introduced here\u2014not only oral, visual, written, and printed media, but everything that intervenes, enables, supplements, or is simply in between. With essays addressing infrastructure and genres, associational practices and protocols, this volume establishes mediation as the condition of possibility for enlightenment. In so doing, it not only answers Kant\u2019s query; it also poses its own broader question: how would foregrounding mediation change the kinds and areas of inquiry in our own epoch? This Is Enlightenment is a landmark volume with the polemical force and archival depth to start a conversation that extends across the disciplines that the Enlightenment itself first configured. Publisher's page           Untouchable Fictions: Literary Realism and the Crisis of Caste   By Toral Jatin Gajarawala   Untouchable Fictions considers the crisis of literary realism- progressive, rural, regionalist, experimental- in order to derive a literary genealogy for the recent explosion of Dalit (\u201cuntouchable\u201d caste) fiction. Drawing on a wide array of fiction from Premchand and Renu in Hindi to Mulk Raj Anand and V.S. Naipaul in English, Gajarawala illuminates the dark side of realist complicity: a hidden aesthetics and politics of caste. How does caste color the novel? What are its formal tendencies? What generic constraints does it produce? Untouchable Fictions juxtaposes the Dalit text, and its radical critique, with a history of progressive literary movements in South Asia. Gajarawala reads Dalit writing dialectically, doing justice to its unique and groundbreaking literary interventions while also demanding that it be read as an integral moment in the literary genealogy of the 20th and 21st century. How might we trace the origins of the rise of Dalit fiction in the critical \u201crealism\u201d of the Progressive Writers Association of the 1930s, or in the gaps laid bare by the peasant novel of the 1950s? And what kind of dialogue does \u201cuntouchable caste\u201d writing with its more famous counterpart: the Anglophone fiction of the last few decades? Under Gajarawala\u2019s lens the aesthetic languages of Hindi and English are intertwined and caste becomes a central category of literary analysis. This book, grounded in the fields of postcolonial theory, South Asian literatures, and cultural studies will be important for all readers interested in the problematic relations between aesthetics and politics, between social movements and cultural production. Engaged as it is with contemporary theories of realism and the problem of aesthetics, it would also be of interest to students of English, comparative literature, contemporary Third World literature, and historians of literary movements. More specifically, as a text that considers recent developments in genre theory and South Asian fiction, it would interest scholars of the Indian and Indian Anglophone novel. Finally, this project, as an interrogation of caste politics in the cultural sphere, is an important contribution to the burgeoning field of Dalit studies. Publisher's Page           Victorian Discourses on Sexuality and Religion   By John Maynard   John Maynard's original and provocative study looks at sexuality and religion as creations of language, in the literary and cultural discourses of Victorian England. After a wide-ranging introduction (drawing on myth, anthropology, comparative religion and the history of sexuality) Maynard goes on to articulate and interpret the strikingly complex and varied ways in which the earnest sceptic Arthur Hugh Clough, the Protestant Charles Kingsley, and the Catholic convert Coventry Patmore placed the relation of sexuality and religion at the centre of their work. A final chapter on Jude the Obscure demonstrates Thomas Hardy's deconstruction of the endeavour to make sense of sexuality and religion, fragmenting this inherited discourse into mere words and bodily parts, in a disintegration of the great constructive vision of his predecessors.

Gladstein and Dara Rossman Regaignon   Writing Program Administration at Small Liberal Arts Colleges   presents an empirical study of the writing programs at one hundred   small, private liberal arts colleges. Jill M. Gladstein and Dara Rossman   Regaignon provide detailed information about a type of writing program   not often highlighted in the scholarly record and offer a model for such   national, multi-institutional research. Utilizing the mixed methods   approach of grounded theory, Gladstein and Regaignon weave together   survey, interview, and focus group data, site document analysis, and   institutional history. They describe the writing programs at small   colleges today as being dominated by writing across the curriculum-based   approaches to writing instruction and the writing centers as   emphasizing peer tutoring, and hence the development of undergraduate   students as leaders and scholars. For small colleges, the movement   toward vertical writing curricula, professionalized leadership   positions, and innovative writing assessments occurs when institutions   deepen or reaffirm their commitment to writing across the curriculum. In   addition, Writing Program Administration at Small Liberal Arts Colleges offers a heuristic for understanding and comparing writing programs within and across institutions.
