The program began on Monday, January 27\u2014the first day of classes of the Spring 2014 semester\u2014with free shuttle vans running between 715 Broadway in Manhattan and 6 MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn. The vans operate as Route A and run midday, Mondays through Thursdays, starting at 10:15 a.m. in Brooklyn and 11:15 in Manhattan. One trip on Route B departs from Manhattan at 9:15 p.m. on these weekdays and makes its final stop in Brooklyn.     \u201cWe initiated this pilot program to give students, faculty, and staff more traveling options between the University\u2019s locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn,\u201d said Fred S. Barlow, assistant director of public safety and transportation at the NYU Department of Public Safety. \u201cThe schedule takes into consideration the times students and faculty are most likely to need to travel. We hope the shuttle will encourage members of the NYU community to take advantage of the opportunities both at Washington Square and in Downtown Brooklyn, including the School of Engineering, the Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) and the Media and Games Network (MAGNET).\u201d     The pilot program is in addition to NYU\u2019s overnight Safe Ride shared ride/on demand service that has been available to students traveling between Manhattan and Brooklyn between midnight and 6:30 a.m.     For detailed information on the schedule, visit http://bit.ly/1ibe0iK .
