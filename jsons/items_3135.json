It aims at educating a much needed  new generation of literary translators. The program is supported by all the  faculty members of the prestigious NYU French department and, as such, is  guaranteed to offer an equally top-rate theoretical and analytical education in  translation.         NYU provides the perfect environment for this type of  program in translation. Our two main  advantages are 1) our location in New York City where, besides the French Publishers\u2019  Agency, the vast majority of American publishers likely to publish French books  in translation are located, and 2) the NYU Paris center, where the students  will spend a six-week Summer session allowing them to meet with contemporary  French writers, publishers, and foreign rights managers. For more information, check out our Facebook page and the blog created by Literary Translation students.  Admission The  requirements for admission are a B.A. with a strong concentration of French  (e.g. major in French literature or language, major in Comparative literature  with a specialization in French literature); a statement of purpose (2 pages double-spaced); a translation sample consisting of approximately 3000 words (double-spaced) translated from the French (fiction, drama, essay, poetry, or  social sciences) with a photocopy of the original including all the necessary  references; three letters of recommendation; an official transcript of  undergraduate studies; GRE scores; and TOEFL scores (for those whose native  language is not English). ( http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication )      Applications are accepted for fall admission only .      The application deadline is April 15th, 2015.                      Program content and  requirements This one-year program (Fall and Spring semester in New York,  intensive six-week Summer session in France) will comprise eight four-credit  courses (32 credits in total) plus a thesis. Two thesis formats will be  accepted:      1) The typical thesis will consist of the original translation  of a book-long piece, such as a play, a collection of short stories, poems or  essays, a short novel or a long novella, preceded by a foreword-type analysis  of the specific translation problems raised by the text.      2) For students interested in a more fully analytical  approach, the thesis could consist of a 60- to 100-page comparative study of  existing translations.

In the new location, students have the opportunity to benefit from the numerous cultural, artistic, and academic institutions of this celebrated neighborhood, as well as to get to know the city through faculty-led visits and walking tours. The program offers regular day trips to places outside of the city, such as Chantilly, Giverny, and Versailles, and weekend excursions to locations that have included Avignon, the Loire Valley, Mont-Saint-Michel, and La Rochelle. These trips allow students to further embrace the richness, depth, and diversity of French history and civilization.   Studying at NYU Paris   Paris: city of revolution, exhilarating tumult of art and spectacle, cosmopolitan crossroads, capital of the world. French romanticist George Sand thought Parisians were \u201cthe most admirable people in the universe \u2013 grand, sublime, na\u00efve, and generous.\u201d Students who come to Paris join a long line of visitors to the city who contribute to its fervent mix\u2014its arts, its history, its politics\u2014and make the city their own. \u201cParis is a veritable ocean,\u201d Balzac wrote. \u201cDiscover it, describe it\u2026\u201d At NYU Paris, the city is your classroom.   The curriculum at NYU Paris focuses on the language, arts, history, literature, and politics of France and its relationships with the wider world. A world-class faculty provides context and support for students\u2019 academic work. Students with a limited background in French enroll in Program I, where all courses except for language are taught in English. Students proficient in French participate in Program II, which features a variety of courses taught in French. All students take a French language course appropriate to their level.   Coursework is enhanced by faculty-led trips in and around Paris, to world-renowned museums such as the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e Picasso or to smaller galleries and exhibits, as well as to the opera, ballet, and theatre. Students receive a University of Paris student card and may take courses at the University of Paris or at the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques (Sciences Po). All students are carefully advised upon their arrival in Paris; students who opt to take courses in the French university system receive additional individualized in-house tutorial assistance.   Masters level graduate programs in French Literature, French Language &amp; Civilization, Museum Studies, and Teaching French as a Foreign Language also contribute to the overall academic quality of the Paris academic center.

It aims at educating a much needed  new generation of literary translators. The program is supported by all the  faculty members of the prestigious NYU French department and, as such, is  guaranteed to offer an equally top-rate theoretical and analytical education in  translation.         NYU provides the perfect environment for this type of  program in translation. Our two main  advantages are 1) our location in New York City where, besides the French Publishers\u2019  Agency, the vast majority of American publishers likely to publish French books  in translation are located, and 2) the NYU Paris center, where the students  will spend a six-week Summer session allowing them to meet with contemporary  French writers, publishers, and foreign rights managers. For more information, check out our Facebook page and the blog created by Literary Translation students.
