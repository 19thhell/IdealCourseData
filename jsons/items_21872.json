Establish criteria for development within the existing NYU footprint in the University\u2019s core location, and the surrounding neighborhoods that would prioritize.                       &mdash; Identifying opportunities to       decentralize facilities and actively       pursuing these opportunities;                            &mdash; Contextual development that is       sensitive to building heights, densities,       and materials;                            &mdash; Reuse before new development.                     &mdash; Considering mixed-use facilities that       complement Manhattan\u2019s mixed       neighborhoods, particularly in regard       to ground-floor uses.                       Identify solutions to maximize utilization of existing assets by consulting with the     community on:                           &mdash; The types of facilities that can be decentralized from the Village core and surrounding neighborhoods and cultivating locations outside these areas;                            &mdash; Preferences for appropriate places for vertical additions;                            &mdash; Encouraging programmatic and scheduling efficiencies; and                            &mdash; Opening new and reenvisioning existing recreational spaces to better serve both the student population as well as the community at large.                                      Make thoughtful urban and architectural design a priority by:                           &mdash; Respecting the limitations of the urban environment, including the impact on       New York City\u2019s infrastructure;                                   &mdash; Improving the quality of open spaces; and                            &mdash; Actively soliciting, utilizing, and implementing input from the community in the design process.                                            Support community sustainability by:                           &mdash; Preserving existing diverse social and economic character through the support of community efforts to sustain affordable housing and local retail;                                  &mdash; Exploring the utilization of ground floors of buildings for community-oriented uses such as local retail, gallery spaces for local artists, nonprofit users and other providers of community services; and                            &mdash; Generating a tenant relocation policy for legal, residential tenants, in the event that construction or conversion necessitates the relocation of tenants.                                            Respect for the community\u2019s existing qualities of life including, but not limited to:                           &mdash; Taking measures to mitigate effects of construction such as noise, dust, work hours; sound mitigation for mechanical equipment; and construction staging;                                  &mdash; Reaching out early and often for community consultation related to major construction;                            &mdash; Creating a Web site for ongoing constructions; and                            &mdash; Committing to a community-oriented public process for reviewing NYU\u2019s proposed projects and developments.

The Planning Team of SAPD is responsible for the long and short-range physical planning needs for the University\u2019s local and global campuses. The team serves NYU\u2019s academic and administrative units through the management of the University\u2019s space inventory. With each individual client, the Planning Team works to allocate space through collaboration to find the best space to meet each need. The Planning Team offers programming, planning, pre-design, and capital planning services to clients engaging in long-range plans and in preparation for major capital projects. The Planning Team guides the University\u2019s NYU PLANS 2031, a 25-year plan to envision the University as it approaches its Bicentennial.   The Design Team of SAPD sets the guidelines for the quality of NYU\u2019s built environments. The promotion of design excellence and the implementation of sustainable design practices throughout the built and landscaped environments of the University are the paramount objectives. The Design Team is responsible for the development of a set of written design guidelines, which will guide the development of future capital projects. The Design Team advises and guides the process for the selection of architects for planning and capital projects. Members of the Design Team follow major capital projects through the design and construction process to insure the integration of design excellence on the campus.   SAPD is an ambitious advocate for the maintenance, adaptive-reuse, and the preservation of NYU\u2019s architectural and fiscal resources. We strive for thoughtful and considered solutions that help the University to better fulfill its academic mission and we are committed to NYU\u2019s founding mandate to be a university \u201cin and of the City\u201d.

In July 2012, the New York City Council approved the Core Plan described by NYU 2031, granting the University a new zoning envelope to construct needed facilities over the coming years.                  Looking to the Future           Core Plan Commitments      NYU is answering a number of local needs identified by Council Member Margaret Chin and Community Board 2 as we develop our infrastructure at Washington Square.

Establish criteria for development within the existing NYU footprint in the University\u2019s core location, and the surrounding neighborhoods that would prioritize.                       &mdash; Identifying opportunities to       decentralize facilities and actively       pursuing these opportunities;                            &mdash; Contextual development that is       sensitive to building heights, densities,       and materials;                            &mdash; Reuse before new development.                     &mdash; Considering mixed-use facilities that       complement Manhattan\u2019s mixed       neighborhoods, particularly in regard       to ground-floor uses.                       Identify solutions to maximize utilization of existing assets by consulting with the     community on:                           &mdash; The types of facilities that can be decentralized from the Village core and surrounding neighborhoods and cultivating locations outside these areas;                            &mdash; Preferences for appropriate places for vertical additions;                            &mdash; Encouraging programmatic and scheduling efficiencies; and                            &mdash; Opening new and reenvisioning existing recreational spaces to better serve both the student population as well as the community at large.                                      Make thoughtful urban and architectural design a priority by:                           &mdash; Respecting the limitations of the urban environment, including the impact on       New York City\u2019s infrastructure;                                   &mdash; Improving the quality of open spaces; and                            &mdash; Actively soliciting, utilizing, and implementing input from the community in the design process.                                            Support community sustainability by:                           &mdash; Preserving existing diverse social and economic character through the support of community efforts to sustain affordable housing and local retail;                                  &mdash; Exploring the utilization of ground floors of buildings for community-oriented uses such as local retail, gallery spaces for local artists, nonprofit users and other providers of community services; and                            &mdash; Generating a tenant relocation policy for legal, residential tenants, in the event that construction or conversion necessitates the relocation of tenants.                                            Respect for the community\u2019s existing qualities of life including, but not limited to:                           &mdash; Taking measures to mitigate effects of construction such as noise, dust, work hours; sound mitigation for mechanical equipment; and construction staging;                                  &mdash; Reaching out early and often for community consultation related to major construction;                            &mdash; Creating a Web site for ongoing constructions; and                            &mdash; Committing to a community-oriented public process for reviewing NYU\u2019s proposed projects and developments.
