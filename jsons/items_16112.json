takes advantage of Abu Dhabi's geographical location at the intersection of five great cultural and civilizational regions: the Arab world at the center; the African world to the southwest; the Mediterranean world to the northwest; the Iranian and Central Asian worlds to the northeast; and the Indian Ocean world to the southeast.   The historical and cultural interactions and exchanges between these regions have generated engaging areas for study in both the humanities and social sciences. The flow of people, ideas, and commodities through the Gulf has made it a cosmopolitan and culturally hybrid setting for many centuries. The historical archives testify to this richness, which can also be gleaned from the local cuisine, the mix of many spoken languages, and the diversity of people who now live in the Gulf region.   Today, Abu Dhabi is at the center of the most strategically important region of the world. At least sixty percent of the world's proven fossil fuel reserves are located in the Gulf region, and some of the most vexing political conflicts are not too far away. As a result, Abu Dhabi represents a natural setting for studying the complex cultural, political, and economic dynamics of the Arab world, South and Central Asia, and Europe.   The Arab Crossroads concentration allows students to study this important region from a number of disciplinary perspectives: Economics, History, Political Science, Literature, and Philosophy. In addition to coursework, students have the opportunity to travel to some of the countries in these regions and experience first-hand the issues that are raised in class.

Beginning with early Western travelers&rsquo; imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region. Through ethnography, literature, film and fieldwork, we will explore such topics as Orientalism and its legacy; constructs of youth, gender, family and tribe; poetry and mediation; generational and social change; oil, development and globalization; transnational labor, migration and diaspora; Indian Ocean networks; pilgrimage and piety; the Islamic Revival; faith, medicine, and bioethics; displacement and dispossession; refugees and human rights; and the Arab uprisings.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. In this course we investigate the rich and complex history of al-Andalus, focusing on the changing relationships between Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities.

This was especially the case during the eight centuries from 711&ndash;1492 when various parts of the Iberian peninsula were ruled over by Muslims. In this course we look both at how what are today Morocco and Spain were connected in this period in both history and imagination, and at how the Spanish colonial presence in Morocco in the 20th century played a important role in the Spanish civil war. The course includes an extended trip through Morocco and Spain.

We learn about Arab seafaring and trade in the Indian Ocean and the creation of the &quot;Arabian Seas.&quot; We read the narratives of Arab merchants, such as Suleiman the Merchant and Abu Hassan al-Sirafi who came to China from the Gulf in the 9th and the 10th centuries, and the great travelogue by Abu Abdallah Ibn Battuta, who traveled to China all the way from North Africa in the 14th century. We study the history of the corresponding periods in Chinese history&mdash;the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, and to complement the Arab travelogues, read the narrative of Ma Huan, the Chinese Muslim who sailed from China to Mecca and other cities in the region in the 15th century. The class visits Quanzhou, better known as Zaytoon, a city dominated by Arabs for several centuries, and other port cities in the Yangzi Delta and north in the Grand Canal on the way to Beijing.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

ACS-AD 206X Jews in the Muslim World in the Middle Ages                                                                              This course examines the history and culture of the Jews in the medieval Islamic world, beginning with the historiographical debate about this contentious subject. The syllabus moves from the early encounter between Islam and the Jews at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, discussing the Qur&rsquo;an and other foundational texts, to the legal and actual status of the Jews. We will examine how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish (and Islamic) life, and how changes in the economy affected developments in Jewish law. The course will also examine the organization and functions of the Jewish community and will address the large question of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. We will also read literary sources showing how deeply influenced the Jews were by Arabic culture. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Christian minority in the Islamic world and with that of Jews living in Medieval Latin Europe.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality. Major themes under exploration will comprise the question of the veil, the structure of the family, the use of sexual pleasures, the debates around female genital cutting, the conflicts over reproduction, and the politics of sexual identity. Writers include Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Ann Laura Stoler, Lisa Pollard, Joseph Massad, Leila Abu-Lughod, Chandra Mohanty, Mehammed Mack, Beatriz Preciado, Joan Wallach Scott, Saba Mahmood, Farha Ghannam, Homa Hoodfar, Afsaneh Najmabadi, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Marcia Inhorn, Madawi al Rasheed, Douglas Northrop, Silvia Federici, and Goran Therborn.    *Note: Former title of this course was &#39;Arabs, Sex, and Modernity&#39;.

The novels are our guides in order to understand the multiple layers of a city, and to build knowledge about the relationship between literature and social life. We read works by Naguib Mahfouz, Sunalla Ibrahim, Huda Barakat, Hanan Al Sheikh, Tawfic Yussuf Awad, Sinan Antoun, and Ghassan Kanafani. We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.

Gulf countries have witnessed an unprecedented construction boom since the beginning of oil exploitation. New cities have been built and old cities have been renewed, often with the help of such world-class architects as Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, and Constantinos Doxiadis. In Abu Dhabi, infrastructures, public buildings, and residential projects have been designed by Roger Taillibert, Benjamin Thompson, Norman Foster, and Zaha Hadid, to name but a few. Students contribute to writing the story of modern architecture in the city. They visit and document remarkable buildings, explore local archives, and reconstitute the trajectories of architectural forms and patterns.

We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields. The course culminates in an extended research proposal for a capstone project.

Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, Muslim and &lsquo;pagan&rsquo; realms co-exist uneasily in the original cycle of tales that often confront their protagonists with such differences as a problem. Even the possession of supernatural powers recurs in the tales in the form of an accusation made against perceived outsiders (the Maghrebi magician, the Jewish professional, the Sapphic witch). The reception of the Nights tales in Europe, Marina Warner contends in Stranger Magic, animated the new sciences of anthropology and psychology, suggesting alternative modes of modernity less strictly beholden to Enlightenment reason. Cultural difference peaked the interest of the translators who brought the Nights to Europe and pioneered travelogues and ethnographies of the Levant, Egypt and Arabia. Their writings would serve as points of departure for seminal works on the engagement with cultural difference and its representation, Appiah&rsquo;s Cosmopolitanism and Said&rsquo;s Orientalism. Texts studied include Galland&rsquo;s history of the coffee trade, folktales, histories, travelogues, ethnographies, polemics, and literary and cinematic retellings.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

At the end of the course, we ask what other national school systems might learn from the U.A.E.&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, opportunity, and danger.

This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

During the semester, students will read from a wide variety of literary genres including love poetry, popular epics, travelers&rsquo; accounts, geographical works and sufi mystical treatises from many different regions of the Muslim world, ranging from West Africa to South East Asia. Exploring the movement of people, goods, and ideas within works of literature and tracing the formation, circulation and transformation of Islamicate literary genres, the course focuses on the ways that literary works mediate between local, translocal, and global identities.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region.

The Arabic authors were heirs to the entire Greek philosophical legacy and took it in a number of important and innovative directions, some of which have remained with us to the present day. Topics broached include knowledge, certitude, and the rules of rational debate; the metaphysical distinction between essence and existence and the attendant notions of necessity and contingency; the medieval analysis of the soul, the psychic faculties, and moral psychology; and the role of religion in society and the analysis of religious claims within philosophy.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &quot;Arab exceptionalism&quot;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth. The course seeks to link the Arab Middle East to broader questions of political organization and accountability.    Recommended Prerequisites: Introduction to Comparative Politics (POLSC-AD 150).

It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life. Each student is expected to complete a final research project exploring the core questions posed by the course.

THEAT-AD 134JX Theater in the Arab World                                                                                         This class examines recent trends in contemporary Arab theatre, contextualizing these within a broader history of Arab performance including film. Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus&rsquo;s Historical Miniatures, &lsquo;Udwan&rsquo;s The Trial of the Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus&rsquo;s The Elephant, Diyab&rsquo;s Strangers Don&rsquo;t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki&rsquo;s use of the halqa and Wannus&rsquo; inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus&rsquo;s and Farag&rsquo;s use of the Arabian Nights Tales, Al-Hakim&rsquo;s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim&rsquo;s use of Greek myth).
