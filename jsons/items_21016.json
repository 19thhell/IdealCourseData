Default compilers, applications and libraries can be set by individual or combinations of Modules commands. Modules are not applications, rather they simply add the location of applications to your environment. You can list the available Modules using the command:      $ module avail   You can load a module, in this case the C/C++ Intel Compiler module, using the command:     $ module load intel/11.1.046   Once the module for Intel C/C++ is added to your shell environment, Intel C/C++ binaries, headers, libraries and help pages will be available to your session.    You can load multiple modules in one line. For example, to load intel compilers and OpenMPI:     $ module load intel/11.1.046 openmpi/intel/1.4.3      You can view the added modules using the command:     $ module list      To see specific module information such as what other modules needed to be loaded first to load a specific module you can use the command module show &lt;module name&gt; . For example, to show more information on OpenMPI module:     $ module show openmpi      To unload a module you can use the command module unload &lt;module name&gt; . For example, to unload a loaded intel compiler module:     $ module unload intel      To unload more than one out of many loaded modules you can use module unload &lt;module name&gt; &lt;module name&gt; .

Pop-up blockers must be disabled to play the courses.   2.\u00a0If that does not work, click on the system checker icon on the iDevelop Home Page. It will let you know if you are missing a plug-in, such as Flash, that is required to play the courses properly.   3.\u00a0If you are using a MAC and are using Firefox, try switching to Safari.   4.\u00a0If none of the above work, call the Helpdesk (212-263-6868) to create a ticket. Please ask the support analyst to note the name of the course you are trying to access and as many details about the issue as you are able to provide.   \u00a0   \u00a0                                                                                        NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}, {"content": "Modules - High Performance Computing at NYU - NYU Wikis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Skip to content    Skip to breadcrumbs    Skip to header menu    Skip to action menu    Skip to quick search                                                                    Spaces                                      Create                          Quick Search                     Help                                                            Online Help                             Keyboard Shortcuts                            Feed Builder                            What\u2019s new                             Available Gadgets                            About Confluence                                                                                    Log in                                                      High Performance Computing at NYU    Pages  Blog    Child pages   Pages   Modules     Browse pages  Configure Space tools                                                                     Tools                                                     A t tachments (0)                                           Page History                                           Restrictions                                                               Page Information                                           Link to this Page\u2026                                           View in Hierarchy                                           View Source                                           Export to PDF                                           Export to Word                                                                                                    Pages                              Skip to end of banner                 JIRA links         Go to start of banner                          Modules                                                                                                                                                                 Skip to end of metadata                                         Created by  Maureen A Butler , last modified by  Sreedhar Manchu on Oct 21, 2011                  Go to start of metadata                                Environment Modules    NYU HPC uses an open source software package called &quot;Environment Modules,&quot; (or Modules for short) which allows you to add various path definitions to your shell environment. Default compilers, applications and libraries can be set by individual or combinations of Modules commands. Modules are not applications, rather they simply add the location of applications to your environment. You can list the available Modules using the command:      $ module avail   You can load a module, in this case the C/C++ Intel Compiler module, using the command:     $ module load intel/11.1.046   Once the module for Intel C/C++ is added to your shell environment, Intel C/C++ binaries, headers, libraries and help pages will be available to your session.    You can load multiple modules in one line. For example, to load intel compilers and OpenMPI:     $ module load intel/11.1.046 openmpi/intel/1.4.3      You can view the added modules using the command:     $ module list      To see specific module information such as what other modules needed to be loaded first to load a specific module you can use the command module show &lt;module name&gt; . For example, to show more information on OpenMPI module:     $ module show openmpi      To unload a module you can use the command module unload &lt;module name&gt; . For example, to unload a loaded intel compiler module:     $ module unload intel      To unload more than one out of many loaded modules you can use module unload &lt;module name&gt; &lt;module name&gt; . For example, out of many loaded modules if you want to unload intel and openmpi:     $ module unload openmpi intel      To unload all the loaded modules, you can do:     $ module purge      You can use help option to know more information on module command:     $ module --help     \u00a0                                                       No labels                                                                                                                                           Overview      Content Tools      Activity                                                     Powered by Atlassian Confluence 5.6.6 , Team Collaboration Software      Printed by Atlassian Confluence 5.6.6, Team Collaboration Software.
