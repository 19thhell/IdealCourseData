Description       What do we really mean when we talk about \u201cauthority,\u201d and why do we obey it? This semester we will examine the decision to obey or disobey and the pleasures and agonies that come with following the rules and with breaking them. Across a range of literary, philosophical, political theoretical, and psychoanalytic texts, we will examine the authority figures behind the rules, those who decide to follow them (or not), and the bystanders around them. We will ask how different disciplines grapple with the challenge of authority and obedience\u2014for instance, how political theory imagines the \u201csovereign,\u201d how literature erects archetypes of temptation, and how psychoanalysis imagines the prohibitions we carry within ourselves. We will also track these tropes and figures through history, asking how the rules, the rulers, and the ruled change over time (and how and why they might). How do our ideas about what constitutes obedience and disobedience shift? When we enter into a relationship (or a culture!) with foundational rules and preconditions, how does this enable, diminish or, some might suggest, even destroy our freedom? And what happens when the promises we\u2019ve made conflict with each other and make it impossible to obey one command without disobeying another?

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

Description       What do we really mean when we talk about \u201cauthority,\u201d and why do we obey it? This semester we will examine the decision to obey or disobey and the pleasures and agonies that come with following the rules and with breaking them. Across a range of literary, philosophical, political theoretical, and psychoanalytic texts, we will examine the authority figures behind the rules, those who decide to follow them (or not), and the bystanders around them. We will ask how different disciplines grapple with the challenge of authority and obedience\u2014for instance, how political theory imagines the \u201csovereign,\u201d how literature erects archetypes of temptation, and how psychoanalysis imagines the prohibitions we carry within ourselves. We will also track these tropes and figures through history, asking how the rules, the rulers, and the ruled change over time (and how and why they might). How do our ideas about what constitutes obedience and disobedience shift? When we enter into a relationship (or a culture!) with foundational rules and preconditions, how does this enable, diminish or, some might suggest, even destroy our freedom? And what happens when the promises we\u2019ve made conflict with each other and make it impossible to obey one command without disobeying another? Our readings will include, in addition to earlier and later works, Immanuel Kant\u2019s \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?,\u201d Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s\u00a0 The \u00a0\u00a0 Social Contract, \u00a0Charles Perrault\u2019s \u201cBluebeard,\u201d Mary Wollstonecraft\u2019s\u00a0 The Wrongs of Woman \u00a0, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\u2019s\u00a0 Fear and Trembling, \u00a0and Sigmund Freud\u2019s\u00a0 Totem and Taboo. \u00a0                 Syllabus       FIRST-UG91            Course Type       First-Year Program: Interdisciplinary Seminars (FIRST-UG)                               top of page                                                                   NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.
