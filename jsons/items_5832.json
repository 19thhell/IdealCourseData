Double Feature:   Channelrhodopsin-Assisted Patching  Neurogrid: New Techniques and Technology from the Neuroscience Institute                     Channelrhodopsin-Assisted Patching: In Vivo Recording of Genetically and Morphologically Identified Neurons throughout the Brain   by William Munoz Miranda     In our brain networks, diverse types of neurons assemble into circuits and participate in computations that support the processing and storage of information. While headway is being made in understanding the scale and identity of these cellular elements and their interconnections, grasping their functional implications for behavior requires the precise identification of these cell types\u00a0 in vivo \u00a0and the monitoring of their activity profiles in the context of network and behavioral states. In a recent study published in the journal\u00a0 Cell Reports , Mu\u00f1oz and colleagues devise a new method facilitating this avenue of questions.   The developed method, channelrhodopsin-assisted patching, combines\u00a0 in vivo \u00a0optogenetics with juxtacellular recording and labeling technologies. The strategy utilizes patch pipettes containing an optic fiber to record from mice conditionally expressing ChR2 in various genetically defined cell populations. The paper shows that this strategy has numerous advantages. First, the authors demonstrate that their approach enabled the reliable and efficient targeting and juxtacellular recordings of light-responsive neurons, dramatically improving the yield of targeting specific cell types as compared to traditional blind recording methods. Second, since the method does not depend on visual guidance, the authors were able to target recordings at any depth in the brain. Third, the approach enabled the routine labeling of targeted neurons and thus the determination of their morphological features. Fourth, the authors developed a protocol to target genetically defined neurons for intracellular recordings in whole-cell configuration. In this way, this innovative method allows the efficient\u00a0 in vivo \u00a0targeted recording of neurons that are labeled and identified by their molecular, electrophysiological, and morphological features, which are fundamental determinants of a neuron\u2019s identity and function. Importantly, such recordings can be carried out in anesthetized and awake preparations.   This approach overcomes critical limitations of present technologies. For example, the need of optical access of imaging-based technologies, such as two-photon targeted patching and calcium imaging, has largely restricted their application to superficial cortical layers. On the other hand, while the combination of conditional expression of channelrhodopsin in genetic groups and extracellular recordings has allowed the \u2018optical tagging\u2019 of light-responsive units at any recording depth, this strategy can only provide coarse anatomical position of recorded neurons, does not allow morphological recovery, and cannot grant access to intracellular recording. Channelrhodopsin-assisted patching is not subject to these limitations, attaining higher efficiency and precision in the recording of the activity of individual cellular elements\u00a0 in vivo .   The article presents proof of principle supporting the utility of the method. The authors were able to target recording and labeling of GABAergic interneurons in deep neocortical layers with high efficiency, despite the fact they represent a minority of cortical neurons. Among the results of the study, the first recordings of morphologically identified somatostatin-expressing interneurons in anesthetized and awake preparations (Figure 5) and the first targeted whole-cell recordings of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in neocortical layer 5 (Figure 4) were obtained. The results also provide strong evidence for the need of morphological information to disentangle the heterogeneity present within these genetic groups of neocortical networks (Figure 6). Finally, the authors adapted the strategy for the recording of genetically defined neurons at subcortical depths, including morphologically identified cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain (Figure 7).   This efficient and robust technique is an exciting and important complement to existing tools. By allowing the dissection of the activity of individual cellular elements in \u00a0vivo \u00a0with higher efficiency and precision, it will substantially accelerate our understanding of the computational significance of the cell types composing brain networks and bring about new conceptual advances.

Understanding how the brain performs complex functions, from sensory perception to decision making, requires analysis of this spiking activity over space and time. However, action potentials are brief (1-2 ms), small amplitude events relative to voltage fluctuations in the extracellular space, making them difficult to record. Typically, recording electrodes must be inserted into the brain and placed in close proximity to neurons in order to acquire individual action potentials. Implantation of electrodes damages brain tissue and therefore limits recording to small, restricted areas, especially in humans. When information about neural activity over larger areas is required, for instance to determine the onset zone of a seizure or localize a certain brain function to an area of cortex, electrodes are placed on the surface of the brain (electrocorticography). These surface electrodes record local field potentials (LFP) that represent the summed input synaptic activity of hundreds to thousands of neurons. Although analysis of LFP recordings provides insight into neural processes, the relationship to neurons\u2019 output in the form of spiking is not straightforward. The capacity to record both action potentials and LFP without penetrating the brain surface would greatly increase the amount of information available in a single recording without introducing the potential complications of invasive devices.   In a recent issue of Nature Neuroscience, we demonstrated that a novel neural interface device, the \u2018NeuroGrid\u2019, can record action potentials of cortical neurons without penetrating the surface of the brain. This ability is due to several key design elements: (i) recording electrodes with similar size and spacing compared to neuronal cell bodies in cortex; (ii) use of a conducting polymer (PEDOT:PSS) instead of conventional metals as the interface between brain and electronics to increase the efficiency of neural signal transduction; (iii) advanced microfabrication techniques to generate a thin (4 \u03bcm) and highly conformable overall structure that can closely adhere to the complex curves of the cortex.   LFP and action potentials were recorded with the NeuroGrid both chronically in vivo in rats and intra-operatively from human patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. Action potentials in rat somatosensory cortex were stable in waveform appearance and distribution over recording electrodes for more than one week. Identification of action potentials generated by a putative single neurons (clustering) revealed characteristics suggestive of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Because the most superficial excitatory cortical neurons are located approximately 200 \u03bcm below the cortical surface (layer II), the NeuroGrid appears to have a detection radius of at least this distance.   This study establishes the NeuroGrid as an effective tool for large-scale recording of LFP and action potentials from the cortical surface with minimal risk of tissue damage. Such a device could be used to record from human cortical areas characteristically too sensitive to risk implantation of penetrating electrodes, or within sulci/fissures that are inaccessible to conventional surface arrays. Data generated will facilitate understanding of the relationship between LFP and spiking activity in different cortical regions, and could be used for control of brain-machine interfaces or therapeutic closed-loop stimulation in brain disease.
