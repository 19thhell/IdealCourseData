At the core of Cognitive Science, this endeavor has emerged as a preeminent research frontier, forging links across the humanities, the social sciences and the hard sciences. Reflecting the inter-disciplinary character of this frontier, NYU\u2019s Language &amp; Mind study program is strongly integrative, drawing courses from three departments: Linguistics, Psychology and Philosophy. Human language is at the center of the Language &amp; Mind study program, but the major is broader than Linguistics; the program also incorporates Psychological experimentation techniques and Philosophical inquiry. The aim is to give students the necessary background for exploration of new perspectives for both language and the human mind.

At the core of Cognitive Science, this endeavor has emerged as a preeminent research frontier, forging links across the humanities, the social sciences and the hard sciences. Reflecting the inter-disciplinary character of this frontier, NYU\u2019s Language &amp; Mind study program is strongly integrative, drawing courses from three departments: Linguistics, Psychology and Philosophy. Human language is at the center of the Language &amp; Mind study program, but the major is broader than Linguistics; the program also incorporates Psychological experimentation techniques and Philosophical inquiry. The aim is to give students the necessary background for exploration of new perspectives for both language and the human mind.
