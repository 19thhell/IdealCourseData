Are you planning to become an entrepreneur and make your mark? Do you want to do good after doing well in your career and start your own philanthropic initiative? Do you wonder why some leaders succeed while others fail? Do you wish to analyze and understand your own potential for leadership?    If you answered \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the questions above, this program will benefit you. It is meant for those who wish to better understand and further develop their potential and propensity to lead others. The program is based on the premise that leadership is not a genetic inheritance. It\u2019s a skill to acquire and master. A journey to commence and complete.This program will provide you a framework for that skill and a template for that journey.    As you rise in your career, you will need multiple and often conflicting constituencies on board to follow your vision. But if you don\u2019t lead, others will not follow. This program will help you hone some of the essential self-reflective skills you need to give form and substance to such vision, including:     Understanding what leadership is and is not   By analyzing real life cases from diverse contexts, you will gain a more fine-tuned idea of the scope and limitations of leadership.    Developing the skills needed to lead   By understanding the conduct of actual leaders and analyzing the effectiveness of their conduct, you should be able to further develop the natural leadership skills you already possess and leverage them more effectively in complex organizational situations.    Understanding your own mindscape as a leader   Effective leadership requires awareness of one\u2019s own assumptions, preferences and unconscious style of leadership. Through in-depth group discussion and self-assessments, you will identify, comprehend, and critique your own assumptions and attitudes towards leaders and leading.    Developing a personal leadership plan   By the end of this program, you will have gained substantial insight into how best to harness your natural inclinations to lead toward a more successful management of your current career path, perhaps even laying out a new one.    To achieve these objectives, we combine a variety of pedagogical approaches: lectures, group discussions, case analysis, videos, and self-assessments. Emphasis is placed on self-reflection and linking the concepts from the program to participants\u2019 own objectives and development as leaders.     Program Benefits:  During this program participants will:      Acquire a pragmatic framework of the building blocks of leadership    Assess their leadership potentials and pitfalls based on this framework    Design a personal and actionable leadership road map to guide them through their career and life choices.      This program is eligible for Continuing Professional Education Credits (CPE).

We are a school with energy and excellence, IQ and EQ, neighborhood roots and global reach.    Stern\u2019s vision begins with people and ideas. Our students and faculty continue to redefine what business can do to create value for shareholders and society. The possibilities for reinvention in the 21st century are endless. It is this potential that inspires what we call An Education in Possible .    An Education in Possible starts with the realization that imagination is the only constraint to innovation and that opportunity sits alongside every problem. Our ability to translate those problems into opportunities requires both rigor inside the classroom and engagement beyond its four walls. Driven by a profound belief that business can be a force for good, we empower students to use business to improve the world.    We take pride in our culture and invite you to explore NYU Stern.

Jill Bright, chief administrative officer at Cond&eacute; Nast, and Mason Salit, wealth market leader at TD Bank, shared perspectives with MBA students on how great leaders succeed as part of NYU Stern's Leadership Development Initiative (LDI). During a panel discussion, moderated by Professor Dolly Chugh and coordinated by the School's Leadership Development team, Bright and Salit described attributes of effective leaders and shared stories of both disappointment and success in their careers. According to both Bright and Salit, great leaders possess a number of traits, including: Inspiration Vision Self-awareness Humility Empathy Integrity Willingness to admit mistakes and learn from them The ability to balance evaluating information and being decisive &ldquo;Great leaders surround themselves with a great team, they value diversity, and most important, they are willing to listen to other opinions,&rdquo; explained Salit. Bright agreed, adding that good leaders create a &ldquo;culture of winning.&rdquo; Bright and Salit also shared a few pieces of advice: Don&rsquo;t wait to have difficult conversations Build a team of smart colleagues with differing viewpoints Stretch yourself, take risks and be willing to make mistakes                                          Learn more about Stern&#039;s Leadership Development Initiative    Leadership Development Initiative                                          Read more about past Leadership Luncheon Series events:               David Rock, co-founder and director, NeuroLeadership Institute Stephen Sadove, chairman and CEO, Saks Sharon Allen, former chairman, Deloitte Jeff Zucker, former president and CEO, NBC Universal Tony Alvarez, co-founder, Alvarez &amp; Marsal LLC   Bill Drayton, founder and CEO, Ashoka   Mike Indursky (MBA &rsquo;90), president, Bliss World Holdings Inc.

Are you planning to become an entrepreneur and make your mark? Do you want to do good after doing well in your career and start your own philanthropic initiative? Do you wonder why some leaders succeed while others fail? Do you wish to analyze and understand your own potential for leadership?    If you answered \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the questions above, this program will benefit you. It is meant for those who wish to better understand and further develop their potential and propensity to lead others. The program is based on the premise that leadership is not a genetic inheritance. It\u2019s a skill to acquire and master. A journey to commence and complete.This program will provide you a framework for that skill and a template for that journey.    As you rise in your career, you will need multiple and often conflicting constituencies on board to follow your vision. But if you don\u2019t lead, others will not follow. This program will help you hone some of the essential self-reflective skills you need to give form and substance to such vision, including:     Understanding what leadership is and is not   By analyzing real life cases from diverse contexts, you will gain a more fine-tuned idea of the scope and limitations of leadership.    Developing the skills needed to lead   By understanding the conduct of actual leaders and analyzing the effectiveness of their conduct, you should be able to further develop the natural leadership skills you already possess and leverage them more effectively in complex organizational situations.    Understanding your own mindscape as a leader   Effective leadership requires awareness of one\u2019s own assumptions, preferences and unconscious style of leadership. Through in-depth group discussion and self-assessments, you will identify, comprehend, and critique your own assumptions and attitudes towards leaders and leading.    Developing a personal leadership plan   By the end of this program, you will have gained substantial insight into how best to harness your natural inclinations to lead toward a more successful management of your current career path, perhaps even laying out a new one.    To achieve these objectives, we combine a variety of pedagogical approaches: lectures, group discussions, case analysis, videos, and self-assessments. Emphasis is placed on self-reflection and linking the concepts from the program to participants\u2019 own objectives and development as leaders.     Program Benefits:  During this program participants will:      Acquire a pragmatic framework of the building blocks of leadership    Assess their leadership potentials and pitfalls based on this framework    Design a personal and actionable leadership road map to guide them through their career and life choices.      This program is eligible for Continuing Professional Education Credits (CPE).

We are a school with energy and excellence, IQ and EQ, neighborhood roots and global reach.    Stern\u2019s vision begins with people and ideas. Our students and faculty continue to redefine what business can do to create value for shareholders and society. The possibilities for reinvention in the 21st century are endless. It is this potential that inspires what we call An Education in Possible .    An Education in Possible starts with the realization that imagination is the only constraint to innovation and that opportunity sits alongside every problem. Our ability to translate those problems into opportunities requires both rigor inside the classroom and engagement beyond its four walls. Driven by a profound belief that business can be a force for good, we empower students to use business to improve the world.    We take pride in our culture and invite you to explore NYU Stern.

Jill Bright, chief administrative officer at Cond&eacute; Nast, and Mason Salit, wealth market leader at TD Bank, shared perspectives with MBA students on how great leaders succeed as part of NYU Stern's Leadership Development Initiative (LDI). During a panel discussion, moderated by Professor Dolly Chugh and coordinated by the School's Leadership Development team, Bright and Salit described attributes of effective leaders and shared stories of both disappointment and success in their careers. According to both Bright and Salit, great leaders possess a number of traits, including: Inspiration Vision Self-awareness Humility Empathy Integrity Willingness to admit mistakes and learn from them The ability to balance evaluating information and being decisive &ldquo;Great leaders surround themselves with a great team, they value diversity, and most important, they are willing to listen to other opinions,&rdquo; explained Salit. Bright agreed, adding that good leaders create a &ldquo;culture of winning.&rdquo; Bright and Salit also shared a few pieces of advice: Don&rsquo;t wait to have difficult conversations Build a team of smart colleagues with differing viewpoints Stretch yourself, take risks and be willing to make mistakes                                          Learn more about Stern&#039;s Leadership Development Initiative    Leadership Development Initiative                                          Read more about past Leadership Luncheon Series events:               David Rock, co-founder and director, NeuroLeadership Institute Stephen Sadove, chairman and CEO, Saks Sharon Allen, former chairman, Deloitte Jeff Zucker, former president and CEO, NBC Universal Tony Alvarez, co-founder, Alvarez &amp; Marsal LLC   Bill Drayton, founder and CEO, Ashoka   Mike Indursky (MBA &rsquo;90), president, Bliss World Holdings Inc.

Are you planning to become an entrepreneur and make your mark? Do you want to do good after doing well in your career and start your own philanthropic initiative? Do you wonder why some leaders succeed while others fail? Do you wish to analyze and understand your own potential for leadership?    If you answered \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the questions above, this program will benefit you. It is meant for those who wish to better understand and further develop their potential and propensity to lead others. The program is based on the premise that leadership is not a genetic inheritance. It\u2019s a skill to acquire and master. A journey to commence and complete.This program will provide you a framework for that skill and a template for that journey.    As you rise in your career, you will need multiple and often conflicting constituencies on board to follow your vision. But if you don\u2019t lead, others will not follow. This program will help you hone some of the essential self-reflective skills you need to give form and substance to such vision, including:     Understanding what leadership is and is not   By analyzing real life cases from diverse contexts, you will gain a more fine-tuned idea of the scope and limitations of leadership.    Developing the skills needed to lead   By understanding the conduct of actual leaders and analyzing the effectiveness of their conduct, you should be able to further develop the natural leadership skills you already possess and leverage them more effectively in complex organizational situations.    Understanding your own mindscape as a leader   Effective leadership requires awareness of one\u2019s own assumptions, preferences and unconscious style of leadership. Through in-depth group discussion and self-assessments, you will identify, comprehend, and critique your own assumptions and attitudes towards leaders and leading.    Developing a personal leadership plan   By the end of this program, you will have gained substantial insight into how best to harness your natural inclinations to lead toward a more successful management of your current career path, perhaps even laying out a new one.    To achieve these objectives, we combine a variety of pedagogical approaches: lectures, group discussions, case analysis, videos, and self-assessments. Emphasis is placed on self-reflection and linking the concepts from the program to participants\u2019 own objectives and development as leaders.     Program Benefits:  During this program participants will:      Acquire a pragmatic framework of the building blocks of leadership    Assess their leadership potentials and pitfalls based on this framework    Design a personal and actionable leadership road map to guide them through their career and life choices.      This program is eligible for Continuing Professional Education Credits (CPE).

We are a school with energy and excellence, IQ and EQ, neighborhood roots and global reach.    Stern\u2019s vision begins with people and ideas. Our students and faculty continue to redefine what business can do to create value for shareholders and society. The possibilities for reinvention in the 21st century are endless. It is this potential that inspires what we call An Education in Possible .    An Education in Possible starts with the realization that imagination is the only constraint to innovation and that opportunity sits alongside every problem. Our ability to translate those problems into opportunities requires both rigor inside the classroom and engagement beyond its four walls. Driven by a profound belief that business can be a force for good, we empower students to use business to improve the world.    We take pride in our culture and invite you to explore NYU Stern.

Jill Bright, chief administrative officer at Cond&eacute; Nast, and Mason Salit, wealth market leader at TD Bank, shared perspectives with MBA students on how great leaders succeed as part of NYU Stern's Leadership Development Initiative (LDI). During a panel discussion, moderated by Professor Dolly Chugh and coordinated by the School's Leadership Development team, Bright and Salit described attributes of effective leaders and shared stories of both disappointment and success in their careers. According to both Bright and Salit, great leaders possess a number of traits, including: Inspiration Vision Self-awareness Humility Empathy Integrity Willingness to admit mistakes and learn from them The ability to balance evaluating information and being decisive &ldquo;Great leaders surround themselves with a great team, they value diversity, and most important, they are willing to listen to other opinions,&rdquo; explained Salit. Bright agreed, adding that good leaders create a &ldquo;culture of winning.&rdquo; Bright and Salit also shared a few pieces of advice: Don&rsquo;t wait to have difficult conversations Build a team of smart colleagues with differing viewpoints Stretch yourself, take risks and be willing to make mistakes                                          Learn more about Stern&#039;s Leadership Development Initiative    Leadership Development Initiative                                          Read more about past Leadership Luncheon Series events:               David Rock, co-founder and director, NeuroLeadership Institute Stephen Sadove, chairman and CEO, Saks Sharon Allen, former chairman, Deloitte Jeff Zucker, former president and CEO, NBC Universal Tony Alvarez, co-founder, Alvarez &amp; Marsal LLC   Bill Drayton, founder and CEO, Ashoka   Mike Indursky (MBA &rsquo;90), president, Bliss World Holdings Inc.
