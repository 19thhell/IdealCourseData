Initial Educational Statement   The Initial Educational Statement should be completed by the field instructor and student collaboratively. Part I, the Orientation and Field Instruction Plan, should be completed within the first two weeks of placement. Part II provides a baseline assessment of the student\u2019s skill level, establishes the learning plan for the remainder of the semester, and provides an initial indication of the grade level of the student\u2019s performance in the early stages of placement. Part II should be completed in the 7th week of field placement.

The field instructor, in collaboration with the student, works to evaluate the student\u2019s progress over the course of the year.   Initial Educational Statement   The Initial Educational Statement should be completed by the field instructor and student collaboratively. Part I, the Orientation and Field Instruction Plan, should be completed within the first two weeks of placement. Part II provides a baseline assessment of the student\u2019s skill level, establishes the learning plan for the remainder of the semester, and provides an initial indication of the grade level of the student\u2019s performance in the early stages of placement. Part II should be completed in the 7th week of field placement.

Initial Educational Statement   The Initial Educational Statement should be completed by the field instructor and student collaboratively. Part I, the Orientation and Field Instruction Plan, should be completed within the first two weeks of placement. Part II provides a baseline assessment of the student\u2019s skill level, establishes the learning plan for the remainder of the semester, and provides an initial indication of the grade level of the student\u2019s performance in the early stages of placement. Part II should be completed in the 7th week of field placement.
