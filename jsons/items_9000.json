The Neoclassical paintings of Jacques-Louis David,      for instance, are characterized by their exceptional clarity and      order and their frieze-like compositions, which recall ancient relief      sculpture and even Greek vase painting. Examples such as The Oath      of the Horatii, created on the eve of the French Revolution, extol      Roman civic virtues like patriotism and loyalty, making them highly      successful vehicles of political propaganda as well as dramatic      works of art.      Both Neoclassicism and Romanticism coincided with the democratic      movements of the late 1770s, and both artistic styles placed value      on emotional content and the idea of \"natural man\". While Neoclassicism      celebrated heroism in service of the State and human reason and      rationality, Romanticism emphasized imagination, intuition, and      the extremes of subjective experience. The Romantic movement fostered      the emergence of the modern idea of the artist as anti-authoritarian      rebel genius. Romantic works depict a range of human emotions from      joy and awe to terror and agony, and artists like Gericault and      Turner expressed moral outrage over contemporary events in history      paintings and landscape.      Realist artists also responded to contemporary events, but instead      of painting from the imagination, they presented the subject matter      of everyday life scenes that they observed and restaged  on a      grand scale formerly reserved for history painting. The consummate      Realist painter in mid-nineteenth-century France, Gustave Courbet      painted unsentimental canvasses that featured the provincial citizens      of his native Ornans in works like Burial at Ornans and Young Ladies      of the Village. Edouard Manet scandalized both the critics and public      with works that flouted middle class morality (Le Djeuner sur l'Herbe;      Olympia). Manet's use of broad areas of flat color with little shading      or modeling (the \"color patch\") reasserted the two-dimensionality      of painting on canvas and influenced the work of the Impressionists.           Building on the achievements of Realist artists, the Impressionists      painted scenes of modern life and middle class leisure in and around      Paris. They often painted directly from nature, creating canvasses      \"en plein air,\" or out-of-doors, in front of the urban or suburban      landscape. They attempted to capture the transitory and ephemeral      character of the modern city and landscape, with special attention      to the effects of light and optical theory, as is especially clear      in the serial paintings of Claude Monet. Impressionist canvasses      reject traditional means of illusionism such as linear perspective,      foreshortening, contour shading and modeling. Instead of creating      the illusion of depth, the Impressionists reinforced the flatness      of the canvas through the build-up of individual brushstrokes of      pure, unblended color (optical color mixture).      The Post-Impressionists emerged as critics of the seeming lack      of structure and symbolic content in Impressionist painting. They      rejected the Impressionists' goal of capturing the momentary and      sought to convey the permanent, but they remained indebted to the      Impressionists' individualized brushstrokes and liberated color.      Paul  Cezanne and Georges Seurat took a more intellectual approach      to painting. While Seurat utilized color theory and the Divisionist      style to depict scenes of Parisian nightlife and outdoor leisure,      Cezanne used cubic, \"axe-cut\" brushstrokes, geometricized forms,      and pure color to reinterpret the \"grand\" themes of Western painting      such as landscape and still life. Paul Gauguin and Vincent Van Gogh,      by contrast, strove for greater emotional and symbolic content in      their paintings. Both artists viewed the city as alienating rather      than utopian. They each sought creative inspiration in the pre-      industrial world, Van Gogh in the South of France and Gauguin in      Brittany and Tahiti. While both artists employ anti-naturalistic      colors, Van Gogh's compositions also rely for expressive effect      on his characteristic gestural brushstroke and impasto surface.

Workshop Series: Realistic Entrepreneurial Actionable Learning       NYU Reynolds is thrilled to host an exclusive evening with Alan Hilburg, one of the      world's leading authorities and innovators on reimagining brands with special guest Shaheen Sheik-Sadhal, Founder of       Esse Law Group .           An Evening of Bridging the Unimaginable Heights and Incalculable Difference Social Entrepreneurship      Can Make With Emotional Branding and the New Four Letter \"F\" Word             December 10, 2013       Rudin Family Forum, NYU Wagner                Download the presentation from the event.                  About the Workshop and Alan Hilburg          It's been said that social entrepreneurship is misunderstood, undervalued and requires rebranding to create a new coherence with the innumerable     communities whose understanding and support are essential.          Alan Hilburg is an avid believer that social entrepreneurship is a doorway to achieving responsible possibilities, and that social entrepreneurs are the      world's greatest bridge builders because they build bridges of difference. Unfortunately, social entrepreneurship is consistently and callously      misunderstood. The idea of applying the knowledge, ethos and ideas of traditional business entrepreneurs to the landscape of social change has captured      many imaginations. And as the popularity of social entrepreneurship grows, there are as many definitions of the dynamic as there are people pursuing      it.          In this workshop, Alan, who brings 30 years of experience as one of the world's leading authorities and innovators on reimagining brands, will discuss his      revisioning strategies for more effectively connecting social entrepreneurs with the incalculable number of communities and markets who are not yet      vested in the mission of social entrepreneurship. This can be achieved by emotional branding which shatters the old rules of branding because it      identifies, articulates and connects consumers with brands in an intensely individual, emotional bond defined by a brand experience built on a      relationship of trust. It's not easy to achieve, but its coherence engages consumers at a deeply personal level that drives their preferences, choices      and decisions.          As an often-sought public speaker, Alan has been described as \"frustratingly insightful, inspirational, stimulating to the point of exhaustion,      illuminating and always elevating.\" He was identified by the London Times, WSJ and Advertising Age as a \"leading brand architect.\" His career includes      guiding six of the top 30 branding campaigns of the 20th century including Johnson and Johnsons Tylenol brand recovery; the creation of GEs Bringing      Good Things to Life; Wendys iconic Wheres the Beef?; and, the creation of the Olympic Torch Run for AT&T. He and his teams also navigated numerous      award-winning campaigns for National Geographic, Coca Cola, Burger King, Gillette, Johnson Wax, World Wrestling Federation, Four Season Hotels,      American Airlines, JPMorganChase, US Air Force, Shell, Chevron, Exxon-Mobil, Micron and other global brands.

{"detail": [{"content": "Neoclassicism to Post-Impressionism at the Metropolitan Museum of Art                                                                       Neoclassicism revived both the subject matter and styles of Greek      and Roman art. The Neoclassical paintings of Jacques-Louis David,      for instance, are characterized by their exceptional clarity and      order and their frieze-like compositions, which recall ancient relief      sculpture and even Greek vase painting. Examples such as The Oath      of the Horatii, created on the eve of the French Revolution, extol      Roman civic virtues like patriotism and loyalty, making them highly      successful vehicles of political propaganda as well as dramatic      works of art.      Both Neoclassicism and Romanticism coincided with the democratic      movements of the late 1770s, and both artistic styles placed value      on emotional content and the idea of \"natural man\". While Neoclassicism      celebrated heroism in service of the State and human reason and      rationality, Romanticism emphasized imagination, intuition, and      the extremes of subjective experience. The Romantic movement fostered      the emergence of the modern idea of the artist as anti-authoritarian      rebel genius. Romantic works depict a range of human emotions from      joy and awe to terror and agony, and artists like Gericault and      Turner expressed moral outrage over contemporary events in history      paintings and landscape.      Realist artists also responded to contemporary events, but instead      of painting from the imagination, they presented the subject matter      of everyday life scenes that they observed and restaged  on a      grand scale formerly reserved for history painting. The consummate      Realist painter in mid-nineteenth-century France, Gustave Courbet      painted unsentimental canvasses that featured the provincial citizens      of his native Ornans in works like Burial at Ornans and Young Ladies      of the Village. Edouard Manet scandalized both the critics and public      with works that flouted middle class morality (Le Djeuner sur l'Herbe;      Olympia). Manet's use of broad areas of flat color with little shading      or modeling (the \"color patch\") reasserted the two-dimensionality      of painting on canvas and influenced the work of the Impressionists.           Building on the achievements of Realist artists, the Impressionists      painted scenes of modern life and middle class leisure in and around      Paris. They often painted directly from nature, creating canvasses      \"en plein air,\" or out-of-doors, in front of the urban or suburban      landscape. They attempted to capture the transitory and ephemeral      character of the modern city and landscape, with special attention      to the effects of light and optical theory, as is especially clear      in the serial paintings of Claude Monet. Impressionist canvasses      reject traditional means of illusionism such as linear perspective,      foreshortening, contour shading and modeling. Instead of creating      the illusion of depth, the Impressionists reinforced the flatness      of the canvas through the build-up of individual brushstrokes of      pure, unblended color (optical color mixture).      The Post-Impressionists emerged as critics of the seeming lack      of structure and symbolic content in Impressionist painting. They      rejected the Impressionists' goal of capturing the momentary and      sought to convey the permanent, but they remained indebted to the      Impressionists' individualized brushstrokes and liberated color.      Paul  Cezanne and Georges Seurat took a more intellectual approach      to painting. While Seurat utilized color theory and the Divisionist      style to depict scenes of Parisian nightlife and outdoor leisure,      Cezanne used cubic, \"axe-cut\" brushstrokes, geometricized forms,      and pure color to reinterpret the \"grand\" themes of Western painting      such as landscape and still life. Paul Gauguin and Vincent Van Gogh,      by contrast, strove for greater emotional and symbolic content in      their paintings. Both artists viewed the city as alienating rather      than utopian. They each sought creative inspiration in the pre-      industrial world, Van Gogh in the South of France and Gauguin in      Brittany and Tahiti. While both artists employ anti-naturalistic      colors, Van Gogh's compositions also rely for expressive effect      on his characteristic gestural brushstroke and impasto surface.

An Evening of Bridging the Unimaginable Heights and Incalculable Difference Social Entrepreneurship      Can Make With Emotional Branding and the New Four Letter \"F\" Word             December 10, 2013       Rudin Family Forum, NYU Wagner                Download the presentation from the event.                  About the Workshop and Alan Hilburg          It's been said that social entrepreneurship is misunderstood, undervalued and requires rebranding to create a new coherence with the innumerable     communities whose understanding and support are essential.          Alan Hilburg is an avid believer that social entrepreneurship is a doorway to achieving responsible possibilities, and that social entrepreneurs are the      world's greatest bridge builders because they build bridges of difference. Unfortunately, social entrepreneurship is consistently and callously      misunderstood. The idea of applying the knowledge, ethos and ideas of traditional business entrepreneurs to the landscape of social change has captured      many imaginations. And as the popularity of social entrepreneurship grows, there are as many definitions of the dynamic as there are people pursuing      it.          In this workshop, Alan, who brings 30 years of experience as one of the world's leading authorities and innovators on reimagining brands, will discuss his      revisioning strategies for more effectively connecting social entrepreneurs with the incalculable number of communities and markets who are not yet      vested in the mission of social entrepreneurship. This can be achieved by emotional branding which shatters the old rules of branding because it      identifies, articulates and connects consumers with brands in an intensely individual, emotional bond defined by a brand experience built on a      relationship of trust. It's not easy to achieve, but its coherence engages consumers at a deeply personal level that drives their preferences, choices      and decisions.          As an often-sought public speaker, Alan has been described as \"frustratingly insightful, inspirational, stimulating to the point of exhaustion,      illuminating and always elevating.\" He was identified by the London Times, WSJ and Advertising Age as a \"leading brand architect.\" His career includes      guiding six of the top 30 branding campaigns of the 20th century including Johnson and Johnsons Tylenol brand recovery; the creation of GEs Bringing      Good Things to Life; Wendys iconic Wheres the Beef?; and, the creation of the Olympic Torch Run for AT&T.

The novel has been for a long time understood by its theorists as the genre par excellence of truthlessness. This course attempts to reevaluate this view, proposing that the 19th-century novel in particular should be understood as responding to the emerging tendency to view truth as inseparable from, rather than opposed to, time. This tendency, then, can be said to account for the specific shape and the remarkable \"success\" of the 19th-century European novel. It is in these novels that narrative's essential relation to time achieves its most dramatic fruition. Readings from Goethe, Hegel, Balzac, Stendhal, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Henry James, Bakhtin, Koj\u00e8ve, Peter Brooks.
