The  course focuses on: 1), the relationship between sociological theory and  research; and 2), methodological issues, such as causality,  identification of mechanisms, the logic of argument, objectivity,  reliability and validity, problems of measurement, representation,  conceptualization, inference, and sampling. The course seeks  to illuminate: (1) how to choose a sociological research project that  is worthwhile and practical; (2) how to choose and use methods adequate  for a research project; (3) how to evaluate the research, evidence, and  arguments offered in support of theoretical claims.           Requirements:         We will run all class meetings as discussions. Every student  must come prepared to every class and participate. Each week, a  written task analysis will be due. A term paper in the form of a  full research proposal will be due at the end of the semester.         The class will be organized around issues of research development and  design. We will use a good, standard textbook by Neuman that  provides a reasonable overview of the knowledge commonly expected in a  basic graduate methodology class in our discipline. We will also  read a variety of other materials that aimed at important issues not  sufficiently explored in this or comparable textbooks.         Written assignments  will include short papers every week. On occasion these will be  group efforts of 2-3 students, otherwise individual efforts. In  the weekly writing tasks, students will attempt to solve research  design issues related to the week's readings. In the second half  of the semester, these weekly efforts will also be aimed at the  research proposal that is the culminating work for the class. All  assignments must be handed in on  time.  I will not give incompletes.         The class discussions will be organized around the weekly writing  assignments. Generally, the weekly pieces will be circulated  among all class members through the class discussion list before   the class meets, and students will be assigned as commentators for  others' papers. These papers are expected to take into account  the assigned readings of the week, but the papers rather than the  readings will be the focus of our discussions.

The  course focuses on: 1), the relationship between sociological theory and  research; and 2), methodological issues, such as causality,  identification of mechanisms, the logic of argument, objectivity,  reliability and validity, problems of measurement, representation,  conceptualization, inference, and sampling. The course seeks  to illuminate: (1) how to choose a sociological research project that  is worthwhile and practical; (2) how to choose and use methods adequate  for a research project; (3) how to evaluate the research, evidence, and  arguments offered in support of theoretical claims.           Requirements:         We will run all class meetings as discussions. Every student  must come prepared to every class and participate. Each week, a  written task analysis will be due. A term paper in the form of a  full research proposal will be due at the end of the semester.         The class will be organized around issues of research development and  design. We will use a good, standard textbook by Neuman that  provides a reasonable overview of the knowledge commonly expected in a  basic graduate methodology class in our discipline. We will also  read a variety of other materials that aimed at important issues not  sufficiently explored in this or comparable textbooks.         Written assignments  will include short papers every week. On occasion these will be  group efforts of 2-3 students, otherwise individual efforts. In  the weekly writing tasks, students will attempt to solve research  design issues related to the week's readings. In the second half  of the semester, these weekly efforts will also be aimed at the  research proposal that is the culminating work for the class. All  assignments must be handed in on  time.  I will not give incompletes.         The class discussions will be organized around the weekly writing  assignments. Generally, the weekly pieces will be circulated  among all class members through the class discussion list before   the class meets, and students will be assigned as commentators for  others' papers. These papers are expected to take into account  the assigned readings of the week, but the papers rather than the  readings will be the focus of our discussions.
