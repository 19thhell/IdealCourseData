Our Story          In 1986, the Association of Black Faculty and Administrators at New York University proposed to the then Chancellor L. Jay Oliva that an all-University honors program be named in memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and support his vision of a world free of racism, poverty, violence, and war. Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars would not only be among the best and brightest, but they would also be asked to give back in the form of service to others. In 1987, the first group of 16 Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars began their studies in the College of Arts and Science, the School of Education, the Tisch School of the Arts, the Stern School of Business and the Gallatin School. They were from California, Florida, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas.   Today, Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are enrolled in all undergraduate divisions of the University, hail from coast to coast, and in May 2015 the Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars Program will graduate its 24th Class.

You must be a U.S. Citizen or Permanent Resident to be eligible for these scholarships.   AnBryce Scholarships   Through the generosity of the AnBryce Foundation, this scholarship is awarded each year to a small number of academically-motivated students who demonstrate financial need and who are the first generation in their family to attend college. The award will cover up to the cost of tuition and is renewable over four years of undergraduate study at NYU. These Scholars will participate in a rich combination of orientation and mentoring programs, as well as educational and cultural activities. Students are expected to maintain a minimum GPA of 3.5 each year and to participate actively in program activities. There is no application to be considered for this scholarship.

Arch Scholarships   This University scholarship is awarded each year to students who demonstrate financial need and who are committed to having a positive impact on the world. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions has partnered with the Wasserman Center for Career Development to create a career development and internship program for these Scholars, which at the onset of the freshman year, will introduce scholars to career options and help them to develop career potential and marketable professional skills. The award will help to meet full need and is renewable over four years of undergraduate study at NYU. There is no application to be considered for this scholarship. Applicants are automatically considered through their admission application materials.          Lewis Rudin City Scholarships   Rudin Scholars are outstanding entering freshmen selected from public and parochial high schools in all five boroughs of New York City. In addition to their scholarship, the scholars participate in academic and cultural activities in New York City. The program is named in honor of the late real estate developer Lewis Rudin, former president of the Association for a Better New York and NYU alumnus and trustee. There is no application to be considered for this scholarship. Applicants are automatically considered through their admission application materials.     Martin Luther King, Jr., Scholarships   Since its inception in 1987, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Scholars Program has awarded over 400 need-based and merit scholarships to incoming freshmen at NYU. These students present records of outstanding academic achievement, leadership, and commitment to the principles of community service, humanitarianism, and social progress.   MLK Scholars help to plan and participate in academic and cultural events that draw on the vast resources of New York University and New York City. They explore cultural diversity through domestic and international travel and take the lead in helping others through community service. There is no application to be considered for this scholarship. Applicants are automatically considered through their admission application materials.     Paths to Peace Scholarships   The Paths to Peace program brings sixteen students of different faiths and backgrounds from Israel and Palestine (West Bank and Gaza) to study together for one semester at New York University, located in the center of New York City. The program is dedicated to training future leaders, endowing them with the skills and experience to advance reconciliation and coexistence for future generations. The academic objective of Paths to Peace is to focus on the historical, political, cultural, and religious relationships between Israelis and Palestinians. All students in the program will be required to take at least two mandatory courses, together with NYU students, on Middle Eastern Politics, and Modern Israel. They will also participate in two weekly workshops to be held on two separate days and to be conducted by experienced Palestinian and Israeli facilitators. Workshop participants will engage in an in-depth process of exploration, observation and analysis of the conflict and will have the opportunity to gain important insights into their identities as well as the dynamics of groups in conflict. Successful applicants will receive a scholarship to cover tuition, room and board, health insurance, books, travel, and a living stipend for the academic semester. You must complete a separate application to be considered for this scholarship. Click here for more information and the application .   Phi Theta Kappa Scholarships   These scholarships are awarded to outstanding community college transfer students who are members of Phi Theta Kappa , the national honor society for two-year colleges. Transfer students from all colleges who are members of Phi Theta Kappa and have participated in the Phi Theta Kappa programs are eligible for consideration.        Finish Line Grant   The Finish Line Grant is a product of NYU's Momentum Campaign -- a six-year effort to raise $1 billion to improve financial aid at NYU -- and is intended to ensure additional grant assistance that will contribute towards lowering debt upon graduation.   The Finish Line Grant program is subject to institutional review and availability.                                                    Finish Line Award Grant Criteria                               No application is necessary. All eligible students will be evaluated and awarded automatically.   To be eligible, a student must:     Be an NYU undergraduate identified as being in their final semester based on traditional credit load for their program. (For most programs, credit completion occurs at 128 earned credits).   Be enrolled at NYU in the semester of estimated graduation.   Have received federal subsidized loan disbursements (Direct Subsidized or Federal Perkins) applicable to their cost of attendance at some point in their NYU undergraduate career.     Recipients should note:     The total amount of a student's financial aid, including the amount of the Finish Line grant, cannot exceed the student's total cost of attendance for the semester. If it is necessary to reduce any portion of the student's financial aid to accommodate the Finish Line Grant, this portion will be reduced in accordance with federal guidance.   The amount awarded will be 10% of the total amount of subsidized federal student loan(s) borrowed during attendance at NYU, up to traditional program length. Loans considered include Direct Subsidized Loans and Federal Perkins Loans.   The Finish Line Grant is offered once per student. It will be applied towards the student\u2019s outstanding balance at NYU first, and if there are no additional charges and the student is otherwise eligible, the remaining amount will be awarded as a refund.                          Outside Scholarships That Can Be Used at NYU   In addition to NYU scholarships, you may be eligible for a scholarship or grant from an outside agency or organization. NYU would then reduce the amount of any loan you were initially allocated, and allow you to apply your outside scholarship or grant to your cost of attending NYU.   You should aggressively pursue these options through your or your parents' employers, unions, professional organizations, and community and special interest groups. There are also a number of free scholarship search services available, many of which are featured under &quot;Scholarship Search Services&quot; on the NYU Office of Financial Aid website . We recommend, however, that you do not pay for any scholarship search service.

The understanding of the legacy that informs the Scholars Program includes the themes of \u201cthe beloved community\u201d and social justice - Dr. King\u2019s commitment to the proposition that inclusive and just communities are communities where individuals can grow and thrive. An all-University honors program, the MLK, Jr. Scholars Program     Promotes excellence in academic achievement and leadership   Builds Community   Helps to prepare and nurture the next generation of leadership for change     The Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars Program is more than an academic scholarship and requires more of students than outstanding grades. Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are enrolled in full-time study and complete their degrees in one of NYU\u2019s undergraduate divisions. In addition, Scholars are awarded a merit and need-based financial aid package and participate in a rich combination of scholarly activities, domestic and international travel colloquia, research, leadership activities including community service, and educational and cultural activities.        Our Story          In 1986, the Association of Black Faculty and Administrators at New York University proposed to the then Chancellor L. Jay Oliva that an all-University honors program be named in memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and support his vision of a world free of racism, poverty, violence, and war. Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars would not only be among the best and brightest, but they would also be asked to give back in the form of service to others. In 1987, the first group of 16 Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars began their studies in the College of Arts and Science, the School of Education, the Tisch School of the Arts, the Stern School of Business and the Gallatin School. They were from California, Florida, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas.   Today, Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are enrolled in all undergraduate divisions of the University, hail from coast to coast, and in May 2015 the Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars Program will graduate its 24th Class.

Finish Line Grant   The Finish Line Grant is a product of NYU's Momentum Campaign -- a six-year effort to raise $1 billion to improve financial aid at NYU -- and is intended to ensure additional grant assistance that will contribute towards lowering debt upon graduation.   The Finish Line Grant program is subject to institutional review and availability.                                                    Finish Line Award Grant Criteria                               No application is necessary. All eligible students will be evaluated and awarded automatically.   To be eligible, a student must:     Be an NYU undergraduate identified as being in their final semester based on traditional credit load for their program. (For most programs, credit completion occurs at 128 earned credits).   Be enrolled at NYU in the semester of estimated graduation.   Have received federal subsidized loan disbursements (Direct Subsidized or Federal Perkins) applicable to their cost of attendance at some point in their NYU undergraduate career.     Recipients should note:     The total amount of a student's financial aid, including the amount of the Finish Line grant, cannot exceed the student's total cost of attendance for the semester. If it is necessary to reduce any portion of the student's financial aid to accommodate the Finish Line Grant, this portion will be reduced in accordance with federal guidance.   The amount awarded will be 10% of the total amount of subsidized federal student loan(s) borrowed during attendance at NYU, up to traditional program length. Loans considered include Direct Subsidized Loans and Federal Perkins Loans.   The Finish Line Grant is offered once per student. It will be applied towards the student\u2019s outstanding balance at NYU first, and if there are no additional charges and the student is otherwise eligible, the remaining amount will be awarded as a refund.                          Outside Scholarships That Can Be Used at NYU   In addition to NYU scholarships, you may be eligible for a scholarship or grant from an outside agency or organization. NYU would then reduce the amount of any loan you were initially allocated, and allow you to apply your outside scholarship or grant to your cost of attending NYU.   You should aggressively pursue these options through your or your parents' employers, unions, professional organizations, and community and special interest groups. There are also a number of free scholarship search services available, many of which are featured under &quot;Scholarship Search Services&quot; on the NYU Office of Financial Aid website . We recommend, however, that you do not pay for any scholarship search service.

Presidential Honors Scholars, Advanced Honors Seminars, and Departmental Honors programs are some of these opportunities (Freshman Honors Seminars are now required of all incoming CAS students; these courses remain rigorous and devoted to academic inquiry at a sophisticated level).      Presidential Honors Scholars           The top five percent of the entering class is invited to join; students may also apply for entry after they have matriculated, having demonstrated superlative academic achievement and a consistent record of leadership and service to the community. In this program, students will be able to: Receive special advising from College faculty and staff Challenge themselves in honors courses and through independent research Study abroad Take advantage of New York City's cultural resources, and develop leadership skills through community service.      Activities include: Scholars Lecture Series Cultural events in the city Community service projects Freshman Honors Seminar Study abroad intersession Trips    Scholars are admitted as freshmen directly from high school. Membership in the Scholars Program is renewable annually, depending on the quality of the scholar's academic records and his or her level of participation in the program. All scholars are expected to be full-time students and maintain a grade point average of at least 3.65.    Students interested in joining the program have the opportunity to apply in the spring term prior to their sophomore year. Applications are available in the Dean's office, Silver Center, Room 909, each year after spring break.    Freshman Seminars     This first-year requirement offers freshmen the opportunity to be in a small, intellectually stimulating class taught by a distinguished faculty member. Introduce students to demanding and challenging standards of analysis and argumentation, oral as well as written, by means of intensive discussion, papers on focused topics, and reading that emphasizes critical interpretation rather than absorption of information.      Except where noted, the seminars do not assume any specific course or background on the student's part. Each seminar is 4 points, and enrollment is limited to 18 students.       Advanced Honors Seminars    Established in response to the popularity and success of the Freshman Honors Seminars, the Advanced Honors Seminars are primarily designed for sophomores and juniors in the College. Offered in the spring of each year, they give students the same opportunity to come into direct contact with great ideas and great thinkers in small seminars taught by distinguished professors from throughout the University faculty. Each seminar is 4 credits and enrollment is usually limited to 18 students. Departmental Honors      Many departments and programs offer talented and highly motivated juniors and seniors the opportunity to take individual honors courses or to enroll in special honors programs that often culminate in the writing of a thesis under faculty supervision. See the individual departmental listings for further information.               WINS - Women in Science at NYU    A selective program for highly motivated women planning careers in science and mathematics    Did you know that there are more women than men at many liberal arts colleges but that nationally women are underrepresented in scientific and mathematical studies and research? To address this shortage, the College of Arts and Science at NYU has instituted the Women in Science (WINS) program that will capitalize on the talents of women undergraduates who are interested in careers that focus on research in science and math. A core group of women, WINS Scholars, are selected from each entering class whose interests and abilities are nurtured through a highly individualized program of study, research, and mentoring.   WINS seeks to foster the talents and support the aspirations of young women preparing for professional and academic careers that involve research in anthropology, bio-chemistry, biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, neural science, physics, or psychology.
