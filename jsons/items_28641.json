Nepal Earthquake Disaster Email Scams (Alert)   In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Nepal, just like major disasters before it, human nature is often at its best, but for some, it is at its worst. Following major disasters, scammers usually send out floods of email in an attempt to either solicit donations for fake charities, or else to lure users into clicking links containing malware or responding to phishing attempts.

You will then need to configure your mobile device; see the   Setting Up Your Mobile Device tab for instructions.          Mobile devices, such as smart phones, PDAs, and tablets, are computers with advanced operating systems capable of    running robust applications and storing large amounts of data. It is essential that you enable the appropriate security controls    to protect the data you store and access on them. In addition, the use of any mobile device to send, receive, view, transmit or store    University related data must adhere to the Policy on Responsible Use of NYU Computers and Data.
