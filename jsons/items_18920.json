Payroll Procedures    Q. I have not yet completed my Wasserman Forms? Can I start working?    Q. I do not have a myTime tab OR I can't log into myTime OR myTime kicks me out OR myTime won't let me make entries OR WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS DAMN MYTIME? What should I do?    Q. I work with several teachers. Do all of them need to sign my Workschedule and my timesheets?    Q. When and where do I submit the paper timesheets?    Q. When is myTime due?    Q. How do I get paid for the Orientation?    Q. How do I get paid for the time I spent at my school waiting to see the principal, to see my teacher, and/or to work out a schedule with my teacher? (This will only apply when you first start the program and visit your school.)    Q. How do I get paid for work in an after-school program?    Q. Will I get paid for a lunch hour or time on the playground.? If so, how.    Q. I only worked in the second week of the Pay Period. (Or, I only worked in the first week of the Pay Period.) How do I fill out my timesheet?    Q. When will I be paid?    Q. I couldn&rsquo;t turn my timesheet (and/or submit myTime) in by the deadline and turned them in \"late\"? Will I still be paid?    Q. If I missed the deadlines and turned my timesheet in late. should I wait until the next deadline and turn the timesheet in (and do myTime) at the end of the following Pay Period with my next timesheet?    Q. I made a mistake in my calculations on my paper timesheet? How can I correct this? Do I need to have a new timesheet signed by my teacher?    Q. I have Direct Deposit. When will I start getting checks, and when will checks be deposited to my account each Pay Period?    Q. I don't have Direct Deposit. When and where can I pick up my checks?     Q: Can I turn my timesheet in late (and/or do myTime late) and still be paid on time?    Q: But I&rsquo;m dead broke. I desperately need that paycheck? Can&rsquo;t you make an exception one time?     Q. I forgot to do myTime. What can I do?     Q: Are there any penalties for turning in a timesheet(or doing myTime) late?    Q. I am supposed to get premium pay because of my school location and/or year in school, but I am getting standard pay? Why and how can I correct this?    Q: I didn&rsquo;t work the 6 hour minimum one week. Will I still be paid?    Q: I didn&rsquo;t work the 6 hour minimum one week. Do I need to make the time up?    Q: I didn&rsquo;t work at all one Pay Period. Should I still turn in a timesheet?    Q: My teacher was absent on my last day of work during the Pay Period, and I couldn&rsquo;t get her signature. Can I turn it in without a teacher&rsquo;s signature?    Q: Could I have the substitute sign the timesheet the timesheet? Or the principal? Or the America Reads coordinator?    Q: I forgot to turn in a timesheet for the last Pay Period. Can I just put all the hours on my next timesheet?     Q: I turned in a timesheet, but I forgot to put some time that I worked on it. Can I just add that time to my next timesheet?    Q. What happens if I don't give the yellow copy of my signed timesheet to my teacher?    Q: Forecasting hours. Example: I work on Thursday and Friday, but my teacher will be away after Wednesday of the second week. Can I just forecast the hours on Thursday and Friday that I will work and put them on the timesheet, and have the teacher sign it on Wednesday?    Q: I&rsquo;ve learned that I can work more hours each week than I put on my Workschedule OR I can&rsquo;t work as many hours as I said on my original Workschedule. Do I need to turn in a new Workschedule?    Q. How can I check my Federal Work Study Balance? You've said that sometimes NYU takes away federal work study. If that happens -- o r, if I keep working after if I run out of FWS -- I will need to refund all the money I've been paid after that time. How can I avoid this?    Q: Do I have this job for the entire school year?    Q. Half of my federal works study is awarded for the Fall semester; half for the Spring. Does this limit the amount I can earn any semester?             Answers to Some Common Questions about Payroll Procedures    Q. I have not yet completed my Wasserman Forms? Can I start working?    Yes, you can start working...and must start working before the deadline we have given you...but you cannot be put on payroll until we have the Wasserman form. If you are working, submit your paper timesheets by the deadline and keep the pink copy safe to enter myTime once you have submitted the Wasserman forrms. (You will not have access to myTime until you have done so.) If you do not complete the Wasserman form, you cannot be paid. When you do submit the Wasserman form, you will be paid for all the work you have done up until that time, and going forward.    We understand that sometimes you need to get ID from home, etc. That's okay. But please understand that this will delay your paychecks.    Once everything has been completed, and you start getting checks, there will be no more delays if you meet the deadlines for submitting timesheets and myTime.    Top of Page    Q.

Remember: you must be on campus to use myTime unless you download NYU VPN from the NYU ITS site on your NYU Home. If you're off-campus, you can use VPN to enter myTime from home, etc. However, we have found that VPN often does not work smoothly, so we encourage you to do these entries from on campus.    If you have just started or returned to the program, you must submit the proper forms from the Wasserman Center (Form A or B), in order for us to begin the processing necessary for you to view and submit your timesheets via NYU myTime. If you are a new tutor, you must turn the Wasserman form into our office. If you are a returning tutor, you need to tell us that you have done your Reappointment form online.    Once we have this, it can take some time to get you processed onto payroll. We do it as quickly as we can, but at some point it is out of our hands and the Payroll Office needs to complete it. As a result, some tutors, especially those just starting, are not able to view and submit myTime at the time when their first timesheet is due. In the majority of cases, you will be able to access myTime during the following pay period.    If this is your situation, simply turn in the white copy of the timesheet to our mailbox, give the yellow copy to your teacher (as always) and keep the pink copy for yourself. When myTime does appear, you will be able to use the pink copy to enter your hours correctly. The paper timesheet and myTime must conform exactly.    If you are still not able to access myTime and are experiencing an abnormal delay, please contact askPeopleLink@nyu.edu or call them at (212) 992-LINK (5565) and see what they say the problem is. Often, they can fix it. Then contact us if there is anything we need to do. Do not hesitate to call them or email and complain if things are not working. You are entitled to know your situation. Unfortunately, we can't correct these problems. They must do so.    Top of Page    Q. I work with several teachers. Do all of them need to sign my Workschedule and my timesheets?    No. Only one teacher needs to sign your Workschedule, and that will be the teacher who signs all of your timesheets. It should be apparent which teacher is this primary teacher. Of course, you need to be sure the primary teacher is reasonably aware of when you're working.    Top of Page    Q. When and where do I submit the paper timesheets?    Put the white copy in our mailbox in the lobby of 25 W. 4th St. (right hand entrance as you face the building.) It is due by Noon on the Monday after the Sunday end of the Pay Period, but can be put in the box as soon as all the work shown on the timesheet has been completed and it has been signed by your teacher.    We will soon have a place for School of Engineering students to deposit signed timesheerts, pick up new timesheets, etc. on the Brooklyn campus.    Give the yellow copy to your teacher. Do this as soon as she/he signs it. Tear it off and give it to her/him. You will not be paid unless this is done.    Keep the pink copy for yourself in case any problems arise, and to guide you in entering myTime. Your paper timesheet and myTime must conform exactly.    Top of Page    Q. When is myTime due?    The deadline for myTime is midnight on the Sunday at the end of each Pay Period. You must both turn in your paper timesheet, and do your myTime, by the deadlines to get paid on time (i.e., two weeks after the end of the Pay Period.) You can both turn in the paper timesheet and do myTime before the deadline as long as all the work you are claiming has been completed and your timesheet has been signed by your teacher.    Remember: you must be on campus to use myTime unless you download NYU VPN from the NYU ITS site. If you're on campus, you can use VPN to enter myTime from home, etc. However, we have found that VPN often does not work smoothly, so we encourage you to do these entries from on campus.    Top of Page    Q. How do I get paid for the Orientation?    You will not be paid for the Orientation unless and until you start working at your school, so don't submit a timesheet that has only Orientation hours on it. It will not be processed. Orientation hours should go on the Second Saturday or Sunday (sometimes we say one thing; sometimes another; either of these is fine) of the first timesheet you use that has school hours on it. You will put the other hours that ;you worked in that Pay Period on the timesheet where they properly go, and leave the Orientation hours on the second saturday (whatever the date; we will know what it is. This is the only time you will ever include Saturday hours.)    When you do myTime, you should put the Orientation hours as they appear on your paper timesheet--the second Saturday or Sunday -- whatever that date is. (It will necessarily not be the actual date of the Orientation.) This is the only time you will put hours on a timesheet that are not entered on the day and time when the work was actually done.    The best approach is to use the timesheet from your Orientation folder where we instructed you to put on the Orientation hours. The Pay period end date for this timesheet will be the end date of whatever Pay Period you start working in.    The same teacher who signs your Workschedule, and who will sign your timesheets throughout -- i.e, your primary teacher -- will sign this timesheet. If they question the Orientation time, just explain.    Top of Page    Q. How do I get paid for the time I spent at my school waiting to see the principal, to see my teacher, and/or to work out a schedule with my teacher? (This will only apply when you first start the program and visit your school.)    We will pay you (within reason) for the time you spend waiting to be assigned to a teacher, working out your schedule, etc. This time should go on your first timesheet (ideally the one you got in your Orientation folder and on which you put your Orientation hours.) The Pay Period end date for this timesheet will be the end date of whatever Pay Period the activity occurs. On the timesheet, put the exact time and date of the activity, and include the hours in your totals just as you would any other time. if the teacher questions the time, explain that you are paid for waiting, etc.    When you enter your myTime, the time will be entered at exactly the same time that it appears on your timesheet. As you know, the Orientation hours on the timesheet will be entered in myTime on the second Saturday or Sunday as the timesheet, whatever that date is (even though you did not actually work at that time.)    The same teacher who signs your Workschedule, and who will sign your timesheets throughout -- i.e, your primary teacher -- will sign this timesheet.    Top of Page    Q. How do I get paid for work in an after-school program?    You can work in afterschool programs run by your school or by an outside organization (this is the most common situation.) As is the case in the school day, you must always work in the presence of a licensed professional. You cannot be alone with or in charge of children.    You can put the times you work on your regular timeseet, Include them with all your other time in your totals. Your regular teacher will sign the timesheet for all the hours, including afterschool time. You wil enter them in myTime just as they appear on the timesheet.    The challenge is making sure your regular teacher can verify that you were there in the afterschool program and did the work. It is unlikely that the teacher will be in the afterschool prorgram. So you need to find a consistent and reliable way for whoever supervises you in the afterschool program to communicate with your regular teacher to verify your work. You might try developing a little form yourself that shows days, start and end times in the afterschool program (similar to, but far less complicated than our regular timesheets.) As you do with your school day hours, enter these days and times each time you work in the afterschool program., have your after school supervisor sign it, then give it to your regular teacher when you present the teacher with your timesheet to be signed at the end of the pay period. The teacher could clip this note to the Yellow copy that you will give to the teacher.    You may not work in the evenings, on weekends or any time the school is closed. You may not grade papers or exams at night; prepare lessons over the weekend, etc. You may only be paid for time you are actually in the shcool working (or otherwise interacting) with children and teachers.    Top of Page    Q. Will I get paid for a lunch hour or time on the playground.? If so, how.    You will be paid for lunch if you have lunch with your students or with your teacher to discuss the work with children. Put this on the timeseet and enter it on myTime just as all other time. This is also the case if you go to the playground    You may take a lunch hour away from children and teachers, and even leave the school, but you will not be paid for this time and should not put it on your timesheet.    Remember: As is always the case, you must always be in the presence of a licensed professional. You may not be alone with or in charge of children.    Top of Page    Q. I only worked in the second week of the Pay Period. (Or, I only worked in the first week of the Pay Period.) How do I fill out my timesheet?    As you always do, put the hours on the timesheet exactly when the work was performed. If you only worked in the second week of the Pay Period, leave all of the items in the first week blank. Similarly, if you only worked in the first week, leave the second week blank.    A good way to keep this straight is to put the Pay Period end date at the bottom of the left hand date column, and then work your way back up to the first day of the Pay Period.    And, of course, to enter your time each day you go rather than waitng until the end of the Pay Period and trying to remember (or expect your teacher to remember) when you were there over that time.    Top of Page    Q. When will I be paid?    If you meet the deadlines for submitting both the paper timesheet and myTime, you will be paid two weeks later (i.e., at the end of the next Pay Period.) Checks are distributed on the Friday and the Monday at the end/beginning of each Pay Period. If you have direct deposit, we don't know when the checks will get into your account, but it should be around Friday at the end of the next Pay Period. Please note that the first check is sometimes delayed. Don't worry. You will be paid . If this creates a financial crisis for you, come see us and we can arrange for an emergency, no-interest, no-hassle loan that will be repaid from subsequent checks.    Top of Page    Q. I couldn&rsquo;t turn my timesheet (and/or submit myTime) in by the deadline? Will I still be paid?    A: Yes. You will always be paid for your work (assuming you have money in your FWS account.) The &ldquo;deadline&rdquo; is simply the time by which a timesheet (or myTime) needs to be submitted for a check to be ready for you 2 weeks later. If you miss the &ldquo;deadline,&rdquo; simply turn in the timesheet (and do myTime) as soon as possible thereafter. Your check will be delayed by one pay cycle, but you will be paid.    Do not add the hours to your next timesheet. This is grounds for dismissal.    Do not wait until the end of the next Pay Period to turn in the timesheet and do myTime. Do this as soon as the timesheet is signed.    Top of Page    Q. If I missed the deadline, should I wait until the next deadline and turn the timesheet in (and do myTime) at the end of the following Pay Period with my next timesheet?    A: No. You should not wait until a &ldquo;deadline&rdquo; to turn in any timesheet, and certainly not one that is late. You should turn in every timesheet as soon as all the work shown on it has been done and your teacher has signed it. Turn a \"late\" timesheet in as soon as you possible can after the deadline. The earlier we get the timesheet, the sooner we can start processing it.    If you are turning it on Monday, but after noon, or Tuesday morning, bring it up to our office on the 5th Floor (until 5 pm.) This way we will have a better chance of getting it approved so you can be paid on time. Of course, you must have done myTime, because we can't approve myTime without a timesheet to compare it to.    Top of Page    Q. I made a mistake in my calculations on my paper timesheet? How can I correct this? Do I need to have a new timesheet signed by my teacher?    A. If you made an arithmetic mistake but the start and end dates and times on the paper timesheet are correct, just enter this information in myTime exactly as it appears on the paper timesheet (as you're always supposed to do. myTIme will do the math correctly, and that's what your paycheck will be based on. You don't need to get a new timesheet signed or make any other corrections.    If the problem is something else...you realize you put down hours you didn't work, or you put the wrong start and end times on the paper timesheet, you will need to do another, correct timesheet, have it signed, and use it as the guide to enter your myTime.    Top of Page    Q. I have Direct Deposit. When will I start getting checks, and when will checks be deposited to my account each Pay Period?    We play no role in Direct Deposit and cannot answer these questions or solve Direct Deposit problems. You will need to direct your questions to askPeopleLink@nyu.edu or call them at (212) 992-LINK (5565). If you do not get your first check through Direct Deposit when you think you should have, you can try coming to our check distribution window on the Friday/Monday at the end/beginning of each Pay Period, but, if your check is not there, we will not be able to answer anyquestions.    Top of Page    Q. I don't have Direct Deposit. When and where can I pick up my checks?    We distribute checks on the Friday/Monday at the end/beginning of each Pay Period on the first floor of 25 W. 4th St. (left entrance as you face the building) at Window 22 between 11 am and 5 pm. You must pick up your check in person, and have your NYU ID. No one can pick it up for you, and we will not mail it (except at the end of a year; we will give you instructions at those times.) If these times are impossible for you, contact us and we'll try to make other arrangements.    Top of Page    Q: Can I turn my timesheet in late (and/or do myTime late) and still be paid on time?    This is not something under our control. You don&rsquo;t need our permission to turn in a timesheet \"late,\" (i.e., after the \"deadline\") and we cannot get you paid on time if you do. Deadlines are set by myTime and the NYU Payroll office. Sometimes we are able to approve timesheets a little bit late and it will make it through. Other times, it won&rsquo;t. We will process them as quickly as possible, but we do not have the power to issue paychecks, extend deadlines, etc.    The sooner you turn it in after the deadline (ideally by bringing it to our office on the 5th Floor), the better the chance you have of getting paid on time.    Top of Page    Q: But I&rsquo;m dead broke. I desperately need that paycheck? Can&rsquo;t you make an exception one time?    It&rsquo;s not that we won&rsquo;t -- we can&rsquo;t. But while we do not have the power to issue paychecks or extend deadlines, if you are desperate, we can often get you a short-term, interest free loan from the University that you can pay back once you start turning in timesheets on time and getting paid on time. Email us and tell us if that&rsquo;s your situation.    Top of Page    Q. I forgot to do myTime. What should I do?    A. You can access myTime going back two pay periods. If you realize you have not done myTime before the end of two pay periods since it was due, just go to myTime and do it. If you no longer have access to that Pay Period, you will need to bring your copy of the paper timesheet to our office and someone will do it for you.    Top of Page       Q: Are there any penalties for turning in a timesheet(or doing myTime) late?    A: Unless it becomes a regular occurrence, there are no penalties imposed by us, but there is an intrinsic penalty: if 2 (or more) timesheets come in during the same period (e.g. one after a &ldquo;deadline&rdquo; and one before the next &ldquo;deadline&rdquo;) the hours will be combined by the Payroll office and one check will be issued. Because taxes are calculated and withheld based on the annualized total of each paycheck, the amount of taxes withheld from that check will be greater than the total that would have been withheld in two separate checks. (However, the withholding rate while school is in session is so low that it likely won&rsquo;t make much difference.)    Also, if a timesheet is more than two Pay Periods late, you can no longer access that period in myTime to enter those hours. In that case, you will need to bring your paper copy of the timesheet to our office and ask us to override the system and enter your myTime hours for you. Please make every effort to avoid this, as it places an unnecessary burden of time on both you and us.    If you consistently turn in timesheets late, it is difficult for us to know if you are working consistently; it is unfair to ask your teacher to think back on prior days you worked long in the past; it causes us extra work. If this occurs, we will investigate your timesheets carefully with your teacher and likely terminte your employment.    It is easy to turn in a timeshet. The lobby of 25 W. 4 th St. is open every weeknight from 7 am until 10 pm, on Saturdays until 5 pm (closed on Sundays.) Turning in a timesheet on time, either by you or a friend should be relatively easy.    Top of Page    Q. I am supposed to get premium pay because of my school location and/or year in school, but I am getting standard pay? Why and how can I correct this?    To get you paid as soon as possible, we start the appointment process as soon as we can, before we know for certain where tutors will end up working. Therefore, we appoint all undergrads at $11/hour and all grad students at $13/hour. Once things have settled, and it's clear that you will continue at your originally assigned school, and that that school location calls for premium pay, we will make the adjustment. In a subsequent check, all underpayments will be made up: i.e., you will get any additional pay to which you were entitled but did not get originally.    Top of Page    Q: I didn&rsquo;t work the 6 hour minimum one week. Will I still be paid?    Yes. You will always be paid for your work, even if it&rsquo;s only 15 minutes in an entire Pay Period. We understand that sometimes people miss work, don&rsquo;t meet the minimum number of hours, etc. This is okay. It&rsquo;s only if you consistently fail to meet your obligation of 6 hours per week that will prompt us to take remedial action.    Top of Page    Q: I didn&rsquo;t work the 6 hour minimum one week. Do I need to make the time up?    No. This is not a program where you are paid a regular stipend and need to make up missed work. You are paid only for the work that you do. You can work extra time whenever you want to and it&rsquo;s okay with the teacher, but you don&rsquo;t need to make up the time that you miss.    However, as the end of the semester approaches, if you have fallen far behind the number of hours you should have worked in the semester, we may decide not to continue you employment. As you may recall from your Orientation, we expect you to be a consistent presence in the classroom and if you have not honored this, you jeopardize your ability to continue in the program.    Top of Page    Q: I didn&rsquo;t work at all one Pay Period. Should I still turn in a timesheet?    No. If you didn&rsquo;t work, there is no reason to turn in a timesheet or to do myTime. Just be sure you keep the Pay Periods straight on myTime and enter time there for the Pay Period you actually work.    Top of Page    Q: My teacher was absent on my last day of work during the Pay Period, and I couldn&rsquo;t get her signature. Can I turn it in without a teacher&rsquo;s signature?    No. We will not process a timesheet without a teacher&rsquo;s signature. It&rsquo;s unfortunate if a teacher&rsquo;s absence makes you miss a deadline, but that&rsquo;s the situation. You should have it signed as soon as possible when the teacher returns, and turn it in right away. Don&rsquo;t wait until the next &rdquo;deadline.&rdquo;    Top of Page    Q: Could I have the substitute sign the timesheet the timesheet? Or the principal? Or the America Reads coordinator?    A: Maybe. The point of the signature is to verify that you worked, not just to have a signature. If the principal or coordinator can verify the time &ndash; it&rsquo;s best if the school has a sign-in system or timeclock that allows them to see when you were there &ndash; they can sign it. Similarly, if the teacher leaves a note for the sub indicating when you worked, or if you can show the sub a sign in sheet, that would be okay. Under no circumstances should you sign for the teacher.    Top of Page    Q: I forgot to turn in a timesheet for the last Pay Period. Can I just put all the hours on my next timesheet?    A: No. All time on timesheets must be entered at exactly the time the work was done. If you forgot to do a timesheet, do it as soon as you remember, have it signed, and turn it in. You can never put time on a timesheet if it wasn&rsquo;t done at that time. If the timesheet goes back more than 2 Pay Periods, you will likely not be able to do myTime for that Pay Period. Bring your timesheet into our office and see Marina and she will help with myTime.    Top of Page    Q: I turned in a timesheet, but I forgot to put some time that I worked on it. Can I just add that time to my next timesheet?    No. As noted above. you can never put time on a timesheet that wasn&rsquo;t done at that actual time. If it&rsquo;s a major concern to you, come to the office to discuss it and we&rsquo;ll find a way to work it out.    Top of Page    Q. What happens if I don't give the yellow copy of my signed timesheet to my teacher?    This is a very serious violation of our policy. We will not process the timesheet. We will instruct you to come get it, take it to the teacher and explain your failure, give the teacher the timesheet, and submit it again to us. This will almost certainly delay your paycheck by at least one Pay Period (two weeks.) If it happens more than once, we may choose to terminate your empoyment. Be sure your teacher understands that he/she must keep the yellow copy on file in their room for the entire year.    Top of Page    Q: Forecasting hours. Example: I work on Thursday and Friday, but my teacher will be away after Wednesday of the second week. Can I just forecast the hours on Thursday and Friday that I will work and put them on the timesheet, and have the teacher sign it on Wednesday?    No. Forecasting hours and having a timesheet signed by a teacher is grounds for immediate dismissal. Under no circumstances should you do this. It's unfortunate if this occurs, but if it does, just have the teacher sign it as soon as he/she returns and turn it in right away.    Top of Page    Q: I&rsquo;ve learned that I can work more hours each week than I put on my Workschedule OR  I can&rsquo;t work as many hours as I said on my original Workschedule. Do I need to turn in a new Workschedule?    No. As long as you are working with the same teacher who signed the original Workschedule, and you continue to meet the minimum requirement, you do not need to turn in a new Workschedule If you occasionally work too few hours, or if you occasionally are able to work more hours, that&rsquo;s fine. Don&rsquo;t turn in a new Workschedule.    But if the primary teacher you are working with, and who will be in a position to sign your timesheets, changes, you must submit a new Workschedule with the new teacher&rsquo;s name, email address and signature. If you do this, please put &ldquo;New Teacher&rdquo; or &ldquo;Replacement Worksheet&rdquo; in the upper right hand corner of the new Workschedule.    And if your hours will fall below the 6 hour per week minimum, you need to inform us of that and we need to consider what to do.    Top of Page    Q. How can I check my Federal Work Study Balance? You've said that sometimes NYU takes away federal work study. If that happens -- o r, if I keep working after if I run out of FWS -- I will need to refund all the money I've been paid after that time. How can I avoid this?    First, be absolutely sure you have accepted your FWS. On Albert, under Student Center/Finances, scroll down to Accept/Decline Awards. Click on 2015. Be sure you have checked that you accept your Federal Work Study award for 2014-2015. You only need to do this once. Or you can go into the Office of Financial Aid at 25 W. 4th St. (First Floor) and accept it in person.    Second, you should personally keep a record of your declining balance. Write down, or enter into a spreadsheet, how much FWS you start with. Then, every time you turn in a timesheet, deduct the amount on the timesheet. This way, you will always know how much you have left... UNLESS...    ...NYU takes away your FWS which, believe it or not, can and does happen. Pay careful attention to any mail you get from the NYU Office of Financial Aid , and tell people at your home address to do so too, since a notice that your FWS has been rescinded or modified should be sent there. If you get such a notice, stop working and notify us immediately and we'll see if we can help.    Another way to keep an eye on this is to look at every paycheck stub when you get it (or view it online if you have direct deposit.) If your FWS has not been rescinded, it will say \"AM READS\" on the stub. If it says \"REG STU,\" your FWS has been rescinded. Again, stop working and contact us immediately.    Third, you can, and should, check your FWS balance on Albert regularly. If what you see there concerning your FWS balance gives you concern, contact the Office of Financial Aid at (212) 998-4444 or contact PeopleLink at askPeopleLink@nyu.edu or call them at (212) 992-LINK (5565). Note that sometimes this is not completely up-to-date, but it's a good way to check.    While this is usually not something to worry about, you do need to make absolutely certain that you have enough money in your Federal Work Study allotment to keep working. If you award is rescinded, or if you use up all your money, you must stop working immediately and contact us to see if we can help, and to avoid getting money you will need to repay.    Top of Page    Q: Do I have this job for the entire school year?    Yes. If all goes well, we will continue your employment through the Spring semester (as long as you have money in your federal work study allotment.) We will ask all tutors to submit a new signed Workschedule in the Spring. And we will hold a job for you next year if you want us to.    However, if you do not want to work in the Spring, or can&rsquo;t, for whatever reason, that&rsquo;s okay. We will hold a job for you next Fall provided you have worked a reasonable number of hours and submit an Exit Evaluation as we request.    Top of Page    Q. Half of my federal works study is awarded for the Fall semester; half for the Spring. Does this limit the amount I can earn any semester?    No. You are not penalized for going under or going over half of your allotment in the first semester. All we care about is that you not exceed your allotment for the entire academic year. Moreover, you can earn your entire allotment in any one semester, if you can work that much.    Top of Page          This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.
