Choices communities have been designated by the University as areas in which residents have a particular commitment to maintaining an environment free of alcohol and controlled substances.   Choices community residents will be selected based on an application process. The information you provide in this application will be kept confidential.   Applications will be available on-line for all students who are guaranteed housing and meet all application and payment deadlines. You must re-apply for NYU Housing before you apply to live in Choices.   You will be notified via your NYU e-mail address if you have been selected for a Choices Floor. Individuals not selected for a Choices assignment will go through the general Housing assignment process (please find complete details on the reapplication section of this site ), but will remain on the waiting list for a Choices community vacancy, should one become available during the academic year.     For more information regarding the Choices communities, please contact the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services at (212) 998-4600.          Where are the Choices communities?   We have four Choices communities across campus. For upperclass students, the communities are located in Coral Tower and Palldium Special Interest Suites (one large suite comprised of both single and double rooms that share a common space and kitchen). You can indicate your preference for Coral or Palladium on the housing reapplication.   For first-year students , the communities are in Third North (apartment style) and Rubin Hall (traditional style). You may specify on your application your preference between Third North and Rubin.                                              How do I apply for Choices?   Incoming students may access the Choices application through the NYU Housing application (available through NYUHome: Housing Forms).   When will I find out if I was placed in Choices?   Incoming first-year students will find out their Choices placement in Early July.   Returning students will receive an e-mail with your Choices community placement information in late March. You will select your room through the online room selection process during Phase 2 of the Room Selection Process (early April).

Choices communities have been designated by the University as areas in which residents have a particular commitment to maintaining an environment free of alcohol and controlled substances.   Choices community residents will be selected based on an application process. The information you provide in this application will be kept confidential.   Applications will be available on-line for all students who are guaranteed housing and meet all application and payment deadlines. You must re-apply for NYU Housing before you apply to live in Choices.   You will be notified via your NYU e-mail address if you have been selected for a Choices Floor. Individuals not selected for a Choices assignment will go through the general Housing assignment process (please find complete details on the reapplication section of this site ), but will remain on the waiting list for a Choices community vacancy, should one become available during the academic year.     For more information regarding the Choices communities, please contact the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services at (212) 998-4600.          Where are the Choices communities?   We have four Choices communities across campus. For upperclass students, the communities are located in Coral Tower and Palldium Special Interest Suites (one large suite comprised of both single and double rooms that share a common space and kitchen). You can indicate your preference for Coral or Palladium on the housing reapplication.   For first-year students , the communities are in Third North (apartment style) and Rubin Hall (traditional style). You may specify on your application your preference between Third North and Rubin.                                              How do I apply for Choices?   Incoming students may access the Choices application through the NYU Housing application (available through NYUHome: Housing Forms).   When will I find out if I was placed in Choices?   Incoming first-year students will find out their Choices placement in Early July.   Returning students will receive an e-mail with your Choices community placement information in late March. You will select your room through the online room selection process during Phase 2 of the Room Selection Process (early April).

NYU lives by the underlying principle that great cities and great universities belong together, that great cities need great universities, that a university\u2019s academic enterprise leads to the ideas, the innovation and the human talent that help cities flourish. NYU is among the many intellectual, cultural, and educational institutions that are mainstays of cities\u2019 futures. Through enhanced communications with the community, NYU. strives to solicit feedback on the University\u2019s long-range plans as well as inform community members about the many lectures, symposia, workshops, and events that are open and available to the public.
