For approval of distance education programs in New York State, click here .     Distance education is defined as a system and a process that connects learners with providers via distributed learning resources. While distance learning takes a wide variety of forms, all distance learning is characterized by: a separation of place and/or time between instructor and learner, among learners, and/or between learners and learning resources. If your school offers courses or programs in the form of distance education to students who do not reside within New York State while completing their studies, the information that follows will apply to you.   In addition, if your school or program has activity in the following catagories: non-classroom experiences, marketing and/or advertising, or proctoring, State Authorization may also apply to you.   Each of the categories below, depending on the nature or level of activity, can serve to constitute what a state might consider a physical presence within its borders by an out-of-state institution, whether or not related to a distance education program, and thus will necessitate state authorization.   Each individual state has created its own set of standards and guidelines with respect to educational activities within its borders by out-of-state institutions.   If your school or program meets or plans activities with respect to distance education courses or programs or non-distance program offerings which will meet any of the following catagories as defined below, please contact Brianna Bates, Accreditation Coordinator in the Office of Academic Program Review at brianna.bates@nyu.edu or 212-998-2388.   The following catagories highlight when State Authorization is required:              Non-classroom Experience: Internships, externships, field experience, clinicals, practicums, student teaching and medical clerkships     Specific states have classified &quot;on the ground&quot; educational activities, even when part of a distance education course or program, as constituting a physical presence and need for authorization within their state. If a student is completing any non-classroom credit bearing component or general requirement for any program outside of New York State, authorization within the specific state may be required prior to completion of the educational activity. This includes: internships, externships, clinicals, practicums, student teaching and medical clerkships.     Please click here to access a current chart summary of the non-classroom experience restrictions for NYU.                 Marketing/Advertising/Recruiting   States have defined marketing and/or advertising within their borders as constituting a physical presence and need for authorization prior to an out-of-state institution being allowed to advertise by local and/or national means. This includes but is not limited to: having recruiting agents or sales representatives active within the state, print advertising, radio advertising, television advertising. Currently, NYU restricts marketing and/or advertising activity in the states listed below.

If a school or program has any of the following, please notify our office so that we can plan accordingly for compliance:   - Any computer servers located in a state other than New York   - A phone number generated from a state other than New York   - An IP (internet provider) address generated from a state other than New York                                                    On This Page       Non-classroom experience     Marketing/Advertising/Recruiting   Proctoring     Faculty State of Residence   Additional Triggers               Statement of Compliance Status                                           Educational institutions are required to have made a good faith effort at complying with any applicable state approval or licensure requirements in each state in which it operates.

No. The federal regulation requiring institutions to comply with state regulations was \u2018vacated\u2019 by a federal court order, which was upheld in 2012. The regulation was set aside on purely procedural grounds.   Federal regulations acknowledge that even without the federal regulations, states still expect you to follow their laws. Reciprocity agreements have been drafted but are far from being in order to be adopted.                                                                                                                                                                          I have students who reside outside of New York State enrolled in a distance education program, what do I need to do?                                                        If you have students that reside outside of New York State and are enrolled in a distane education program, you will likely have to go through the process for State Authroization in the states where you have students. Do not worry, you are not alone. It is a complicated process but Brianna Bates, Accreditation Coordinator, will guide you through the process and paperwork.   For now, as NYU works to comply with all State Authorization requirements, it is important that the Office of Academic Program Review be made aware of the level of activity in other states. This will help prioritize the order in which applications should take place to avoid fines and any other penalities.                                                                                                                                                                        Is State Authorization necessary for programs without any distance education offerings?                                                        Maybe.   If you have no distance education but have any marketing and/or advertising, non-classroom offerings (internship, externship, clinical, practicum, field experience, clerkship, etc.), or any proctoring activities, you may be required to apply for authorization in specific states, depending on the laws and regulations of those states.   Please refer to the catagories listing the key triggers for State Authorization to the left on this page.                                                                                                                                                                        I know that there is a student participating in a non-classroom experience (internship, externship, clinical, practicum, field experience, clerkship, etc) in a state that requires authorization. What do I do?                                                        Please notify our office immediately. It is important that we are aware of all activity so that we can navigate regulations to comply and protect the placement of that student.   We know that your team works hard to make placements available and that these experiences are beyond valuable to students. With your help we are working as hard as we can to keep all opportunities open.   Prior to securing authorization please understand that it may be necessary to restrict placements within specific states.                                                                                                                                                                          We proctor exams or assignments of students outside of NewYork State, is State Authorization necessary?                                                        Maybe.   The following states require state authorization to proctor within their state: Delaware, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia.                                                                                                                                                                          We have marketing and/or advertising activity outside of New York State, is State Authorization necessary?                                                        Maybe.     Please view the map and chart listed as a resource under the detailed discription of the marketing and/or advertising catagories listed to the left.                                                                                                                                                                          What do I have to do if I want to start a new distance education (online) program?                                                        You first need to obtain approval from the New York State Education Department to offer the program. Click here for information on how to proceed and contact the Office of Academic Program Review if you have any questions.                                                                                                                                                                          Are there any states where State Authorization is not needed to enroll state residents in a distance education course or program, as long as there are no other trigers (marketing and/or advertising, proctoring, faculty resideing in-state, non-classroom experiences such as internships, field experience, clinical placements, etc.)?                                                       Yes, but this list is dependent on the distance education offering not having any of the other triggers present.   A chart will be coming soon to provide you with an easily accessible listing.                                                                                                                                                                          Aren't there any states where State Authorization is not needed?                                                       Yes, Maine.                                                                                                                                                                          If New York University is not approved in all states, can I restrict enrollments in distance education programs?                                                        Yes, you need to and should have a statement on your website and a system for turning the students away.   A sample statement could be&quot; students from x, y and z states are restricted from enrollment at this time&quot;.                                                                                                                                                                          What will happen if we do enroll a student in a distance education programor have non-distance activities in a state where New York University does not have State Authorization?                                                        One of or a combination of the following could happen: fines may be assessed to New York University, the state may request that the student be pulled from their placement or de-enrolled in their program (which could incur additional financial cost, and a strained relstionship would exist moving forward toward securing authorization within that specific state.                                                                                                                                                                          What are the enrollment restrictions for offering CEU's via distance education?                                                       Thirteen states have regulations that require educational institutions to secure state authorization prior to offering Continuing Education Credits (CEU\u2019s) via distance education to residents of their state. NYU has already secured approval in five of these states. Eight remain, from which enrollments should be restricted until further notice:     Alabama   Alaska   New Hampshire   Oklahoma   Oregon   Texas   Utah   Wisconsin     Another common question is whether or not a program can offer a student access to the CEU, but not grant credits to them if they are from a restricted state and still remain in compliance. Unfortunately, even without offering CEU's, individuals in the restricted states will not be able to access the materials. The State Authorization issue has grown out of a consumer protection focus. Even without CEU's being granted, just delivering distance education to students in the respective states in exchange for payment could trigger a state to notify the University of non-compliant activity.   Restricting enrollments is best practice to protect the University from liabilities and potential fines for non-compliance. For the time being, it is essential that individuals residing in these states simply be restricted from enrolling.

For approval of distance education programs in New York State, click here .     Distance education is defined as a system and a process that connects learners with providers via distributed learning resources. While distance learning takes a wide variety of forms, all distance learning is characterized by: a separation of place and/or time between instructor and learner, among learners, and/or between learners and learning resources. If your school offers courses or programs in the form of distance education to students who do not reside within New York State while completing their studies, the information that follows will apply to you.   In addition, if your school or program has activity in the following catagories: non-classroom experiences, marketing and/or advertising, or proctoring, State Authorization may also apply to you.   Each of the categories below, depending on the nature or level of activity, can serve to constitute what a state might consider a physical presence within its borders by an out-of-state institution, whether or not related to a distance education program, and thus will necessitate state authorization.   Each individual state has created its own set of standards and guidelines with respect to educational activities within its borders by out-of-state institutions.   If your school or program meets or plans activities with respect to distance education courses or programs or non-distance program offerings which will meet any of the following catagories as defined below, please contact Brianna Bates, Accreditation Coordinator in the Office of Academic Program Review at brianna.bates@nyu.edu or 212-998-2388.   The following catagories highlight when State Authorization is required:              Non-classroom Experience: Internships, externships, field experience, clinicals, practicums, student teaching and medical clerkships     Specific states have classified &quot;on the ground&quot; educational activities, even when part of a distance education course or program, as constituting a physical presence and need for authorization within their state. If a student is completing any non-classroom credit bearing component or general requirement for any program outside of New York State, authorization within the specific state may be required prior to completion of the educational activity. This includes: internships, externships, clinicals, practicums, student teaching and medical clerkships.     Please click here to access a current chart summary of the non-classroom experience restrictions for NYU.                 Marketing/Advertising/Recruiting   States have defined marketing and/or advertising within their borders as constituting a physical presence and need for authorization prior to an out-of-state institution being allowed to advertise by local and/or national means. This includes but is not limited to: having recruiting agents or sales representatives active within the state, print advertising, radio advertising, television advertising. Currently, NYU restricts marketing and/or advertising activity in the states listed below.

If a school or program has any of the following, please notify our office so that we can plan accordingly for compliance:   - Any computer servers located in a state other than New York   - A phone number generated from a state other than New York   - An IP (internet provider) address generated from a state other than New York                                                    On This Page       Non-classroom experience     Marketing/Advertising/Recruiting   Proctoring     Faculty State of Residence   Additional Triggers               Statement of Compliance Status                                           Educational institutions are required to have made a good faith effort at complying with any applicable state approval or licensure requirements in each state in which it operates.

No. The federal regulation requiring institutions to comply with state regulations was \u2018vacated\u2019 by a federal court order, which was upheld in 2012. The regulation was set aside on purely procedural grounds.   Federal regulations acknowledge that even without the federal regulations, states still expect you to follow their laws. Reciprocity agreements have been drafted but are far from being in order to be adopted.                                                                                                                                                                          I have students who reside outside of New York State enrolled in a distance education program, what do I need to do?                                                        If you have students that reside outside of New York State and are enrolled in a distane education program, you will likely have to go through the process for State Authroization in the states where you have students. Do not worry, you are not alone. It is a complicated process but Brianna Bates, Accreditation Coordinator, will guide you through the process and paperwork.   For now, as NYU works to comply with all State Authorization requirements, it is important that the Office of Academic Program Review be made aware of the level of activity in other states. This will help prioritize the order in which applications should take place to avoid fines and any other penalities.                                                                                                                                                                        Is State Authorization necessary for programs without any distance education offerings?                                                        Maybe.   If you have no distance education but have any marketing and/or advertising, non-classroom offerings (internship, externship, clinical, practicum, field experience, clerkship, etc.), or any proctoring activities, you may be required to apply for authorization in specific states, depending on the laws and regulations of those states.   Please refer to the catagories listing the key triggers for State Authorization to the left on this page.                                                                                                                                                                        I know that there is a student participating in a non-classroom experience (internship, externship, clinical, practicum, field experience, clerkship, etc) in a state that requires authorization. What do I do?                                                        Please notify our office immediately. It is important that we are aware of all activity so that we can navigate regulations to comply and protect the placement of that student.   We know that your team works hard to make placements available and that these experiences are beyond valuable to students. With your help we are working as hard as we can to keep all opportunities open.   Prior to securing authorization please understand that it may be necessary to restrict placements within specific states.                                                                                                                                                                          We proctor exams or assignments of students outside of NewYork State, is State Authorization necessary?                                                        Maybe.   The following states require state authorization to proctor within their state: Delaware, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia.                                                                                                                                                                          We have marketing and/or advertising activity outside of New York State, is State Authorization necessary?                                                        Maybe.     Please view the map and chart listed as a resource under the detailed discription of the marketing and/or advertising catagories listed to the left.                                                                                                                                                                          What do I have to do if I want to start a new distance education (online) program?                                                        You first need to obtain approval from the New York State Education Department to offer the program.

Are there any states where State Authorization is not needed to enroll state residents in a distance education course or program, as long as there are no other trigers (marketing and/or advertising, proctoring, faculty resideing in-state, non-classroom experiences such as internships, field experience, clinical placements, etc.)?                                                       Yes, but this list is dependent on the distance education offering not having any of the other triggers present.   A chart will be coming soon to provide you with an easily accessible listing.                                                                                                                                                                          Aren't there any states where State Authorization is not needed?                                                       Yes, Maine.                                                                                                                                                                          If New York University is not approved in all states, can I restrict enrollments in distance education programs?                                                        Yes, you need to and should have a statement on your website and a system for turning the students away.   A sample statement could be&quot; students from x, y and z states are restricted from enrollment at this time&quot;.                                                                                                                                                                          What will happen if we do enroll a student in a distance education programor have non-distance activities in a state where New York University does not have State Authorization?                                                        One of or a combination of the following could happen: fines may be assessed to New York University, the state may request that the student be pulled from their placement or de-enrolled in their program (which could incur additional financial cost, and a strained relstionship would exist moving forward toward securing authorization within that specific state.                                                                                                                                                                          What are the enrollment restrictions for offering CEU's via distance education?                                                       Thirteen states have regulations that require educational institutions to secure state authorization prior to offering Continuing Education Credits (CEU\u2019s) via distance education to residents of their state. NYU has already secured approval in five of these states. Eight remain, from which enrollments should be restricted until further notice:     Alabama   Alaska   New Hampshire   Oklahoma   Oregon   Texas   Utah   Wisconsin     Another common question is whether or not a program can offer a student access to the CEU, but not grant credits to them if they are from a restricted state and still remain in compliance. Unfortunately, even without offering CEU's, individuals in the restricted states will not be able to access the materials. The State Authorization issue has grown out of a consumer protection focus. Even without CEU's being granted, just delivering distance education to students in the respective states in exchange for payment could trigger a state to notify the University of non-compliant activity.   Restricting enrollments is best practice to protect the University from liabilities and potential fines for non-compliance. For the time being, it is essential that individuals residing in these states simply be restricted from enrolling.
