The capstone relates theoretical knowledge and skills to practical problems, while students work collaboratively in real world situations to research and communicate results to a variety of audiences.Each capstone works as a single team under the leadership of an instructor. Capstones meet weekly. Much of the work will be done outside of class in interviewing stakeholders, analyzing data and visiting sites. Experts may be brought in to brief the seminar on particular aspects of the problem under discussion. At the end of the term, projects are presented to the client, students, NYU faculty, and interested members of the community.

Selected instructors will lead about 10 students in a collaborative semester-long project culminating in a public presentation and written report. Description Capstone seminars are problem-based, project-oriented courses for senior Environmental Studies students. They require self-initiated, collaborative, interdisciplinary, and integrative student work. The capstone entails students working for a client (actual or hypothetical) and using an applied approach to problem solving. Students work collaboratively on a current environmental problem, including characterizing the problem, analyzing possible solutions, implementing solutions, and publicly presenting the results.The aim is to improve a student\u2019s ability to synthesize and integrate material from a range of disciplines while deploying diverse methodologies and vocabularies in a problem-solving context. The capstone relates theoretical knowledge and skills to practical problems, while students work collaboratively in real world situations to research and communicate results to a variety of audiences.Each capstone works as a single team under the leadership of an instructor. Capstones meet weekly. Much of the work will be done outside of class in interviewing stakeholders, analyzing data and visiting sites. Experts may be brought in to brief the seminar on particular aspects of the problem under discussion. At the end of the term, projects are presented to the client, students, NYU faculty, and interested members of the community. Visit http://www.environment.as.nyu.edu/page/capstone for descriptions and videos of past capstones. Application Materials To apply, please submit the following to environmental.studies@nyu.edu by 3/26/2015 at noon. Interviews will be scheduled shortly thereafter. Project title Project description Intended client (actual or hypothetical) Outcomes Class activities Statement of interest Resume or CV Preference on whether you would like to teach in Fall 2015 or Spring 2016 Please contact the program at environmental.studies@nyu.edu if you have any questions before submitting a proposal. Instructors will be compensated as adjunct instructors and have access to a course support budget and NYU resources.
