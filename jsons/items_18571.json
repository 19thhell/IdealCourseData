Researchers may have analysis done by the facility specialist or perform the work by themselves after training (certain restrictions may apply to external users). The Bruker AXS SMART APEXII Single Crystal Diffractometer was acquired through the support of the Molecular Design Institute in the Department of Chemistry at New York University. The Bruker AXS D8 DISCOVER GADDS X-Ray Microdiffractometer was acquired through the support of the National Science Foundation CRIF Program under Award Number CHE-0840277 and the NSF MRSEC Program under Award Number DMR-0820341 .

The data collection will be scheduled as early as possible whenever the instrument is available. After structure solution and refinement, you and your adviser will receive the final data by email. The usual turnaround time is one or two weeks. In some cases with disorder or twinning, it may take longer.    For powder sample, you need to fill out Online Request Form for GADDS . Once you submit the request, you and Tony will receive an email about the request. Tony will schedule the measurement as early as possible whenever the instrument is available. When the data is ready, you will receive it by email. The turnaround time depends on what kind of service you have requested.

Each individual who wishes to be authorized to use X-ray equipments at the Facility must first receive training concerning the X-ray radiation hazards associated with the use of the equipment, the function and importance of the equipment's safety devices, the proper operation procedures, and procedures to follow in the even of a suspected radiation exposure.

GADDS SOP (click to download the pdf file)              POLICY           Structure Service       Data collection and structure determinations are performed on a first-come, first-serve basis.    The user must complete request form with the group adviser's signature and the grant number. Otherwise, the measurement will be postponed.    If you are preparing a highly unstable material, make arrangements ahead of time with the crystallographer.    When a structure is considered final and complete, all necessary data (cif, tables, ORTEP, etc.) will be sent to the sample provider and his/her adviser.    You are responsible for safekeeping your own released data.         Co-authorship and Acknowledgment       The crystallographer should be considered for co-authorship when the structural information is an important part of the paper and structural information has been derived mainly from the diffraction data. The crystallographer will help completing the X-ray part of the experiments and reviewing the manuscript.    If structure determination was used only to confirm information obtained by other means (NMR, MS, etc.) and no structural details will be given in the paper, only acknowledgment is more appropriate.    If single crystal work is performed, you can write: Authors are grateful for the assistance of Dr. Chunhua Hu at the Department of Chemistry of New York University with the X-ray analysis and acknowledge the Molecular Design Institute of NYU for purchasing the single crystal diffractometer.    If you use the GADDS instrument, you can write: Authors are grateful for the assistance of Dr. Chunhua Hu at the Department of Chemistry of New York University with the X-ray analysis and acknowledge the support by the National Science Foundation under Award Numbers CRIF/CHE-0840277 and by the NSF MRSEC Program under Award Number DMR-0820341.    If your data are collected at the APS, please add an acknowledgment: The authors acknowledge Yu-Sheng Chen at Chemistry and Materials Science Sector of the Center for Advanced Radiation Sources (ChemMatCARS) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Sector 15, which is principally supported by the National Science Foundation/Department of Energy under grant number NSF/CHE-0822838. Use of the APS, an Office of Science User Facility operated for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory, was supported by the U.S. DOE under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.            LOCATION         The facility is located in the 357 Brown Building of the Silver Complex.
