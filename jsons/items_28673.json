The mission of the Production and Design Studio is to provide students with the skills, techniques and experiences necessary to pursue a career in the design, technical, management and other production areas of the performing arts. Design training includes scenery, costumes, lighting and sound design. Management training includes stage management, production management, general management, and producing.\u2028 Studio coursework is structured in a conservatory style where students spend three days a week, between 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM in studies focused specifically on theatre production and design. The alternate weekdays are reserved for academic classes. Our first year students study all aspects of production to gain shared skills and vocabulary creating life-long collaborative skills and production techniques. In the second year each student will focus their training in two of five key areas: scenic design, costume design, lighting design, sound design or management. Management training includes stage management, production management, general management and producing. The focus classes are supported with directing, script analysis, graphics, computer and business courses. For a full description of first year courses, click here . Second year course descriptions can be found here . The junior and senior students study one-on-one with their major instructor and participate in internships in the New York industry. Internships may include experiences in theater, dance, opera, television and film. Through contacts made during internships, many of our graduates find their first jobs. In 2012-2014, our students interned with:  Companies/Productions/Shows: Atlantic Theater Company Alvin Ailey Dance Company Blue Bloods Brooklyn Academy of Music Dodgers Productions Elementary Focus Features Lionfish Studio Metropolitan Opera MTV/VH1 Tinc Productions Viacom Vibrant Design  Broadway Designers: Gregg Barnes Randy Carfagno John Gromada Don Holder Christine Jones Anna Louizos Derek McClane Tyler Micoleau Sven Ortel George Tsypin Jennifer Tipton Donyale Werle   Production and Design students are assigned to least one production each semester and often will volunteer for three or four other shows per year. The Drama Department produces well over fifty plays each year in our seven performance spaces. All of these shows are exclusively for the Undergraduate Drama Department. Our shows are intended for the education of the undergraduate students. First year students learn by contributing to the show \u2013 crewing, building, running, hanging lights/sound/projection equipment. As the student progresses through the program, production assignments build skills and challenge one to take on greater responsibilities. Second year students will assist the designers and stage managers on fully produced shows. In the final two years, students are encouraged to design or manage full productions. The faculty decides when each student is prepared to take on a major leadership role in production. The Faculty of The Production and Design Studio are award winning, professional designers, managers, directors and technicians of the New York world of performing arts. Nine faculty members are full-time with five heading the department\u2019s production departments. There are sixteen faculty members who do what they teach in New York and around the world. We are very proud of our graduates who are professionals with a trained intellect and imagination, excellent communication skills, and a broad range of experience.
