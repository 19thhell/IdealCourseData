Over the past several years, biology has been revolutionized with the development of powerful techniques in molecular and cellular biology, genomics and bioinformatics that are now being applied to research across the spectrum of the science, from genetics and development to biomedicine, field studies and animal behavior. The department\u2019s programs of study and research reflect this contemporary view of biology.    The department offers students the opportunity to explore the various areas of current biology in an integrated yet diverse program that builds from a solid foundation of the basic elements of molecular and cellular biology, genetics, evolution, organ systems and population studies. Students are exposed to modern concepts, state-of-the-art approaches and current methods of experimentation in molecular biology, biochemistry, genomics and bioinformatics within introductory courses taken at the very outset of their studies. A variety of intermediate courses then provides in-depth exploration of major fields of biology. Advanced students may register for graduate-level courses, which are most often given in the specialized areas of faculty research.    Three options are available to students pursuing a major in Biology. The standard Biology track provides the major with a broad background in biology with the laboratory, quantitative and reasoning skills needed for today\u2019s modern biology. The Ecology track also provides students with the broad background in modern biology, but with a focus on ecological concepts, approaches and analytical methods. The Global Public Health/Science major with Concentration in Biology provides students with strong foundations in biological science and global public health, with a focus on one of three emphasis areas: genetics and genomics, infectious diseases or environmental health.    The department also offers a series of discrete minors in the life sciences , specifically in the areas of:      Molecular and Cell Biology    Genetics    Genomics and Bioinformatics    Environmental Biology          Each minor is designed to hone skills in a particular contemporary area of biology and requires a laboratory experience. The minors permit students to create a course of study that will meet their unique academic and career goals.    The Biology majors and minors provide outstanding preparation for careers in research, academia, medicine, dentistry and related fields. Graduates of the department have a remarkable record of success in acceptance into professional schools and in establishing notable careers in the biomedical sciences.    Other courses offered by the department are designed to acquaint nonscience majors with contemporary issues in biology. Such courses are often topical, addressing problems such as environmental pollution, limits of the earth, and human physiology.    Outstanding and highly motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors work, independent study, summer laboratory research, internships and other enhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in undergraduate research projects in faculty laboratories through the many formal and informal opportunities afforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important research accomplishment and contains several specialized research and laboratory facilities that are integrated into the educational programs. These include the undergraduate Molecular Biology Laboratory, the Microscope Facility, the Genomics Core Facility and the Tissue Culture Facility. Field studies are carried out at many regional sites. Department faculty are also affiliated with the NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, the NYU Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences, the NYU School of Medicine, the NYU David B. Kriser School of Dentistry, the American Museum of Natural History, the New York Botanical Garden, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories.    Students with questions about majoring in biology or minoring in a specific area of biology should visit the office of the Department of Biology. Those declaring a major in biology should complete a department declaration form. They are assigned a faculty adviser from the department; students meet with that professor to design a program of study, determine course selections and discuss career goals. The faculty adviser is also available to provide guidance concerning the many options and opportunities afforded by the department for curricular enhancement, including research experiences.

Environmental Studies Students learn about modern environmental science in the context of contemporary global issues, exploring the impact that the decisions of nations and individuals have on local and world ecologies. The course emphasizes the science involved in environmental decisions while also examining the role of ethics, politics, and economics in environmental decisions at both personal and governmental levels. Students examine such topics as ecology and biodiversity, including the nature and effects of succession, evolution, and invasion species; the atmosphere, including air pollution, ozone depletion, and climate change; sources, use, and misuse of water resources; human population and feeding the world\u2019s people, including developments in agriculture and genetic modifications of organisms; and the nature of Earth\u2019s energy resources and their use by humankind. History of the Universe History of the Universe examines the nature of science as a way of looking at the world and   study that world as revealed through the work of scientists over the   years. They learn about the nature of matter and energy and how the   universe has evolved. Topics include the origin and development of the   stars, galaxies, planetary systems, and the universe itself, as well as   study of the Earth and the development of life on Earth and its   potential to exist elsewhere in the universe. The course begins with the   development of scientific thought at multiple locations around the   pre-modern world by reference to Babylonian and Chinese astronomy,   Indian numerical systems, and the work of such scientists as Aristotle,   Ptolemy, Al-Sufi, Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo. It continues with   discoveries by the likes of Newton, Darwin, Curie, Einstein, and Hubble   during the period of Western scientific hegemony and ends with the   multinational world of present-day science. Students acquire an   understanding not only of modern science but also of its development and   of the methods, strengths, and limitations of the scientific method. Life Science Life Science examines fundamental principles and processes of biological science. The theme of evolution is woven throughout the course. Topics include genetics, cancer, cell biology, biochemistry, biotechnology, and bioethics, with special emphasis on the human species. Many of the topics are discussed within a social and historical context, demonstrating the global nature of scientific problems and scientific process. Selected readings from science journals, newspaper articles, and recent books expose students to the relevance and application of scientific work to their everyday lives, focusing particularly on genetic disease, the function and treatment of HIV infection, and other current important frontiers and ethical issues in the discipline. The course also acquaints students with the historical development of life science by reference to key figures from Galen to Averro\u00ebs to Mendel and Darwin. Science of Technology Science of Technology follows   the intertwined histories of science, technology, and society, focusing   mainly on the technology of communication from the earliest means of   communicating across space and time to present forms of communication.   Students investigate the science behind the technology by engaging in   inquiry-based group activities and group projects that illustrate the   scientific method and the role of experimentation in producing   scientific results. The course also looks at the impact technology has   had on societies, and the way the structure and values of different   societies have conditioned how technologies are actually used. Student   research projects investigate the basic science, history, and impact of   technologies in other fields such as energy, medicine, or   transportation.
