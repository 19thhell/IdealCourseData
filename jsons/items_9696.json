Latest News: \u00a0 Daniel Martin's article, &quot;'Some Trick of the Moonlight': Seduction and the Moving Image in Bram Stoker's Dracula,&quot; (Victorian\u00a0Literature and Culture 40.2) has been awarded Honorable Mention by the North American Victorian Studies Association (NAVSA) Donald Gray Prize for an essay published in the field of Victorian Studies in 2012. \u00a0 Matthew Kaiser's article, &quot;Pater's Mouth,&quot; ( Victorian Literature and Culture 39.1) has been awarded the North American Victorian Studies Association (NAVSA) Donald Gray Prize for the best essay published in the field of Victorian Studies in 2011. The international, interdisciplinary panel of judges commented: &quot;First place in a strong and varied field goes to Matthew Kaiser\u2019s sophisticated essay on Pater and taste \u2013 taste in the physical rather than the aesthetic sense. Drawing on eight Pater texts in a rich and lyrical essay, Kaiser\u2019s informative references to art, classics, history, philosophy, philology, poetry, physiology, gastronomy, and Eucharistic imagery produce an exceptionally fine close reading and provocative argument.&quot; Deborah Lutz's article, &quot;The Dead Still Among Us: Victorian Secular Relics and the Materiality of Death,&quot; ( Victorian Literature and Culture 39.1) has won the Best Article of 2011 prize from the Nineteenth-Century Studies Association.  Beginning with issue 41.1\u00a0 Victorian Literature and Culture will be published by Cambridge University Press in quarterly issues.
