In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance they developed and evolved into languages that we recognize as the basis of (among others) modern French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. The great works of literature produced in these centuries became the foundation of the national literatures of their respective cultures. The major in Romance Languages in the College of Arts and Science is a nine-course major administered by the Departments of Italian, French, and Spanish and Portuguese. Students choose a combination of any two of these four languages, taking five courses in one and four in the other. Thus, majors in Romance Languages are able to take advantage of the rich course offerings and resources of our world-renowned language departments and learn from distinguished scholars in two fields. The major stresses competence in speaking and writing before moving into literary and cultural course work. To improve students\u2019 facility with their two languages and promote cross-cultural understanding and exposure, study away at NYU Buenos Aires , Florence , Madrid , and Paris is encouraged. While they are at Washington Square, students can take advantage of talks, exhibits, films, and other events sponsored by the Departments of French, Italian, and Spanish and Portuguese and NYU\u2019s Maison Fran\u00e7aise , Casa Italiana , and King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center , as well as by cultural institutions in New York City. A major in Romance Languages is applicable to careers in international law and business, communications, education, fine arts, tourism, and diplomacy. It also complements majors in such fields as art history, cinema studies, comparative literature, history, international relations, linguistics, medieval and Renaissance studies, and music.
