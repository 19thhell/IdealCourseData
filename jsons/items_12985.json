Knowledge of rudimentary matrix algebra and calculus is assumed (we will review as necessary)..     Course Summary: This is a course in regression analysis. It begins with basic hypothesis testing using Ordinary Least Squares regression. In this course we will examine how to build more sophisticated models allowing us to test more complex hypotheses, and also learn more sophisticated statistical tests enabling us to proceed with analysis even when the Gauss-Markov assumptions are violated. The primary emphasis is on identifying statistical techniques appropriate to the question being examined, and correctly applying those techniques.     Course Requirements     There will be approximately 4 to 6 computer-based problem sets requiring students to analyze data with the techniques covered in class. You are free to work together on these problem sets, and  are encouraged to do so! In addition, there will be an 18-25 page research paper on a topic chosen by the student - - with the professor's approval - - utilizing techniques covered in class. This paper can be a paper that the student is writing for another course, provided that it makes sufficient use of material covered in this course. If the paper is to be turned in to another class this needs to be made clear to both faculty members receiving the paper. Class attendance and participation are mandatory.
