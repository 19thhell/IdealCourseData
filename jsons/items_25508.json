I investigate how mass audiences embrace films on the basis of myths and sensibilities that may revive or adjust ancient narratives to modern times. Literature, aesthetics, history, geography and sociology are key in my attempt to excavate these resurgences. I have written on the relationships between film and literature, theory, space, and politics. My current research focuses on how French film theorists and critics laid the foundation for a sociological approach to film prior to the advent of political modernism.
