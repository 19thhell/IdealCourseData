Aussies famously describe their nation as the lucky country, yet from the Indigenous perspective, it might more aptly be called the stolen country. Australia is the land of the fair go, which cruelly detains refugees; a multicultural nation with a history of a white Australia policy; a place with distinctive local traditions, which takes many of its cues from global culture; an easy-going country with a surprisingly large degree of governmental control over individual liberties; a highly urbanised population that romances the Bush and the Outback as embodying \u2018real\u2019 Australia; a nation proud of its traditions of egalitarianism and mateship, with numerous rules about who is allowed in \u2018the club\u2019; a society with a history of anti-British and anti-American sentiment that simultaneously hold strong political allegiances and military pacts with Britain and the USA; and a place with a history of progressive social policy and a democratic tradition, which has never undergone a revolution. This course strives to make sense of Australian society and culture by exploring the complexities and contradictions in Australia\u2019s self-image.   The course will be introduced with an overview, and followed by four sessions covering four distinct themes during Orientation and the first three weeks of semester. Each session will include a 1-hour lecture, either given by the instructor or a guest lecturer, and a recitation-style discussion. There are seven mandatory field trips: Sydney Harbour Cruise, Rocks Walking Tour, The Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park, Balmain Bowling Club Lawn Bowls, Overnight trip to Inglevale Farm, and the NYU World Tour.   Sample Syllabus                          Anthropology                                                 Anthropology of Indigenous Australia - ANTH-UA 9037 - 4 points                               This course offers an introduction to some of the classical and current issues in the anthropology of Indigenous Australia. The role of anthropology in the representation and governance of Indigenous life is itself an important subject for anthropological inquiry, considering that Indigenous people of Australia have long been the objects of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics. These representations\u2014in feature films about them (such as Rabbit-Proof Fence and Australia), New Age Literature (such as Mutant Message Down Under), or museum exhibitions (such as in the Museum of Sydney or the Australian Museum)\u2014are now also in dialogue with Indigenous forms of cultural production, in genres as diverse as film, television, drama, dance, art and writing. The course will explore how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions on their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. Through the examination of ethnographic and historical texts, films, archives and Indigenous life-writing accounts, we will consider the ways in which Aboriginalities are being challenged and constructed in contemporary Australia.   The course will consist of lectures interspersed with discussions, student presentations, and films/other media; we may also have guest presenters.       Sample Syllabus                                                                        Indigenous Australian Art: An Analytical Survey - ANTH-UA 9038 or SCA-UA 9836 - 4 points                               This course is a survey of the principal themes and issues in the development of Indigenous art in Australia. It focuses on some of the regional and historical variations of Aboriginal art in the context of the history of a settler nation, while considering the issues of its circulation and evaluation within contemporary discourses of value. Topics include the cosmological dimensions of the art, its political implications, its relationship to cultural identity, and its aesthetic frameworks. Students will visit some of the major national collections of Indigenous Australian art as well as exhibitions of contemporary works. There will also be guest presentations from Indigenous artists and Indigenous art curators.

Sample Syllabus                                Business                                                    Foundations of Finance - FINC-UB 9002 - 4 points                               Prerequisites: (1) STAT-UB 103 Statistics for Business Control and Regression/Forecasting Models OR STAT-UB 1 Statistics for Business Control (4 credit) plus STAT-UB 3 Regression/Forecasting (2 credit) OR equivalent AND (2) one of the following: ECON-UB 1 Microeconomics OR ECON-UA 2 Economic Principles II, OR ECON-UA 5 Introduction to Economic Analysis, AND (3) ACCT-UB 1 Principles of Financial Accounting AND (4) At least Sophomore Standing.   This course is a rigorous, quantitative introduction to financial market structure and financial asset valuation. This course seeks to equip students with a fundamental understanding of the concepts and principles of finance. The main topics of the course are time value of money, portfolio selection, equilibrium asset pricing (CAPM), equity valuation, arbitrage pricing, fixed income securities and derivatives. You are expected to understand valuation formulas and be able to apply them to new problems. The appropriate tools necessary for solving these problems will be developed at each stage and practiced in the homework assignments. The models we will cover have immediate applications and implications for real-world financial decisions. Every effort will be made to relate the course material to current financial news.   Throughout the course the emphasis will be on two main areas: learning conceptual knowledge through theory and problem solving; and critical thinking through the application of real-life scenarios and local cases. The course will incorporate aspects of Australian securities market and financial institutions and a comparative approach will be adopted in demonstrating similarities and differences between the U.S. capital market and the Australian capital market.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Introduction to Marketing - MKTG-UB 9001 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the concepts and skills needed to create and critique effective marketing. Marketers in all organisations require an understanding of the many facets of marketing, beyond simply advertising or communications. The American Marketing Association defines marketing as:   \u201cMarketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\u201d   The course focuses on the role of marketing and its importance in contemporary organisations and society. During the session, students will critically explore marketing principles, concepts and models from a practical perspective. Beyond studying the theory of marketing, students will analyse a variety of real-world examples and case studies. Organisations need to create a balanced, coordinated marketing mix, where all elements of its marketing activities work together. Marketing also requires combining qualitative and quantitative analysis to gain an understanding and reveal insights into the internal and external environment. To achieve this, the course uses a combination of lectures, class discussion, case studies, assignments and exams. The remainder of this syllabus describes the course and students responsibilities.   Sample Syllabus                                Chemistry                                                    Organic Chemistry II - CHEM-UA 9226 - 5 points (Lecture, Laboratory, & Recitation)                               Prerequisite: CHEM-UA 243, Organic Chemistry I or its equivalent   Students registering for this course must also register for the Laboratory section     The aim of the course is to introduce advanced concepts in organic chemistry with particular emphasis on aromatic and carbonyl systems. Some simple aspects of biochemistry including carbohydrates will be discussed. The importance of spectroscopic techniques in organic chemistry will be emphasised. Lectures will take place at the NYU Sydney Academic Centre. Weely 4 1/2 hr. laboratory sessions will be conducted in a facility within walking distance of student housing where students have the opportunity to conduct experiments using NMR and IR machines. A pre-lab session of 20 minutes will take place at the beginning of each practical class. Students will acquire the practical skills of Organic Chemistry and will become familiar with organic laboratory procedures and techniques.     Sample Syllabu s                            Child and Adolescent Mental Health Studies                                                    Child and Adolescent Brain Development: Applications From Neuroscience to Practice - CAMS-UA 9141 - 4 points                               This course aims to understand the key aspects of the anatomy of the human brain, the development of the human brain across the lifespan and how scientists observe, assess and intervene in the development of neurocognitive processes in childhood and adolescence. Students will develop an appreciation of the complexity of the human brain, the limits and advantages of our current knowledge. Also, students will gain an awareness that a neurocognitive perspective has explained a considerable array of human behavior, including aspects of emotional functioning and personality.   Sample Syllabus                                College Core Curriculum                                                  Expressive Culture: Film - CORE-UA 9750 - 4 points                               How has Australian cinema engaged with significant and often contested historical, political and cultural events in the nation\u2019s past? The films in this course offer critical perspectives on the history of colonisation in Australia; the legacies of the Stolen Generations; the controversies surrounding Australia\u2019s role in World War One; as well as Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbours. We will focus on films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo (2009). We will also draw on films that have employed innovative narrative and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past and the present such as Ten Canoes (2006) and The Tracker (2002). Throughout the course, students will develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies. In particular, students will develop a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched detail, allegory and archives across a diverse range of examples.     Sample Syllabus                                Creative Writing                                                    Creative Writing - WRTNG-UG 9501 or CRWRI-UA 9815 - 4 points                               In this class students are encouraged to consider the intersectional environments (natural, urban, cultural, historical etc.) that they interact with and within, and how their sensibilities differ living away from home to contemplate how a sense of place can be conveyed through writing. We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.   Sample Syllabus                                English                                                  World Literature in English II: Australia and New Zealand - ENGL-UA 9164 - 4 points                               This course is an introduction to the literatures of Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific region, with a focus on indigenous, migrant and diasporic writing. In addition to major texts from Australia and New Zealand, we will also encounter a range of works from Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and the Pacific islands. Some questions we will tackle include: How have the cultural, historical, and economic processes of colonialism, diaspora and migration connected and shaped this diverse region? How have issues of race and indigeneity been central to various discourses of nationalism? What particular roles have Australia and New Zealand, as sub-imperial powers, played in the region? Finally, what can the latest generation of migrant writing in Australia show us about new forms of interconnections across the globalizing Asia-Pacific? Students in this course will examine novels, poetry, films and theoretical texts to develop critical thinking, reading and writing skills. Along the way, they will gain a solid grounding in the problematics of postcolonialism, race, diaspora, indigeneity, nationalism and multiculturalism.     Sample Syllabus                                                                            Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Eco-Criticism - ENVST-UA 9510 or ENGL-UA 9735 - 4 points                               Recent findings in the biological and physical sciences pose complex questions not just for those who work in the lab, but for philosophers, scholars, artists and students of literary theory. In this course we consider the cultural reverberations of ecological awareness\u2014focusing on literature, cinema and visual art. Eco-criticism is a relatively young field of study in the humanities, developed in response to twin crises: actual environmental degradation, and a breakdown in intellectual categories of \u2018the natural\u2019 brought on by technology and politics. This course provides an opportunity to reflect on a number of key tropes in ecological thinking including wilderness, pollution, animals, food and apocalypse. Learn about a philosopher who survived a crocodile attack, the beach at the end of the world, how to prepare and eat Australian moths, and why the Large Hadron Collider is a metaphysical machine. Principle texts in this course include American and Australian novels, films and documentaries, read alongside supplementary sources in literary, audio and artistic mediums. We ask how literature\u2014one of the richest arenas for the practice of human imagination\u2014does, has, or could shape environmental thought and action. How does the non-human world enter into human artforms? What are the historical and structural obstacles to admitting different forms of consciousness into text? What literary genres and styles are called forth by the huge ecological challenges of our times?

We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

Topics include tourism, floods, food, rural and urban environments, acclimatisation and the introduction of plant and animal species over the nineteenth century.   Sample Syllabus                                Gallatin                                                  Creative Writing - WRTNG-UG 9501 or CRWRI-UA 9815 - 4 points                               In this class students are encouraged to consider the intersectional environments (natural, urban, cultural, historical etc.) that they interact with and within, and how their sensibilities differ living away from home to contemplate how a sense of place can be conveyed through writing. We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

Application required.   This 2-credit course is designed to complement and enhance your 2-credit internship fieldwork placement completed during the same semester at NYU Sydney. The seminar provides the structure for you to explore many different aspects of your internship site, and to gain more from your experience by comparing and contrasting the internship experiences of all class participants. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization hosting your internship, including its mission, approach, policies, and the context in which it operates. More generally, we will consider the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Throughout the semester we will take note of similarities and differences of Australian and American workplaces and work culture. Ultimately, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience, and on your personal and future professional goals.

It will focus on the how environmental health issues are defined and approached by civic groups, governmental officials and researchers. It will highlight how environmental threats come to the attention of the public and weigh the options for addressing these threats. Finally, it will underscore the need for multi-disciplinary approaches in understanding these threats and crafting solutions. We will focus on prevention of environmentally mediated diseases and discuss challenges to effective prevention.

This course discusses these questions, as well as others that advance our understanding of the role of environment in Australian history. Questions include: How are environments incorporated into the tool kit of historians? How are environments incorporated into the tool kit of historians? What counts for evidence? Topics include tourism, floods, food, rural and urban environments, acclimatisation and the introduction of plant and animal species over the nineteenth century.

Though its waters connect places as diverse as Patagonia, Kamchatka, Hawai\u2019I, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Sydney, histories of these disparate regions and their societies can profitably be considered under a common rubric. This course brings together work across disciplines, from history, anthropology, geography, political economy, and cultural studies, to piece together the contours of the Pacific Ocean, c. 1500 to c. 1850, as a historical arena of internal linkages as well as one forged by connections with the wider world. Central themes of the course will include cultural encounters, comparative empires, trade, and environmental change.

Sample Syllabus                                Journalism                                                  Journalism and Society: Science, Environment and Politics - JOUR-UA 9503 or ENVST-UA 9503 - 4 points                               In this hybrid reading / writing class, we will explore environmental journalism from an Australian perspective. We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.   Sample Syllabus                              Media, Culture, &amp; Communication                                                  Global Media Seminar - MCC-UE 9456 - 4 points                               This course examines diverse issues and perspectives related to global media. Historical and theoretical frameworks will be provided to enable students to approach the scope, disparity and complexity of current developments. These frameworks will be supplemented with the latest media news and developments. In short, we ask: what the heck is going on in the hyper-turbulent realm of blogs, Buzzfeed and The Sydney Morning Herald?   Students will be encouraged to assess shifts in national, regional and international media patterns of production, distribution and consumption. The aim is to come to an understanding of the tumultuous contemporary global communication environment. Key concepts examined include: the advent of social media; the radical implications of globalisation; the disruption of established information flows and emergence of new information channels; the ethics, law and regulation of modern media; and trends in communication and information technologies. Issues addressed include: the rise of celebrity culture; the challenges facing the entertainment industry; and the rise, rise and potential demise of Rupert Murdoch. The focus will be international, with an emphasis on Australia.   Ultimately, the course will examine the ways in which global communication is undergoing a paradigm shift, as demonstrated by the Arab spring and the creeping dominance of Google, Facebook and Twitter. In other words: students, I\u2019ve a feeling we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore.

During the course of the semester we will discuss many different aspects of cognition: perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision making. The emphasis in the course will be on how psychologists have used experiments to help construct theories of how the human mind works and how human thinking occurs. The class will involve lectures, student presentations, discussion, video material to accompany lectures, and occasional example class experiments. The course also has a practical component, for which students work in small groups and conduct an empirical study, which they write up in a research report.     Sample Syllabus                                                                      Social Psychology - PSYCH-UA 9032 - 4 points                               Prerequisite for NYU Students: PSYCH-UA 1/Introduction to Psychology   This course advances the understanding of major principles and findings of social psychology. This course will specifically discuss four main areas: (1) the science of social psychology; (2) the individual within the social world; (3) the impact individuals have on another individual or group; and (4) social relationships.   The course will be in lecture format, but class discussion and participation is expected. Therefore, preparation prior to each class is necessary.

The Australian Experience - SCA-UA 9809 - 4 points                               This course offers a wide-ranging critique of Australian culture and society. It aims to interrogate Australian society with a methodology that draws on critical race theory, feminism, social geography and cultural studies. It will look at issues such as the relationship between Australian settler culture and Aboriginal Australians; Australia\u2019s experience of migration and multiculturalism; Australians\u2019 relationship with their environment; and Australians\u2019 sense of national identity. In particular, it will consider how these issues have played out in popular culture.   This course offers a special experience for students wishing to broaden and deepen their methodologies of cultural analysis. Australian society is fascinating in itself, but it also offers a unique perspective on transnational issues such as identity formation, social justice movements and the experience of multiculturalism. For instance, given Australia\u2019s history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations, the issue of race in a post-colonial context is particularly acute here. Through comparison with the Australian experience, students will develop a more critical view of American and global society. Students wishing to pursue a career that involves cultural analysis will benefit greatly from studying Australian society, in Australia, and thus developing this comparative approach.   This course has three interweaving themes of study: race, class and gender. This course will look at how these issues have played out in various facets of Australian culture, ie: attitudes to the landscape; representations of crime; humour; and art. The course is bookended by sessions that consider place-making in Australia: an introductory session that looks at exploration and mapping, and a concluding session that looks at popular music and geographies of place.

Aussies famously describe their nation as the lucky country, yet from the Indigenous perspective, it might more aptly be called the stolen country. Australia is the land of the fair go, which cruelly detains refugees; a multicultural nation with a history of a white Australia policy; a place with distinctive local traditions, which takes many of its cues from global culture; an easy-going country with a surprisingly large degree of governmental control over individual liberties; a highly urbanised population that romances the Bush and the Outback as embodying \u2018real\u2019 Australia; a nation proud of its traditions of egalitarianism and mateship, with numerous rules about who is allowed in \u2018the club\u2019; a society with a history of anti-British and anti-American sentiment that simultaneously hold strong political allegiances and military pacts with Britain and the USA; and a place with a history of progressive social policy and a democratic tradition, which has never undergone a revolution. This course strives to make sense of Australian society and culture by exploring the complexities and contradictions in Australia\u2019s self-image.   The course will be introduced with an overview, and followed by four sessions covering four distinct themes during Orientation and the first three weeks of semester. Each session will include a 1-hour lecture, either given by the instructor or a guest lecturer, and a recitation-style discussion. There are seven mandatory field trips: Sydney Harbour Cruise, Rocks Walking Tour, The Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park, Balmain Bowling Club Lawn Bowls, Overnight trip to Inglevale Farm, and the NYU World Tour.   Sample Syllabus                          Anthropology                                                 Anthropology of Indigenous Australia - ANTH-UA 9037 - 4 points                               This course offers an introduction to some of the classical and current issues in the anthropology of Indigenous Australia. The role of anthropology in the representation and governance of Indigenous life is itself an important subject for anthropological inquiry, considering that Indigenous people of Australia have long been the objects of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics. These representations\u2014in feature films about them (such as Rabbit-Proof Fence and Australia), New Age Literature (such as Mutant Message Down Under), or museum exhibitions (such as in the Museum of Sydney or the Australian Museum)\u2014are now also in dialogue with Indigenous forms of cultural production, in genres as diverse as film, television, drama, dance, art and writing. The course will explore how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions on their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. Through the examination of ethnographic and historical texts, films, archives and Indigenous life-writing accounts, we will consider the ways in which Aboriginalities are being challenged and constructed in contemporary Australia.

This course is a rigorous, quantitative introduction to financial market structure and financial asset valuation. This course seeks to equip students with a fundamental understanding of the concepts and principles of finance. The main topics of the course are time value of money, portfolio selection, equilibrium asset pricing (CAPM), equity valuation, arbitrage pricing, fixed income securities and derivatives. You are expected to understand valuation formulas and be able to apply them to new problems. The appropriate tools necessary for solving these problems will be developed at each stage and practiced in the homework assignments. The models we will cover have immediate applications and implications for real-world financial decisions. Every effort will be made to relate the course material to current financial news.   Throughout the course the emphasis will be on two main areas: learning conceptual knowledge through theory and problem solving; and critical thinking through the application of real-life scenarios and local cases. The course will incorporate aspects of Australian securities market and financial institutions and a comparative approach will be adopted in demonstrating similarities and differences between the U.S. capital market and the Australian capital market.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Introduction to Marketing - MKTG-UB 9001 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the concepts and skills needed to create and critique effective marketing. Marketers in all organisations require an understanding of the many facets of marketing, beyond simply advertising or communications. The American Marketing Association defines marketing as:   \u201cMarketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\u201d   The course focuses on the role of marketing and its importance in contemporary organisations and society. During the session, students will critically explore marketing principles, concepts and models from a practical perspective. Beyond studying the theory of marketing, students will analyse a variety of real-world examples and case studies. Organisations need to create a balanced, coordinated marketing mix, where all elements of its marketing activities work together. Marketing also requires combining qualitative and quantitative analysis to gain an understanding and reveal insights into the internal and external environment. To achieve this, the course uses a combination of lectures, class discussion, case studies, assignments and exams. The remainder of this syllabus describes the course and students responsibilities.

The films in this course offer critical perspectives on the history of colonisation in Australia; the legacies of the Stolen Generations; the controversies surrounding Australia\u2019s role in World War One; as well as Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbours. We will focus on films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo (2009). We will also draw on films that have employed innovative narrative and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past and the present such as Ten Canoes (2006) and The Tracker (2002). Throughout the course, students will develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies. In particular, students will develop a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched detail, allegory and archives across a diverse range of examples.

We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

In addition to major texts from Australia and New Zealand, we will also encounter a range of works from Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and the Pacific islands. Some questions we will tackle include: How have the cultural, historical, and economic processes of colonialism, diaspora and migration connected and shaped this diverse region? How have issues of race and indigeneity been central to various discourses of nationalism? What particular roles have Australia and New Zealand, as sub-imperial powers, played in the region? Finally, what can the latest generation of migrant writing in Australia show us about new forms of interconnections across the globalizing Asia-Pacific? Students in this course will examine novels, poetry, films and theoretical texts to develop critical thinking, reading and writing skills. Along the way, they will gain a solid grounding in the problematics of postcolonialism, race, diaspora, indigeneity, nationalism and multiculturalism.

In this course we consider the cultural reverberations of ecological awareness\u2014focusing on literature, cinema and visual art. Eco-criticism is a relatively young field of study in the humanities, developed in response to twin crises: actual environmental degradation, and a breakdown in intellectual categories of \u2018the natural\u2019 brought on by technology and politics. This course provides an opportunity to reflect on a number of key tropes in ecological thinking including wilderness, pollution, animals, food and apocalypse. Learn about a philosopher who survived a crocodile attack, the beach at the end of the world, how to prepare and eat Australian moths, and why the Large Hadron Collider is a metaphysical machine. Principle texts in this course include American and Australian novels, films and documentaries, read alongside supplementary sources in literary, audio and artistic mediums. We ask how literature\u2014one of the richest arenas for the practice of human imagination\u2014does, has, or could shape environmental thought and action. How does the non-human world enter into human artforms? What are the historical and structural obstacles to admitting different forms of consciousness into text?

We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

In short, we ask: what the heck is going on in the hyper-turbulent realm of blogs, Buzzfeed and The Sydney Morning Herald?   Students will be encouraged to assess shifts in national, regional and international media patterns of production, distribution and consumption. The aim is to come to an understanding of the tumultuous contemporary global communication environment. Key concepts examined include: the advent of social media; the radical implications of globalisation; the disruption of established information flows and emergence of new information channels; the ethics, law and regulation of modern media; and trends in communication and information technologies. Issues addressed include: the rise of celebrity culture; the challenges facing the entertainment industry; and the rise, rise and potential demise of Rupert Murdoch. The focus will be international, with an emphasis on Australia.   Ultimately, the course will examine the ways in which global communication is undergoing a paradigm shift, as demonstrated by the Arab spring and the creeping dominance of Google, Facebook and Twitter. In other words: students, I\u2019ve a feeling we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore.

During the course of the semester we will discuss many different aspects of cognition: perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision making. The emphasis in the course will be on how psychologists have used experiments to help construct theories of how the human mind works and how human thinking occurs. The class will involve lectures, student presentations, discussion, video material to accompany lectures, and occasional example class experiments. The course also has a practical component, for which students work in small groups and conduct an empirical study, which they write up in a research report.     Sample Syllabus                                                                      Social Psychology - PSYCH-UA 9032 - 4 points                               Prerequisite for NYU Students: PSYCH-UA 1/Introduction to Psychology   This course advances the understanding of major principles and findings of social psychology. This course will specifically discuss four main areas: (1) the science of social psychology; (2) the individual within the social world; (3) the impact individuals have on another individual or group; and (4) social relationships.   The course will be in lecture format, but class discussion and participation is expected. Therefore, preparation prior to each class is necessary.

The Australian Experience - SCA-UA 9809 - 4 points                               This course offers a wide-ranging critique of Australian culture and society. It aims to interrogate Australian society with a methodology that draws on critical race theory, feminism, social geography and cultural studies. It will look at issues such as the relationship between Australian settler culture and Aboriginal Australians; Australia\u2019s experience of migration and multiculturalism; Australians\u2019 relationship with their environment; and Australians\u2019 sense of national identity. In particular, it will consider how these issues have played out in popular culture.   This course offers a special experience for students wishing to broaden and deepen their methodologies of cultural analysis. Australian society is fascinating in itself, but it also offers a unique perspective on transnational issues such as identity formation, social justice movements and the experience of multiculturalism. For instance, given Australia\u2019s history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations, the issue of race in a post-colonial context is particularly acute here. Through comparison with the Australian experience, students will develop a more critical view of American and global society. Students wishing to pursue a career that involves cultural analysis will benefit greatly from studying Australian society, in Australia, and thus developing this comparative approach.   This course has three interweaving themes of study: race, class and gender. This course will look at how these issues have played out in various facets of Australian culture, ie: attitudes to the landscape; representations of crime; humour; and art. The course is bookended by sessions that consider place-making in Australia: an introductory session that looks at exploration and mapping, and a concluding session that looks at popular music and geographies of place.

Aspiring science reporters, authors, editors, producers, videographers, coders and bloggers (and various permutations thereof) who complete the intensive 16-month program receive a Master of Arts degree in Journalism and an Advanced Certificate in Science, Health and Environmental Reporting. They join an extended family of graduates (391 at last count!) committed to covering scientific, medical and environmental topics with precision, nuance and passion.   SHERP alumni have diverse backgrounds and beliefs and work in many types of digital, print and broadcast media in twenty-five countries. What unites them are two deeply held convictions: science is too important to leave only to scientists, and journalism is too important to leave only to the scientifically illiterate.   SHERP 's current students are the newest links in a chain that stretches back to the program's founding in 1982 by Bill Burrows , who retired in 2008 and was succeeded as SHERP director by Dan Fagin , a longtime science and environmental journalist who was awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction for his book, Toms River: A Story of Science and Salvation .\u00a0   What We Do: A Customized Curriculum, a Hands-On Approach   Humans are a storytelling species, and the scientific enterprise is the wellspring of many of our greatest contemporary narratives. But how many of us possess the skills to make these narratives our profession? SHERP 's customized curriculum is tailored to develop world-class science storytellers at a time of unprecedented change, challenge and opportunity in journalism. Our faculty of nationally prominent science journalists offers rigorous instruction in research, reporting, writing and editing through coverage of cutting-edge science, from nanotechnology and epigenetics to global climate change and cosmology. Coursework is built around case studies and learning by doing, not academic theory or rote memorization.   A key focus is reporting, writing and editing features and news for magazines and online sites , but students also dive into all forms of modern journalism, from books and long-form narratives to blogs , videos , audio podcasts , data visualization \u00a0and social media . Entrepreneurial skills, including self-marketing, are emphasized throughout the SHERP sequence and especially in a new class focusing on developing sound business models for digital science journalism projects. Investigative science journalism is also an important curricular focus, as evidenced by a recent investigation conducted by Professor Charles Seife and his SHERP students into fraudulent drug studies submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. The powerful results of this faculty-student collaboration\u00a0 were published \u00a0in 2015 in JAMA-Internal Medicine and Slate .   Visual journalism is woven into the curriculum from the first semester, when every SHERP student learns to shoot and edit video under the tutelage of an experienced videographer \u00a0who also provides advanced instruction during the second semester. There is also a workshop on data mining, analysis and visualization taught by graphics editors at the Times . We teach audio podcasting, too. The curriculum reflects our philosophy that twenty-first century journalism education should be platform-agnostic : the content of the story should dictate its form, not vice versa. Whether they do most of their work in print or online, our graduates thrive in the fast-changing science journalism landscape because they are comfortable telling stories on mulltiple platforms, in multiple ways.   The culture at SHERP is challenging but never cutthroat. We emphasize cooperative learning in an informal, intellectually rich  environment. SHERP students work hard and love what they do. Thanks to  the specialized curriculum and intimate atmosphere, \"sherpies\" form lifelong bonds during their sixteen months in the program, including eight marriages so far!   Where We Work: NYC, the World Capital of Science Journalism   SHERP takes full advantage of its home base at the center of the science journalism firmament: New York City, where there are more journalism job opportunities than anywhere else in the world. Our neighborhood is a particularly fertile one for science storytelling because\u00a020 Cooper Square is right in the middle of Lower Manhattan's booming Silicon Alley; Facebook and IBM's Jeopardy!-winning Watson computer are one block away.\u00a0A small program nested comfortably in a large research university, SHERP utilizes the vast intellectual resources of New York University, including the NYU School of Medicine, to enrich student experiences.\u00a0We also reach well beyond the university community.\u00a0In addition to two full-time professors with many years of experience in professional science journalism, Dan Fagin and Charles Seife , the program's superb faculty includes current or former editors and writers at Scientific  American , The New York Times , Science , Reuters ,  Nature and The Wall Street Journal , among other outlets. SHERP faculty work at the very highest levels of science journalism but are also deeply committed to the hard work of teaching well, with long track records of success in the classroom as well as the newsroom.     \u00a0        The curriculum also draws heavily on a roster of guest speakers constituting a who's who of science journalism and science research.  In a typical year, nearly one hundred journalists and scientists  visit SHERP to speak in classes or at evening seminars that have become gathering places for the New York science journalism community. There are also yearly field trips to Brookhaven National Laboratory, The New York Times , the American Museum of Natural History and CNN. When SHERP students go on a field trip, they do much more than tour; they pitch stories to editors and participate in seminars with leading researchers.   Science journalism internships at leading publications, programs and web sites are a crucial part of the SHERP experience and are fully integrated into the overall curriculum, not a tacked-on appendage. Every student completes two for-credit internships during the final eight months of the program, but the internship process actually begins much earlier. Starting in the first semester, SHERP's internship coordinator provides personalized support and advice, assisting students in landing positions and then making sure they get the most out of their internship experiences. SHERP interns don't get coffee, except for themselves; they get clips . Many choose to intern at outlets that have worked closely with SHERP for years ; their supervisors are often alumni or current or former faculty. Others take advantage of the flexibility of the our internship program to secure internships at exciting new digital publishing ventures or\u00a0 places \u00a0 a little \u00a0 farther off the beaten track \u00a0for science journalists.     \u00a0   &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;   SHERP's popular Inside-Out speaker series features candid conversations with some of the world's most prominent science journalists.   Watch More &gt;   \u00a0   \u00a0        Our Focus: Building Skills and Portfolios   To thrive in today's convergent media environment, science journalists need diverse skills and a broad portfolio of published work. SHERP delivers both. By graduation, a typical SHERP student has written or edited dozens of stories of all lengths and types, produced several video and audio pieces, built data graphics and slide shows and even authored a book proposal -- all prepared in close collaboration with highly accomplished professors who are leaders in science journalism.\u00a0   The stories SHERP students produce for their classes are of such high quality that every year many are published in professional media. In addition, students gain invaluable experience by assigning, reporting, writing and editing stories for Scienceline , an award-winning webzine run entirely by SHERP students. Scienceline's mix of news, features, profiles , blogs , videos , audio podcasts and data visualizations attracts approximately 6,000 visitors per day (more than 2 million per year) from around the world. In addition, Scienceline stories are regularly syndicated to the web sites of Scientific American , Discover , Popular Science , LiveScience.com , Space.com , OnEarth , The Scientist and other outlets , generating even more clips, exposure and opportunities for SHERP students. Finally, SHERP's unrivalled internship program puts students in position to publish their work in places like The New York  Times , NOVA , Wired and dozens of other globally prominent outlets .   Life After SHERP   Job placement is a proven strength of SHERP. Every year, several graduating students go to work full-time at places where they were SHERP interns; other job-seeking graduates tap the close-knit and extensive SHERP alumni network, which operates its own busy email list. Over the years, editors have come to trust the SHERP \"brand,\" so graduates fare very well in the extremely competitive market for staff jobs and freelance work in science journalism.   SHERP alumni regularly return to Cooper Square for evening seminars and other special events , and as guest speakers in classes. They also assist their successors by generously contributing to the Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund. The tight bonds between current and former students and faculty (both present and past ) are a distinguishing feature of SHERP and a crucial asset for \"SHERPies\" new and old. (Long after they've graduated, SHERPies love to collaborate with each other, whether on serious editor-writer partnerships or this parody video .)   Join Us!

Aussies famously describe their nation as the lucky country, yet from the Indigenous perspective, it might more aptly be called the stolen country. Australia is the land of the fair go, which cruelly detains refugees; a multicultural nation with a history of a white Australia policy; a place with distinctive local traditions, which takes many of its cues from global culture; an easy-going country with a surprisingly large degree of governmental control over individual liberties; a highly urbanised population that romances the Bush and the Outback as embodying \u2018real\u2019 Australia; a nation proud of its traditions of egalitarianism and mateship, with numerous rules about who is allowed in \u2018the club\u2019; a society with a history of anti-British and anti-American sentiment that simultaneously hold strong political allegiances and military pacts with Britain and the USA; and a place with a history of progressive social policy and a democratic tradition, which has never undergone a revolution. This course strives to make sense of Australian society and culture by exploring the complexities and contradictions in Australia\u2019s self-image.   The course will be introduced with an overview, and followed by four sessions covering four distinct themes during Orientation and the first three weeks of semester. Each session will include a 1-hour lecture, either given by the instructor or a guest lecturer, and a recitation-style discussion. There are seven mandatory field trips: Sydney Harbour Cruise, Rocks Walking Tour, The Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park, Balmain Bowling Club Lawn Bowls, Overnight trip to Inglevale Farm, and the NYU World Tour.   Sample Syllabus                          Anthropology                                                 Anthropology of Indigenous Australia - ANTH-UA 9037 - 4 points                               This course offers an introduction to some of the classical and current issues in the anthropology of Indigenous Australia. The role of anthropology in the representation and governance of Indigenous life is itself an important subject for anthropological inquiry, considering that Indigenous people of Australia have long been the objects of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics. These representations\u2014in feature films about them (such as Rabbit-Proof Fence and Australia), New Age Literature (such as Mutant Message Down Under), or museum exhibitions (such as in the Museum of Sydney or the Australian Museum)\u2014are now also in dialogue with Indigenous forms of cultural production, in genres as diverse as film, television, drama, dance, art and writing. The course will explore how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions on their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. Through the examination of ethnographic and historical texts, films, archives and Indigenous life-writing accounts, we will consider the ways in which Aboriginalities are being challenged and constructed in contemporary Australia.   The course will consist of lectures interspersed with discussions, student presentations, and films/other media; we may also have guest presenters.

It focuses on some of the regional and historical variations of Aboriginal art in the context of the history of a settler nation, while considering the issues of its circulation and evaluation within contemporary discourses of value. Topics include the cosmological dimensions of the art, its political implications, its relationship to cultural identity, and its aesthetic frameworks. Students will visit some of the major national collections of Indigenous Australian art as well as exhibitions of contemporary works. There will also be guest presentations from Indigenous artists and Indigenous art curators.

This course is a rigorous, quantitative introduction to financial market structure and financial asset valuation. This course seeks to equip students with a fundamental understanding of the concepts and principles of finance. The main topics of the course are time value of money, portfolio selection, equilibrium asset pricing (CAPM), equity valuation, arbitrage pricing, fixed income securities and derivatives. You are expected to understand valuation formulas and be able to apply them to new problems. The appropriate tools necessary for solving these problems will be developed at each stage and practiced in the homework assignments. The models we will cover have immediate applications and implications for real-world financial decisions. Every effort will be made to relate the course material to current financial news.   Throughout the course the emphasis will be on two main areas: learning conceptual knowledge through theory and problem solving; and critical thinking through the application of real-life scenarios and local cases. The course will incorporate aspects of Australian securities market and financial institutions and a comparative approach will be adopted in demonstrating similarities and differences between the U.S. capital market and the Australian capital market.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Introduction to Marketing - MKTG-UB 9001 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the concepts and skills needed to create and critique effective marketing. Marketers in all organisations require an understanding of the many facets of marketing, beyond simply advertising or communications. The American Marketing Association defines marketing as:   \u201cMarketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\u201d   The course focuses on the role of marketing and its importance in contemporary organisations and society. During the session, students will critically explore marketing principles, concepts and models from a practical perspective. Beyond studying the theory of marketing, students will analyse a variety of real-world examples and case studies. Organisations need to create a balanced, coordinated marketing mix, where all elements of its marketing activities work together. Marketing also requires combining qualitative and quantitative analysis to gain an understanding and reveal insights into the internal and external environment. To achieve this, the course uses a combination of lectures, class discussion, case studies, assignments and exams. The remainder of this syllabus describes the course and students responsibilities.

The films in this course offer critical perspectives on the history of colonisation in Australia; the legacies of the Stolen Generations; the controversies surrounding Australia\u2019s role in World War One; as well as Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbours. We will focus on films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo (2009). We will also draw on films that have employed innovative narrative and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past and the present such as Ten Canoes (2006) and The Tracker (2002). Throughout the course, students will develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies. In particular, students will develop a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched detail, allegory and archives across a diverse range of examples.

We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

In addition to major texts from Australia and New Zealand, we will also encounter a range of works from Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and the Pacific islands. Some questions we will tackle include: How have the cultural, historical, and economic processes of colonialism, diaspora and migration connected and shaped this diverse region? How have issues of race and indigeneity been central to various discourses of nationalism? What particular roles have Australia and New Zealand, as sub-imperial powers, played in the region? Finally, what can the latest generation of migrant writing in Australia show us about new forms of interconnections across the globalizing Asia-Pacific? Students in this course will examine novels, poetry, films and theoretical texts to develop critical thinking, reading and writing skills. Along the way, they will gain a solid grounding in the problematics of postcolonialism, race, diaspora, indigeneity, nationalism and multiculturalism.

In this course we consider the cultural reverberations of ecological awareness\u2014focusing on literature, cinema and visual art. Eco-criticism is a relatively young field of study in the humanities, developed in response to twin crises: actual environmental degradation, and a breakdown in intellectual categories of \u2018the natural\u2019 brought on by technology and politics. This course provides an opportunity to reflect on a number of key tropes in ecological thinking including wilderness, pollution, animals, food and apocalypse. Learn about a philosopher who survived a crocodile attack, the beach at the end of the world, how to prepare and eat Australian moths, and why the Large Hadron Collider is a metaphysical machine. Principle texts in this course include American and Australian novels, films and documentaries, read alongside supplementary sources in literary, audio and artistic mediums. We ask how literature\u2014one of the richest arenas for the practice of human imagination\u2014does, has, or could shape environmental thought and action. How does the non-human world enter into human artforms? What are the historical and structural obstacles to admitting different forms of consciousness into text?

We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

Historical and theoretical frameworks will be provided to enable students to approach the scope, disparity and complexity of current developments. These frameworks will be supplemented with the latest media news and developments. In short, we ask: what the heck is going on in the hyper-turbulent realm of blogs, Buzzfeed and The Sydney Morning Herald?   Students will be encouraged to assess shifts in national, regional and international media patterns of production, distribution and consumption. The aim is to come to an understanding of the tumultuous contemporary global communication environment. Key concepts examined include: the advent of social media; the radical implications of globalisation; the disruption of established information flows and emergence of new information channels; the ethics, law and regulation of modern media; and trends in communication and information technologies. Issues addressed include: the rise of celebrity culture; the challenges facing the entertainment industry; and the rise, rise and potential demise of Rupert Murdoch. The focus will be international, with an emphasis on Australia.   Ultimately, the course will examine the ways in which global communication is undergoing a paradigm shift, as demonstrated by the Arab spring and the creeping dominance of Google, Facebook and Twitter.

During the course of the semester we will discuss many different aspects of cognition: perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision making. The emphasis in the course will be on how psychologists have used experiments to help construct theories of how the human mind works and how human thinking occurs. The class will involve lectures, student presentations, discussion, video material to accompany lectures, and occasional example class experiments. The course also has a practical component, for which students work in small groups and conduct an empirical study, which they write up in a research report.     Sample Syllabus                                                                      Social Psychology - PSYCH-UA 9032 - 4 points                               Prerequisite for NYU Students: PSYCH-UA 1/Introduction to Psychology   This course advances the understanding of major principles and findings of social psychology. This course will specifically discuss four main areas: (1) the science of social psychology; (2) the individual within the social world; (3) the impact individuals have on another individual or group; and (4) social relationships.   The course will be in lecture format, but class discussion and participation is expected. Therefore, preparation prior to each class is necessary.

The Australian Experience - SCA-UA 9809 - 4 points                               This course offers a wide-ranging critique of Australian culture and society. It aims to interrogate Australian society with a methodology that draws on critical race theory, feminism, social geography and cultural studies. It will look at issues such as the relationship between Australian settler culture and Aboriginal Australians; Australia\u2019s experience of migration and multiculturalism; Australians\u2019 relationship with their environment; and Australians\u2019 sense of national identity. In particular, it will consider how these issues have played out in popular culture.   This course offers a special experience for students wishing to broaden and deepen their methodologies of cultural analysis. Australian society is fascinating in itself, but it also offers a unique perspective on transnational issues such as identity formation, social justice movements and the experience of multiculturalism. For instance, given Australia\u2019s history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations, the issue of race in a post-colonial context is particularly acute here. Through comparison with the Australian experience, students will develop a more critical view of American and global society. Students wishing to pursue a career that involves cultural analysis will benefit greatly from studying Australian society, in Australia, and thus developing this comparative approach.   This course has three interweaving themes of study: race, class and gender. This course will look at how these issues have played out in various facets of Australian culture, ie: attitudes to the landscape; representations of crime; humour; and art. The course is bookended by sessions that consider place-making in Australia: an introductory session that looks at exploration and mapping, and a concluding session that looks at popular music and geographies of place.

Aspiring science reporters, authors, editors, producers, videographers, coders and bloggers (and various permutations thereof) who complete the intensive 16-month program receive a Master of Arts degree in Journalism and an Advanced Certificate in Science, Health and Environmental Reporting. They join an extended family of graduates (391 at last count!) committed to covering scientific, medical and environmental topics with precision, nuance and passion.   SHERP alumni have diverse backgrounds and beliefs and work in many types of digital, print and broadcast media in twenty-five countries. What unites them are two deeply held convictions: science is too important to leave only to scientists, and journalism is too important to leave only to the scientifically illiterate.   SHERP 's current students are the newest links in a chain that stretches back to the program's founding in 1982 by Bill Burrows , who retired in 2008 and was succeeded as SHERP director by Dan Fagin , a longtime science and environmental journalist who was awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction for his book, Toms River: A Story of Science and Salvation .\u00a0   What We Do: A Customized Curriculum, a Hands-On Approach   Humans are a storytelling species, and the scientific enterprise is the wellspring of many of our greatest contemporary narratives. But how many of us possess the skills to make these narratives our profession? SHERP 's customized curriculum is tailored to develop world-class science storytellers at a time of unprecedented change, challenge and opportunity in journalism. Our faculty of nationally prominent science journalists offers rigorous instruction in research, reporting, writing and editing through coverage of cutting-edge science, from nanotechnology and epigenetics to global climate change and cosmology. Coursework is built around case studies and learning by doing, not academic theory or rote memorization.   A key focus is reporting, writing and editing features and news for magazines and online sites , but students also dive into all forms of modern journalism, from books and long-form narratives to blogs , videos , audio podcasts , data visualization \u00a0and social media . Entrepreneurial skills, including self-marketing, are emphasized throughout the SHERP sequence and especially in a new class focusing on developing sound business models for digital science journalism projects. Investigative science journalism is also an important curricular focus, as evidenced by a recent investigation conducted by Professor Charles Seife and his SHERP students into fraudulent drug studies submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. The powerful results of this faculty-student collaboration\u00a0 were published \u00a0in 2015 in JAMA-Internal Medicine and Slate .   Visual journalism is woven into the curriculum from the first semester, when every SHERP student learns to shoot and edit video under the tutelage of an experienced videographer \u00a0who also provides advanced instruction during the second semester. There is also a workshop on data mining, analysis and visualization taught by graphics editors at the Times . We teach audio podcasting, too. The curriculum reflects our philosophy that twenty-first century journalism education should be platform-agnostic : the content of the story should dictate its form, not vice versa. Whether they do most of their work in print or online, our graduates thrive in the fast-changing science journalism landscape because they are comfortable telling stories on mulltiple platforms, in multiple ways.   The culture at SHERP is challenging but never cutthroat. We emphasize cooperative learning in an informal, intellectually rich  environment. SHERP students work hard and love what they do. Thanks to  the specialized curriculum and intimate atmosphere, \"sherpies\" form lifelong bonds during their sixteen months in the program, including eight marriages so far!   Where We Work: NYC, the World Capital of Science Journalism   SHERP takes full advantage of its home base at the center of the science journalism firmament: New York City, where there are more journalism job opportunities than anywhere else in the world. Our neighborhood is a particularly fertile one for science storytelling because\u00a020 Cooper Square is right in the middle of Lower Manhattan's booming Silicon Alley; Facebook and IBM's Jeopardy!-winning Watson computer are one block away.\u00a0A small program nested comfortably in a large research university, SHERP utilizes the vast intellectual resources of New York University, including the NYU School of Medicine, to enrich student experiences.\u00a0We also reach well beyond the university community.\u00a0In addition to two full-time professors with many years of experience in professional science journalism, Dan Fagin and Charles Seife , the program's superb faculty includes current or former editors and writers at Scientific  American , The New York Times , Science , Reuters ,  Nature and The Wall Street Journal , among other outlets. SHERP faculty work at the very highest levels of science journalism but are also deeply committed to the hard work of teaching well, with long track records of success in the classroom as well as the newsroom.     \u00a0        The curriculum also draws heavily on a roster of guest speakers constituting a who's who of science journalism and science research.  In a typical year, nearly one hundred journalists and scientists  visit SHERP to speak in classes or at evening seminars that have become gathering places for the New York science journalism community. There are also yearly field trips to Brookhaven National Laboratory, The New York Times , the American Museum of Natural History and CNN. When SHERP students go on a field trip, they do much more than tour; they pitch stories to editors and participate in seminars with leading researchers.   Science journalism internships at leading publications, programs and web sites are a crucial part of the SHERP experience and are fully integrated into the overall curriculum, not a tacked-on appendage. Every student completes two for-credit internships during the final eight months of the program, but the internship process actually begins much earlier. Starting in the first semester, SHERP's internship coordinator provides personalized support and advice, assisting students in landing positions and then making sure they get the most out of their internship experiences. SHERP interns don't get coffee, except for themselves; they get clips . Many choose to intern at outlets that have worked closely with SHERP for years ; their supervisors are often alumni or current or former faculty. Others take advantage of the flexibility of the our internship program to secure internships at exciting new digital publishing ventures or\u00a0 places \u00a0 a little \u00a0 farther off the beaten track \u00a0for science journalists.     \u00a0   &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;   SHERP's popular Inside-Out speaker series features candid conversations with some of the world's most prominent science journalists.   Watch More &gt;   \u00a0   \u00a0        Our Focus: Building Skills and Portfolios   To thrive in today's convergent media environment, science journalists need diverse skills and a broad portfolio of published work. SHERP delivers both. By graduation, a typical SHERP student has written or edited dozens of stories of all lengths and types, produced several video and audio pieces, built data graphics and slide shows and even authored a book proposal -- all prepared in close collaboration with highly accomplished professors who are leaders in science journalism.\u00a0   The stories SHERP students produce for their classes are of such high quality that every year many are published in professional media. In addition, students gain invaluable experience by assigning, reporting, writing and editing stories for Scienceline , an award-winning webzine run entirely by SHERP students. Scienceline's mix of news, features, profiles , blogs , videos , audio podcasts and data visualizations attracts approximately 6,000 visitors per day (more than 2 million per year) from around the world. In addition, Scienceline stories are regularly syndicated to the web sites of Scientific American , Discover , Popular Science , LiveScience.com , Space.com , OnEarth , The Scientist and other outlets , generating even more clips, exposure and opportunities for SHERP students. Finally, SHERP's unrivalled internship program puts students in position to publish their work in places like The New York  Times , NOVA , Wired and dozens of other globally prominent outlets .   Life After SHERP   Job placement is a proven strength of SHERP. Every year, several graduating students go to work full-time at places where they were SHERP interns; other job-seeking graduates tap the close-knit and extensive SHERP alumni network, which operates its own busy email list. Over the years, editors have come to trust the SHERP \"brand,\" so graduates fare very well in the extremely competitive market for staff jobs and freelance work in science journalism.   SHERP alumni regularly return to Cooper Square for evening seminars and other special events , and as guest speakers in classes. They also assist their successors by generously contributing to the Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund. The tight bonds between current and former students and faculty (both present and past ) are a distinguishing feature of SHERP and a crucial asset for \"SHERPies\" new and old. (Long after they've graduated, SHERPies love to collaborate with each other, whether on serious editor-writer partnerships or this parody video .)   Join Us!   If you think our program is right for you, we look forward to introducing you to our students, professors and alumni and showing you the unique, convivial culture of SHERP. Please see the How to Apply page for full details on how to proceed. All SHERP students start in September and are expected to complete the program by December of the following year. We are not able to enroll part-time students.   Please note that the formal application deadline is January 4 but we will consider late applications. We make admission decisions on a rolling basis starting in February. All applicants need to take the GRE test, whether or not you already have a graduate degree.   SHERP gratefully acknowledges the generosity of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and our alumni and friends in helping to support our work.     \u00a0   \u00a0                 Events                     Past Events         April            02       Documentary Distribution: Maximizing Opportunities              March            27       2015 NYU Journalism Career Fair              March            24       Filming on the Frontlines                  More events &gt;     Academic calendar &gt;                   Byline - Recent Publications                                      A Children&#39;s Book About Snowy Owls         April 06, 2015                                Melissa Kim          SHERP 1984                                                   Peter Pan: the Ultimate Alt-Bro         April 02, 2015                                Ashley Taylor          SHERP 2012                                                   Diagnosis or Delusion?
