We developed a competency-based instructional model based on thinking skills and built the first program to provide clinical training and experiences to predoctoral students in esthetic oriented orthodontic treatment using clear aligners.   Our postgraduate orthodontic program has been designed as an intensive and exciting three-year journey which aims not only to develop orthodontists but to develop leaders in our field, pioneers of a new generation of orthodontists.   The department is also pioneering research in orthodontics and tooth movement through CTOR, the Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research. Numerous animal and clinical studies are underway, investigating ways to move teeth faster and safer and strengthen the bones of the jaws.                    meet our faculty & staff Read More                    alumni: connecting, events, fundraising Read More                    CTOR Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   Comprehensive care requires the general dentist to recognize, identify, and manage all aspects of oral and dental diseases and disorders, including orthodontic and dentofacial problems. General dentists must have an understanding of the etiology and management of acquired and developmental occlusal abnormalities and dentofacial deformities for patients of all ages. The general dentist should also be able to counsel patients and consult with specialists to coordinate total oral health care. The curriculum emphasizes critical thinking and problem-solving skills and the distinction between limited and comprehensive orthodontic treatment. The department works closely with the Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR) , the only center of its kind dedicated to the rapid translation of research finding in to novel clinic applications and improved therapies.                                                  First Year                               Foundational information concerning postnatal facial growth, tooth eruption patterns and timing is presented with clinical applications. This unit is integrated with the basic science curriculum.                                                              Second Year                               Foundational information concerning diagnosis is presented. Students begin to apply this in the context of patient examination toward developing sub-skills for competence:     Reporting: Recognizing normal and abnormal conditions, identifying, analyzing information   Interpreting: Synthesizing information, investigating etiology, making decisions/ judgments based in reason and/or evidence   Managing: Deciding care strategies in the best interest of the patient, including no treatment, observation, or treatment   Educating: Counseling the patient about problems, management objectives, care options, risks and benefits of care options     Foundational information and experiences support knowledge and skills in esthetic oriented orthodontic treatment using clear aligners.   Students are also presented with interdisciplinary controversies in dental healthcare and explore disagreements and make/ defend decisions.                                                              Third Year                               Students participate in a series of small group seminars where diagnostic topics introduced in the second year are further developed and reinforced. By reviewing the components of patient diagnosis in the context of simulated clinical case histories, students demonstrate competence in developing problem lists, treatment objectives, sequential treatment plans and alternative treatment plans. Specific attention is given to occlusal examination, evaluation of facial form and proportion, cephalometric analysis, diagnostic study cast analysis, and radiographic interpretation. Foundational information concerning topics that pertain to concepts and practice are presented. Topics include: biology of tooth movement, biomechanics, mechanotherapy and a variety of appliances used during and after orthodontic treatment.   Students diagnose and treat patients who could benefit from esthetic oriented clear aligner therapy under faculty supervision.                                                              Fourth Year                               Students with patients who could benefit from esthetic oriented clear aligner therapy have active clinical experiences under faculty supervision. Students are assessed for competence in management of malocclusion and skeletal problems and credentialed for graduation.   A select group of fourth year students participate in an Orthodontic Honors program. Through conferences, seminars, and clinical experiences, students develop more advanced knowledge and skills in managing orthodontic and dentofacial problems.

Numerous animal and clinical studies are underway, investigating ways to move teeth faster and safer and strengthen the bones of the jaws.   Our most recent innovation is our newly patented method which is shown to accelerate tooth movement as much as 50% in early-phase clinical studies, safely and effectively.

She has a most pleasing personality and is very respectful to a 74-year-old.   I feel very comfortable when she is examining and cleaning my teeth; she inspires trust. Her chair-side manner is very reassuring and her handling of dental instruments is very gentle. I appreciate that she keeps in touch with the faculty periodontist, Dr. Kye, and together they keep me abreast of the best plan for my dental health. She updates him whenever necessary. She also has Dr. Kye check her work before ending my appointment.   In my opinion she is already an outstanding dental practitioner. I still have one year left under her care, until she graduates, and will continue to enjoy that special care.

We developed a competency-based instructional model based on thinking skills and built the first program to provide clinical training and experiences to predoctoral students in esthetic oriented orthodontic treatment using clear aligners.   Our postgraduate orthodontic program has been designed as an intensive and exciting three-year journey which aims not only to develop orthodontists but to develop leaders in our field, pioneers of a new generation of orthodontists.   The department is also pioneering research in orthodontics and tooth movement through CTOR, the Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research. Numerous animal and clinical studies are underway, investigating ways to move teeth faster and safer and strengthen the bones of the jaws.                    meet our faculty & staff Read More                    alumni: connecting, events, fundraising Read More                    CTOR Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   Comprehensive care requires the general dentist to recognize, identify, and manage all aspects of oral and dental diseases and disorders, including orthodontic and dentofacial problems. General dentists must have an understanding of the etiology and management of acquired and developmental occlusal abnormalities and dentofacial deformities for patients of all ages. The general dentist should also be able to counsel patients and consult with specialists to coordinate total oral health care. The curriculum emphasizes critical thinking and problem-solving skills and the distinction between limited and comprehensive orthodontic treatment. The department works closely with the Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR) , the only center of its kind dedicated to the rapid translation of research finding in to novel clinic applications and improved therapies.                                                  First Year                               Foundational information concerning postnatal facial growth, tooth eruption patterns and timing is presented with clinical applications. This unit is integrated with the basic science curriculum.                                                              Second Year                               Foundational information concerning diagnosis is presented. Students begin to apply this in the context of patient examination toward developing sub-skills for competence:     Reporting: Recognizing normal and abnormal conditions, identifying, analyzing information   Interpreting: Synthesizing information, investigating etiology, making decisions/ judgments based in reason and/or evidence   Managing: Deciding care strategies in the best interest of the patient, including no treatment, observation, or treatment   Educating: Counseling the patient about problems, management objectives, care options, risks and benefits of care options     Foundational information and experiences support knowledge and skills in esthetic oriented orthodontic treatment using clear aligners.   Students are also presented with interdisciplinary controversies in dental healthcare and explore disagreements and make/ defend decisions.                                                              Third Year                               Students participate in a series of small group seminars where diagnostic topics introduced in the second year are further developed and reinforced. By reviewing the components of patient diagnosis in the context of simulated clinical case histories, students demonstrate competence in developing problem lists, treatment objectives, sequential treatment plans and alternative treatment plans. Specific attention is given to occlusal examination, evaluation of facial form and proportion, cephalometric analysis, diagnostic study cast analysis, and radiographic interpretation. Foundational information concerning topics that pertain to concepts and practice are presented. Topics include: biology of tooth movement, biomechanics, mechanotherapy and a variety of appliances used during and after orthodontic treatment.   Students diagnose and treat patients who could benefit from esthetic oriented clear aligner therapy under faculty supervision.                                                              Fourth Year                               Students with patients who could benefit from esthetic oriented clear aligner therapy have active clinical experiences under faculty supervision. Students are assessed for competence in management of malocclusion and skeletal problems and credentialed for graduation.   A select group of fourth year students participate in an Orthodontic Honors program. Through conferences, seminars, and clinical experiences, students develop more advanced knowledge and skills in managing orthodontic and dentofacial problems.

Numerous animal and clinical studies are underway, investigating ways to move teeth faster and safer and strengthen the bones of the jaws.   Our most recent innovation is our newly patented method which is shown to accelerate tooth movement as much as 50% in early-phase clinical studies, safely and effectively.

Here's what our patients are saying:                                I am writing to you to express my complete satisfaction with the level of dental care that I have been receiving from my student dentist, Ms Kavita Patel. She has a most pleasing personality and is very respectful to a 74-year-old.   I feel very comfortable when she is examining and cleaning my teeth; she inspires trust. Her chair-side manner is very reassuring and her handling of dental instruments is very gentle. I appreciate that she keeps in touch with the faculty periodontist, Dr. Kye, and together they keep me abreast of the best plan for my dental health. She updates him whenever necessary. She also has Dr. Kye check her work before ending my appointment.   In my opinion she is already an outstanding dental practitioner. I still have one year left under her care, until she graduates, and will continue to enjoy that special care.

We developed a competency-based instructional model based on thinking skills and built the first program to provide clinical training and experiences to predoctoral students in esthetic oriented orthodontic treatment using clear aligners.   Our postgraduate orthodontic program has been designed as an intensive and exciting three-year journey which aims not only to develop orthodontists but to develop leaders in our field, pioneers of a new generation of orthodontists.   The department is also pioneering research in orthodontics and tooth movement through CTOR, the Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research. Numerous animal and clinical studies are underway, investigating ways to move teeth faster and safer and strengthen the bones of the jaws.                    meet our faculty & staff Read More                    alumni: connecting, events, fundraising Read More                    CTOR Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   Comprehensive care requires the general dentist to recognize, identify, and manage all aspects of oral and dental diseases and disorders, including orthodontic and dentofacial problems. General dentists must have an understanding of the etiology and management of acquired and developmental occlusal abnormalities and dentofacial deformities for patients of all ages. The general dentist should also be able to counsel patients and consult with specialists to coordinate total oral health care. The curriculum emphasizes critical thinking and problem-solving skills and the distinction between limited and comprehensive orthodontic treatment. The department works closely with the Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR) , the only center of its kind dedicated to the rapid translation of research finding in to novel clinic applications and improved therapies.                                                  First Year                               Foundational information concerning postnatal facial growth, tooth eruption patterns and timing is presented with clinical applications. This unit is integrated with the basic science curriculum.                                                              Second Year                               Foundational information concerning diagnosis is presented. Students begin to apply this in the context of patient examination toward developing sub-skills for competence:     Reporting: Recognizing normal and abnormal conditions, identifying, analyzing information   Interpreting: Synthesizing information, investigating etiology, making decisions/ judgments based in reason and/or evidence   Managing: Deciding care strategies in the best interest of the patient, including no treatment, observation, or treatment   Educating: Counseling the patient about problems, management objectives, care options, risks and benefits of care options     Foundational information and experiences support knowledge and skills in esthetic oriented orthodontic treatment using clear aligners.   Students are also presented with interdisciplinary controversies in dental healthcare and explore disagreements and make/ defend decisions.                                                              Third Year                               Students participate in a series of small group seminars where diagnostic topics introduced in the second year are further developed and reinforced. By reviewing the components of patient diagnosis in the context of simulated clinical case histories, students demonstrate competence in developing problem lists, treatment objectives, sequential treatment plans and alternative treatment plans. Specific attention is given to occlusal examination, evaluation of facial form and proportion, cephalometric analysis, diagnostic study cast analysis, and radiographic interpretation. Foundational information concerning topics that pertain to concepts and practice are presented. Topics include: biology of tooth movement, biomechanics, mechanotherapy and a variety of appliances used during and after orthodontic treatment.   Students diagnose and treat patients who could benefit from esthetic oriented clear aligner therapy under faculty supervision.                                                              Fourth Year                               Students with patients who could benefit from esthetic oriented clear aligner therapy have active clinical experiences under faculty supervision. Students are assessed for competence in management of malocclusion and skeletal problems and credentialed for graduation.   A select group of fourth year students participate in an Orthodontic Honors program. Through conferences, seminars, and clinical experiences, students develop more advanced knowledge and skills in managing orthodontic and dentofacial problems.

Numerous animal and clinical studies are underway, investigating ways to move teeth faster and safer and strengthen the bones of the jaws.   Our most recent innovation is our newly patented method which is shown to accelerate tooth movement as much as 50% in early-phase clinical studies, safely and effectively.

Here's what our patients are saying:                                I am writing to you to express my complete satisfaction with the level of dental care that I have been receiving from my student dentist, Ms Kavita Patel. She has a most pleasing personality and is very respectful to a 74-year-old.   I feel very comfortable when she is examining and cleaning my teeth; she inspires trust. Her chair-side manner is very reassuring and her handling of dental instruments is very gentle. I appreciate that she keeps in touch with the faculty periodontist, Dr. Kye, and together they keep me abreast of the best plan for my dental health. She updates him whenever necessary. She also has Dr. Kye check her work before ending my appointment.   In my opinion she is already an outstanding dental practitioner. I still have one year left under her care, until she graduates, and will continue to enjoy that special care.

Objectives     Upon successful completion of the Advanced Program in Orthodontics, international program participants will have the ability to recognize patients requiring orthodontic therapy. They will develop the clinical skill to achieve, through orthodontic treatment, esthetic and functionally acceptable occlusion for patients with moderately severe malocclusion.     Faculty   Participants treat a variety of patients under the close guidance of a diverse and experienced faculty comprised of top practitioners in the field of orthodontics and related areas.     Course Components   A variety of lectures, seminars and conferences are incorporated into the program. Areas of focus include an overview of the biological basis and biomechanical principles of orthodontic theory and practice. Principles, issues and diverse subjects are explored and applied to clinical care and research. Participants are exposed to complex and interesting cases, such as orthognathic surgery, in a forum designed to enhance the ability to interact successfully with professionals with a variety of educational backgrounds. There are opportunities to participate in elective experiences such as teaching, research and society meetings. Ample time is made available for these and other individual student interests.
