Chetham's school and library contain the superbly preserved domestic premises of the collegiate church founded in 1421 (the church is now Manchester Cathedral, just alongside, which the Cathedral group will visit instead of the Rylands tour). See Manchester Cathedral below .  At the Reformation the buildings were held by the Stanleys, Earls of Derby, until the Civil War. Shortly after the merchant Humphrey Chetham died in 1653, his executors bought the buildings as the school and library for which he left money in his will. John Dee was warden there briefly at the turn of the 17th c. In the 19th. c. there were three phases of restoration, the one of 1878 by Alfred Waterhouse, architect of the City Hall and Victoria University (now Manchester University) as well as many other important public buildings throughout England. The school is a renowned Music School.  *For architecture, see further Hartwell, Manchester , pp. 63-70 and Clare Hartwell, The History and Architecture of Chetham's School and LIbrary (Yale UP, 2004) (on sale in the Library).   Manchester Cathedral  Although there is evidence of an Anglo-Saxon and early medieval church, the present church largely dates from the foundation of the college in 1421, after which it expanded through the building of chantry chapels until in the early 16th c under James Stanley II it reached its present size. It underwent later (primarily Victorian) refurbishment, after it became a Cathedral in 1846 when the diocese of Manchester was created to serve the burgeoning industrial city. The best recent work is that of Basil Champneys, architect of the Rylands Library (see below ) (porch and vestries 1898). It was damaged in World War 2 (1940) and again in the IRA bomb attack on Central Manchester in 1996.   In 1421 the Rector, Thomas de la Warre, who was also Lord of the Manor, petitioned Henry V to change the then Parish Church into a Collegiate foundation as a chantry college. The new Collegiate Church was to be governed by a Master or Warden, and eight Fellows. The Warden had the responsibility for the cure of souls as well as the government of the clergy and the parishioners. Thomas de la Warre was the last male member of his family and gave his manor house, which he had inherited from his childless brother (and which is now Chetham's Library and School), to be used as the residence for the priests or Fellows. IN 1482 James Stanley, younger brother of Sir Thomas Stanley (husband of Lady Margaret Beaufort), became Warden of the Collegiate Church, followed (1485-1506) by his nephew, also James (later Bishop of Ely), who endowed the John the Baptist chapel and partly donated the choir stalls. Delegates should particularly look at the choir and misericords.   Lady Margaret Beaufort secured several of her officials from the collegiate church. Their names identify their North-West origins: Hugh Ashton, her receiver-general, Hugh Oldham, her chancellor, Christopher Urswicke, her confessor, and others. Oldham, later bishop of Exeter, developed the Jesus Chapel chantry into a larger foundation which became in time Manchester Grammar School (still very prestigious), with the warden and fellows of the collegiate church appointing to the school. In 1547 the college was dissolved but re-established under Mary, receiving its third charter from Elizabeth in 1578 and its fourth from Charles I in 1636.   The Archives of Manchester Cathedral date from 1421 to the current day. They are housed in a purpose built strong-room above the North Porch and contain one of the longest complete runs of Parish Registers in the Country as well as many documents of local historical relevance, particularly concerning the Cathedrals land ownership. (They are therefore of interest to local historians but not to EBS members.)   *For architecture, see further Hartwell, Manchester , pp. 45-62. Guide books and leaflets will be available, and there is a very good historical timeline at the Cathedral website,  http://www.manchestercathedralonline.co.uk .   John Rylands Library , Deansgate  The Library was commissioned by the widow of John Rylands, Manchester Nonconformist and textile manufacturer in order to provide a memorial to her husband and to house his theological books as a free library. Mrs Rylands added two further major collections (see below), making it a leading scholarly library in England, which in 1972 merged with the University of Manchester Library. The building is by Basil Champneys (1890-9) and is a remarkable building with stunning fittings and furnishings. It has just re-opened after the building of a major extension. From the Library website  http://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/ The Library's manuscript collections originated in Mrs Rylands's purchase of the personal collection of the Earl of Crawford in 1901. Holdings of individual manuscript items now cover more than fifty languages, including all the major European and Middle Eastern languages, and numerous Far Eastern scripts. They span five millennia, and are written on virtually every medium ever employed. The subject range is vast, encompassing literary, historical, antiquarian, genealogical, biblical, devotional, ritualistic, medical, scientific, legal and administrative texts. The Library first acquired archive collections in the 1920s when local landed families were invited to donate or deposit their papers. In addition to family muniment collections, the Library now holds the archives of numerous companies, business associations, trade unions, charities, social organizations and religious institutions. The Methodist Church and other Nonconformist denominations are particularly well represented. The archives of the University of Manchester and the papers of individual scientists and academics are another important element in the Library's holdings, while the large archive of the Manchester Guardian newspaper is a key resource for a wide range of research interests. In another area, the Library is continually adding to its wealth of 20th-century literary and dramatic archives. The material is now searchable on ELGAR (electronic gateway to archives at the Rylands). The printed book collections of the JRUL are among the finest in the world. The foundation stone of the Library's printed collection was laid in 1892 when Mrs Rylands purchased the Spencer Collection. This was generally acknowledged to be the finest library then in private ownership. The JRUL holds some 4,000 incunables, representing over 500 European presses, including the largest collection of Aldines in the world and the second largest collection of works printed by Caxton. There are some 12,500 books printed between 1475 and 1640, and some 45,000 printed between 1641 and 1700. 18th- and 19th-century holdings comprise 160,000 and 400,000 volumes respectively. These collections encompass almost all the landmarks of printing through five centuries, including magnificent illustrated books, examples of fine printing, landmark works in typography, key historical texts and exquisite bookbindings. They cover a wide range of subjects: theology and philosophy; economic, social, political and military history; travel and exploration; literature, drama and music; art and archaeology; science and medicine.   *For architecture, see further Hartwell,  Manchester , pp. 96-101.

Chetham's school and library contain the superbly preserved domestic premises of the collegiate church founded in 1421 (the church is now Manchester Cathedral, just alongside, which the Cathedral group will visit instead of the Rylands tour). See Manchester Cathedral below .  At the Reformation the buildings were held by the Stanleys, Earls of Derby, until the Civil War. Shortly after the merchant Humphrey Chetham died in 1653, his executors bought the buildings as the school and library for which he left money in his will. John Dee was warden there briefly at the turn of the 17th c. In the 19th. c. there were three phases of restoration, the one of 1878 by Alfred Waterhouse, architect of the City Hall and Victoria University (now Manchester University) as well as many other important public buildings throughout England. The school is a renowned Music School.  *For architecture, see further Hartwell, Manchester , pp. 63-70 and Clare Hartwell, The History and Architecture of Chetham's School and LIbrary (Yale UP, 2004) (on sale in the Library).   Manchester Cathedral  Although there is evidence of an Anglo-Saxon and early medieval church, the present church largely dates from the foundation of the college in 1421, after which it expanded through the building of chantry chapels until in the early 16th c under James Stanley II it reached its present size. It underwent later (primarily Victorian) refurbishment, after it became a Cathedral in 1846 when the diocese of Manchester was created to serve the burgeoning industrial city. The best recent work is that of Basil Champneys, architect of the Rylands Library (see below ) (porch and vestries 1898). It was damaged in World War 2 (1940) and again in the IRA bomb attack on Central Manchester in 1996.   In 1421 the Rector, Thomas de la Warre, who was also Lord of the Manor, petitioned Henry V to change the then Parish Church into a Collegiate foundation as a chantry college. The new Collegiate Church was to be governed by a Master or Warden, and eight Fellows. The Warden had the responsibility for the cure of souls as well as the government of the clergy and the parishioners. Thomas de la Warre was the last male member of his family and gave his manor house, which he had inherited from his childless brother (and which is now Chetham's Library and School), to be used as the residence for the priests or Fellows. IN 1482 James Stanley, younger brother of Sir Thomas Stanley (husband of Lady Margaret Beaufort), became Warden of the Collegiate Church, followed (1485-1506) by his nephew, also James (later Bishop of Ely), who endowed the John the Baptist chapel and partly donated the choir stalls. Delegates should particularly look at the choir and misericords.   Lady Margaret Beaufort secured several of her officials from the collegiate church. Their names identify their North-West origins: Hugh Ashton, her receiver-general, Hugh Oldham, her chancellor, Christopher Urswicke, her confessor, and others. Oldham, later bishop of Exeter, developed the Jesus Chapel chantry into a larger foundation which became in time Manchester Grammar School (still very prestigious), with the warden and fellows of the collegiate church appointing to the school. In 1547 the college was dissolved but re-established under Mary, receiving its third charter from Elizabeth in 1578 and its fourth from Charles I in 1636.   The Archives of Manchester Cathedral date from 1421 to the current day. They are housed in a purpose built strong-room above the North Porch and contain one of the longest complete runs of Parish Registers in the Country as well as many documents of local historical relevance, particularly concerning the Cathedrals land ownership.
