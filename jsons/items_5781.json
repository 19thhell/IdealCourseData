Mecca Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery                                       Chair : Robert S. Glickman, DMD   Professor, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery   Overview   The mission of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery is to train clinicians and scientists to advance current knowledge in the field, to encourage the discovery of improved therapies and to serve the public by providing quality surgical care.   The Anthony S. Mecca Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery dates back to 1867, when the first organized course in oral surgery was offered by what was then known as the New York College of Dentistry. The course consisted of didactic lectures supplemented by cadaver operations and weekly clinics. As the specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery evolved, so too did the department. By 1915 daily clinics in diagnosis and treatment of surgical conditions including impactions, neoplasms, fractures, and infections were taught. Later, classes in local anesthesia, nitrous oxide, general anesthesia, and patient assessment were added. Many surgeons responsible for the changing face of the specialty were also leaders of the Anthony S. Mecca Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at NYU \u2014 among them Drs. Leo Winter, Harry Seldin, and William Harrigan. The oral and maxillofacial surgery faculty at NYU today embraces the traditions of the past while contributing to the future development of the specialty.                    meet our faculty Read More                    group practice directory Read More                    dds course inventory Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   The didactic curriculum in oral and maxillofacial surgery focuses on surgical application of the basic biomedical sciences. This is accomplished via a series of lectures in the second and third years and augmented by small group seminars and case discussions scheduled during the assigned clinical rotations in the third year.                                                  Second Year                               The second-year lecture series in oral and maxillofacial surgery occurs as part of the Survey of Dental Specialties course. An introduction to the basic principles of the discipline including techniques of administration of local anesthesia, basic exodontias armamentarium and technique, fundamental surgical principles including asepsis, wound healing and hemostasis, complex exodontias, management of dentoalveolar infections, management of soft tissue and dentoalveolar injuries, prevention and management of surgical complications, and surgical considerations in management of the cleft lip/palate patient are all addressed in a multidisciplinary case-based format. A series of bench lab exercises in local anesthesia technique, flap design and suture technique, and vital signs and management of medical emergencies complement this lecture series.                                                              Third Year                               The third-year didactic course in advanced oral and maxillofacial surgery focuses on more advanced surgical topics including impactions, preprosthetic surgery, implants, bone grafts and reconstructive surgery, management of benign and malignant lesions of the jaws, temporomandibular joint surgery, orthognathic surgery and correction of dentofacial anomalies, mandibular and midface trauma management. This core of lectures is supplemented by daily small group seminars and complex case discussion sessions, which are scheduled during the clinical rotation in oral and maxillofacial surgery.     The third-year clinical course in oral and maxillofacial surgery consists of two one-week rotations during which the students are fully immersed in all of the activities of the department including performing exodontias procedures, surgical consultations, and postoperative evaluations; assisting complex dentoalveolar surgical cases; and assisting or observing sedation cases and operating room cases at the College and at affiliate hospitals. Students attend weekly departmental rounds and daily small group seminars. The emphasis is placed on total perioperative patient management skills in addition to clinical surgical experiences.                                                              Fourth Year                               The fourth-year clinical course in oral and maxillofacial surgery consists of a one-week OMS hospital rotation assignment during which the student hones skills in dentoalveolar surgery and gains additional exposure to complex major oral and maxillofacial procedures including ambulatory anesthesia cases and operating room assisting and observation. The students participate in all service activities including rounds, lectures, seminars, and clinical assignments. Students are also assigned to sessions in the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic where they gain experience in the management of oral surgery emergencies.                                                              Honors Program                               The Honors Program in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery accepts two senior students each year. These students are assigned faculty mentors on a rotating basis to ensure exposure to all activities within the department. Students spend one half-day per week in the clinic where they are assigned advanced dentoalveolar cases. In addition they attend resident lectures and seminars and/or cases on a rotating basis. The students also work with faculty mentors on research projects or case reports and abstracts suitable for presentation.                                                              Basic Life Support and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation                               Training in basic life support and cardiopulmonary resuscitation occurs biannually to ensure that all students are certified according to the standards of the American Heart Association. Basic life support training includes recognition of early warning signs and appropriate entry into the emergency medical system. The students are taught recognition of and appropriate intervention for respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and foreign body airway obstruction in the conscious and unconscious individual. This training is supplemented by lectures on management of common medical emergencies and review of the NYUCD medical emergency protocol during the third-year OMS clinical course.

The Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery dates back to 1867, when the first organized course in oral surgery was offered by what was then known as the New York College of Dentistry. The long affiliation between NYU and Bellevue Hospital has enabled the program to fulfill its mission in training postdoctoral students to become leaders in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Many surgeons responsible for the changing face of the specialty were also leaders of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, among them Drs. Leo Winter, Harry Seldin, and William Harrigan.   Didactic training in biomedical sciences takes place at the College of Dentistry and the Medical Center. A wealth of clinical experience is achieved at the affiliate teaching hospitals. These include Tisch Hospital - NYU Medical Center, Lenox Hill Hospital and The Harbor Healthcare System - Veterans Administration Hospital.   Learning Goals for the Program   Read complete Learning Goals and Objectives here &gt;&gt;&gt;   Accreditation Status   The program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. Each year two applicants are accepted into the six-year OMS/MD program and one applicant is accepted into the four-year OMS certificate program.   Residency Program Objectives   The objective of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery program is to prepare graduates for a successful and productive career in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The curriculum is designed to develop the clinical, academic, and communicative skills that will provide for diversified career options. The educational experience is progressive in nature offering increasing responsibilities as residents proceed through the program. A unique feature of this program is immediate participation in all aspects of patient care.   Graduates of the program will be prepared to pursue contemporary full scope Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery practice, obtain medical New York state licensure (6-year residents), and be prepared for the rigors of specialty board examination.   Program Outline   Six Year Residency/ Integrated MD Curriculum   The six-year integrated MD training program has been developed to prepare the graduated dentist an academic and/ or private practice career in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. It is an integrated clinical and didactic program designed to meet the requirements leading to certification by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Upon completion of the residency program, the candidate will receive a medical degree from New York University School of Medicine, a certificate of completion for one year of General Surgery residency, and a specialty certificate in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Students/ residents enrolled in medical school are responsible for the tuition costs.   The didactic training in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery begins with postgraduate courses in craniofacial development, head and neck anatomy, bone biology, and physical diagnosis. These essential foundation courses are supplemented by certification in ACLS, PALS, and ATLS. Each Tuesday morning is dedicated to selected topics in oral and maxillofacial surgery. This includes but is not limited to:     Maxillofacial Trauma   Pathologic lesions of the head and neck   Correction of dentofacial deformities   Maxillofacial Reconstruction   Temporomandibular joint surgery   Dentoalveolar surgery   Ambulatory general anesthesia and deep sedation   Cleft lip and palate repair   Management of odontogenic infections   Dental implants   Management of facial pain   Facial aesthetic surgery   Coding and nomenclature   Risk management     Monday morning attending conference reviews each case from the preceding week. The Chair and faculty in the Pathology Department at the College teach Oral Pathology two times a month.   In addition, there are regularly scheduled multidisciplinary conferences in dentofacial deformities, facial trauma, craniofacial-cleft lip and palate, and Head and Neck Tumor Board.                                                  Year One                               The first year of the program consists of six months on the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service and six months in the C 21 Medical School Curriculum. Curriculum for the 21st Century, or C 21, provides students with patient- centered and diseased- focused medical education. Please visit http://school.med.nyu.edu for further information. In addition, the resident completes Basic Science Courses at NYU College of Dentistry and a Physical Diagnosis Course at NYU School of Medicine.

The curriculum exposes students to a variety of oral surgery techniques and new modalities of treatment.     Objectives     Upon successful completion of the Advanced Program for International Dentists in Oral Surgery, participants will have an increased understanding of the biological basis of oral surgery theory and practice.     Faculty   Participants treat a variety of patients under the close guidance of a diverse and experienced faculty comprised of top practitioners in the field of oral surgery and related areas.     Course Components   An array of lectures, seminars, conferences, and patient care/clinical experiences are offered to further develop the participant's expertise. Participants will participate in treatment of a wide variety of patients and will learn how to determine if a particular clinical situation requires consultation with other specialties. The assessment and evaluation skills needed to explore literature and current research will be developed, and the student will be prepared to appreciate the role of the new technology in oral surgery. There are opportunities to participate in elective experiences such as teaching, research and society meetings. Ample time is made available for these and other individual student interests.

Glickman, DMD   Professor, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery   Overview   The mission of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery is to train clinicians and scientists to advance current knowledge in the field, to encourage the discovery of improved therapies and to serve the public by providing quality surgical care.   The Anthony S. Mecca Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery dates back to 1867, when the first organized course in oral surgery was offered by what was then known as the New York College of Dentistry. The course consisted of didactic lectures supplemented by cadaver operations and weekly clinics. As the specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery evolved, so too did the department. By 1915 daily clinics in diagnosis and treatment of surgical conditions including impactions, neoplasms, fractures, and infections were taught. Later, classes in local anesthesia, nitrous oxide, general anesthesia, and patient assessment were added. Many surgeons responsible for the changing face of the specialty were also leaders of the Anthony S. Mecca Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at NYU \u2014 among them Drs. Leo Winter, Harry Seldin, and William Harrigan. The oral and maxillofacial surgery faculty at NYU today embraces the traditions of the past while contributing to the future development of the specialty.                    meet our faculty Read More                    group practice directory Read More                    dds course inventory Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   The didactic curriculum in oral and maxillofacial surgery focuses on surgical application of the basic biomedical sciences. This is accomplished via a series of lectures in the second and third years and augmented by small group seminars and case discussions scheduled during the assigned clinical rotations in the third year.                                                  Second Year                               The second-year lecture series in oral and maxillofacial surgery occurs as part of the Survey of Dental Specialties course. An introduction to the basic principles of the discipline including techniques of administration of local anesthesia, basic exodontias armamentarium and technique, fundamental surgical principles including asepsis, wound healing and hemostasis, complex exodontias, management of dentoalveolar infections, management of soft tissue and dentoalveolar injuries, prevention and management of surgical complications, and surgical considerations in management of the cleft lip/palate patient are all addressed in a multidisciplinary case-based format. A series of bench lab exercises in local anesthesia technique, flap design and suture technique, and vital signs and management of medical emergencies complement this lecture series.                                                              Third Year                               The third-year didactic course in advanced oral and maxillofacial surgery focuses on more advanced surgical topics including impactions, preprosthetic surgery, implants, bone grafts and reconstructive surgery, management of benign and malignant lesions of the jaws, temporomandibular joint surgery, orthognathic surgery and correction of dentofacial anomalies, mandibular and midface trauma management. This core of lectures is supplemented by daily small group seminars and complex case discussion sessions, which are scheduled during the clinical rotation in oral and maxillofacial surgery.     The third-year clinical course in oral and maxillofacial surgery consists of two one-week rotations during which the students are fully immersed in all of the activities of the department including performing exodontias procedures, surgical consultations, and postoperative evaluations; assisting complex dentoalveolar surgical cases; and assisting or observing sedation cases and operating room cases at the College and at affiliate hospitals. Students attend weekly departmental rounds and daily small group seminars. The emphasis is placed on total perioperative patient management skills in addition to clinical surgical experiences.                                                              Fourth Year                               The fourth-year clinical course in oral and maxillofacial surgery consists of a one-week OMS hospital rotation assignment during which the student hones skills in dentoalveolar surgery and gains additional exposure to complex major oral and maxillofacial procedures including ambulatory anesthesia cases and operating room assisting and observation. The students participate in all service activities including rounds, lectures, seminars, and clinical assignments. Students are also assigned to sessions in the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic where they gain experience in the management of oral surgery emergencies.                                                              Honors Program                               The Honors Program in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery accepts two senior students each year. These students are assigned faculty mentors on a rotating basis to ensure exposure to all activities within the department. Students spend one half-day per week in the clinic where they are assigned advanced dentoalveolar cases. In addition they attend resident lectures and seminars and/or cases on a rotating basis. The students also work with faculty mentors on research projects or case reports and abstracts suitable for presentation.                                                              Basic Life Support and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation                               Training in basic life support and cardiopulmonary resuscitation occurs biannually to ensure that all students are certified according to the standards of the American Heart Association. Basic life support training includes recognition of early warning signs and appropriate entry into the emergency medical system. The students are taught recognition of and appropriate intervention for respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and foreign body airway obstruction in the conscious and unconscious individual. This training is supplemented by lectures on management of common medical emergencies and review of the NYUCD medical emergency protocol during the third-year OMS clinical course.

The Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery dates back to 1867, when the first organized course in oral surgery was offered by what was then known as the New York College of Dentistry. The long affiliation between NYU and Bellevue Hospital has enabled the program to fulfill its mission in training postdoctoral students to become leaders in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Many surgeons responsible for the changing face of the specialty were also leaders of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, among them Drs. Leo Winter, Harry Seldin, and William Harrigan.   Didactic training in biomedical sciences takes place at the College of Dentistry and the Medical Center. A wealth of clinical experience is achieved at the affiliate teaching hospitals. These include Tisch Hospital - NYU Medical Center, Lenox Hill Hospital and The Harbor Healthcare System - Veterans Administration Hospital.   Learning Goals for the Program   Read complete Learning Goals and Objectives here &gt;&gt;&gt;   Accreditation Status   The program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. Each year two applicants are accepted into the six-year OMS/MD program and one applicant is accepted into the four-year OMS certificate program.   Residency Program Objectives   The objective of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery program is to prepare graduates for a successful and productive career in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The curriculum is designed to develop the clinical, academic, and communicative skills that will provide for diversified career options. The educational experience is progressive in nature offering increasing responsibilities as residents proceed through the program. A unique feature of this program is immediate participation in all aspects of patient care.   Graduates of the program will be prepared to pursue contemporary full scope Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery practice, obtain medical New York state licensure (6-year residents), and be prepared for the rigors of specialty board examination.   Program Outline   Six Year Residency/ Integrated MD Curriculum   The six-year integrated MD training program has been developed to prepare the graduated dentist an academic and/ or private practice career in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. It is an integrated clinical and didactic program designed to meet the requirements leading to certification by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Upon completion of the residency program, the candidate will receive a medical degree from New York University School of Medicine, a certificate of completion for one year of General Surgery residency, and a specialty certificate in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Students/ residents enrolled in medical school are responsible for the tuition costs.   The didactic training in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery begins with postgraduate courses in craniofacial development, head and neck anatomy, bone biology, and physical diagnosis. These essential foundation courses are supplemented by certification in ACLS, PALS, and ATLS. Each Tuesday morning is dedicated to selected topics in oral and maxillofacial surgery. This includes but is not limited to:     Maxillofacial Trauma   Pathologic lesions of the head and neck   Correction of dentofacial deformities   Maxillofacial Reconstruction   Temporomandibular joint surgery   Dentoalveolar surgery   Ambulatory general anesthesia and deep sedation   Cleft lip and palate repair   Management of odontogenic infections   Dental implants   Management of facial pain   Facial aesthetic surgery   Coding and nomenclature   Risk management     Monday morning attending conference reviews each case from the preceding week. The Chair and faculty in the Pathology Department at the College teach Oral Pathology two times a month.   In addition, there are regularly scheduled multidisciplinary conferences in dentofacial deformities, facial trauma, craniofacial-cleft lip and palate, and Head and Neck Tumor Board.                                                  Year One                               The first year of the program consists of six months on the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service and six months in the C 21 Medical School Curriculum. Curriculum for the 21st Century, or C 21, provides students with patient- centered and diseased- focused medical education. Please visit http://school.med.nyu.edu for further information.

The curriculum exposes students to a variety of oral surgery techniques and new modalities of treatment.     Objectives     Upon successful completion of the Advanced Program for International Dentists in Oral Surgery, participants will have an increased understanding of the biological basis of oral surgery theory and practice.     Faculty   Participants treat a variety of patients under the close guidance of a diverse and experienced faculty comprised of top practitioners in the field of oral surgery and related areas.     Course Components   An array of lectures, seminars, conferences, and patient care/clinical experiences are offered to further develop the participant's expertise. Participants will participate in treatment of a wide variety of patients and will learn how to determine if a particular clinical situation requires consultation with other specialties. The assessment and evaluation skills needed to explore literature and current research will be developed, and the student will be prepared to appreciate the role of the new technology in oral surgery. There are opportunities to participate in elective experiences such as teaching, research and society meetings. Ample time is made available for these and other individual student interests.

Glickman, DMD   Professor, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery   Overview   The mission of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery is to train clinicians and scientists to advance current knowledge in the field, to encourage the discovery of improved therapies and to serve the public by providing quality surgical care.   The Anthony S. Mecca Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery dates back to 1867, when the first organized course in oral surgery was offered by what was then known as the New York College of Dentistry. The course consisted of didactic lectures supplemented by cadaver operations and weekly clinics. As the specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery evolved, so too did the department. By 1915 daily clinics in diagnosis and treatment of surgical conditions including impactions, neoplasms, fractures, and infections were taught. Later, classes in local anesthesia, nitrous oxide, general anesthesia, and patient assessment were added. Many surgeons responsible for the changing face of the specialty were also leaders of the Anthony S. Mecca Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at NYU \u2014 among them Drs. Leo Winter, Harry Seldin, and William Harrigan. The oral and maxillofacial surgery faculty at NYU today embraces the traditions of the past while contributing to the future development of the specialty.                    meet our faculty Read More                    group practice directory Read More                    dds course inventory Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   The didactic curriculum in oral and maxillofacial surgery focuses on surgical application of the basic biomedical sciences. This is accomplished via a series of lectures in the second and third years and augmented by small group seminars and case discussions scheduled during the assigned clinical rotations in the third year.                                                  Second Year                               The second-year lecture series in oral and maxillofacial surgery occurs as part of the Survey of Dental Specialties course. An introduction to the basic principles of the discipline including techniques of administration of local anesthesia, basic exodontias armamentarium and technique, fundamental surgical principles including asepsis, wound healing and hemostasis, complex exodontias, management of dentoalveolar infections, management of soft tissue and dentoalveolar injuries, prevention and management of surgical complications, and surgical considerations in management of the cleft lip/palate patient are all addressed in a multidisciplinary case-based format. A series of bench lab exercises in local anesthesia technique, flap design and suture technique, and vital signs and management of medical emergencies complement this lecture series.                                                              Third Year                               The third-year didactic course in advanced oral and maxillofacial surgery focuses on more advanced surgical topics including impactions, preprosthetic surgery, implants, bone grafts and reconstructive surgery, management of benign and malignant lesions of the jaws, temporomandibular joint surgery, orthognathic surgery and correction of dentofacial anomalies, mandibular and midface trauma management. This core of lectures is supplemented by daily small group seminars and complex case discussion sessions, which are scheduled during the clinical rotation in oral and maxillofacial surgery.     The third-year clinical course in oral and maxillofacial surgery consists of two one-week rotations during which the students are fully immersed in all of the activities of the department including performing exodontias procedures, surgical consultations, and postoperative evaluations; assisting complex dentoalveolar surgical cases; and assisting or observing sedation cases and operating room cases at the College and at affiliate hospitals. Students attend weekly departmental rounds and daily small group seminars. The emphasis is placed on total perioperative patient management skills in addition to clinical surgical experiences.                                                              Fourth Year                               The fourth-year clinical course in oral and maxillofacial surgery consists of a one-week OMS hospital rotation assignment during which the student hones skills in dentoalveolar surgery and gains additional exposure to complex major oral and maxillofacial procedures including ambulatory anesthesia cases and operating room assisting and observation. The students participate in all service activities including rounds, lectures, seminars, and clinical assignments. Students are also assigned to sessions in the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic where they gain experience in the management of oral surgery emergencies.                                                              Honors Program                               The Honors Program in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery accepts two senior students each year. These students are assigned faculty mentors on a rotating basis to ensure exposure to all activities within the department. Students spend one half-day per week in the clinic where they are assigned advanced dentoalveolar cases. In addition they attend resident lectures and seminars and/or cases on a rotating basis. The students also work with faculty mentors on research projects or case reports and abstracts suitable for presentation.                                                              Basic Life Support and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation                               Training in basic life support and cardiopulmonary resuscitation occurs biannually to ensure that all students are certified according to the standards of the American Heart Association. Basic life support training includes recognition of early warning signs and appropriate entry into the emergency medical system. The students are taught recognition of and appropriate intervention for respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and foreign body airway obstruction in the conscious and unconscious individual. This training is supplemented by lectures on management of common medical emergencies and review of the NYUCD medical emergency protocol during the third-year OMS clinical course.

The Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery dates back to 1867, when the first organized course in oral surgery was offered by what was then known as the New York College of Dentistry. The long affiliation between NYU and Bellevue Hospital has enabled the program to fulfill its mission in training postdoctoral students to become leaders in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Many surgeons responsible for the changing face of the specialty were also leaders of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, among them Drs. Leo Winter, Harry Seldin, and William Harrigan.   Didactic training in biomedical sciences takes place at the College of Dentistry and the Medical Center. A wealth of clinical experience is achieved at the affiliate teaching hospitals. These include Tisch Hospital - NYU Medical Center, Lenox Hill Hospital and The Harbor Healthcare System - Veterans Administration Hospital.   Learning Goals for the Program   Read complete Learning Goals and Objectives here &gt;&gt;&gt;   Accreditation Status   The program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. Each year two applicants are accepted into the six-year OMS/MD program and one applicant is accepted into the four-year OMS certificate program.   Residency Program Objectives   The objective of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery program is to prepare graduates for a successful and productive career in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The curriculum is designed to develop the clinical, academic, and communicative skills that will provide for diversified career options. The educational experience is progressive in nature offering increasing responsibilities as residents proceed through the program. A unique feature of this program is immediate participation in all aspects of patient care.   Graduates of the program will be prepared to pursue contemporary full scope Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery practice, obtain medical New York state licensure (6-year residents), and be prepared for the rigors of specialty board examination.   Program Outline   Six Year Residency/ Integrated MD Curriculum   The six-year integrated MD training program has been developed to prepare the graduated dentist an academic and/ or private practice career in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. It is an integrated clinical and didactic program designed to meet the requirements leading to certification by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Upon completion of the residency program, the candidate will receive a medical degree from New York University School of Medicine, a certificate of completion for one year of General Surgery residency, and a specialty certificate in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Students/ residents enrolled in medical school are responsible for the tuition costs.   The didactic training in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery begins with postgraduate courses in craniofacial development, head and neck anatomy, bone biology, and physical diagnosis. These essential foundation courses are supplemented by certification in ACLS, PALS, and ATLS. Each Tuesday morning is dedicated to selected topics in oral and maxillofacial surgery. This includes but is not limited to:     Maxillofacial Trauma   Pathologic lesions of the head and neck   Correction of dentofacial deformities   Maxillofacial Reconstruction   Temporomandibular joint surgery   Dentoalveolar surgery   Ambulatory general anesthesia and deep sedation   Cleft lip and palate repair   Management of odontogenic infections   Dental implants   Management of facial pain   Facial aesthetic surgery   Coding and nomenclature   Risk management     Monday morning attending conference reviews each case from the preceding week. The Chair and faculty in the Pathology Department at the College teach Oral Pathology two times a month.   In addition, there are regularly scheduled multidisciplinary conferences in dentofacial deformities, facial trauma, craniofacial-cleft lip and palate, and Head and Neck Tumor Board.                                                  Year One                               The first year of the program consists of six months on the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service and six months in the C 21 Medical School Curriculum. Curriculum for the 21st Century, or C 21, provides students with patient- centered and diseased- focused medical education. Please visit http://school.med.nyu.edu for further information.

The curriculum exposes students to a variety of oral surgery techniques and new modalities of treatment.     Objectives     Upon successful completion of the Advanced Program for International Dentists in Oral Surgery, participants will have an increased understanding of the biological basis of oral surgery theory and practice.     Faculty   Participants treat a variety of patients under the close guidance of a diverse and experienced faculty comprised of top practitioners in the field of oral surgery and related areas.     Course Components   An array of lectures, seminars, conferences, and patient care/clinical experiences are offered to further develop the participant's expertise. Participants will participate in treatment of a wide variety of patients and will learn how to determine if a particular clinical situation requires consultation with other specialties. The assessment and evaluation skills needed to explore literature and current research will be developed, and the student will be prepared to appreciate the role of the new technology in oral surgery. There are opportunities to participate in elective experiences such as teaching, research and society meetings. Ample time is made available for these and other individual student interests.
