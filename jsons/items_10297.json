Our students adopt a global perspective and interdisciplinary outlook as they pursue work in various languages, traditions and academic fields. Faculty members offer courses embracing the ancient and modern periods of world literature, exploring critical, theoretical, and historical issues, as well as problems of representation in the broadest sense. This type of analysis expands the field of literature to include a wide variety of cultural practices -- from historical, philosophical, and legal texts to artifacts of visual and popular culture -- revealing the roles literature plays as a form of material expression and symbolic exchange.   Admitting an average of six fully-funded students a year into its doctoral program, the department provides an intimate intellectual setting in which students work closely with core faculty while exploring the considerable resources offered by other NYU departments and by universities participating in the Inter-University Doctoral Consortium (Columbia University, CUNY, Princeton University, Rutgers University, Stonybrook, Teachers' College - Columbia, Fordham University, and The New School for Social Research).   Graduate students play a vital role in the life of the department, notably through the organization of annual conferences which attract the participation of graduate students and faculty from across the nation and around the world. Recent conferences include \"The Age of Comparison\" (Takahiro Nakajima, keynote speaker), \"Foreclosure and Forgiveness: Tracing Debt in Literature and Culture\" (Mark Sanders, keynote speaker), \"The Speakable, The Unspeakable, and the Politics of Listening: Ethics of Confronting the Real\" (Ngugi wa Thiong'o, keynote speaker), \"National Literatures Under Siege\" (Assia Djebar, keynote speaker) and \"Translation: Themes and Variations\" (Lawrence Venuti, keynote speaker), \"On Limits\" (A.

The scholarly methods we employ, and in which we train our students, include close reading, historical and archival research, literary theory, the history of the book, media theory, and cultural analysis.
