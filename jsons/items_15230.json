The Future         Where will the data revolution take us?                                                                                                                                                     Turning data into insight.   Our networked world is generating a deluge of data that no human, or group of humans, can process fast enough. This data deluge has the potential to transform the way business, government, science and healthcare are carried out. The emerging discipline of data science holds the key to unlocking that potential. It uses automated methods to analyze massive amounts of data and extract knowledge from them. Data science combines aspects of computer science, applied mathematics and statistics.        Big data monitors 12 terabytes of tweets each day to improve product sentiment analysis.     \u201cData science will also revolutionize medicine, education, and other areas that are slated to become \u2018evidence-based.\u2019\u201d \u2014NYU\u2019s Data Science and Statistics Working Group                                                                                                                                        From healthcare to business to government.   Data science is already being put to use in nearly every sphere of modern life. The transportation industry is using it to better predict flight arrival times. Online retailers are using it to better understand consumer habits. Managers are using it to make decisions based on facts rather than instincts. But data science is in its infancy. As it matures, data science holds the promise of creating drugs customized for individual patients, making government run more efficiently and helping our cities be healthier places to live.        By 2010, 28% of the digital universe required some level of data network security.     \u201cRobust, unbiased data are the first step toward addressing our long-term economic needs and key policy priorities.&#8221; \u2014Peter Orszag, Former Director, White House Office of Management and Budget                                                                                                                                          Acquire &amp; Parse   Sensors, medical devices, the Web and smartphones \u2014 to name just a few sources \u2014 capture structured and unstructured data in massive amounts in real-time, all the time.

They also advance the field by developing new automated tools and methodologies.       Analyze &amp; Refine   With an explorer\u2019s desire to uncover what others might not see, data scientists analyze data. Their insights are used in sectors ranging from biology to finance to government.       Interaction   Data scientists excel in presenting complicated findings for experts and non-experts alike. Information visualization, graphic design and human computer interaction all come into play.                                                                                                                                        Where will the data revolution take us?   Data science has already started to revolutionize most areas of intellectual endeavor found at NYU and in the world. We believe this revolution is just beginning. Data science can help us answer not only the great questions and challenges of our time, but also centuries-old questions. Through data science we may improve our understanding of how the brain works, for example. With that understanding we can build intelligent machines capable of advancing life-saving medical research. Data science can help us realize the promises of the digital age.        33% of all data will be stored, or will have passed through the cloud by 2015.     \u201c\u2026Now we really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data. So the complimentary scarce factor is the ability to understand that data and extract value from it.\u201d \u2014Hal Varian, Chief Economist for Google                                                                                                    Unlocking Big Data&#8217;s Potential   From government, social networks and ecommerce sites to sensors, smart meters and mobile networks, data is being collected at an unprecedented speed and scale.

The Future         Where will the data revolution take us?                                                                                                                                                     Turning data into insight.   Our networked world is generating a deluge of data that no human, or group of humans, can process fast enough. This data deluge has the potential to transform the way business, government, science and healthcare are carried out. The emerging discipline of data science holds the key to unlocking that potential. It uses automated methods to analyze massive amounts of data and extract knowledge from them. Data science combines aspects of computer science, applied mathematics and statistics.        Big data monitors 12 terabytes of tweets each day to improve product sentiment analysis.     \u201cData science will also revolutionize medicine, education, and other areas that are slated to become \u2018evidence-based.\u2019\u201d \u2014NYU\u2019s Data Science and Statistics Working Group                                                                                                                                        From healthcare to business to government.   Data science is already being put to use in nearly every sphere of modern life. The transportation industry is using it to better predict flight arrival times. Online retailers are using it to better understand consumer habits. Managers are using it to make decisions based on facts rather than instincts. But data science is in its infancy. As it matures, data science holds the promise of creating drugs customized for individual patients, making government run more efficiently and helping our cities be healthier places to live.        By 2010, 28% of the digital universe required some level of data network security.     \u201cRobust, unbiased data are the first step toward addressing our long-term economic needs and key policy priorities.&#8221; \u2014Peter Orszag, Former Director, White House Office of Management and Budget                                                                                                                                          Acquire &amp; Parse   Sensors, medical devices, the Web and smartphones \u2014 to name just a few sources \u2014 capture structured and unstructured data in massive amounts in real-time, all the time.

Analyze &amp; Refine   With an explorer\u2019s desire to uncover what others might not see, data scientists analyze data. Their insights are used in sectors ranging from biology to finance to government.       Interaction   Data scientists excel in presenting complicated findings for experts and non-experts alike. Information visualization, graphic design and human computer interaction all come into play.                                                                                                                                        Where will the data revolution take us?   Data science has already started to revolutionize most areas of intellectual endeavor found at NYU and in the world. We believe this revolution is just beginning. Data science can help us answer not only the great questions and challenges of our time, but also centuries-old questions. Through data science we may improve our understanding of how the brain works, for example. With that understanding we can build intelligent machines capable of advancing life-saving medical research. Data science can help us realize the promises of the digital age.        33% of all data will be stored, or will have passed through the cloud by 2015.     \u201c\u2026Now we really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data.

Business analytics unlocks the predictive potential of data analysis to improve financial performance, strategic management, and operational efficiency.     Gain a Competitive Advantage  Graduates will be equipped to influence decision-making, strategy and ultimately drive better business results by gaining the ability to transform data into a powerful and predictive strategic asset. Business Analytics is critical in preparing organizations to solve 21st-century business challenges and participants of this program will have exposure to innovative methodologies that support data driven decision making.     What Differentiates this Program?     APPROACH: The NYU Stern Master of Science in Business Analytics, an advanced business degree program, teaches students both to understand the role of evidence-based data in decision making and to leverage data as a strategic asset. The program is designed for experienced professionals interested in gaining competitive advantage through the predictive potential of data.     FORMAT: The Master of Science in Business Analytics program is a one year long, part-time program divided into five on-site class sessions (modules) at NYU Stern in New York and other rotating global locations. This part-time format reduces the absence from the office to approximately 5 weeks over the course of the year. Between modules, students complete an average of 20-25 hours per week of work via distance learning. For more information on the format, please click here .     NETWORK: Participants have the opportunity to cross-learn and share best practices among their cohort and through their exposure to top faculty and business leaders in the growing field of Business Analytics. With a degree from New York University, graduates will join NYU\u2019s extensive global alumni network.     APPLICATION: The culmination of the program is the Business Analytics Capstone, which gives students an opportunity to apply the learnings of the program by presenting a unified and practical case on a topic of their choosing. This is a team based project with approximately 4-5 students per group.
