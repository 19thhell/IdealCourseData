We constantly move throughout... walking, biking, driving, or taking transit. Yet a variety of hidden boundaries such as laws, urban design, and physical limitations shape how we move about the urban space. This engaging discussion focused on rethinking how individuals move through cities.            Thursday, April 2, 2015  6:30pm - 8:30pm            Documentary Screening, Panel Discussion, Reception   Through a focus on transportation systems, especially bicycling and walking, this session explores the ongoing tensions inherent in planning the urban boundaries that shape everyday life as people move into and out of the city. The session will begin with a short documentary film, Every Speed, Lindsey Martin and Julia Fuller, which examines the interaction between human bodies and urban space.            Friday, April 3, 2015  Workshop Schedule            The Human Body and the Urban Plan     The first workshop continues the theme from the Thursday night session, considering the pivotal role of the urban spatial plan in promoting or undermining human bodily health. Examples include the development of the nineteenth century and twentieth century city plan as a political and public health response to cholera and malaria epidemics; the implication of suburban spatial planning in obesity and depression; and the urban cordon-sanitaire and spatial lockdowns of slum precincts as an attempt to contain west African Ebola outbreaks.   Technological Bodies, Between Physiological and Psychological Boundaries     How does one measure and draw boundaries around an idea? What happens when on-the-ground reality necessitates action by exceeding the boundaries imposed by ideas? The second mini-workshop builds on the social \u201cidea\u201d and physiological reality of hunger to explore the way that concepts are bounded and implicated in public and private action.   Odorific Borders     The final mini-workshop investigates the ways that sensorial knowledge such as tasting and smelling complicate public health discourse. Building on a case study of the recent water contamination crisis in West Virginia, this section of the workshop examines how human sensorial knowledge bounds public health discourse, complicating the relationship between scientist, regulator, and consumer.            The conference goal was to better understanding how human life is shaped and transformed by the real and imagined boundaries around them, while providing a forum for public outreach and engagement with policy making.            Film Screening: Every Speed                               Every Speed is an experimental short documentary that looks at the meaning of movement for people with and without physical disabilities - both in terms of design and accessibility of cities and transportation as well as personal experiences of movement - in the context of a culture that places value on independence, speed, and physical ability.

Her research has examined how people in different geographic and organizational contexts understand environmental problems, uneven distributions of environmental health risks, developments in the environmental health sciences, and factors that contribute to, and reduce, vulnerability to environmental risk and disaster.   \u201cEnvironmental problems are cultural problems, as well as scientific and political problems,\u201d Fortun said. \u201cTo understand environmental problems, many of the assumptions of industrial culture must be set aside \u2013 assumptions about health, prosperity and security; assumptions about how science should be conducted and used in governance,; assumptions about how complex problems play out and can be addressed. My research and teaching aims to advance our ability to think through and constructively engage the cultural dynamics of environmental and other complex problems.\u201d   Fortun's undergraduate teaching contributes to RPI's new Sustainability Studies Program, and to the development of student capacity for independent research. Her graduate teaching focuses on research design and methods, on cultural analysis of science and technology, and on critical theories of language, knowledge, and communication.   Her current work includes research for a book titled Making Environmental Sense, which examines how information technology, theory and culture have shaped the environmental field over the last two decades; The Asthma Files, a collaborative, web-based project to draw together and explicate multiple perspectives on asthma \u2013 from different scientific disciplines, policy arenas, health care settings and communities where asthmatics live; and Strategizing Transdisciplinarity: From Exposure Assessment to Exposure Science, a NSF-funded study of environmental exposure science.   Fortun\u2019s book Advocacy After Bhopal: Environmentalism, Disaster, New Global Orders. (University of Chicago Press, 2001) was awarded the 2003, biannual Sharon Stephens Prize by the American Ethnological Society. From 2005 to 2010, Fortun co-edited (with Mike Fortun) Cultural Anthropology, one of the most highly ranked journals in the field, published by the American Anthropological Association.

It\u2019s no wonder that her courses in AU\u2019s Global Environmental Politics Program always include a real-world, local project in sustainable design. When not in the classroom at SIS or the architectural studio or feeding her teenage children, Vicky works for the Cadmus Group, Inc., an environmental consultancy. At Cadmus she leads research work for the Appalachian Regional Commission, sustainability consulting for the Smithsonian Institution, and consulting and review teams for projects seeking LEED certification. She worked for the U.S. Green Building Council on LEED v.3, and advises the U.S. EPA\u2019s ENERGY STAR commercial and industrial branch as Higher Education sector lead on issues ranging from energy benchmarking to curriculum development and workforce training in energy efficiency. Vicky was the first-ever recipient of AU\u2019s Most Innovative Green Teacher of the Year award.                         Kim Lucas                                           Transportation Management Specialist, Washington DC Department of Transportation                               Kim Lucas works at the District of Columbia\u2019s Department of Transportation where she manages the Capital Bikeshare and Bicycle Parking programs. With over 300 stations and approximately 2,900 bikes available system-wide, nearly 10 million trips have been taken by Capital Bikeshare members since its launch.     Prior to joining DDOT, Kim worked in the San Francisco Bay Area after completing her Master\u2019s degree in City Planning at the University of California, Berkeley. In the over twelve years since she began her transportation career as a student bus driver at the University of Virginia, she has worked in the cornerstones of transportation planning: the public and private sectors, advocacy and research. She is an active member of the Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle Professionals, Young Professionals in Transportation, and the Women\u2019s Transportation Seminar.

Phil Olson                                           Assistant Professor, Department of Science and Technology in Society, Virginia Tech                               Phil Olson is an assistant professor in the Department of Science and Technology in Society. He works at the intersections of bioethics, environmental ethics, medicine in culture, technology studies, and gender studies. His current research focuses on funeral technologies, and on relationships between the medicalized body and the funeralized corpse. In Phil\u2019s research, the dead human body and funeral technologies serve as research sites for studying the interaction of religious, commercial, medical, governmental, cultural, and environmental interests. His most recent work (forthcoming in Science, Technology &amp; Human Values) examines various body concepts deployed by actors who have a stake in the development of alkaline hydrolysis, a form of funerary disposition that has begun to take hold in the US. Phil is currently working on projects having to do with \u201cnecro-waste,\u201d the classification of funeral technologies, the gender politics of caring for corpses, and the roles of technology in organizing and controlling funeral work.   Phil\u2019s interest in funeral work comes from his experiences growing up in a family of funeral directors, and from working in funeral homes in Minnesota and North Dakota. Deciding not to pursue the family business, Phil earned his Ph.D. in Philosophy from Emory University in 2007 and joined the STS Department in 2012. He has taught courses in epistemology, theoretical ethics, bioethics, feminism, pragmatism, and the philosophy of religion. He also teaches courses on medical and funeral technologies.   Phil serves on the Board of Trustees/Directors of the Funeral Consumer Alliance of the Virginia Blue Ridge, a local non-profit, all-volunteer organization devoted to providing our service area with information about local funeral options and requirements.   Recently, Phil organized a public screening of the award-winning documentary, Dying Green, which was followed by a panel discussion about the growing \u201cgreen burial\u201d movement.                         Jody A. Roberts                                           Director, Institute for Research, Chemical Heritage Foundation                               Roberts\u2019s work explores the intersections of emerging molecular sciences and public policy and the ways in which tensions brought about between the two get resolved. He received advanced degrees in science and technology studies from Virginia Tech where he cultivated an interest in the practice of the molecular sciences and the ways in which they are shaped by internal architecture and design (e.g., technologies of the laboratory) and the politics of the broader world (e.g., chemical regulations). Before joining the CHF staff, he was the Charles C. Price Fellow and Gordon Cain Fellow at CHF. Roberts is a research professor in the Center for Science, Technology, and Society at Drexel University and a lecturer in the History and Sociology of Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania. He serves as a Senior Fellow in the Environmental Leadership Program, a national program training the next generation of environmental leaders. Roberts holds an undergraduate degree in chemistry from Saint Vincent College.                         Gabe Rousseau                                           Bicycle and Pedestrian Manager, Federal Highway Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation                               Gabe Rousseau is a ten-year veteran of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and helped set up the Safe Routes to School Program when SAFETEA-LU was enacted in 2005.

Examples include the development of the nineteenth century and twentieth century city plan as a political and public health response to cholera and malaria epidemics; the implication of suburban spatial planning in obesity and depression; and the urban cordon-sanitaire and spatial lockdowns of slum precincts as an attempt to contain west African Ebola outbreaks.   Technological Bodies, Between Physiological and Psychological Boundaries     How does one measure and draw boundaries around an idea? What happens when on-the-ground reality necessitates action by exceeding the boundaries imposed by ideas? The second mini-workshop builds on the social \u201cidea\u201d and physiological reality of hunger to explore the way that concepts are bounded and implicated in public and private action.   Odorific Borders     The final mini-workshop investigates the ways that sensorial knowledge such as tasting and smelling complicate public health discourse. Building on a case study of the recent water contamination crisis in West Virginia, this section of the workshop examines how human sensorial knowledge bounds public health discourse, complicating the relationship between scientist, regulator, and consumer.            The conference goal was to better understanding how human life is shaped and transformed by the real and imagined boundaries around them, while providing a forum for public outreach and engagement with policy making.            Film Screening: Every Speed                               Every Speed is an experimental short documentary that looks at the meaning of movement for people with and without physical disabilities - both in terms of design and accessibility of cities and transportation as well as personal experiences of movement - in the context of a culture that places value on independence, speed, and physical ability.

Her research has examined how people in different geographic and organizational contexts understand environmental problems, uneven distributions of environmental health risks, developments in the environmental health sciences, and factors that contribute to, and reduce, vulnerability to environmental risk and disaster.   \u201cEnvironmental problems are cultural problems, as well as scientific and political problems,\u201d Fortun said. \u201cTo understand environmental problems, many of the assumptions of industrial culture must be set aside \u2013 assumptions about health, prosperity and security; assumptions about how science should be conducted and used in governance,; assumptions about how complex problems play out and can be addressed. My research and teaching aims to advance our ability to think through and constructively engage the cultural dynamics of environmental and other complex problems.\u201d   Fortun's undergraduate teaching contributes to RPI's new Sustainability Studies Program, and to the development of student capacity for independent research. Her graduate teaching focuses on research design and methods, on cultural analysis of science and technology, and on critical theories of language, knowledge, and communication.   Her current work includes research for a book titled Making Environmental Sense, which examines how information technology, theory and culture have shaped the environmental field over the last two decades; The Asthma Files, a collaborative, web-based project to draw together and explicate multiple perspectives on asthma \u2013 from different scientific disciplines, policy arenas, health care settings and communities where asthmatics live; and Strategizing Transdisciplinarity: From Exposure Assessment to Exposure Science, a NSF-funded study of environmental exposure science.   Fortun\u2019s book Advocacy After Bhopal: Environmentalism, Disaster, New Global Orders. (University of Chicago Press, 2001) was awarded the 2003, biannual Sharon Stephens Prize by the American Ethnological Society. From 2005 to 2010, Fortun co-edited (with Mike Fortun) Cultural Anthropology, one of the most highly ranked journals in the field, published by the American Anthropological Association.

Phil Olson                                           Assistant Professor, Department of Science and Technology in Society, Virginia Tech                               Phil Olson is an assistant professor in the Department of Science and Technology in Society. He works at the intersections of bioethics, environmental ethics, medicine in culture, technology studies, and gender studies. His current research focuses on funeral technologies, and on relationships between the medicalized body and the funeralized corpse. In Phil\u2019s research, the dead human body and funeral technologies serve as research sites for studying the interaction of religious, commercial, medical, governmental, cultural, and environmental interests. His most recent work (forthcoming in Science, Technology &amp; Human Values) examines various body concepts deployed by actors who have a stake in the development of alkaline hydrolysis, a form of funerary disposition that has begun to take hold in the US. Phil is currently working on projects having to do with \u201cnecro-waste,\u201d the classification of funeral technologies, the gender politics of caring for corpses, and the roles of technology in organizing and controlling funeral work.   Phil\u2019s interest in funeral work comes from his experiences growing up in a family of funeral directors, and from working in funeral homes in Minnesota and North Dakota. Deciding not to pursue the family business, Phil earned his Ph.D. in Philosophy from Emory University in 2007 and joined the STS Department in 2012. He has taught courses in epistemology, theoretical ethics, bioethics, feminism, pragmatism, and the philosophy of religion. He also teaches courses on medical and funeral technologies.   Phil serves on the Board of Trustees/Directors of the Funeral Consumer Alliance of the Virginia Blue Ridge, a local non-profit, all-volunteer organization devoted to providing our service area with information about local funeral options and requirements.   Recently, Phil organized a public screening of the award-winning documentary, Dying Green, which was followed by a panel discussion about the growing \u201cgreen burial\u201d movement.                         Jody A. Roberts                                           Director, Institute for Research, Chemical Heritage Foundation                               Roberts\u2019s work explores the intersections of emerging molecular sciences and public policy and the ways in which tensions brought about between the two get resolved. He received advanced degrees in science and technology studies from Virginia Tech where he cultivated an interest in the practice of the molecular sciences and the ways in which they are shaped by internal architecture and design (e.g., technologies of the laboratory) and the politics of the broader world (e.g., chemical regulations). Before joining the CHF staff, he was the Charles C. Price Fellow and Gordon Cain Fellow at CHF. Roberts is a research professor in the Center for Science, Technology, and Society at Drexel University and a lecturer in the History and Sociology of Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania. He serves as a Senior Fellow in the Environmental Leadership Program, a national program training the next generation of environmental leaders. Roberts holds an undergraduate degree in chemistry from Saint Vincent College.

How is the body a physical and social site?    How is the body a biological site?       Overview:    In the 21st century, the body is represented in many different ways and for many different reasons. Law enforcement agencies incorporate new technologies for biometric scanning into both safety and surveillance programs that often target immigrants, youth, people of color, and the poor. The media uses computer software to alter images of the body that in turn influence cultural standards of beauty and success. Advances in scientific imaging technology allow the inner workings of the body to be viewed and recorded with increasing detail and accuracy. Images of tissues, cells and gene patterns are presented without acknowledging the individuals whose bodies served as the source for the resulting scientific discoveries. Examples of these new representations of the body are found in the pages of magazines, subway cars, bus stops, and even schools; they are sent directly to our phones and computers, and pumped into our homes through televisions, video games and the Internet; they are carried in the form of a fingerprinted green cards, welfare identification and criminal records. A conscious examination of how institutions and people in power represent the body often reveals self-serving messages behind the images, and often targeting teenagers. Teens are deeply engaged in the process of trying out new ways to visually express their identity and are often deeply self-conscious about their own bodies and social representations of bodies. In this unit students take a closer look at images produced by law enforcement agencies, the media, and the scientific community and the messages they convey. Students will be introduced to contemporary artists who reference and reclaim the messages embedded in body representations and will offers students an opportunity to investigate, reclaim or rewrite messages about the body in their own artwork.    Class Sessions    PART 1: The Body as Physical and Social Site Week 1: Fingerprints: Evidence of the Individual Students will explore the theme of the fingerprint as both a marker of unique identity and a tool co-opted by social institutions through the process of making a drawing inspired by their own experiences with and ideas about fingerprinting. Week 2: Reclaiming the Body Students will explore the theme of the body as represented by mass media and advertising through the process of looking at the works of artists that address the effects of advertising and its use of digital technology to manipulate the public and more specifically, teenagers. Students will then create mixed-media artworks to express their thoughts on this theme. PART 2: The Body as Biological Site Week 3: Microscopic Landscapes Students will explore the theme of the body represented by medical science by investigating artists whose work is either inspired by medical representations of the body or addresses ethical concerns arising from advances in scientific medicine. Students will further investigate this theme by creating miniature landscapes of the body&rsquo;s interior. Week 4: Collaborative Bodies Students will explore the idea of collaborative representations of the body through the process of working together to create three temporal projects that reflect on topics from past lessons: namely, The Body as a Social Site and The Body as a Biological Site. Students will engage in an exercise that mirrors how diverse representations of the body can be combined to shape new ideas and representations. PART 3: Final Project Weeks 5-8: Representing the Body Students will explore the theme of imaging the body through the process of making a self-directed project in the medium of their choice for exhibition.
