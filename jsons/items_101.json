The Next Silicon Valley? New York\u2019s tech hub is taking shape \u2013 and enrolling grad students          April 4, 2015       0 Comments             Back in 2010, then-mayor Michael Bloomberg threw down a challenge: New York City would put up $400 million worth of land and infrastructure upgrades to seed a technology hub that would give Silicon Valley a run for its money. Universities would compete for the central role by proposing plans for an applied sciences research facility. The payoff over 30 years, Bloomberg predicted, would be some 400 new companies, billions of dollars in economic activity and nearly 30,000 new jobs.   Today, Bloomberg is back in the business world, running his namesake media company. Meanwhile, Applied Sciences NYC is taking shape with not one but four new\u00a0 grad-school options \u00a0for those interested in applying technological know-how to contemporary problems. All four get a piece of the city\u2019s largesse. Three of the programs created by the competition already have students on campus; another could open this year.

What&#8217;s the Big Deal With Big Data?          April 4, 2015       0 Comments             On Manhattan\u2019s West Side, construction crews are erecting Hudson Yards, a massive $20 billion office, retail and residential complex that\u2019s the biggest real estate development in New York City since Rockefeller Center in the 1930s. But the project is remarkable not just because of its five office towers and 5,000 residences, but because it\u2019s the first large-scale city neighborhood in the world that\u2019s being designed to collect Big Data\u2014that is, enormous sets of information\u2014and utilize it to tinker with the quality of everyday life.   When the complex is completed in a few years, a vast number of sensors embedded both indoors and outdoors continuously will collect data on everything from energy and water use and how much garbage and carbon dioxide residents generate, to the precise ebb and flow of pedestrian traffic and public transportation usage. All that data will flow into the Internet cloud, where the complex\u2019s management will be able to monitor and analyze it in the search for cost savings and ways to make things operate more smoothly. But that\u2019s not all. Eventually, residents may be offered a chance to \u201copt-in\u201d and use their smart phones to provide even more data about themselves, in exchange for being able to use the cloud themselves for things such as guidance on where to hail a taxi.

Claudio Silva receives IEEE&#8217;s 2014 Visualization Technical Achievement Award          November 13, 2014       0 Comments                On November 11, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) presented its 2014 Visualization and Technical Achievement Award to Claudio\u00a0T. Silva , Head of Disciplines at CUSP and professor of Computer Science and Engineering at NYU&#8217;s\u00a0Polytechnic School of Engineering.   The award, one of the highest honors given by the IEEE Computer Science Society&#8217;s Technical Committee on Visualization and Graphics (VGTC), recognizes Silva&#8217;s seminal advances to geometric computing for visualization and contributions to the development of the VisTrails data exploration system. The committee also cited Silva&#8217;s participation in various multidisciplinary projects.   VisTrails systematically maintains provenance for the data exploration process by capturing all the steps researchers follow in the course of an experiment\u2014much like document-tracking applications in Microsoft Word and Google Docs track changes to a document. Tracking provenance is essential because that information allows a researcher to accurately reproduce his or her own results or the results of others, even if they involve hundreds of parameters and complex data sets.   &#8220;Consider that when a researcher is engaged in an exploratory process, working with simulations, data analysis, and visualization, for example, very little is repeated during the analysis process; change is the norm, and new workflows are constantly being generated,&#8221; Silva explained. &#8220;VisTrails manages these rapidly evolving workflows. To make a simple analogy, using it is like having someone in the lab watching over your shoulder and taking concise notes.&#8221;   &#8220;Clauio Silva has blazed a trail of innovation in visualization that has strongly influenced many researchers, including myself,&#8221; said Amitabh Varshney, director of the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee and a professor of computer science and the director of the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies at the University of Maryland. &#8220;One of the reasons his work has had such a significant impact is because it combines elegant foundational research with real-world applications. This award is a well-deserved recognition of Claudio&#8217;s illustrious accomplishments and stunning impact.&#8221;            2014 AT&#038;T Transit Tech Developer Day at CUSP          November 11, 2014       0 Comments             November 22, 2014 &#8211; November 22, 2014   2 MetroTech Center   Map and Directions | Register   Description:  The 2014 AT&amp;T Transit Tech Developer Day App is an opportunity to launch the development of your 2014 MTA App Quest entry.

Now researchers at\u00a0 NYU \u00a0are borrowing astronomy\u2019s methods and turning their cameras towards Manhattan\u2019s famous skyline.   NYU\u2019s\u00a0 Center for Urban Science and Progress \u00a0has been running what\u2019s likely the world\u2019s first \u201c urban observatory \u201d of its kind for about a year. From atop a tall building in downtown Brooklyn (NYU won&#8217;t say its address, due to security concerns), two cameras&#8211;one regular one and one that captures infrared wavelengths&#8211;take panoramic images of lower and midtown Manhattan. One photo is snapped every 10 seconds. That\u2019s 8,640 images a day, or more than 3 million since the project began (or about 50 terabytes of data).   Taking photos of the skyline is nothing new; hordes of tourists do so everyday. And satellites and drones can already capture aerial vantage points. What\u2019s unique about the observatory is the sheer, steady volume of imagery combined with an unchanging vista that offers a slice of the city, rather than only a bird\u2019s-eye view.            NYU CUSP Unveils First-of-its-Kind &#8216;Urban Observatory&#8217; in Downtown Brooklyn          October 28, 2014       0 Comments             New York University\u2019s Center for Urban Science &amp; Progress (CUSP) today unveiled its Urban Observatory, a project that will persistently observe and analyze New York City in an effort to better understand the \u201cpulse of the city\u201d in various states, such as mobility, energy use, communications and economics. The data gathered from the Urban Observatory will ultimately be used to improve various aspects of urban life, including energy efficiency, detecting releases of hazardous material, tracking pollution plumes, aiding in post-blackout restoration of electrical power, and more.   \u201cThis technology comes at an opportune time when about 80% of the U.S. population and 50% of the global population live in cities, said Dr. Steven Koonin, NYU CUSP\u2019s founding director. \u201cWe\u2019ll take these large data sets and turn them into solutions for city-wide problems, helping us to better understand our urban environment and improve the quality of life for citizens around the world.\u201d   The CUSP Urban Observatory, which is still in its demonstration phase, uses an 8 megapixel camera situated atop a building in Downtown Brooklyn to quantify the dynamics of New York City by capturing one panoramic, long-distance image of Lower and Midtown Manhattan every 10 seconds. These observations differ from those of a satellite due to the fixed urban vantage point, which offer an unchanging perspective, with easy and low cost operations. Techniques adapted from astronomy are used to analyze the images.   Strict protocols have been observed to protect the privacy of those individuals in the field of view \u2013 no more than a few pixels cover the closest sources in the scene and images are significantly blurred to ensure that no personal detail is ever captured. Additionally, all analyses have been performed at the aggregate level and any human inspection has been done without the knowledge of the precise location of the source.   CUSP\u2019s Urban Observatory seeks high impact science and applications to enhance public well-being, city operations, and future urban design and combines correlative data including administrative records, original measurements, and current topography. Although the technology is currently being used to solely observe New York City, CUSP hopes to share this with other major cities, such as London, Chicago, and Hong Kong, for similar use and application.   A team of CUSP scientists have been working on this technology for almost two years. Data will be made available for analysis by CUSP personnel and others by proposal.        The upper panel shows a single snapshot of Midtown and the Lower East Side of Manhattan at roughly 11:00AM. Although difficult to see with the naked eye, the image contains two exhaust plumes generated by one of the buildings in the scene. The processed image in the bottom panel removes the objects which are constant (like buildings) and keeps only objects which are moving (like the plumes). With this technique, the Urban Observatory&#8217;s data processing algorithms are able to extract the location of the faint emission plumes.       About New York University\u2019s Center for Urban Science &amp; Progress   CUSP is an applied science research institute created by New York University with a consortium of world-class universities and the foremost international technology companies to address the needs of cities. At the heart of its academic program, CUSP will investigate and develop solutions to the challenges that face cities around the world.\u00a0 This research will make CUSP the world\u2019s leading authority in the emerging field of \u201curban informatics\u201d.\u00a0 For more news and information on CUSP, please visit\u00a0 http://cusp.nyu.edu/ .

Silva , Head of Disciplines at CUSP and professor of Computer Science and Engineering at NYU&#8217;s\u00a0Polytechnic School of Engineering.   The award, one of the highest honors given by the IEEE Computer Science Society&#8217;s Technical Committee on Visualization and Graphics (VGTC), recognizes Silva&#8217;s seminal advances to geometric computing for visualization and contributions to the development of the VisTrails data exploration system. The committee also cited Silva&#8217;s participation in various multidisciplinary projects.   VisTrails systematically maintains provenance for the data exploration process by capturing all the steps researchers follow in the course of an experiment\u2014much like document-tracking applications in Microsoft Word and Google Docs track changes to a document. Tracking provenance is essential because that information allows a researcher to accurately reproduce his or her own results or the results of others, even if they involve hundreds of parameters and complex data sets.   &#8220;Consider that when a researcher is engaged in an exploratory process, working with simulations, data analysis, and visualization, for example, very little is repeated during the analysis process; change is the norm, and new workflows are constantly being generated,&#8221; Silva explained. &#8220;VisTrails manages these rapidly evolving workflows. To make a simple analogy, using it is like having someone in the lab watching over your shoulder and taking concise notes.&#8221;   &#8220;Clauio Silva has blazed a trail of innovation in visualization that has strongly influenced many researchers, including myself,&#8221; said Amitabh Varshney, director of the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee and a professor of computer science and the director of the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies at the University of Maryland. &#8220;One of the reasons his work has had such a significant impact is because it combines elegant foundational research with real-world applications. This award is a well-deserved recognition of Claudio&#8217;s illustrious accomplishments and stunning impact.&#8221;            2014 AT&#038;T Transit Tech Developer Day at CUSP          November 11, 2014       0 Comments             November 22, 2014 &#8211; November 22, 2014   2 MetroTech Center   Map and Directions | Register   Description:  The 2014 AT&amp;T Transit Tech Developer Day App is an opportunity to launch the development of your 2014 MTA App Quest entry.

Now researchers at\u00a0 NYU \u00a0are borrowing astronomy\u2019s methods and turning their cameras towards Manhattan\u2019s famous skyline.   NYU\u2019s\u00a0 Center for Urban Science and Progress \u00a0has been running what\u2019s likely the world\u2019s first \u201c urban observatory \u201d of its kind for about a year. From atop a tall building in downtown Brooklyn (NYU won&#8217;t say its address, due to security concerns), two cameras&#8211;one regular one and one that captures infrared wavelengths&#8211;take panoramic images of lower and midtown Manhattan. One photo is snapped every 10 seconds. That\u2019s 8,640 images a day, or more than 3 million since the project began (or about 50 terabytes of data).   Taking photos of the skyline is nothing new; hordes of tourists do so everyday. And satellites and drones can already capture aerial vantage points. What\u2019s unique about the observatory is the sheer, steady volume of imagery combined with an unchanging vista that offers a slice of the city, rather than only a bird\u2019s-eye view.            NYU CUSP Unveils First-of-its-Kind &#8216;Urban Observatory&#8217; in Downtown Brooklyn          October 28, 2014       0 Comments             New York University\u2019s Center for Urban Science &amp; Progress (CUSP) today unveiled its Urban Observatory, a project that will persistently observe and analyze New York City in an effort to better understand the \u201cpulse of the city\u201d in various states, such as mobility, energy use, communications and economics. The data gathered from the Urban Observatory will ultimately be used to improve various aspects of urban life, including energy efficiency, detecting releases of hazardous material, tracking pollution plumes, aiding in post-blackout restoration of electrical power, and more.   \u201cThis technology comes at an opportune time when about 80% of the U.S. population and 50% of the global population live in cities, said Dr. Steven Koonin, NYU CUSP\u2019s founding director. \u201cWe\u2019ll take these large data sets and turn them into solutions for city-wide problems, helping us to better understand our urban environment and improve the quality of life for citizens around the world.\u201d   The CUSP Urban Observatory, which is still in its demonstration phase, uses an 8 megapixel camera situated atop a building in Downtown Brooklyn to quantify the dynamics of New York City by capturing one panoramic, long-distance image of Lower and Midtown Manhattan every 10 seconds. These observations differ from those of a satellite due to the fixed urban vantage point, which offer an unchanging perspective, with easy and low cost operations. Techniques adapted from astronomy are used to analyze the images.   Strict protocols have been observed to protect the privacy of those individuals in the field of view \u2013 no more than a few pixels cover the closest sources in the scene and images are significantly blurred to ensure that no personal detail is ever captured. Additionally, all analyses have been performed at the aggregate level and any human inspection has been done without the knowledge of the precise location of the source.   CUSP\u2019s Urban Observatory seeks high impact science and applications to enhance public well-being, city operations, and future urban design and combines correlative data including administrative records, original measurements, and current topography. Although the technology is currently being used to solely observe New York City, CUSP hopes to share this with other major cities, such as London, Chicago, and Hong Kong, for similar use and application.   A team of CUSP scientists have been working on this technology for almost two years. Data will be made available for analysis by CUSP personnel and others by proposal.        The upper panel shows a single snapshot of Midtown and the Lower East Side of Manhattan at roughly 11:00AM. Although difficult to see with the naked eye, the image contains two exhaust plumes generated by one of the buildings in the scene. The processed image in the bottom panel removes the objects which are constant (like buildings) and keeps only objects which are moving (like the plumes). With this technique, the Urban Observatory&#8217;s data processing algorithms are able to extract the location of the faint emission plumes.       About New York University\u2019s Center for Urban Science &amp; Progress   CUSP is an applied science research institute created by New York University with a consortium of world-class universities and the foremost international technology companies to address the needs of cities. At the heart of its academic program, CUSP will investigate and develop solutions to the challenges that face cities around the world.\u00a0 This research will make CUSP the world\u2019s leading authority in the emerging field of \u201curban informatics\u201d.\u00a0 For more news and information on CUSP, please visit\u00a0 http://cusp.nyu.edu/ .

Register            AAAI 2015 Workshop on AI for Cities          July 23, 2014       0 Comments                      Almost half of humanity today lives in urban environments and that number will grow to 80% or more by the middle of this century in different parts of the world. Cities are thus the loci of resource consumption, economic activity, social interactions, and education and innovation; they are the cause of our looming sustainability problems but also where those problems must be solved. Cities are also an enormous forum for policy making, as well as an apparently unbounded source of digital data of a wide nature. Artificial Intelligence has the potential to play a central role in tackling the underlying hard computational, decision making, and statistical problems of cities.   With this in mind, CUSP has proposed a worskshop to bring together AI researchers who work on urban informatics and domain experts from city agencies in order to: i) identify and characterize the prototypical AI problems that cities face, ii) discuss data access, open platforms, and dissemination of information, iii) present recent research in this nascent subfield, and iv) strengthen the path from research to decision and policy making. The workshop will be held on January 25-26, 2015, in Austin, Texas.   Topics include     Spatiotemporal inference of urban processes (social or natural)   Energy consumption/disaggregation models of large urban areas   Planning/Scheduling for city operations   Decision making for urban science and for city policy   AI models of transportation and utilities networks   Resource allocation in urban systems   Event detection of urban activity and processes   Active learning, sampling biases and dataset shift in city data   Multi-agent simulations of urban processes   Visualization and city operational systems   Cross-city comparative analysis   Improving public health systems in cities   Crowdsourcing for urban science and decision making   Open data platforms and data access tools for data science     Preliminary Agenda         09:00 &#8211; 09:10   \u00a0-   \u00a0Introduction and opening remarks       09:10 &#8211; 09:40   \u00a0-   \u00a0 Invited talk &#8211; Juliana Freire, NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering        09:40 &#8211; 10:10   \u00a0-   \u00a0Invited talk &#8211; Autonomous Machines and Robots in Cities &#8211; Manuela Veloso, CMU       10:10 &#8211; 10:30   \u00a0-   \u00a0Coffee Break       10:30 &#8211; 11:00   \u00a0-   Invited talk &#8211; Adi Botea, IBM       11:00 &#8211; 11:30   \u00a0-   \u00a0Invited talk &#8211; Craig Knoblock, USC       11:30 &#8211; 12:30   \u00a0-   \u00a0Lunch Break       12:30 &#8211; 01:00   \u00a0-   \u00a0Invited Talk &#8211; Mike Flowers, NYU CUSP       01:00 &#8211; 03:00   \u00a0-   \u00a0Paper Presentations       03:00 &#8211; 03:30   \u00a0-   \u00a0Data access &#8211; city data portals, initiatives, and restrictions       03:30 &#8211; 04:00   \u00a0-   \u00a0Coffee Break       04:00 &#8211; 04:30   \u00a0-   \u00a0Data access &#8211; city data portals, initiatives, and restrictions       04:30 &#8211; 05:00   \u00a0-   \u00a0Open discussion and concluding remarks       05:00 &#8211; 06:00   \u00a0-   \u00a0Social event         Submission Requirements   Papers must be formatted in AAAI two-column, camera-ready style.

Numerous privacy concerns have been raised by use &#8211; or misuse &#8211; of such data in commercial and national security arenas. Yet we are motivated by the potential for \u201cbig data\u201d to be harnessed to serve the public good: scientists can use new forms of data to do research that improves people&#8217;s live; federal, state and local governments can use data to improve the delivery of services to citizens; and non-profit organizations can use the information to advance the public good.   Access to big data raises many unanswered questions related to privacy and confidentiality:\u00a0 What are the ethical and legal requirements for scientists and government officials seeking to serve the public good without harming individual citizens? What are the rules of engagement? What are the best ways to provide access while protecting confidentiality? Are there reasonable mechanisms to compensate citizens for privacy loss?     CUSP, along with\u00a0the\u00a0 American Statistical Association and its Privacy and Confidentiality subcommittee\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0 Research Data Centre of the German Federal Employment Agency , sponsored a book on this very issue, Privacy, Big Data, and the Public Good: Frameworks for Engagement .\u00a0 Published by Cambridge University Press, this book is\u00a0an accessible summary of the important legal, economic, and statistical thinking that frames the many privacy issues associated with the use of big data &#8211; along with practical suggestions for protecting privacy and confidentiality that can help to guide practitioners.   The book launch, held at the New York Academy of Sciences on July 16th, included talks and panels by the book&#8217;s editors and a number of the authors. You can watch these talks and panels below.   Editors&#8217; Panel   Moderator: Michael Holland   Panelists: Julia Lane, Victoria Stodden, Stefan Bender, Helen Nissenbaum   The editors discuss the motivation for the book and how it contributes to the broader conversation on privacy concerns about big data.\u00a0 They also briefly highlight the contribution of authors who were unable to participate in the event.     Panel 1: Law, Ethics, and Economics of Big Data   Moderator: Jake Bournazian   Panel: Helen Nissenbaum, Kathy Strandburg, Victoria Stodden     Authors discuss the fact that \u201cbig data\u201d is more than a straightforward change in technology.\u00a0 It poses deep challenges to our traditions of notice and consent as tools for managing privacy.\u00a0 Because our new tools of data science can make it all but impossible to guarantee anonymity in the future, is it possible to truly give informed consent, when we cannot, by definition, know what the risks are from revealing personal data either for individuals or for society as a whole?   Presentations:       Helen Nissenbaum   Victoria Stodden         Panel 2: Practical Concerns of Working with Big Data   Moderator: Julia Lane   Panelists: Bob Goerge, Daniel &#8220;Dazza&#8221; Greenwood, Carl Landwehr   Based on their experience building large data collections, authors discuss some of the best practical ways to provide access while protecting confidentiality.\u00a0 What have we learned about effective engineered controls?\u00a0 About effective access policies?\u00a0 About designing data systems that reinforce &#8211; rather than counter &#8211; access policies?\u00a0 They also explore the business, legal, and technical standards necessary for a new deal on data.   Presentations:       Bob George   Carl Landwehr         Panel 3: Statistical Framework: Issues &amp; Practical Responses   Moderator: Stefan Bender   Panelists: Frauke Kreuter, Jerry Reiter, Peter Elias   Since the data generating process or the data collection process is not necessarily well understood for big data streams, authors discuss what statistics can tell us about how to make greatest scientific use of this data. They also explore the shortcomings of current disclosure limitation approaches and whether we can quantify the extent of privacy loss.   Presentations:       Frauke Kreuter   Jerry Reiter   Peter Elias         Capstone Speaker: Theresa Pardo   Our capstone speaker is\u00a0the Director of the Center for Technology in Government at the University at Albany, the Open NY Policy Advisor for Open.NY.Gov, and the President of the Digital Government Society.\u00a0 She shows us how \u201cbig data\u201d can be harnessed to serve the public good by presenting a guide for making information in the public sector more available and more usable.   Presentations:       Theresa Pardo                    CUSP Collaborates in Public Mapping Mission          November 21, 2013       0 Comments                CUSP is teaming up with NYU&#8217;s Govlab, MIT Media Lab, Public Lab and Peer-2-Peer University\u00a0to offer a novel hybrid of massive open online course (MOOC) and hands-on team-based field work.
