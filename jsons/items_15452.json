The increase in international art transactions has incubated a booming market for stolen and fraudulent art, and major U.S. arts institutions continue to grapple with repatriation of stolen or looted objects in their collections.    To address the enormity of this global trend, the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies (NYU-SCPS) will present a three-day symposium, \u201cArt Crime and Cultural Heritage: Fakes, Forgeries, and Looted and Stolen Art,\u201d on June 4-6, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. It will take place at NYU School of Law, 40 Washington Square South, Lipton Hall.    Co-organized by Jane C.H. Jacob , art historian and provenance research expert, Jacob Fine Art, Inc.; Chris Marinello , director and founder, Art Recovery International; and Alice Farren-Bradley , moderator, Museum Security Network, this forum will bring together professionals from major museums and auction houses; art crime attorneys; experts from the NYU School of Law, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the President's Cultural Property Advisory Committee; independent scholars and authors; art crime victims; forensic scientists; and other individuals who are working to develop solutions for this worldwide issue.    Topics include art theft and gallery scams, misappropriated use of work, looting and cultural repatriation, fakes and forgeries, art market drivers, insurance fraud, scientific and forensic approaches, provenance research, issues facing auction houses and purchasers, and current case studies.
