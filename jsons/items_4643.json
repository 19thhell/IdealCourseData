Immerse yourself in England\u2019s fascinating history, and learn about the noteworthy and notorious figures that have shaped English history in the medieval and Tudor eras. Live, study, and dine on the college\u2019s beautiful campus, which dates back to the 16th century. Enjoy lectures, field trips to places of historic interest, and unique events\u2014arranged especially for School participants\u2014as well as the flexibility to enroll for one or two weeks.   The program, celebrating its 16th year at Oxford, is a unique collaboration between Oxford University and the NYU School of Professional Studies. The courses, taught by distinguished Oxford tutors, are held each morning. Additionally, there are two pre-dinner lectures each week by accompanying School faculty. Afternoons offer free time, during which you have the opportunity to enjoy special events and field trips.   On campus, visit historic sites, including Oxford\u2019s magnificent medieval cathedral with its ancient cloister and the College\u2019s superb collection of Old Masters\u2019 paintings, and relax in its flower-filled gardens and idyllic meadows. You also may explore the historic city of Oxford on your own. In the town, see the exquisite 17th-century Sheldonian Theatre, the Bodleian Library, and the renowned Ashmolean Museum. Numerous evening concerts, recitals, and theatrical performances are available for you to enjoy.   Register for one or two weeks. Enrollment is open to all. No grades issued.                Academics        Week One: England's Medieval Heroes and Villains  July 19\u201325, 2015  Tutor: Elizabeth Gemmill, Ph.D.   Medieval England is rich in the tapestry of heroes and villains. Examine how, in different ways, the lives of these men and women shed light on the world in which they lived. The course begins in the 12th century with the martyr Thomas Becket and ends in the 15th century with Margaret Beaufort, who persevered through the Wars of the Roses to become a patroness of art and letters, as well as matriarch of the Tudor dynasty. Learn about complex figures from the intervening centuries, including Alice Perrers who compromised the reputation of King Edward III; King Henry V, hero of Agincourt; and also study King John, whose reign led to the issuing of the Magna Carta in 1215, exactly eight hundred years ago.           Week Two: Tudor People: The Famous and the Infamous  July 26\u2013August 1, 2015  Tutor: Tracey Sowerby, Ph.D.     Study the lives, achievements, and exploits of important Tudor men and women whose reputations--whether tyrannical, heroic, or romantic--captured the imagination of the people of 16th century England. This seminar covers such notable figures as young King Edward VI, son of Henry VIII, who acceded to the throne in 1547, Queen Mary, half-sister of Elizabeth I, who later in her reign was maligned as an enemy. Examine the lives of Charles Brandon, a famous military hero and the brother-in-law of Henry VIII; Sir Francis Drake, the famous explorer and naval champion; and Richard III, who although defeated and killed in battle in 1485, became synonymous in the Tudor era with medieval infamy and tyranny.
