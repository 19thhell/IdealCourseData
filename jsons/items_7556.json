Note: This course fulfills 4 units of the Interdisciplinary Seminar requirement.                               Charles Dickens         Course Description          Dickens' extraordinary novel, Bleak House (1852-53), is a 'big book.' A virtual omnibus of mid Victorian society, it encompasses a wide range of themes, locations, issues, and characters, attending to questions wealth and poverty, children and parents, legacies both material and abstract, the place of women, illness and health, crime and punishment, tradition and reform--all against the background of the rapidly growing, foggy, filthy, apparently disconnected city that is nineteenth-century London. Often it is said that this novel is 'about the law;' and this is true in a number of ways; most evidently through the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, a central driver of Dickens' sprawling story. Jarndyce and Jarndyce is a Chancery case, concerning a will; but Dickens also takes us into the broader world of legal London, giving us some of the most memorable lawyer characters in nineteenth-century fiction.     In this course, we focus intently on a slow and careful reading of Bleak House, supplemented by readings and field trips designed to help us understand nineteenth-century London and the Victorians. While locating the course in London will still not let us experience at first-hand Dickens' world, we can bring what might seem like very distant and strange locations closer through museum visits, walking tours, and other outside-the-classroom experiences that permit us to reflect on the city, which is in effect a character in the novel. Reflecting on the differences between contemporary London and its Victorian antecedent, we reflect on the ways in which history leaves its trace on the material world and the way in which literary works represent urban experience and historical change. Our reading of Bleak House will draw our attention to the ways in which the world that it seeks to represent is a vanished one; but it also may call us to realize the ways in which some of the fundamental questions it poses and the forms in which it poses them are, after all, quite close to us.     We will frame our investigation with the idea of jurisdiction. Literally, it means 'the saying of the law' but jurisdiction usually refers to the expertise or command of a particular court. This command can be territorial or it can deal with specific kinds of matters, as in the case of the Chancery, an institution with medieval origins that was supposed to supplement the rigor of the law with 'equity.' Bleak House, we might argue, locates itself at a critical moment in the development of a legal system, when common and customary law institutions and practices are coming under pressure from a rapidly developing modern society. But we might broaden this idea of jurisdiction--as Dickens does in his novel--to think about space, place, and time, affect and desire, and the &quot; jurisdiction&quot; of literature. Who gets to &quot;say the law&quot; where and with what authority? What is the space of the law? And what is the space of the literary? And how does the space of nineteenth-century London shape Dickens' fiction? We can also read this novel as a broader moral appeal for equity in its less institutional sense: in this novel, Dickens might be asking &quot;who are we? and how can we live together justly?&quot;     This course will be of interest to students whose focus is on literature, law, history, culture and society, gender, politics and art, and urban studies.

Charles Dickens         Course Description          Dickens' extraordinary novel, Bleak House (1852-53), is a 'big book.' A virtual omnibus of mid Victorian society, it encompasses a wide range of themes, locations, issues, and characters, attending to questions wealth and poverty, children and parents, legacies both material and abstract, the place of women, illness and health, crime and punishment, tradition and reform--all against the background of the rapidly growing, foggy, filthy, apparently disconnected city that is nineteenth-century London. Often it is said that this novel is 'about the law;' and this is true in a number of ways; most evidently through the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, a central driver of Dickens' sprawling story. Jarndyce and Jarndyce is a Chancery case, concerning a will; but Dickens also takes us into the broader world of legal London, giving us some of the most memorable lawyer characters in nineteenth-century fiction.     In this course, we focus intently on a slow and careful reading of Bleak House, supplemented by readings and field trips designed to help us understand nineteenth-century London and the Victorians. While locating the course in London will still not let us experience at first-hand Dickens' world, we can bring what might seem like very distant and strange locations closer through museum visits, walking tours, and other outside-the-classroom experiences that permit us to reflect on the city, which is in effect a character in the novel. Reflecting on the differences between contemporary London and its Victorian antecedent, we reflect on the ways in which history leaves its trace on the material world and the way in which literary works represent urban experience and historical change. Our reading of Bleak House will draw our attention to the ways in which the world that it seeks to represent is a vanished one; but it also may call us to realize the ways in which some of the fundamental questions it poses and the forms in which it poses them are, after all, quite close to us.     We will frame our investigation with the idea of jurisdiction. Literally, it means 'the saying of the law' but jurisdiction usually refers to the expertise or command of a particular court. This command can be territorial or it can deal with specific kinds of matters, as in the case of the Chancery, an institution with medieval origins that was supposed to supplement the rigor of the law with 'equity.' Bleak House, we might argue, locates itself at a critical moment in the development of a legal system, when common and customary law institutions and practices are coming under pressure from a rapidly developing modern society. But we might broaden this idea of jurisdiction--as Dickens does in his novel--to think about space, place, and time, affect and desire, and the &quot; jurisdiction&quot; of literature. Who gets to &quot;say the law&quot; where and with what authority? What is the space of the law? And what is the space of the literary? And how does the space of nineteenth-century London shape Dickens' fiction? We can also read this novel as a broader moral appeal for equity in its less institutional sense: in this novel, Dickens might be asking &quot;who are we? and how can we live together justly?&quot;     This course will be of interest to students whose focus is on literature, law, history, culture and society, gender, politics and art, and urban studies.

Description       Application: http://gallatin.nyu.edu/utilities/forms/summersaapp.html For more information: http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/undergraduate/global/travelcourses/london--dickens--jurisdictions.html Description: Dickens' novel, Bleak House (1852-53), is an omnibus of mid Victorian society, encompassing a wide range of themes: wealth and poverty, children and parents, legacies, the place of women, illness and health, crime and punishment, tradition and reform--all against the background of the rapidly growing, foggy, filthy city that is nineteenth-century London. Often it is said that this novel is 'about the law;' the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce is a central driver of Dickens' sprawling story. Dickens also takes us into the broader world of legal London, offering some of the most memorable lawyer characters in nineteenth-century fiction. In this course, we focus intently on a slow and careful reading of Bleak House, supplemented by readings and field trips designed to help us understand nineteenth-century London and the Victorians. While locating the course in London will still not let us experience at first-hand Dickens' world, we can bring what might seem like very distant and strange locations closer through outside-the-classroom experiences that permit us to reflect on the city, which is in effect a character in the novel. We will frame our investigation with the idea of jurisdiction. Jurisdiction refers to the expertise or command of a particular court, but we will broaden this idea--as Dickens does in his novel--to think about space, place, and time, affect and desire, and the &quot; jurisdiction&quot; of literature. Who gets to &quot;say the law&quot; where and with what authority? What is the space of the literary? And how does the space of nineteenth-century London shape Dickens' fiction?
