This club aims to provide a forum and a safe space to explore ideas and share experiences. We hope to generate dialogue and allyship, advocacy and activism. We aim to inspire civic engagement and expand student knowledge on a variety of issues and identities. We broadly define disability to include both visible and invisible, learning disabilities, mental illness, chronic pain, chronic illness, and temporary disabilities. In addition, we welcome an evolving understanding of our definition of disability. We are also open to new and different perspectives, with the recognition that this group is rooted in social justice, intersectionality, respect, and constructive dialogue for the purpose of improved understanding.    NYU P.E.A.C.E., Professionals Educating and Advocating for Children with Exceptionalities   P.E.A.C.E. is the NYU student chapter of Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), &quot;the largest international professional organization dedicated to improving the educational success of individuals with disabilities and/or gifts and talents.&quot; CEC chapters work to fulfill the mission and vision of CEC International by &quot;advocating for appropriate governmental policies, seting professional standards, providing professional development, advocating for individuals with exceptionalities, and helping professionals obtain conditions and resources necessary for effective professional practice.&quot;   NYU Health, Humanities and Culture Working Group   The Humanities Initiative   Our Working Research Group (WRG) is devoted to teaching and scholarship at the interface of health, medicine, and culture. Increasingly health care scholars have recognized that health care involves more than bodies and biology; it also involves human meaning, purpose, and culture. And, in the other direction, humanities scholars have increasingly recognized the bodily dimensions of human subjectivity and culture. People are more than their hopes, dreams, and imagination; they are also embodied creatures intimately connected to their biology. Thus, to understand this side of human side of medicine and the bodily side of humanity, academic centers must foster quality inquiry into this rapidly growing interdisciplinary domain.   ASD Nest Support Project  Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development   Department of Teaching and Learning, Programs in Special Education   NYU's partnership with New York City&rsquo;s Department of Education (DoE) and Hunter College&rsquo;s School of Education began in 2001 to fill a gap in the programs the DoE offered for higher functioning children on the autism spectrum. The fruit of that collaboration was the new ASD Nest program, piloted at PS 32 in Brooklyn in September 2003. Its goal was and is to help these children learn how to function well academically, behaviorally and socially in school and in their community. Now, in the 2011-12 school year, the New York City school system serves 500 children with ASDs in 131 fully inclusive Nest classrooms in 19 elementary schools, three middle schools and one high school.       Academic Programs   Working with Individuals with Disabilities: Physical, Mental, and Cognitive   Silver School of Social Work   Continuing Education   This Post Master&rsquo;s Certificate is designed for social workers and other health professionals who are currently working with individuals with disabilities or are interested in making this a part of their practice or agency based work. The Certificate Program will explore disability from a biological, social, psychological, spiritual, and cultural perspective. Defining what is meant by disability will be integral to the learning. This approach to understanding disability focuses on the perspective of the individual and ability not the disability.   Masters Scholars in Medical Humanism Program   NYU Medical School     The Master Scholars in Medical Humanism Program (MSMHP) is a component of the Office of Student Affairs developed to complement the culture of medical education by encouraging students to explore intellectual and artistic interests not necessarily covered in the core curriculum. Through innovative seminars, colloquia, and events moderated by expert facilitators, students are encouraged to pursue their interests outside of the classroom to better prepare them for their practice and inevitably make a meaningful difference in the individual lives of patients.   The MSMHP invites students to develop new opportunities to promote conversations in medicine and humanities; past events have included lectures with nationally recognized faculty, writers and artists, film screenings, visits to off-site museums, concerts and performance arts, and collaborations with other NYU programs.   Special Education in Teaching and Learning   Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development   &bull; UG: Early Childhood/Special Education (Birth-Gr2) (dual certification)  &bull; UG: Childhood/Special (Gr 1-6) (dual certification)  &bull; MA: Early Childhood/Special Education (Birth-Gr2) (dual certification)  &bull; MA: Childhood/Special Education (Gr1-6) (dual certification)  &bull; MA: Special Education @Early Childhood (Birth-Gr2) (stand alone-Special Ed)  &bull; MA: Childhood/Special Education (Gr1-6) (stand alone-Special Ed)  &bull; Advanced Certificate: Special Ed Learning Consultants (Lifespan)  &bull; PhD in Teaching and Learning: Special Education.   Department of Physical Therapy   Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development   &bull; Doctor of Physical Therapy Program   This innovative entry-level program encompasses the study of normal and abnormal structure and function, and the theory and practice of physical therapy. The program aims to develop competent, autonomous practitioners.   &bull; Doctor of Physical Therapy for Practicing Physical Therapists Program   The goal of this clinical doctorate program is to provide practicing physical therapists with the clinical, research application, and business skills needed for current and future experiences as autonomous practitioners   &bull; Masters of Arts for Physical Therapists   In this masters program with a concentration in Pathokinesiology students will develop competent clinical research skills in methodology and data analysis that will be used to solve problems concerning motor control and motor learning in management of patients with physical disabilities.   &bull; Clinical Residency Program in Orthopedic Physical Therapy   The Clinical Residency in Orthopedic Physical Therapy program is designed so that licensed physical therapists can obtain advanced orthopedic physical therapy knowledge and clinical skills.   &bull; Week end Intensives in Orthopedic Physical Therapy   This innovative series of weekend intensives provides advanced training in orthopedic practice to physical therapists in an immersive Friday/Saturday format.     Department of Occupational Therapy   Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development   &bull; MA Occupational Therapy   Our entry level and advanced Masters programs in Occupational Therapy train students in all aspects of improving function and participation with individuals with physical and developmental disabilities, and mental health issues.   &bull; PhD in Occupational Therapy   Our PhD in Occupational Therapy deals with many aspects of disability. Specific coursework in these programs (Assistive Technology, Successful interventions in schools) and mentoring with faculty in directed projects/dissertations addresses issues in areas related to motor development, preamaturity, autism, sensory processing, traumatic brain injury, hand injuries, aging, and others.           Centers    The Henry and Lucy Moses Center for Students with Disabilities   The Henry and Lucy Moses Center for Students with Disabilities provides comprehensive services and programs for undergraduate and graduate students with hearing and visual impairments, mobility impairments, learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders, chronic illnesses, and psychological impairments.   The Moses Center functions to determine qualified disability status and to assist students in obtaining appropriate accommodations and services. Services provided are designed to encourage independence and self-advocacy, backed by a comprehensive system of supports.   The Initiative for Women With Disabilities at the Elly &amp; Steve Hammerman Health &amp; Wellness Center   Lagone Medical Center   This multidisciplinary center is committed to providing respectful, high quality gynecological, medical and wellness services for women and adolescent girls with physical disabilities.   This unique center empowers women with physical disabilities to pursue a healthy lifestyle. Heath and wellness are central to all IWD components including mind-body physical therapy, nutrition consultation, fitness classes and social work services.   The Rusk Institute   Lagone Medical Center   The world&rsquo;s first university-affiliated facility devoted entirely to rehabilitation medicine, the Rusk Institute is among the most renowned center of its kind for the treatment of adults and children with disabilities-home to innovations and advances that have set the standard in rehabilitation care for every stage of life and for every phase of recovery.

ASD Nest Support Project  Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development   Department of Teaching and Learning, Programs in Special Education   NYU's partnership with New York City&rsquo;s Department of Education (DoE) and Hunter College&rsquo;s School of Education began in 2001 to fill a gap in the programs the DoE offered for higher functioning children on the autism spectrum. The fruit of that collaboration was the new ASD Nest program, piloted at PS 32 in Brooklyn in September 2003. Its goal was and is to help these children learn how to function well academically, behaviorally and socially in school and in their community. Now, in the 2011-12 school year, the New York City school system serves 500 children with ASDs in 131 fully inclusive Nest classrooms in 19 elementary schools, three middle schools and one high school.       Academic Programs   Working with Individuals with Disabilities: Physical, Mental, and Cognitive   Silver School of Social Work   Continuing Education   This Post Master&rsquo;s Certificate is designed for social workers and other health professionals who are currently working with individuals with disabilities or are interested in making this a part of their practice or agency based work.

This approach to understanding disability focuses on the perspective of the individual and ability not the disability.   Masters Scholars in Medical Humanism Program   NYU Medical School     The Master Scholars in Medical Humanism Program (MSMHP) is a component of the Office of Student Affairs developed to complement the culture of medical education by encouraging students to explore intellectual and artistic interests not necessarily covered in the core curriculum.

The MSMHP invites students to develop new opportunities to promote conversations in medicine and humanities; past events have included lectures with nationally recognized faculty, writers and artists, film screenings, visits to off-site museums, concerts and performance arts, and collaborations with other NYU programs.

This club aims to provide a forum and a safe space to explore ideas and share experiences. We hope to generate dialogue and allyship, advocacy and activism. We aim to inspire civic engagement and expand student knowledge on a variety of issues and identities. We broadly define disability to include both visible and invisible, learning disabilities, mental illness, chronic pain, chronic illness, and temporary disabilities. In addition, we welcome an evolving understanding of our definition of disability. We are also open to new and different perspectives, with the recognition that this group is rooted in social justice, intersectionality, respect, and constructive dialogue for the purpose of improved understanding.

Increasingly health care scholars have recognized that health care involves more than bodies and biology; it also involves human meaning, purpose, and culture. And, in the other direction, humanities scholars have increasingly recognized the bodily dimensions of human subjectivity and culture. People are more than their hopes, dreams, and imagination; they are also embodied creatures intimately connected to their biology. Thus, to understand this side of human side of medicine and the bodily side of humanity, academic centers must foster quality inquiry into this rapidly growing interdisciplinary domain.

This club aims to provide a forum and a safe space to explore ideas and share experiences. We hope to generate dialogue and allyship, advocacy and activism. We aim to inspire civic engagement and expand student knowledge on a variety of issues and identities. We broadly define disability to include both visible and invisible, learning disabilities, mental illness, chronic pain, chronic illness, and temporary disabilities. In addition, we welcome an evolving understanding of our definition of disability. We are also open to new and different perspectives, with the recognition that this group is rooted in social justice, intersectionality, respect, and constructive dialogue for the purpose of improved understanding.    NYU P.E.A.C.E., Professionals Educating and Advocating for Children with Exceptionalities   P.E.A.C.E. is the NYU student chapter of Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), &quot;the largest international professional organization dedicated to improving the educational success of individuals with disabilities and/or gifts and talents.&quot; CEC chapters work to fulfill the mission and vision of CEC International by &quot;advocating for appropriate governmental policies, seting professional standards, providing professional development, advocating for individuals with exceptionalities, and helping professionals obtain conditions and resources necessary for effective professional practice.&quot;   NYU Health, Humanities and Culture Working Group   The Humanities Initiative   Our Working Research Group (WRG) is devoted to teaching and scholarship at the interface of health, medicine, and culture. Increasingly health care scholars have recognized that health care involves more than bodies and biology; it also involves human meaning, purpose, and culture. And, in the other direction, humanities scholars have increasingly recognized the bodily dimensions of human subjectivity and culture. People are more than their hopes, dreams, and imagination; they are also embodied creatures intimately connected to their biology. Thus, to understand this side of human side of medicine and the bodily side of humanity, academic centers must foster quality inquiry into this rapidly growing interdisciplinary domain.   ASD Nest Support Project  Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development   Department of Teaching and Learning, Programs in Special Education   NYU's partnership with New York City&rsquo;s Department of Education (DoE) and Hunter College&rsquo;s School of Education began in 2001 to fill a gap in the programs the DoE offered for higher functioning children on the autism spectrum. The fruit of that collaboration was the new ASD Nest program, piloted at PS 32 in Brooklyn in September 2003. Its goal was and is to help these children learn how to function well academically, behaviorally and socially in school and in their community. Now, in the 2011-12 school year, the New York City school system serves 500 children with ASDs in 131 fully inclusive Nest classrooms in 19 elementary schools, three middle schools and one high school.       Academic Programs   Working with Individuals with Disabilities: Physical, Mental, and Cognitive   Silver School of Social Work   Continuing Education   This Post Master&rsquo;s Certificate is designed for social workers and other health professionals who are currently working with individuals with disabilities or are interested in making this a part of their practice or agency based work. The Certificate Program will explore disability from a biological, social, psychological, spiritual, and cultural perspective. Defining what is meant by disability will be integral to the learning. This approach to understanding disability focuses on the perspective of the individual and ability not the disability.   Masters Scholars in Medical Humanism Program   NYU Medical School     The Master Scholars in Medical Humanism Program (MSMHP) is a component of the Office of Student Affairs developed to complement the culture of medical education by encouraging students to explore intellectual and artistic interests not necessarily covered in the core curriculum. Through innovative seminars, colloquia, and events moderated by expert facilitators, students are encouraged to pursue their interests outside of the classroom to better prepare them for their practice and inevitably make a meaningful difference in the individual lives of patients.   The MSMHP invites students to develop new opportunities to promote conversations in medicine and humanities; past events have included lectures with nationally recognized faculty, writers and artists, film screenings, visits to off-site museums, concerts and performance arts, and collaborations with other NYU programs.

Reasonable Accommodations are adjustments to policy, practice, and programs that \u201clevel the playing field\u201d for students with disabilities and provide equal access to NYU\u2018s programs and activities. Accommodation plans and other related services are individualized based on each student\u2019s disability-related needs, disability documentation and NYU program requirements and are therefore determined on a case by case basis. Each student who registers with CSD works with a Disability Specialist to develop a reasonable accommodation plan.   Accommodations include, but are not limited to:     Testing accommodations   Note-takers   Use of a computer for exams   Materials in alternate format   Provision of sign language interpreters     Reasonable accommodations do not negate requirements for successful completion of a program, course, or service or adherence to acceptable standards of behavior. It is important to note that some accommodations are not appropriate in all courses.      How to Register with CSD   Students in higher education who wish to receive accommodations must self disclose by registering their disability with CSD. The Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) has established the following process for registration with the office:     Complete an Application for Services form.   Gather and submit current documentation of your disability. To register a learning disability or ADD/ADHD, you must submit a current psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation. If you have a learning disability or ADHD and you do not have a current evaluation and feel unable to secure one, please e-mail mosescsd@nyu.edu and ask for a documentation consultation with a CSD Disability Specialist. For all other disability types, you may submit the CSD Certification of Disability form completed by a qualified health professional/clinician. Please refer to our Disability Documentation Guidelines and choose the one specific to your disability to give to your clinician to use as a guide for completing the Certification of Disability form or psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation.   Submit a signed Authorization for Release of Information form so CSD has your permission to contact your clinician if necessary.   After you have submitted the Application for Services , current disability documentation, and a signed Authorization for Release of Information form, your request for accommodations will be reviewed by a CSD Disability Specialist. You will then be contacted to schedule a meeting to discuss one of the following:     1. Your approved accommodations and how to use the services provided by CSD;  2. The need for additional documentation of your disability;  3. Why you have not been approved for accommodations through CSD.       **Please note that all CSD forms are also available at the Moses Center at 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor.

Now, in the 2011-12 school year, the New York City school system serves 500 children with ASDs in 131 fully inclusive Nest classrooms in 19 elementary schools, three middle schools and one high school.       Academic Programs   Working with Individuals with Disabilities: Physical, Mental, and Cognitive   Silver School of Social Work   Continuing Education   This Post Master&rsquo;s Certificate is designed for social workers and other health professionals who are currently working with individuals with disabilities or are interested in making this a part of their practice or agency based work. The Certificate Program will explore disability from a biological, social, psychological, spiritual, and cultural perspective. Defining what is meant by disability will be integral to the learning. This approach to understanding disability focuses on the perspective of the individual and ability not the disability.   Masters Scholars in Medical Humanism Program   NYU Medical School     The Master Scholars in Medical Humanism Program (MSMHP) is a component of the Office of Student Affairs developed to complement the culture of medical education by encouraging students to explore intellectual and artistic interests not necessarily covered in the core curriculum. Through innovative seminars, colloquia, and events moderated by expert facilitators, students are encouraged to pursue their interests outside of the classroom to better prepare them for their practice and inevitably make a meaningful difference in the individual lives of patients.   The MSMHP invites students to develop new opportunities to promote conversations in medicine and humanities; past events have included lectures with nationally recognized faculty, writers and artists, film screenings, visits to off-site museums, concerts and performance arts, and collaborations with other NYU programs.

Reasonable Accommodations are adjustments to policy, practice, and programs that \u201clevel the playing field\u201d for students with disabilities and provide equal access to NYU\u2018s programs and activities. Accommodation plans and other related services are individualized based on each student\u2019s disability-related needs, disability documentation and NYU program requirements and are therefore determined on a case by case basis. Each student who registers with CSD works with a Disability Specialist to develop a reasonable accommodation plan.   Accommodations include, but are not limited to:     Testing accommodations   Note-takers   Use of a computer for exams   Materials in alternate format   Provision of sign language interpreters     Reasonable accommodations do not negate requirements for successful completion of a program, course, or service or adherence to acceptable standards of behavior. It is important to note that some accommodations are not appropriate in all courses.      How to Register with CSD   Students in higher education who wish to receive accommodations must self disclose by registering their disability with CSD. The Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) has established the following process for registration with the office:     Complete an Application for Services form.   Gather and submit current documentation of your disability. To register a learning disability or ADD/ADHD, you must submit a current psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation. If you have a learning disability or ADHD and you do not have a current evaluation and feel unable to secure one, please e-mail mosescsd@nyu.edu and ask for a documentation consultation with a CSD Disability Specialist. For all other disability types, you may submit the CSD Certification of Disability form completed by a qualified health professional/clinician. Please refer to our Disability Documentation Guidelines and choose the one specific to your disability to give to your clinician to use as a guide for completing the Certification of Disability form or psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation.   Submit a signed Authorization for Release of Information form so CSD has your permission to contact your clinician if necessary.   After you have submitted the Application for Services , current disability documentation, and a signed Authorization for Release of Information form, your request for accommodations will be reviewed by a CSD Disability Specialist. You will then be contacted to schedule a meeting to discuss one of the following:     1. Your approved accommodations and how to use the services provided by CSD;  2. The need for additional documentation of your disability;  3. Why you have not been approved for accommodations through CSD.       **Please note that all CSD forms are also available at the Moses Center at 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor.
