Workload relief is not considered a leave as faculty members are expected to make themselves available to the extent reasonable and practicable for their customary responsibilities of research, student consultation and advising.   The school in which the individual applying for workload relief is a faculty member shall remain financially responsible for the faculty member's salary during the workload relief period. Financial support for workload relief of classroom teaching, necessitated by having to hire appropriate replacements, is borne by a University workload relief fund. Please see the Workload Relief Application (PDF) for details.   Individuals eligible for these workload relief benefits include all full-time (code 102) faculty. To qualify for workload relief, the faculty member must be the parent primarily responsible for the care of a newborn child, newly adopted child, new foster care or guardianship placement, or newly-established legal custodial care. In all circumstances, only one (1) parent may be considered primarily responsible for the care of the child. If both parents could be eligible under this policy because they are both code 102 faculty, each such eligible faculty member could qualify sequentially for a half semester if the designation of primary responsible parent changed, but the total amount of workload relief would not increase.   Normally the first semester of workload relief will be the semester in which the temporary disability leave for childbirth is completed (see Faculty Handbook , p. 59), the semester in which the adoption, foster care or guardianship placement takes place, or the semester in which the birth takes place. If the primary caregiver taking workload relief is the non-birth parent, only the latter two (2) situations are relevant. If these events occur between semesters when classes are not in session, the first semester of the workload relief typically will be the following semester.   At least five (5) months before the start of the first semester of relief, a faculty member wishing to request workload relief for parenting under this plan should inform his or her department chair by filling out a Workload Relief application (PDF) , certifying that she/he is the primary caregiver and stating her/his intentions to take one (1) full semester or two (2) half semesters of relief. The application should be submitted to the person responsible at his/her school for processing the application as listed on the Workload Relief contact sheet. Details of the workload relief arrangement must be decided in consultation with the chair or dean in Schools without departmental organization. Tenure clock stoppage may be granted for cumulative maximum of two semesters during the probationary period to a faculty member who is the primary caregiver of a child whether or not the faculty member avails herself or himself of workload relief (see Faculty Handbook , p.60). The one full semester of relief or two half semesters of relief will count as credit toward a faculty member's sabbatical leave.   This policy is not intended to replace leave available to faculty members who are eligible for leave for the birth of a child, an adoption, or foster care placement under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\"FMLA\"). FMLA shall run concurrently with workload relief as either intermittent or reduced workload leave. An FMLA certification must be completed and submitted with the Workload Relief Application to determine FMLA eligibility. Eligible faculty members may still elect to take unpaid FMLA leave if they wish to provide no service while providing care for their newborn child, newly adopted child, or foster care or guardianship placement.        This policy does not constitute a contract of any kind and may be modified with or without notice at the University's discretion.

Saddle up \u00bb                               TIME'S UP! continues its disaster relief bike rides to the Rockaways to deliver food, blankets, bike-powered electrical stations, demolition assistance, distribution assistance, and free bike repair to neighborhoods devastated by hurricane Sandy.   Volunteers should bring their own bicycles and should be competent cyclists. (No need to be tour de france level; Time's Up members are all ages, all builds, all levels of ability. But you should be comfortable on the road.)   Logistics: Choose either of two meet-ups - at 9:00 at the Time's Up workshop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, or at 9:30 at the Occupy Sandy hub at 520 Clinton Avenue, Brooklyn (the Church of St. Luke and St. Matthew). There, we'll pick up food, medical supplies, and more, and then ride to the Rockaways.   From a distribution hub at Beach 96th St, we'll self-organize into work groups helping to drop off goods, redistribute supplies to home-ridden seniors, help with demolition and construction, and provide free bike repair and bicycle-generated electrical power. We'll bike back as a group, arriving to North Brooklyn by about 6:00.   Bring racks, panniers, bungie cords, and backpacks. Time's Up has a number of aluminium cargo trailers available for use; contact the group to arrange one beforehand, or arrive to the first meetup at 99 S 6th Street.

Workload relief is not considered a leave as faculty members are expected to make themselves available to the extent reasonable and practicable for their customary responsibilities of research, student consultation and advising.   The school in which the individual applying for workload relief is a faculty member shall remain financially responsible for the faculty member's salary during the workload relief period. Financial support for workload relief of classroom teaching, necessitated by having to hire appropriate replacements, is borne by a University workload relief fund. Please see the Workload Relief Application (PDF) for details.   Individuals eligible for these workload relief benefits include all full-time (code 102) faculty. To qualify for workload relief, the faculty member must be the parent primarily responsible for the care of a newborn child, newly adopted child, new foster care or guardianship placement, or newly-established legal custodial care. In all circumstances, only one (1) parent may be considered primarily responsible for the care of the child. If both parents could be eligible under this policy because they are both code 102 faculty, each such eligible faculty member could qualify sequentially for a half semester if the designation of primary responsible parent changed, but the total amount of workload relief would not increase.   Normally the first semester of workload relief will be the semester in which the temporary disability leave for childbirth is completed (see Faculty Handbook , p. 59), the semester in which the adoption, foster care or guardianship placement takes place, or the semester in which the birth takes place. If the primary caregiver taking workload relief is the non-birth parent, only the latter two (2) situations are relevant. If these events occur between semesters when classes are not in session, the first semester of the workload relief typically will be the following semester.   At least five (5) months before the start of the first semester of relief, a faculty member wishing to request workload relief for parenting under this plan should inform his or her department chair by filling out a Workload Relief application (PDF) , certifying that she/he is the primary caregiver and stating her/his intentions to take one (1) full semester or two (2) half semesters of relief. The application should be submitted to the person responsible at his/her school for processing the application as listed on the Workload Relief contact sheet. Details of the workload relief arrangement must be decided in consultation with the chair or dean in Schools without departmental organization. Tenure clock stoppage may be granted for cumulative maximum of two semesters during the probationary period to a faculty member who is the primary caregiver of a child whether or not the faculty member avails herself or himself of workload relief (see Faculty Handbook , p.60). The one full semester of relief or two half semesters of relief will count as credit toward a faculty member's sabbatical leave.   This policy is not intended to replace leave available to faculty members who are eligible for leave for the birth of a child, an adoption, or foster care placement under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\"FMLA\"). FMLA shall run concurrently with workload relief as either intermittent or reduced workload leave. An FMLA certification must be completed and submitted with the Workload Relief Application to determine FMLA eligibility. Eligible faculty members may still elect to take unpaid FMLA leave if they wish to provide no service while providing care for their newborn child, newly adopted child, or foster care or guardianship placement.        This policy does not constitute a contract of any kind and may be modified with or without notice at the University's discretion.

Volunteers should bring their own bicycles and should be competent cyclists. (No need to be tour de france level; Time's Up members are all ages, all builds, all levels of ability. But you should be comfortable on the road.)   Logistics: Choose either of two meet-ups - at 9:00 at the Time's Up workshop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, or at 9:30 at the Occupy Sandy hub at 520 Clinton Avenue, Brooklyn (the Church of St. Luke and St. Matthew). There, we'll pick up food, medical supplies, and more, and then ride to the Rockaways.   From a distribution hub at Beach 96th St, we'll self-organize into work groups helping to drop off goods, redistribute supplies to home-ridden seniors, help with demolition and construction, and provide free bike repair and bicycle-generated electrical power. We'll bike back as a group, arriving to North Brooklyn by about 6:00.   Bring racks, panniers, bungie cords, and backpacks. Time's Up has a number of aluminium cargo trailers available for use; contact the group to arrange one beforehand, or arrive to the first meetup at 99 S 6th Street.

Workload relief is not considered a leave as faculty members are expected to make themselves available to the extent reasonable and practicable for their customary responsibilities of research, student consultation and advising.    The faculty member's School shall remain financially responsible for the faculty member's salary during the workload relief period. Financial support for workload relief of classroom teaching, necessitated by having to hire appropriate replacements, is to be borne by a University workload relief fund. Please see the Workload Relief Form for details.    Download Workload Relief Form    Individuals eligible for workload relief benefits include all full-time (code 102) faculty. To qualify for workload relief, the faculty member must be the parent primarily responsible for the care of a newborn child, newly adopted child, new foster care or guardianship placement, or newly-established legal custodial care. In all circumstances, only one (1) parent may be considered primarily responsible for the care of the child. If both parents could be eligible under this policy because they are both code 102 faculty, each such eligible faculty member could qualify sequentially for a half semester if the designation of primary responsible parent changed, but the total amount of workload relief would not increase.    Normally the first semester of workload relief will be the semester in which the temporary disability leave for childbirth is completed (see Faculty Handbook, p. 53), the semester in which the adoption, foster care or guardianship placement takes place, or the semester in which the birth takes place. If the primary caregiver taking workload relief is the non-birth parent, only the latter two (2) situations are relevant. If these events occur between semesters when classes are not in session, the first semester of the workload relief typically will be the following semester.    In the case of childbirth, at least five (5) months before the start of the first semester of relief, a faculty member wishing to utilize workload relief for parenting under this plan should inform his or her Department Chair by filling out a Workload Relief Form, certifying that she/he is the primary caregiver and stating her/his intentions to take one (1) full semester or two (2) half semesters of relief. The form should be submitted to the person responsible at his/her School for processing the request as listed on the Workload Relief contact sheet. Details of the workload relief arrangement must be decided in consultation with the Department Chair or, in Schools without departmental organization, with the Dean. In the case of adoption, foster care or guardianship, the faculty member should alert the Department Chair or Dean as early as possible. Tenure clock stoppage will be granted for a cumulative maximum of two semesters during the probationary period to a faculty member who is the primary caregiver of a child whether or not the faculty member avails herself or himself of workload relief (see Faculty Handbook, p. 54). The one (1) full semester of relief or two half semesters of relief will count as credit toward a faculty member's sabbatical leave.    This policy is not intended to replace leave available to faculty members who are eligible for leave for the birth of a child, an adoption, or foster care placement under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\"FMLA\"). FMLA shall run concurrently with workload relief as either intermittent or reduced workload leave. An FMLA certification must be completed and submitted with the Workload Relief Form to determine FMLA eligibility. Eligible faculty members may still elect to take unpaid FMLA leave if they wish to provide no service while providing care for their newborn child, newly adopted child, or foster care or guardianship placement.    Tenure Clock Stoppage for Personal Reasons    Tenure clock stoppage may be granted automatically for a maximum of two semesters during the probationary period for any one of, or combination of, the following personal reasons:       Tenure clock stoppage may be authorized during a period of full service to faculty members who are primary caregivers of a child and to primary caregivers of a parent, a spouse, or a domestic partner in a health crisis of extended duration. A domestic partner qualifies if he or she is registered with the University for benefits purposes. \"Primary care\" means day-to-day responsibility for the care of a child, parent, spouse, or registered domestic partner for a substantial portion of the period. Tenure clock stoppage may be authorized to a faculty member who is granted one or more full semesters of leave for any one of, or combination of, illness/disability leave, maternity leave, or personal leave. Please see the application for stopping the tenure clock for Primary Caregivers at http://as.nyu.edu/object/aboutas.pp.forms.html     Tenure clock stoppage for up to two semesters will be granted automatically in the case of a parent primarily responsible for the care of a newborn child, newly adopted child, new foster care or guardianship placement, or newly-established legal custodial care, upon notification to the Chair of the Department or, in the case of Schools without departmental organization, the Dean. In other cases, a request for tenure clock stoppage normally will require advance approval by the dean and the Office of the Provost. Requests should be made as early as possible, and when feasible, approvals should be in place no later than the onset of the semester preceding the period of tenure clock stoppage.    Note: The granting of tenure clock stoppage does not influence granting of tenure in the future.
