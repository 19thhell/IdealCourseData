If you will be staying somewhere where you will receive free room and board, you need to provide a letter from who you are staying with indicating the amount of support they will provide for you and the duration of time you will stay with them. The in-kind value of room and board is estimated to be $10,000 per year.    An organizational sponsor, a copy of an award letter from a sponsoring organization specifying the amount of the award, its duration, and the terms of renewal, or  NYU funding, a copy of an NYU award letter for an NYU scholarship, assistantship, or fellowship.

Please note, F-1 regulations stipulate that only one online class may count towards full-time status in any fall or spring semester.                 Who is eligible            You are eligible to be part-time if:     it is your last semester before you graduate and you have fewer than 12 credits left to finish your degree.     it is your first semester in the U.S., and your department recommends English-language courses in addition to your studies.     you have a medical condition preventing you from being full-time.     If you have any other reason, please speak to an OGS advisor during our walk-in hours.            How to apply                Discuss your enrollment with your academic advisor.     Complete the part-time request form . The Fall 2015 request form will be available in mid-June. If you are a graduate student, first find out if your department considers fewer than 12 credits to be full-time enrollment (see below for more information).     If you experience difficulty with the online request form, first try opening the form in a new browser while signed into NYUHome. If the form still doesn't work, please take a screenshot of the information in the form and email it to ogs.records.update@nyu.edu .         Print the confirmation page for your records. You may be asked to present this form when visiting the OGS walk-in hours or when applying for on-campus employment.     If you are requesting to be part-time because of a medical condition, you must bring a letter from a licensed medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or licensed clinical psychologist to the OGS during walk-in advising hours before or after submitting your part-time request. This letter must     state your full name     recommend that you enroll less than full-time, or not at all, for a specific time period due to a medical condition         An OGS advisor will review your request form and notify you by email that your request has been approved or denied (or request more information if necessary) within 5 business days.            What happens if you don't get approved            You must register for a full-time course load. If you are enrolled on a part-time basis without OGS approval, you will lose the benefits of lawful student status and be unable to stay and study in the United States.          If your department considers fewer than 12 credits full-time enrollment            Graduate students registered for fewer than 12 credits are often considered to be doing the equivalent of full-time studies. This is called full-time equivalency and is something your academic department must evaluate and make a notation of in Albert. Once you get full-time equivalency from your department, you do NOT need to get approval to be part-time from the OGS.

The program is dedicated to training future leaders, endowing them with the skills and experience to advance reconciliation and coexistence for future generations.   The academic objective of Paths to Peace is to focus on the historical, political, cultural, and religious relationships between Israelis and Palestinians. All students in the program will be required to take two mandatory courses, together with NYU students, one on Israel and one on Palestine. They will also participate in two weekly workshops to be held on two separate days and to be conducted by experienced Palestinian and Israeli facilitators. Workshop participants will engage in an in-depth process of exploration, observation and analysis of the conflict and will have the opportunity to gain important insights into their identities as well as the dynamics of groups in conflict.   Students will be allowed to select up to two additional courses based on their own academic interests. These courses should be selected from the University's undergraduate college of Arts and Science or American Language Institute (if further English language training is required based on your level at the start of the program).   Program participants will attend off-campus excursions, such as visits to the UN Headquarters, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, and a weekend in Washington, DC. Each student is expected and required to participate fully in the program and to attend all classes and activities comprising the program. In the event that the University determines, in its sole discretion, that a student has failed to meet the required standard of participation, the student will be subject to immediate dismissal from the program and will be required to return to his/her country of origin.

Spring semester is from January 19 \u2013 May 17, 2016. Successful candidates are required to arrive on time for the start of the program and return home at the end of their semester at NYU.

Anticipate that all costs related to study at NYU will increase approximately 5% for the 2015-2016 academic year and every subsequent year. This increase may be reflected on the I-20 or DS-2019 you receive and therefore may not match precisely the amounts listed below. If you have questions about exact fees, check the NYU Bursar's Office website at www.nyu.edu/bursar .   Find your school at NYU in the column on the left. The columns to the right indicate the 2014-2015 full-time tuition of 24 credits (one academic year) plus service fees, estimated living expenses and health insurance. The total estimated expense plus any additional dependent expenses is what you must document for issuance of the I-20 or DS-2019. Full payment of tuition and fees is due upon registration for classes, which takes place in August/September for the fall semester and January for the spring semester.   Students must demonstrate that they have sufficient liquid assets to cover tuition and living expenses for at least one year of study.

Supporting documents may include but are not limited to:     Personal funds, a current financial statement, printed on letterhead and signed by a bank official, dated within six months.   A personal loan, a pre-approval letter confirming amount for which the loan is approved. A loan application is not sufficient.   An individual sponsor, the OGS Affidavit of Support plus a bank statement and/or letter from employer confirming annual salary and sponsor's position. (The sponsor's annual salary should be at least 3 times the amount of money they are providing to the student).   If you will be staying somewhere where you will receive free room and board, you need to provide a letter from who you are staying with indicating the amount of support they will provide for you and the duration of time you will stay with them. The in-kind value of room and board is estimated to be $10,000 per year.    An organizational sponsor, a copy of an award letter from a sponsoring organization specifying the amount of the award, its duration, and the terms of renewal, or  NYU funding, a copy of an NYU award letter for an NYU scholarship, assistantship, or fellowship.     All financial documentation must be in English or have certified English translations attached to the original and must be dated from within the last six months.     We don't accept income tax documents or personal property deeds such as ownership of property, a car, jewelry, etc. as evidence of acceptable financial documentation.

Please note, F-1 regulations stipulate that only one online class may count towards full-time status in any fall or spring semester.                 Who is eligible            You are eligible to be part-time if:     it is your last semester before you graduate and you have fewer than 12 credits left to finish your degree.     it is your first semester in the U.S., and your department recommends English-language courses in addition to your studies.     you have a medical condition preventing you from being full-time.     If you have any other reason, please speak to an OGS advisor during our walk-in hours.            How to apply                Discuss your enrollment with your academic advisor.     Complete the part-time request form . The Fall 2015 request form will be available in mid-June. If you are a graduate student, first find out if your department considers fewer than 12 credits to be full-time enrollment (see below for more information).     If you experience difficulty with the online request form, first try opening the form in a new browser while signed into NYUHome. If the form still doesn't work, please take a screenshot of the information in the form and email it to ogs.records.update@nyu.edu .         Print the confirmation page for your records. You may be asked to present this form when visiting the OGS walk-in hours or when applying for on-campus employment.     If you are requesting to be part-time because of a medical condition, you must bring a letter from a licensed medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or licensed clinical psychologist to the OGS during walk-in advising hours before or after submitting your part-time request. This letter must     state your full name     recommend that you enroll less than full-time, or not at all, for a specific time period due to a medical condition         An OGS advisor will review your request form and notify you by email that your request has been approved or denied (or request more information if necessary) within 5 business days.            What happens if you don't get approved            You must register for a full-time course load. If you are enrolled on a part-time basis without OGS approval, you will lose the benefits of lawful student status and be unable to stay and study in the United States.          If your department considers fewer than 12 credits full-time enrollment            Graduate students registered for fewer than 12 credits are often considered to be doing the equivalent of full-time studies. This is called full-time equivalency and is something your academic department must evaluate and make a notation of in Albert. Once you get full-time equivalency from your department, you do NOT need to get approval to be part-time from the OGS.

The program is dedicated to training future leaders, endowing them with the skills and experience to advance reconciliation and coexistence for future generations.   The academic objective of Paths to Peace is to focus on the historical, political, cultural, and religious relationships between Israelis and Palestinians. All students in the program will be required to take two mandatory courses, together with NYU students, one on Israel and one on Palestine. They will also participate in two weekly workshops to be held on two separate days and to be conducted by experienced Palestinian and Israeli facilitators. Workshop participants will engage in an in-depth process of exploration, observation and analysis of the conflict and will have the opportunity to gain important insights into their identities as well as the dynamics of groups in conflict.   Students will be allowed to select up to two additional courses based on their own academic interests. These courses should be selected from the University's undergraduate college of Arts and Science or American Language Institute (if further English language training is required based on your level at the start of the program).   Program participants will attend off-campus excursions, such as visits to the UN Headquarters, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, and a weekend in Washington, DC. Each student is expected and required to participate fully in the program and to attend all classes and activities comprising the program. In the event that the University determines, in its sole discretion, that a student has failed to meet the required standard of participation, the student will be subject to immediate dismissal from the program and will be required to return to his/her country of origin.
