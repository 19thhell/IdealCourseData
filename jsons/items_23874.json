Using techniques favored by many artists of the 18th century, Cottam excerpts images taken from the headlines or news snippets, and converts them into riveting and intense studies. Delicately rendered in white crayon against a blue page, they are silky threads of memory. Recording moments of journalism, depicting pieces of people, bodies, and the residual effects of mindless, senseless killing, Cottam draws what is reported on the news. The raw contrast between the pathos of a dead child\u2019s body, and the delicacy of his drawing, speaks to Cottam\u2019s intuitive sense of the historical and tragic record of a life, depicted on a paper so thin that it can fly away, like the soul of the tiny body that lies before us.          Working with images of war, much like Goya, Cottam draws and then scrapes back his images, creating and destroying a layered surface. As a result, many of the drawings have a transparent quality, because of the shimmering white crayon against thinned blue paper. The metalpoint that he uses to scrape away the surface also adds polish and sheen to the skinned paper, and mineral spirits added to the crayon create areas of wash. The technique is about layering and destruction, using methods that reflect an inherent need to remove the creation from its support. Choosing a paper renowned for its luxury, Cottam works on Smythson Featherweight stationery, laid and watermarked, with a soft dove gray-sapphire color. The sheets serve as blue skies to vapors of imagination, with cloud-like and fleeting images.

This series of paintings emerged from his experience of language, and its permutations, as the artist experienced harsh words in common parlance, called out loud on streets among friends and strangers every day in public and private in the City.       Each small painting has the same dimensions. The panel depths vary, implying the hurt of the words, how deeply they penetrate as they are uttered. Contained on the handcrafted wooden panel is a single word, appearing in the top register of a two-color field, lovingly painted with stencil.

The first light in the night sky, it is often seen low on the horizon just after sunset. Ericsson plays with the subsequent interpretation of Lucifer as the favored angel who falls from grace, becoming identified with forces of darkness. In these photograms, Lucifer brings light to the paper, revealing a woman&rsquo;s form, fashioning her contours against glossy black.            Playing with light and dark, edges and shadows, Ericsson manipulates both muse and medium to create a sensuous and luminous image.

Using a different medium each time, sometimes paint, sometimes egg, sometimes pigment and oils, she circulates images into a basin of water, dropping viscous liquids into a receptive tray filled with water, coloring the movement and ripples on the surface, with these intense and delicious substances. At times they are suspended like a meniscus on the surface, at times they form shapes, and then dissolve, trailing tails behind.       The movement of the artist's hand over the water, her gesture, is recorded in the three poetic series of polaroids.

Tender  reflections of majestic landscapes, made on site as he traveled through Norway's fjords and   mountains, many of the small works later inspired larger paintings and drawings when he   returned to his studio. They convey his immediate responses to Norwegian landscape. His own   words describe his impressions:     1991. Lofoten, an archipelago within the Artic Circle, mountainous islands reach out into the Norwegian Sea. In late May the &ldquo;midnight sun&rdquo; floats along the horizon. Dusk becomes dawn; one day runs into the next. I was working with pastels using my fingers to grind pigment into pigment. This physical act extends my being directly into the paper. The work is not driven by conscious thought, rather by a series of sensations and the rhythm of my hands responding to the moment.

In his film Dreamsequence , women are posed in diferent rooms that suggest a dramatic stage set. One kneels on the floor in an empty room filling with balloons that drop randomly from the ceiling, and later sits in a chair, lifting her face to a shower of golden glitter raining down upon her skin. The other perches on a chair in a bay window, naked except for the paint on her face, and the tulle enveloping her lower limbs. She moves without speaking, holding a bird in a cage. In the close ups of their faces shown here, they appear as though they are remembered from a dream.

Animals inhabit an interior and domestic landscape, coming to life and interacting with their environment. A group of branches in a vase waves cautiously as if bent by wind toward an unseen place, breaking into pieces and wispy fragments for no apparent reason. A slipcover begins to growl as if ready for attack. A hidden dragon slithers to life in the folds of a drapery, leaving fire in its wake. An archer shoots at a trophy stag from the      comfort of his decorative pose on an ovoid telephone table. A flock of birds twitter against      the back of a sofa. A living room is submerged in standing water, colorless, and linear. A      blue mattress, its coils exposed, floats away on an ocean of coiled lines. The images form a     personal narrative of disquiet.

As an immigrant to the United States from Korea in 1996, his continued fascination with these interactions has led him to create an art practice that embraces sculpture and installation to create interactive spaces. Working in both large-scale monumental sculpture and intimate conceptual pieces, he brings sensitivity and power to his work. Because he wants to break through the confining divisions between audience and artist, he asks a wide range of participants to bring their own concerns to transform his pieces.

This exhibition of horse      drawings spans two important dates connected to the imagery of Irish painter Timothy Hawkesworth: 1 February 2014      marks the beginning of the Year of the Horse, the seventh sign of the Chinese zodiac and an auspicious year recognizing      the power and primal nature of the horse. The end date of the exhibition, 17 March marks Saint Patrick\u2019s Day, named    for the patron saint of Ireland, where Timothy Hawkesworth grew up on a farm and began his relationship with horses.       Hawkesworth\u2019s horses are energetic and rapidly drawn with graphite over wax and paint on paper, moving from right to left, galloping, rearing, and walking with heads bowed, raised or thrown back in restless movement. Evoking the animal nature with figurative representations, like Susan Rothenberg\u2019s horses from the 1970s, Hawkesworth infuses a personal vision in these drawings, and taps into a source of infinite fascination: domesticated animals that retain a wild and untamed spirit.

Duke House. In this body of work Smith engages themes of transience and permanence, movement and color, nature and displacement.       Taking elements of color and bubbles from his ongoing &quot;Painter Project,&quot; Smith transforms them, draping them over the railings of staircases, suspending them from the skylights and floating them across the floor toward the viewer. Using techniques attuned classic films like as director Carol Reed&rsquo;s &ldquo;Odd Man Out (1947, Two Cities film), Jean-Luc Godard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Two or Three Things I Know About Her,&rdquo; (1967, Argos Films), or Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s 1976 classic, &ldquo;Taxi Driver,&rdquo; Smith hones in on the bubbles floating in front of the camera as visual metaphors for the transience of life, the fragility of the moment.

The transformation of the text of James Ferguson's Astronomy Explained upon Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s Principles (1799) began in response to a Victorian astronomy book entitled Flowers of the Sky in the archive of the John Work Garrett Library at Johns Hopkins University.      As the artist describes, the fluid yet tenuous painting on the book pages is analogous to a fragile web or distant constellation. For Smith, flowers are symbols of our selves and of nature, as well as a metaphor for the machinations of the universe. Implicitly, book folios serve as multivalent supports for the painted leaves and flowers that adorn them with color and design imposed over printed words.

Using techniques favored by many artists of the 18th century, Cottam excerpts images taken from the headlines or news snippets, and converts them into riveting and intense studies. Delicately rendered in white crayon against a blue page, they are silky threads of memory. Recording moments of journalism, depicting pieces of people, bodies, and the residual effects of mindless, senseless killing, Cottam draws what is reported on the news. The raw contrast between the pathos of a dead child\u2019s body, and the delicacy of his drawing, speaks to Cottam\u2019s intuitive sense of the historical and tragic record of a life, depicted on a paper so thin that it can fly away, like the soul of the tiny body that lies before us.          Working with images of war, much like Goya, Cottam draws and then scrapes back his images, creating and destroying a layered surface. As a result, many of the drawings have a transparent quality, because of the shimmering white crayon against thinned blue paper. The metalpoint that he uses to scrape away the surface also adds polish and sheen to the skinned paper, and mineral spirits added to the crayon create areas of wash. The technique is about layering and destruction, using methods that reflect an inherent need to remove the creation from its support. Choosing a paper renowned for its luxury, Cottam works on Smythson Featherweight stationery, laid and watermarked, with a soft dove gray-sapphire color. The sheets serve as blue skies to vapors of imagination, with cloud-like and fleeting images.

This series of paintings emerged from his experience of language, and its permutations, as the artist experienced harsh words in common parlance, called out loud on streets among friends and strangers every day in public and private in the City.       Each small painting has the same dimensions. The panel depths vary, implying the hurt of the words, how deeply they penetrate as they are uttered. Contained on the handcrafted wooden panel is a single word, appearing in the top register of a two-color field, lovingly painted with stencil.

The first light in the night sky, it is often seen low on the horizon just after sunset. Ericsson plays with the subsequent interpretation of Lucifer as the favored angel who falls from grace, becoming identified with forces of darkness. In these photograms, Lucifer brings light to the paper, revealing a woman&rsquo;s form, fashioning her contours against glossy black.            Playing with light and dark, edges and shadows, Ericsson manipulates both muse and medium to create a sensuous and luminous image.

Using a different medium each time, sometimes paint, sometimes egg, sometimes pigment and oils, she circulates images into a basin of water, dropping viscous liquids into a receptive tray filled with water, coloring the movement and ripples on the surface, with these intense and delicious substances. At times they are suspended like a meniscus on the surface, at times they form shapes, and then dissolve, trailing tails behind.       The movement of the artist's hand over the water, her gesture, is recorded in the three poetic series of polaroids.

Tender  reflections of majestic landscapes, made on site as he traveled through Norway's fjords and   mountains, many of the small works later inspired larger paintings and drawings when he   returned to his studio. They convey his immediate responses to Norwegian landscape. His own   words describe his impressions:     1991. Lofoten, an archipelago within the Artic Circle, mountainous islands reach out into the Norwegian Sea. In late May the &ldquo;midnight sun&rdquo; floats along the horizon. Dusk becomes dawn; one day runs into the next. I was working with pastels using my fingers to grind pigment into pigment. This physical act extends my being directly into the paper. The work is not driven by conscious thought, rather by a series of sensations and the rhythm of my hands responding to the moment.

In his film Dreamsequence , women are posed in diferent rooms that suggest a dramatic stage set. One kneels on the floor in an empty room filling with balloons that drop randomly from the ceiling, and later sits in a chair, lifting her face to a shower of golden glitter raining down upon her skin. The other perches on a chair in a bay window, naked except for the paint on her face, and the tulle enveloping her lower limbs. She moves without speaking, holding a bird in a cage. In the close ups of their faces shown here, they appear as though they are remembered from a dream.

Animals inhabit an interior and domestic landscape, coming to life and interacting with their environment. A group of branches in a vase waves cautiously as if bent by wind toward an unseen place, breaking into pieces and wispy fragments for no apparent reason. A slipcover begins to growl as if ready for attack. A hidden dragon slithers to life in the folds of a drapery, leaving fire in its wake. An archer shoots at a trophy stag from the      comfort of his decorative pose on an ovoid telephone table. A flock of birds twitter against      the back of a sofa. A living room is submerged in standing water, colorless, and linear. A      blue mattress, its coils exposed, floats away on an ocean of coiled lines. The images form a     personal narrative of disquiet.

As an immigrant to the United States from Korea in 1996, his continued fascination with these interactions has led him to create an art practice that embraces sculpture and installation to create interactive spaces. Working in both large-scale monumental sculpture and intimate conceptual pieces, he brings sensitivity and power to his work. Because he wants to break through the confining divisions between audience and artist, he asks a wide range of participants to bring their own concerns to transform his pieces.

This exhibition of horse      drawings spans two important dates connected to the imagery of Irish painter Timothy Hawkesworth: 1 February 2014      marks the beginning of the Year of the Horse, the seventh sign of the Chinese zodiac and an auspicious year recognizing      the power and primal nature of the horse. The end date of the exhibition, 17 March marks Saint Patrick\u2019s Day, named    for the patron saint of Ireland, where Timothy Hawkesworth grew up on a farm and began his relationship with horses.       Hawkesworth\u2019s horses are energetic and rapidly drawn with graphite over wax and paint on paper, moving from right to left, galloping, rearing, and walking with heads bowed, raised or thrown back in restless movement. Evoking the animal nature with figurative representations, like Susan Rothenberg\u2019s horses from the 1970s, Hawkesworth infuses a personal vision in these drawings, and taps into a source of infinite fascination: domesticated animals that retain a wild and untamed spirit.

Duke House. In this body of work Smith engages themes of transience and permanence, movement and color, nature and displacement.       Taking elements of color and bubbles from his ongoing &quot;Painter Project,&quot; Smith transforms them, draping them over the railings of staircases, suspending them from the skylights and floating them across the floor toward the viewer. Using techniques attuned classic films like as director Carol Reed&rsquo;s &ldquo;Odd Man Out (1947, Two Cities film), Jean-Luc Godard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Two or Three Things I Know About Her,&rdquo; (1967, Argos Films), or Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s 1976 classic, &ldquo;Taxi Driver,&rdquo; Smith hones in on the bubbles floating in front of the camera as visual metaphors for the transience of life, the fragility of the moment.

The transformation of the text of James Ferguson's Astronomy Explained upon Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s Principles (1799) began in response to a Victorian astronomy book entitled Flowers of the Sky in the archive of the John Work Garrett Library at Johns Hopkins University.      As the artist describes, the fluid yet tenuous painting on the book pages is analogous to a fragile web or distant constellation. For Smith, flowers are symbols of our selves and of nature, as well as a metaphor for the machinations of the universe. Implicitly, book folios serve as multivalent supports for the painted leaves and flowers that adorn them with color and design imposed over printed words.

Program description: The course is a survey that examines contemporary issues in the exhibition and display of art and material culture. The theory that underpins practice is considered within thematic groups: art world ecosystems; typologies and frameworks for exhibition making; curatorial roles; interpretation; authenticity, and identity; establishing value; and spectacle. Examples are drawn from an international selection of museums, galleries, periodic exhibitions, and heritage sites. The discussion framework includes the physical and conceptual contexts, motivations, and educational goals that shape interpretation and presentation. There are lecture/ discussions, site visits and guest speakers.    Academics: Students develop an interdisciplinary approach to connecting historical precedents with current examples of mainstream and alternative strategies of display. Analysis and critique of exhibitions and how they relate to the issues is the main methodology for course discussions and assignments. Students become familiar with advanced theories and approaches to formulate valid, broad-based critique and evaluation. There are readings, oral and written reports, and a final paper. Enrollment is limited to 15 students.    Background: London is at its peak as an international center for art and heritage activity. Generous government funding over the last ten years has generated an unprecedented building and renovation boom in museums, accompanied by innovative programming and educational outreach. This has coalesced with the supercharged global art market to make the city an exciting, multifaceted venue for this study. Possible site visits include Sir John Soane's Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tate Modern, the British Museum, the Serpentine Gallery, the Institute of Contemporary Arts and a for-profit contemporary art gallery.
