The aim of Soil for the Air is to use the power of the crowd and the enthusiasm of citizen scientists to rally around an important cause &#8211; climate change mitigation &#8211; and to break down the wall between institutionalized science and the general public. In the process, the project hopes to make an important discovery about using agricultural soils to remove carbon from the air and store it below ground in healthy soils.
