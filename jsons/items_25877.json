Community Outreach Program     The NYCFC launched its\u00a0 Community Outreach Program \u00a0to promote health in at-risk populations that suffer from poor access to healthcare. This community outreach initiative allows the clinic to perform large-scale screenings that address the health needs of a more diverse patient population than would be possible at the clinic itself.                       Institute for Family Health       The Institute for Family Health is the primary clinical partner of the NYCFC.
