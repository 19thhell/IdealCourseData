As diverse a city New York is so are the offerings in the NYC school system. Some public schools offer special programs and small environments that are similar to private schools while other schools are bustling with crowded classrooms.   Like other communities across the country, children are typically assigned to schools based on their home address. These schools, known as zoned schools, serve all children in the designated catchment area. You can find your zoned school on the NYC Department of Education's website .   The quality and tone of zoned schools vary widely. However, during the elementary school years, the majority of families are comfortable with their children attending their zoned neighborhood school. Some families however seek other options and have their children evaluated for public gifted and talented programs, identify bi-lingual or dual language programs, or consider charter schools in their neighborhoods or elsewhere.     Elementary School   Elementary schools typically house grades Pre-K to 5 or Pre-K to 6th grade. Traditional middle schools (also referred to as Intermediate Schools, Junior High Schools) house children in grades 6-8 and high schools serve student in 9th through 12th grade. There are however both well-established and new schools that are structured differently and serve children in grades K-8, 6-12, K-12; one school on the Upper West Side offers a successful program educating students in 5th to 8th grade.     Middle and High School   At the middle school level, school choice is much more prevalent with students applying to schools within their home school district or in other districts. The choice process brings with it an admission process that is varied. Some schools invest hours to meet with student candidates and administer and review locally developed assessment tests while others accept students based on a review of the school documents.     Gifted and Talented Programs   There are many schools throughout the city that offer gifted and talented programs with one or more classes per grade for identified gifted and talented students. In addition, there are a handful of schools which are dedicated entirely to serving gifted and talented students.     Bi-Lingual/Dual Language Schools   Dual Language programs in NYC public schools teach children the usual curriculum in English as well as in a second language. Dual language programs are available in Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Korean, Haitian Creole or French. Your child can be a native English speaker or an English Language Learner (ELL) to enroll in a dual language program. Most programs do some type of screening to be sure that a dual language program will be an appropriate fit for your child. You should contact schools you are interested in to find out whether they accept students who are not zoned for that school.     Charter Schools   Charter schools operate as independent and autonomous public schools and typically rely on an active parent body. They are awarded a &quot;charter&quot; and are operated according to an approved plan that outlines how they will function pedagogically, administratively, and fiscally. In NYC charter schools are newly established schools and in some cases existing schools that convert to charter status.   Charter schools receive some funding from federal, state and public local funds, and typically must raise additional funds from individuals, foundations, and the private sector. A charter school must comply with all laws regulating public schools therefore any student that is eligible to attend a public school is also qualified for admission to a charter school. A school's charter and their autonomy is dependent upon their meeting educational performance standards, and maintaining sound fiscal and management practices. Charter schools are subject to oversight by the NYC Chancellor.     Public School Assistance within the Greater NY Metro Area   Carebridge Life Resources , NYU's Employee Assistance Program, is available by phone (800-437-0911) to assist you in gaining a better understanding of schools in your home community or a community in which you are planning to move.

The birthday cutoff for school registration is December 31. Therefore, students are eligible to apply for Kindergarten during the year of they turn 5 years old and Pre-K the year they turn 4 years old.   Public Kindergarten in NYC is offered for a full school day (typically 8:40 a.m.-2:50 p.m.). Kindergarten attendance is optional in NYC, however, if desired, children of NYC residents are guaranteed enrollment in a local public school beginning in Kindergarten. Children must enroll in school by the First Grade.   Like other communities across the country, children are typically assigned to schools based on their home address. These schools, known as \u201czoned schools,\u201d serve all children in a designated geographical catchment area. You can find your zoned school on the NYC Department of Education's website or by contacting NYC's Information Line, 311.   There are more than 700 public elementary schools, including 140 K-8 programs in NYC. During the elementary school years, the majority of families are comfortable with their children attending their zoned neighborhood school. Some families however seek other options and have their children evaluated for public gifted and talented programs , identify bi-lingual or dual language programs , or consider charter schools in their home neighborhood or elsewhere.   Evaluating Elementary School For Your Child   As you consider the variety of education options in NYC, it is important that you visit your local zoned school to get to know the school where your child is guaranteed a seat. Be reflective as you consider what is most important to you. No school will have every quality you want, but if you know what matters most to you, you will find an educational option where your child can thrive.     How does your child\u2019s nursery school teacher or Director describe your child in a classroom setting? What are their suggestions for schools or classrooms?   Does your child prefer activities regulated by the teacher? Or the students?   Does she enjoy structure in her day? Does he work best when the expectations are clearly outlined and defined? Does your child enjoy open-ended activities? Does she enjoy being challenged?   Does he prefer to work alone? Does she thrive when working in collaborative group projects?   Could she benefit from a classroom where different learning styles and abilities are mixed in one classroom? Would she thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities?   Are you comfortable with the educational philosophy, pedagogy, and curriculum offered by the school? What is the school\u2019s philosophy on homework?   Are the classrooms diverse and comprised of students with different learning styles and abilities? Are children tracked by ability? Where would your child thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities or a mixed group? Are you more comfortable within homogeneous or heterogeneous groupings?   Would your child feel most comfortable in a small school setting? A larger K-8th grade school? Or just elementary school students? How do the younger students interact with the older students in the school?   What are the facilities like and how important are they to you? Is the outdoor space within the school, or must students walk a distance to a park?   Can you and your child handle commuting by bus or train to school? Or is a school within walking distance preferred?   Are there opportunities for your child to explore sports, arts, drama, and music? Are there science labs? Is there a library in the classroom and/or one serving the whole school?   Does the school take advantage of the public library and other community resources?   How involved are parents in the school? In what kinds of activities are they engaged?
