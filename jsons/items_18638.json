Business analytics unlocks the predictive potential of data analysis to improve financial performance, strategic management, and operational efficiency.     Gain a Competitive Advantage  Graduates will be equipped to influence decision-making, strategy and ultimately drive better business results by gaining the ability to transform data into a powerful and predictive strategic asset. Business Analytics is critical in preparing organizations to solve 21st-century business challenges and participants of this program will have exposure to innovative methodologies that support data driven decision making.     What Differentiates this Program?     APPROACH: The NYU Stern Master of Science in Business Analytics, an advanced business degree program, teaches students both to understand the role of evidence-based data in decision making and to leverage data as a strategic asset. The program is designed for experienced professionals interested in gaining competitive advantage through the predictive potential of data.     FORMAT: The Master of Science in Business Analytics program is a one year long, part-time program divided into five on-site class sessions (modules) at NYU Stern in New York and other rotating global locations. This part-time format reduces the absence from the office to approximately 5 weeks over the course of the year. Between modules, students complete an average of 20-25 hours per week of work via distance learning. For more information on the format, please click here .     NETWORK: Participants have the opportunity to cross-learn and share best practices among their cohort and through their exposure to top faculty and business leaders in the growing field of Business Analytics. With a degree from New York University, graduates will join NYU\u2019s extensive global alumni network.     APPLICATION: The culmination of the program is the Business Analytics Capstone, which gives students an opportunity to apply the learnings of the program by presenting a unified and practical case on a topic of their choosing. This is a team based project with approximately 4-5 students per group.     NYU STERN: New York City is one of the world's great financial and business capitals, and NYU Stern is in the middle of it all. Close to Wall Street, located in the heart of Greenwich Village, NYU Stern is one of the world's leading research institutions. Academic excellence is always a top priority at NYU Stern.

Please note that this     process can take several weeks. We cannot guarantee a decision     date; you will be contacted by the Graduate School when an     admission decision has been made on your application. If you     have any questions and concerns regarding your application,     please contact the Math Department at admissions@math.nyu.edu .                The Program      The master's degree in mathematics     encompasses the basic graduate curriculum in mathematics, and     also offers the opportunity of some more specialized training     in an area of interest. A typical     master's program will involve basic courses in real analysis,     complex analysis and linear algebra, followed by other     fundamental courses such as probability, scientific computing,     and differential equations. Depending       on their mathematical interests, students will then be able to     take more advanced graduate courses in pure and applied     mathematics.        Information about admission on a non-degree basis is HERE .                 Degree Requirements           A candidate for the master's degree in mathematics must     fulfill the following departmental requirements:           36 points of credit, and the grade of at least B in the     written comprehensive examinations, or,      32 points of credit, and a master's thesis, completed     under the supervision of a faculty member and approved by     the department.           Under both options, students may be able to transfer up to 8     points of credit (usually equivalent to two CIMS courses) from     other academic institutions.           Coursework           Students are required to take     eight courses (24 credits) from the list below.       All four courses in Group I, two courses from Group II,     and two additional courses from Group II or Group III must be     taken. Substitute courses are     listed at the end.                Group I      (Mandatory Preparation)           MATH-GA       1410 Introduction to Math Analysis I (fall)      MATH-GA       2450 Complex Variables I (fall)      MATH-GA       2110 Linear Algebra I (fall, spring, and possibly    summer)      MATH-GA       1002 Multivariable Analysis (spring)               Group     II (Fundamentals)           MATH-GA       1420 Introduction to Math Analysis II (spring)      MATH-GA       2460 Complex Variables II (spring)      MATH-GA       2120 Linear Algebra II (spring)      MATH-GA       2901 Basic Probability (fall, spring, summer)      MATH-GA       2043 Scientific Computing (fall, spring)      MATH-GA       2470 Ordinary Differential Equations (spring)                Group III (more advanced core graduate     courses)           MATH-GA       2010 Numerical Methods I (fall)      MATH-GA       2020 Numerical Methods II (spring)      MATH-GA       2130 Algebra I (fall)      MATH-GA       2310 Topology I (fall)      MATH-GA       2210 Number Theory (spring)      MATH-GA       2350 Differential Geometry I (fall)      MATH-GA 2490       Partial Differential Equations (fall)      MATH-GA       2701 Methods of Applied Math (fall)      MATH-GA       2702 Fluid Dynamics (fall)      MATH-GA       2550 Functional Analysis (spring)      MATH-GA       2563 Harmonic Analysis (fall)      MATH-GA       2911 Probability: Limit Theorems I (fall)      MATH-GA       2902 Stochastic Calculus (fall, spring and summer)      MATH-GA       2962 Mathematical Statistics (spring)                or:    DS-GA 1002 Statistical and Mathematical Methods (fall)           Substitutes      MATH-GA       2430  Real Variables     (one-term) is a substitute for MATH-GA 1410       and 1420 Introduction to Math Analysis I and II.      MATH-GA       2451 Complex Variables (one-term) is a substitute for MATH-GA 2450       and 2460 Complex Variables I and II.      MATH-GA       2111 Linear Algebra (one-term) is a substitute for MATH-GA 2110       and 2120 Linear Algebra I and II.      A substitute one-term course may     be taken after the first term of its equivalent two-term     course, but may not be taken after the equivalent two-term     sequence is completed. Resolution of conflicts will require     the approval of the Director of Graduate Studies. Only the credits of the completed     courses will count toward the degree.      Please note that master's and     non-degree students in their first year of study are generally     not permitted to register for any Advanced Topics     courses. In further semesters, students are allowed to     register for such courses with permission of both the course     instructor and the Director of Graduate Studies for the M.S.     Program.                The Written Comprehensive Examinations      Students choosing the first option,      must pass, with the grade of B, the three-part Written     Comprehensive Examination administered by the Department twice     a year, in early September and early January. Most master's     students tend to take exam toward the end of their graduate     studies.           Students are permitted to take the written examinations     twice, with no special permission. A third and final     attempt may be granted by the Department on a case-by-case     basis.           The examinations, in advanced calculus, complex variables     and linear algebra, may include some of the following     material:      Advanced Calculus: Real numbers. Functions of one     variable: continuity, mean-value, differentiability, maxima     and minima, integrals, fundamental theorem of calculus,     inequalities, estimation of sums and integrals, elementary     functions and their power series. Funtions of several     variables: partial derivatives, chain rule, MacLaurin     expansion, critical points, Lagrange multipliers, inverse and     implicit function theorems, jacobian, divergence and curl,     theorems of Green and Stokes.      Complex Variables: Complex numbers, analytical    functions, Cauchy-Riemann equations, Cauchy's integral and    applications, power series, maximum principle, Liouville's    theorem, elementary functions and their conformal maps, bilinear    transformation, classification of singularities, residue theorem    and contour integration, Laurent series, Rouche's theorem,    number of zeros and poles.      Linear Algebra: Vector spaces, linear dependence,     basis, dimension, linear transformation, inner product,     systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, ranks,     eigenvalues, diagonalization of matrices, quadratics forms,     symmetric and orthogonal transformations.      Cooperative preparation is encouraged, as it is for all     examinations. Students may also find the following books     helpful:      Buck, Advanced Calculus ; Courant and John, Introduction to       Calculus and Analysis ; Strang, Linear Algebra ;     Churchill, Complex Variables and Applications .           Master's Thesis      Students choosing the second option will work on a master's     thesis under the supervision of a mathematics faculty member     acting as their thesis advisor. In certain cases involving     interdisciplinary research, a second advisor outside the     Department of Mathematics may be approved by the Director of     Graduate Studies. A proposal outlining the program for the     thesis will be submitted to the Director of Graduate Studies     for approval. Upon completion, a master's thesis must be     approved by the thesis advisor and a second reader of his/her     choice.           Applying for the Ph.D. program     Continuing M.S. students who wish to apply for the Ph.D. program    must first earn the grade of A on the Written Comprehensive    Examinations. As part of the application process, such    students will also be required to prepare and give a    presentation on a mathematical topic to a specially appointed    faculty committee. Ideally, the presentation should take    place during the semester in which the written examinations were    passed. Please note that earning the grade of A in the    written examinations and giving the scientific presentation do    not constitute in themselves an offer of admission to the Ph.D.    program.                Academic Standards      To continue registering for courses in the Department of     Mathematics, a student must be in a good academic standing,     fulfilling the following requirements:           Students must maintain an average of B or better (3.0) in     their first 12 credits. Students failing to achieve this     will not be permitted to continue in the program. Students     cannot obtain an M.S. degree unless they have maintained an     overall average of at least B           Students will be allowed no more than four no-credit     grades, withdrawals, or unresolved incomplete grades during     their academic tenure, and no more than two such grades in     the first six courses for which they have registered.
