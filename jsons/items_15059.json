Our accelerated, dual degree programs allow students to complete a   Master's in less time and at a lower cost than is normally required.   Students in these programs begin graduate coursework while still in CAS   and then apply that coursework towards designated Master's programs in   NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science , Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public  Service , and Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development .
