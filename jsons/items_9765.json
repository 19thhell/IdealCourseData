McCue, MD   We are accepting applications for 2015-2016 starting May 1, 2014   Click here for application information   About the Program   The NYU Department of Psychiatry offers a one-year ACGME-accredited Geriatric Psychiatry Fellowship whose mission is to produce clinical and academic leaders in geriatric psychiatry and to prepare fellows for board certification in the subspecialty of geriatric psychiatry. The program is closely integrated with the ACGME-accredited fellowship in geriatric medicine. Fellows are exposed to a complete spectrum of clinical and academic experiences in geriatric psychiatry, geriatrics, and gerontology. In addi\u00adtion to acquiring expertise in using pharmaco\u00adtherapy and psychosocial interventions to treat elderly patients with late-life mental disorders, fellows gain experience in understanding their elderly patients in relation to their families and environment. Fellows, under the supervision of faculty, function as the team leaders in all set\u00adtings with supervisory responsibility for resi\u00addents, medical students, and professional members of the multidisciplinary treatment team. Fel\u00adlows have the opportunity to assess and treat patients in multiple settings (inpatient, outpatient, consultation-liaison, and nursing home) and gain experience with all modalities of treatment during the course of their fellowship year. Finally, fellows have the opportunity to work with mentors in developing research projects and aca\u00addemic pursuits.   Clinical Rotations   Pearl I. Barlow Center for Memory Evaluation and Treatment Clinical Supervisor: James E. Galvin, MD, MPH   The main training site is the Pearl Barlow Center for Memory Evaluation and Treatment with additional educational experiences at the Parkinson and Movement Disorders Center. Training focuses on the assessment of the elderly patient with primary complaints of cognitive impairment. As part of this training, the fellow becomes certified in use of the Clinical Dementia Rating scale and receives training in neuropsychological assessment. The fellow has the opportunity to follow patients throughout the year and, with supervision, manage their cognitive and psychiatric problems with both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. The fellow works with patients\u2019 families and caregivers through supervised participation in family and group psychotherapy. Additional training is provided in the medical and psychosocial assessment of elderly patients with movement disorders at the Parkinson and Movement Disorders Center. The fellow is also trained in the fundamentals of large-scale research projects through involvement in the research studies conducted by faculty in the Center on Brain Aging.   Coler-Carter Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility Clinical Supervisor: Ravindra Amin, MD   The Coler campus of Coler-Carter Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility consists of over 800 long-term care and over 90 long-term acute care beds. It is the primary provider of long term care to the indigent population of New York City, with majority of the referrals coming from public acute care facilities. The fellow is trained in supervised consultations of nursing home residents. Additionally, there are weekly interdisciplinary case conferences about nursing home residents with challenging psychiatric and behavioral problems. These often involve the patient\u2019s family.   Bellevue Geriatric Medicine Clinic Clinical Supervisors: Sheena Chenthitta, MD; David Sutin, MD   The Bellevue Geriatric Clinic is the primary source for medical care of outpatients aged 65 years and older. The patient population is representative of Bellevue Hospital Center. It serves a very diverse medically underserved population, including a high proportion of immigrants. The fellow has an educational experience doing supervised psychiatric consultations on Clinic patients, and follows patients longitudinally over the course of the year. Additionally, there is a weekly Geriatric Psychiatry-Geriatric Medicine Case Conference.   Bellevue Geriatric Psychiatry Unit Clinical Supervisor: Dennis Popeo, MD   The unit has 28 beds and specializes in the acute psychiatric problems of elderly patients. Patients have a wide variety of diagnoses including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, personality disorders, and dementing disorders. Patients often have co-occurring substance abuse and medical and neurologic illnesses. Therapeutic programming addresses memory skills and coping skills related to the challenges of aging. Under supervision, the fellows gain expertise in the assessment and treatment of these complex patients. There is the opportunity to participate in a weekly consultation with a senior psychopharmacologist and attend the weekly Clinical Case Conference of the Bellevue Psychiatry Inpatient Service.   NYU Behavioral Health Program Clinical Supervisor: Patrick Ying, MD   The Behavioral Health Program, the major outpatient psychiatry service at NYU Langone Medical Center, provides expert yet affordable treatment to individuals suffering from a broad range of mental disorders or emotional problems, including a large number of elderly patients. The fellow will be part of a team of offering the most up-to-date and scientifically validated treatments including psychotherapy, medication, and outpatient electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The fellow will have an assessment and treatment caseload of patients suffering from late-life disorders and will serve as a consultant for geriatric issues to psychiatric residents working in the Program.   Tisch Hospital Consultation Liaison Service Clinical Supervisor: Jane L. Rosenthal, MD   Tisch Hospital is the acute-care facility of NYU Langone Medical Center. The Tisch Hospital Consultation Liaison service sees all adult medical and surgical patients who require a psychiatric consultation. More than half of the patients seen are elderly or at end-of-life. A full range of psychiatric and neuropsychiatric conditions are encountered, including co-occurring substance abuse, delirium, and patients in need of capacity evaluations. Interventions include biological and psychosocial evaluations, psychopharmacologic treatments, individual psychosocial treatments including some cognitive behavioral treatments, and involvement with family as a necessary extension of treating hospitalized patients. Fellows perform supervised consultations of geriatric patients. Additionally, during this rotation the fellow has the opportunity to participate in a biweekly Psychosomatics Journal Club, weekly interdisciplinary pain rounds, weekly palliative care rounds, weekly walk rounds with an internist and clinical pharmacist, weekly didactic sessions for Fellows in Psychosomatic Medicine, and the monthly meeting of the Ethics Committee.

McCue, MD   We are accepting applications for 2015-2016 starting May 1, 2014   Click here for application information   About the Program   The NYU Department of Psychiatry offers a one-year ACGME-accredited Geriatric Psychiatry Fellowship whose mission is to produce clinical and academic leaders in geriatric psychiatry and to prepare fellows for board certification in the subspecialty of geriatric psychiatry. The program is closely integrated with the ACGME-accredited fellowship in geriatric medicine. Fellows are exposed to a complete spectrum of clinical and academic experiences in geriatric psychiatry, geriatrics, and gerontology. In addi\u00adtion to acquiring expertise in using pharmaco\u00adtherapy and psychosocial interventions to treat elderly patients with late-life mental disorders, fellows gain experience in understanding their elderly patients in relation to their families and environment. Fellows, under the supervision of faculty, function as the team leaders in all set\u00adtings with supervisory responsibility for resi\u00addents, medical students, and professional members of the multidisciplinary treatment team. Fel\u00adlows have the opportunity to assess and treat patients in multiple settings (inpatient, outpatient, consultation-liaison, and nursing home) and gain experience with all modalities of treatment during the course of their fellowship year. Finally, fellows have the opportunity to work with mentors in developing research projects and aca\u00addemic pursuits.   Clinical Rotations   Pearl I. Barlow Center for Memory Evaluation and Treatment Clinical Supervisor: James E. Galvin, MD, MPH   The main training site is the Pearl Barlow Center for Memory Evaluation and Treatment with additional educational experiences at the Parkinson and Movement Disorders Center. Training focuses on the assessment of the elderly patient with primary complaints of cognitive impairment. As part of this training, the fellow becomes certified in use of the Clinical Dementia Rating scale and receives training in neuropsychological assessment. The fellow has the opportunity to follow patients throughout the year and, with supervision, manage their cognitive and psychiatric problems with both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. The fellow works with patients\u2019 families and caregivers through supervised participation in family and group psychotherapy. Additional training is provided in the medical and psychosocial assessment of elderly patients with movement disorders at the Parkinson and Movement Disorders Center. The fellow is also trained in the fundamentals of large-scale research projects through involvement in the research studies conducted by faculty in the Center on Brain Aging.   Coler-Carter Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility Clinical Supervisor: Ravindra Amin, MD   The Coler campus of Coler-Carter Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility consists of over 800 long-term care and over 90 long-term acute care beds. It is the primary provider of long term care to the indigent population of New York City, with majority of the referrals coming from public acute care facilities.

Under supervision, the fellows gain expertise in the assessment and treatment of these complex patients. There is the opportunity to participate in a weekly consultation with a senior psychopharmacologist and attend the weekly Clinical Case Conference of the Bellevue Psychiatry Inpatient Service.   NYU Behavioral Health Program Clinical Supervisor: Patrick Ying, MD   The Behavioral Health Program, the major outpatient psychiatry service at NYU Langone Medical Center, provides expert yet affordable treatment to individuals suffering from a broad range of mental disorders or emotional problems, including a large number of elderly patients. The fellow will be part of a team of offering the most up-to-date and scientifically validated treatments including psychotherapy, medication, and outpatient electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The fellow will have an assessment and treatment caseload of patients suffering from late-life disorders and will serve as a consultant for geriatric issues to psychiatric residents working in the Program.   Tisch Hospital Consultation Liaison Service Clinical Supervisor: Jane L. Rosenthal, MD   Tisch Hospital is the acute-care facility of NYU Langone Medical Center. The Tisch Hospital Consultation Liaison service sees all adult medical and surgical patients who require a psychiatric consultation. More than half of the patients seen are elderly or at end-of-life. A full range of psychiatric and neuropsychiatric conditions are encountered, including co-occurring substance abuse, delirium, and patients in need of capacity evaluations. Interventions include biological and psychosocial evaluations, psychopharmacologic treatments, individual psychosocial treatments including some cognitive behavioral treatments, and involvement with family as a necessary extension of treating hospitalized patients. Fellows perform supervised consultations of geriatric patients. Additionally, during this rotation the fellow has the opportunity to participate in a biweekly Psychosomatics Journal Club, weekly interdisciplinary pain rounds, weekly palliative care rounds, weekly walk rounds with an internist and clinical pharmacist, weekly didactic sessions for Fellows in Psychosomatic Medicine, and the monthly meeting of the Ethics Committee.
