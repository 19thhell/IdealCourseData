While this guide is intended for planning future communications, we ask that the new NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering identity not be used in external communications until we are fully merged on January 1, 2014 unless you have been previously granted permission by marketing and communications.     Our Name   Templates   Logos       Our Name   Following is a guide on how to use our new name in written communication.         What Was   Is Now           Polytechnic Institute of New York University   NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering       Usage: Formal documents issued from the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering       NYU-Poly   NYU School of Engineering or School of Engineering         Usage: Second instance in article, paragraph, etc. for public view, or to internal and external audiences, e.g., correspondence to research partner at another institution. And all subsequent mentions in article, paragraph, etc. for public view; anywhere   Note: If &quot;Polytechnic&quot; is used, it must be used in conjunction with NYU, example: &quot;NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering.&quot;   Shortening it is allowed in two ways:   &quot;NYU School of Engineering&quot;       (Allowed in a formal or external document as a second mention)   OR   &quot;School of Engineering&quot;       (Allowed in a less formal setting [web, social media] where the context of NYU is already implied).         &quot;Poly&quot; is no longer in use         Templates   Presentations     PowerPoint template     Sample Stationery   See Stationery Specification for more details, including specifications for business cards and envelopes.     Sample Letter (Black)   Sample Letter (Color)     Logos   To establish the full identity of our school, the logo should be used in its official, unaltered official form, i.e., do not stretch, change colors, enlarge to the point of pixilation, manually type the letterforms, or otherwise modify the logo.   Note: If more than one school is mentioned, use the NYU logo instead of displaying the logos of multiple schools.   Please review Visual Identity Guidelines before using our logo.
