First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School.

Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays. Plan to take a First-Year Writing Seminar in the fall semester; you will take a First-Year Research Seminar next spring.

Description       From Norman Morrison's dramatic self-immolation in front of the Pentagon in 1965 to Muhammad Ali's refusal to enter the U.S. military, to Jane Fonda's widely publicized antiwar activism, the Vietnam War motivated a wide range of Americans to take action against it. In this first-year writing seminar, we will explore some of the central questions raised both by war itself and the various types of activism that have historically arisen to challenge its power. What kinds of people become involved in the efforts to stop war? What types of strategies and activities have they developed? And, perhaps most importantly, what impact have their actions had on the operation of not only of the war in Vietnam, but also on the direction of war and peace in the decades that followed? Through readings, class discussions, and writing exercises that lead to formal essays, this course will employ methodologies drawn from disciplines like film and literary studies, cultural theory, and political science to write and think through the complex moral, philosophical, political, and aesthetic elements involved in antiwar activism. Texts and films may include works by T.V. Reed (\u00a0 The Art of Protest: Culture and Activism from the Civil Rights Movement to the Streets of Seattle \u00a0), Peter Davis (\u00a0 Hearts and Minds \u00a0), Penny Lewis (\u00a0 Hardhats, Hippies, and Hawks: The Vietnam Antiwar Movement as Myth and Memory \u00a0), Nick Turse (\u00a0 Kill Anything that Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam \u00a0), Diane di Prima (\u00a0 Revolutionary Letters \u00a0), David Maraniss (\u00a0 They Marched into Sunlight: War and Peace, America and Vietnam, October 1967 \u00a0), and David S. Meyer (\u00a0 The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America \u00a0).

His primary research interests include the Vietnam War in American memory, social and political protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s, and the shifting landscape of media and technology. He is completing a manuscript focused on the GI coffeehouse movement of the Vietnam War era, mapping a narrative history that re-contextualizes the relationship between American soldiers and the antiwar movement. While currently performing research and writing for a large public exhibition of Vietnam War history at the New-York Historical Society, he also hosts a weekly podcast called\u00a0 The Nostalgia Trap \u00a0that uses personal biographies to explore the social, political, and cultural history of the past several decades.                                     top of page                                     Contact Information     David Parsons             Part-time Faculty              parsonsdlp@gmail.com             1 Wash Pl, Room 613             (212) 998-7340      Download as vCard           \u00a0           Office Hours                     Thursday 10-2                                                     Courses                                                   2015             Spring                            First-Year Research Seminar: Suburban Nation                  Tue,Thu      9:30 AM -      10:45 AM                                                   2015             Fall                            First-Year Writing Seminar: Antiwar Activism in the Vietnam Era and After                  Tue,Thu      8:00 AM -      9:15 AM                                                   2014             Fall                            First-Year Writing Seminar: Walking and Writing in New York City                  Tue,Thu      9:30 AM -      10:45 AM                                       Research and Teaching Interests       American social and political history; film studies; the Vietnam War; American memory; 1960s and 1970s protest movements; the politics of public space; media and technology; oral history                                                                                                            NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School.

Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays. Plan to take a First-Year Writing Seminar in the fall semester; you will take a First-Year Research Seminar next spring.

Description       From Norman Morrison's dramatic self-immolation in front of the Pentagon in 1965 to Muhammad Ali's refusal to enter the U.S. military, to Jane Fonda's widely publicized antiwar activism, the Vietnam War motivated a wide range of Americans to take action against it. In this first-year writing seminar, we will explore some of the central questions raised both by war itself and the various types of activism that have historically arisen to challenge its power. What kinds of people become involved in the efforts to stop war? What types of strategies and activities have they developed? And, perhaps most importantly, what impact have their actions had on the operation of not only of the war in Vietnam, but also on the direction of war and peace in the decades that followed? Through readings, class discussions, and writing exercises that lead to formal essays, this course will employ methodologies drawn from disciplines like film and literary studies, cultural theory, and political science to write and think through the complex moral, philosophical, political, and aesthetic elements involved in antiwar activism. Texts and films may include works by T.V. Reed (\u00a0 The Art of Protest: Culture and Activism from the Civil Rights Movement to the Streets of Seattle \u00a0), Peter Davis (\u00a0 Hearts and Minds \u00a0), Penny Lewis (\u00a0 Hardhats, Hippies, and Hawks: The Vietnam Antiwar Movement as Myth and Memory \u00a0), Nick Turse (\u00a0 Kill Anything that Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam \u00a0), Diane di Prima (\u00a0 Revolutionary Letters \u00a0), David Maraniss (\u00a0 They Marched into Sunlight: War and Peace, America and Vietnam, October 1967 \u00a0), and David S.

His primary research interests include the Vietnam War in American memory, social and political protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s, and the shifting landscape of media and technology. He is completing a manuscript focused on the GI coffeehouse movement of the Vietnam War era, mapping a narrative history that re-contextualizes the relationship between American soldiers and the antiwar movement. While currently performing research and writing for a large public exhibition of Vietnam War history at the New-York Historical Society, he also hosts a weekly podcast called\u00a0 The Nostalgia Trap \u00a0that uses personal biographies to explore the social, political, and cultural history of the past several decades.                                     top of page                                     Contact Information     David Parsons             Part-time Faculty              parsonsdlp@gmail.com             1 Wash Pl, Room 613             (212) 998-7340      Download as vCard           \u00a0           Office Hours                     Thursday 10-2                                                     Courses                                                   2015             Spring                            First-Year Research Seminar: Suburban Nation                  Tue,Thu      9:30 AM -      10:45 AM                                                   2015             Fall                            First-Year Writing Seminar: Antiwar Activism in the Vietnam Era and After                  Tue,Thu      8:00 AM -      9:15 AM                                                   2014             Fall                            First-Year Writing Seminar: Walking and Writing in New York City                  Tue,Thu      9:30 AM -      10:45 AM                                       Research and Teaching Interests       American social and political history; film studies; the Vietnam War; American memory; 1960s and 1970s protest movements; the politics of public space; media and technology; oral history                                                                                                            NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.
