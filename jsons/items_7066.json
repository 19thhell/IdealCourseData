Description       The Renaissance witnessed both an explosion in theatrical innovation and an increasingly global world--the beginnings of global trade, the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the New World, and bouts of both conflict and cooperation among the world\u2019s powers. By reading plays that stage encounters between Europeans from different countries and of different religions, between Europeans and the Ottoman Empire, among natives of \u201cIndia,\u201d and among Europeans, Native Americans, and African slaves, we explore how and why the stage became such a significant site for the representation of cross-cultural encounters. Some questions we explore include: how do these plays represent conflict\u2014between self and other and over goods and territory\u2014and what possibilities for reconciliation do they imagine? How does the theatre participate in the production of a global consciousness? How do these plays understand the differences encountered as a result of travel, trade, and exploration? Why did the theatre develop a fascination with the exotic (for example, with cannibals and pirates)? In what ways did what it means to be European, Christian, or even a good wife or husband get defined and altered by these encounters? In keeping with the theme of encounters, this course stages a number of creative encounters from the period: between works from different European nations; between plays and the prose works with which they were in dialogue; and between written and visual materials, for example, engravings of the New World and its inhabitants. We also read some newly translated accounts of how Arabs viewed Europe. Likely authors include, Shakespeare, Marlowe, Cervantes, Montaigne, Behn, Fletcher, DeBry, and Massinger.

Description       The Renaissance witnessed both an explosion in theatrical innovation and an increasingly global world--the beginnings of global trade, the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the New World, and bouts of both conflict and cooperation among the world\u2019s powers. By reading plays that stage encounters between Europeans from different countries and of different religions, between Europeans and the Ottoman Empire, among natives of \u201cIndia,\u201d and among Europeans, Native Americans, and African slaves, we explore how and why the stage became such a significant site for the representation of cross-cultural encounters. Some questions we explore include: how do these plays represent conflict\u2014between self and other and over goods and territory\u2014and what possibilities for reconciliation do they imagine? How does the theatre participate in the production of a global consciousness? How do these plays understand the differences encountered as a result of travel, trade, and exploration? Why did the theatre develop a fascination with the exotic (for example, with cannibals and pirates)? In what ways did what it means to be European, Christian, or even a good wife or husband get defined and altered by these encounters? In keeping with the theme of encounters, this course stages a number of creative encounters from the period: between works from different European nations; between plays and the prose works with which they were in dialogue; and between written and visual materials, for example, engravings of the New World and its inhabitants. We also read some newly translated accounts of how Arabs viewed Europe. Likely authors include, Shakespeare, Marlowe, Cervantes, Montaigne, Behn, Fletcher, DeBry, and Massinger.

She became addicted. Rebecca studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Los Angeles, before earning a B.A. in anthropology from UC Santa Cruz. She holds a Master's in Theatre from San Diego State University, where she met her fellow collaborators that would form Stone Soup Theatre Company, one of San Diego's most critically acclaimed theatre companies. While serving as Artistic Director of the company, she starred as Lainie Wells in Lee Blessing's Two Rooms and as the title character in August Strindberg's Miss Julie. She also directed the San Diego premiere of Sarah Kane's 4.48 Psychosis. She earned her Doctorate in Theatre from the joint program at UC Irvine/UC San Diego. Her doctoral dissertation explored the role of womens' suicide across the theatrical spectrum. She specializes in the areas of Renaissance Theatre, but explored the theatrical history of the Restoration, American Theatre history and modern British Theatre. Since moving to New York, Dr. Johannsen has taught for Fordham and Mercy College, in addition to directing Janet Sternburg's new play The Fifth String at LaMaMa. She has also been hard at work co-producing Erik Ehn's Soulographie festival, a collection of 17 of Ehn's plays surrounding the theme of genocide, currently being produced all over the country and will arrive at La MaMa in November 2012 (www.soulographie.org).
