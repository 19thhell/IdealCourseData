NYU London   Sponsored by the Urban Design and Architecture Studies program of the Art History Department the M.A. program in Historical and Sustainable Architecture is offered in conjunction with The Sir John Soane Museum, the program operates within the framework of NYU London. In an era when the demolition of older buildings has been recognized, not just as a loss to the urban fabric but also as a major source of environmental pollution, retaining historic structures and using them for new purposes is increasingly desirable --and profitable. This program explores innovative ways to reconcile real estate development with historical preservation and environmental protection by recycling existing structures. The course of study combines academic training and research with experiential learning opportunities.   For additional information visit the Art History Department .   NYU Madrid   The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers unique one-year graduate program leading to an M.A. in with a concentration in either Spanish and Latin American Literatures, or Spanish Language and Translation . Students are admitted to enroll at NYU Madrid for the academic year with courses taught by distinguished NYU and Spanish university faculty, poets, writers, and filmmakers.   For detailed information visit the Department of Spanish and Portuguese .   NYU Paris   The Department of French offers five distinct programs at NYU Paris. The Master of Arts degree in French Literature is a one year program which culminates in the successful completion of the Master\u2019s exam. The Master of Arts degree in French Language and Civilization is offered as a one year program or as a summers only program (courses are completed over the course of three or four consecutive summers) and concludes with a Master\u2019s essay. Our new collaborative two-year dual degree program combines the MA in French Language and Civilization and Advanced Certificate in Museum Studies . Students will spend their first year in Paris and the second in New York. This two-year, 48 credit interdisciplinary program, is open to students interested in developing expertise in French culture and society along with the theory and practice of museum work in two of the greatest museum cities of the world: Paris and New York. The fourth degree in Teaching French as a Foreign Language is a joint degree in conjunction with the Department of Teaching and Learning of the Steinhardt Graduate School of Education, leading to New York State initial certification as a teacher of French for grades 7\u201312. The M.A. in TFFL is a two-year degree program, with the first year spent in Paris, and the second year at the Steinhardt School in New York. Students interested in creative writing may pursue the MFA Writers Workshop in Paris. Over two years, students and faculty convene regularly in Paris for five intensive ten-day residency periods (held biannually in January and July). While in residency students participate in a vibrant community engaged in workshops, craft talks, lectures, individual conferences and manuscript consultations, a diverse series of readings, special events and professional development panels.

Bachelor  of Science (B.S.)      B.S.  programs are offered by the following departments of the College: chemistry,  neural science (B.S. only), and physics. They are also offered for the combined  major in global public health and science, with concentrations in biology,  chemistry, and prehealth (no B.A. option). For details, see the sections on  these individual departments and majors in this Bulletin. The College also  offers jointly with the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering a Bachelor of  Science/Bachelor of Science (B.S./B.S.) program; see the engineering section in  this Bulletin. Further information on engineering is available in the College  Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130.      The  general degree requirements are the same for the B.A. and the B.S., with the  exception of the engineering B.S./B.S.      To  be eligible for the bachelor's degree, students must complete 128 points with a  cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0. Within these points, students  must fulfill the requirements of both a major and the College Core Curriculum.      The  degree requirements to be fulfilled are those in effect during the term of the  student's first registration in the College. Registration in another division  of New York University does not constitute a registration in the College of  Arts and Science.      Readmitted  students must fulfill the requirements as listed in the College of Arts and  Science Bulletin published during the year of their readmission, unless their  readmission letter states otherwise.      In  very exceptional cases, a student may petition the Committee on Undergraduate  Academic Standards for approval of a change in the requirements as stated in  the Bulletin. The petition form may be obtained from the Office of the  Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140.                   CONFERRING  OF DEGREES           Degrees are conferred in September, January, and May. The  formal conferring of degrees by the president of the University takes place  annually at Commencement in May.                   THE  MAJOR           Major  requirements, varying from department to department, are specified in the  sections of this Bulletin devoted to the course listings of individual  departments and programs. Generally, a little more than one-third of the total  points are earned in the major concentration.      Every  student must complete a major with a cumulative grade point average in the  major of at least 2.0. At least one-half of the courses (and in some  departments, at least one-half of the points) used to complete the major must  be taken in the College of Arts and Science. A student may not register for  courses in the major outside of NYU. The  student must be accepted as a major in the department and must review his or  her program with a department adviser each term.                   DECLARATION           Students  go to the office of the department or program to declare a major and have it  posted in the Student Information System (Albert). Students who have earned 64  or more points must declare a major. Those with fewer than 64 points are  strongly encouraged to declare a major as early in their academic career as  possible.                   DOUBLE  MAJOR           Students  may take a double (second) major. The same requirements, including the  maintenance of a minimum grade point average of 2.0, apply to the second major  as to the first. The second major is  declared in the same way as the first (see above). In some cases, courses may be applicable to both majors if the academic departments consider this appropriate.  Students must then obtain written approval for the shared course(s) from  the directors of undergraduate studies of both departments. No student may double count more than two courses between two majors (or between a major and a minor, or between two minors); some departments have set more restrictive sharing rules (a limit of one shared course, or none at all) as indicated in their sections of this Bulletin.                   THE  MINOR           The  minor requirements are found in the departmental sections of the Bulletin. The  minor must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0. The minor is  declared at the office of the sponsoring department or program. No more than  one minor can be completed outside of the College in the other divisions of  NYU, as the limit on non-CAS credits is set at 16 points.                   REGULATIONS  PERTAINING TO BOTH MAJOR AND MINOR           The  major and minor requirements to be followed are those stated in the  departmental sections of the Bulletin in effect during the semester of the  student's first registration in the College. No credit toward the major or  minor is granted for grades of C-minus or lower, although such grades will be  computed into the grade point average of the major or the minor, as well as  into the overall grade point average.      No  course to be counted toward the major or minor may be taken on a pass/fail  basis. (See \"pass/fail option\" under academic policies in this Bulletin.)          Transfer students from other colleges and universities  must have the written approval of the director of undergraduate studies to  count transfer courses toward the major or the minor. Once a student transfers  to the College, all course work must be completed at NYU. (See also \"transfer  students,\" below.)                   TIME  LIMIT           All  requirements for a degree in the College must be met within a period of eight  years from the date of matriculation. For transfer students and for students  who are readmitted to the College, the length of time is proportionately  reduced. Transfer credit is not granted for courses taken more than 10 years  before the student's matriculation in the College.                   RESIDENCE  REQUIREMENT           Once  a student enrolls in the College of Arts and Science (first year and/or  transfer), all course work used to satisfy the 128-credit degree requirement  must be completed at NYU. All students must complete their last 32 points while  registered in the College of Arts and Science. In addition, students must be  registered in the College during the semester immediately prior to graduation,  unless officially approved for a leave of absence in that semester. One-half of  the courses used to complete the major or the minor must be taken in the  College. Any transfer courses to be applied toward major or minor requirements  must be approved by the department.                   TRANSFER  STUDENTS           Transfer  students must complete 64 points in the College of Arts and Science with a  cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 overall, in the required major,  and in the optional minor. At least one-half of the courses used to complete  the major and any minor must be courses offered by the College. Any transfer  courses to be applied toward major or minor requirements must be approved by  the department and may not exceed one-half of the required coursework for the  major or minor. Courses in which a grade of C-minus or lower was obtained are  not transferable.

Italian Studies at NYU Florence   Historical and Sustainable Architecture at NYU London   Spanish and Latin American Literatures at NYU Madrid   Spanish Language and Translation at NYU Madrid   French Literature at NYU Paris   French Language and Civilization at NYU Paris   Teaching French as a Foreign Language at NYU Paris         NYU Florence   The Italian Studies Department offers a 12-month program in Italian Studies at NYU Florence that in addition to course work includes the possibility for internships and independent study as well as seminars and coursework at the Universit\u00e0 di Firenze, the Istituto Italiano di Scienze Umane.   For additional information visit the Italian Studies Department .   NYU London   Sponsored by the Urban Design and Architecture Studies program of the Art History Department the M.A. program in Historical and Sustainable Architecture is offered in conjunction with The Sir John Soane Museum, the program operates within the framework of NYU London. In an era when the demolition of older buildings has been recognized, not just as a loss to the urban fabric but also as a major source of environmental pollution, retaining historic structures and using them for new purposes is increasingly desirable --and profitable. This program explores innovative ways to reconcile real estate development with historical preservation and environmental protection by recycling existing structures. The course of study combines academic training and research with experiential learning opportunities.   For additional information visit the Art History Department .   NYU Madrid   The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers unique one-year graduate program leading to an M.A. in with a concentration in either Spanish and Latin American Literatures, or Spanish Language and Translation . Students are admitted to enroll at NYU Madrid for the academic year with courses taught by distinguished NYU and Spanish university faculty, poets, writers, and filmmakers.   For detailed information visit the Department of Spanish and Portuguese .   NYU Paris   The Department of French offers five distinct programs at NYU Paris. The Master of Arts degree in French Literature is a one year program which culminates in the successful completion of the Master\u2019s exam. The Master of Arts degree in French Language and Civilization is offered as a one year program or as a summers only program (courses are completed over the course of three or four consecutive summers) and concludes with a Master\u2019s essay. Our new collaborative two-year dual degree program combines the MA in French Language and Civilization and Advanced Certificate in Museum Studies . Students will spend their first year in Paris and the second in New York. This two-year, 48 credit interdisciplinary program, is open to students interested in developing expertise in French culture and society along with the theory and practice of museum work in two of the greatest museum cities of the world: Paris and New York. The fourth degree in Teaching French as a Foreign Language is a joint degree in conjunction with the Department of Teaching and Learning of the Steinhardt Graduate School of Education, leading to New York State initial certification as a teacher of French for grades 7\u201312. The M.A. in TFFL is a two-year degree program, with the first year spent in Paris, and the second year at the Steinhardt School in New York. Students interested in creative writing may pursue the MFA Writers Workshop in Paris. Over two years, students and faculty convene regularly in Paris for five intensive ten-day residency periods (held biannually in January and July). While in residency students participate in a vibrant community engaged in workshops, craft talks, lectures, individual conferences and manuscript consultations, a diverse series of readings, special events and professional development panels.

Bachelor  of Science (B.S.)      B.S.  programs are offered by the following departments of the College: chemistry,  neural science (B.S. only), and physics. They are also offered for the combined  major in global public health and science, with concentrations in biology,  chemistry, and prehealth (no B.A. option). For details, see the sections on  these individual departments and majors in this Bulletin. The College also  offers jointly with the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering a Bachelor of  Science/Bachelor of Science (B.S./B.S.) program; see the engineering section in  this Bulletin. Further information on engineering is available in the College  Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130.      The  general degree requirements are the same for the B.A. and the B.S., with the  exception of the engineering B.S./B.S.      To  be eligible for the bachelor's degree, students must complete 128 points with a  cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0. Within these points, students  must fulfill the requirements of both a major and the College Core Curriculum.      The  degree requirements to be fulfilled are those in effect during the term of the  student's first registration in the College. Registration in another division  of New York University does not constitute a registration in the College of  Arts and Science.      Readmitted  students must fulfill the requirements as listed in the College of Arts and  Science Bulletin published during the year of their readmission, unless their  readmission letter states otherwise.      In  very exceptional cases, a student may petition the Committee on Undergraduate  Academic Standards for approval of a change in the requirements as stated in  the Bulletin. The petition form may be obtained from the Office of the  Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140.                   CONFERRING  OF DEGREES           Degrees are conferred in September, January, and May. The  formal conferring of degrees by the president of the University takes place  annually at Commencement in May.                   THE  MAJOR           Major  requirements, varying from department to department, are specified in the  sections of this Bulletin devoted to the course listings of individual  departments and programs. Generally, a little more than one-third of the total  points are earned in the major concentration.      Every  student must complete a major with a cumulative grade point average in the  major of at least 2.0. At least one-half of the courses (and in some  departments, at least one-half of the points) used to complete the major must  be taken in the College of Arts and Science. A student may not register for  courses in the major outside of NYU. The  student must be accepted as a major in the department and must review his or  her program with a department adviser each term.                   DECLARATION           Students  go to the office of the department or program to declare a major and have it  posted in the Student Information System (Albert). Students who have earned 64  or more points must declare a major. Those with fewer than 64 points are  strongly encouraged to declare a major as early in their academic career as  possible.                   DOUBLE  MAJOR           Students  may take a double (second) major. The same requirements, including the  maintenance of a minimum grade point average of 2.0, apply to the second major  as to the first. The second major is  declared in the same way as the first (see above). In some cases, courses may be applicable to both majors if the academic departments consider this appropriate.  Students must then obtain written approval for the shared course(s) from  the directors of undergraduate studies of both departments. No student may double count more than two courses between two majors (or between a major and a minor, or between two minors); some departments have set more restrictive sharing rules (a limit of one shared course, or none at all) as indicated in their sections of this Bulletin.                   THE  MINOR           The  minor requirements are found in the departmental sections of the Bulletin. The  minor must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0. The minor is  declared at the office of the sponsoring department or program. No more than  one minor can be completed outside of the College in the other divisions of  NYU, as the limit on non-CAS credits is set at 16 points.                   REGULATIONS  PERTAINING TO BOTH MAJOR AND MINOR           The  major and minor requirements to be followed are those stated in the  departmental sections of the Bulletin in effect during the semester of the  student's first registration in the College. No credit toward the major or  minor is granted for grades of C-minus or lower, although such grades will be  computed into the grade point average of the major or the minor, as well as  into the overall grade point average.      No  course to be counted toward the major or minor may be taken on a pass/fail  basis. (See \"pass/fail option\" under academic policies in this Bulletin.)          Transfer students from other colleges and universities  must have the written approval of the director of undergraduate studies to  count transfer courses toward the major or the minor. Once a student transfers  to the College, all course work must be completed at NYU. (See also \"transfer  students,\" below.)                   TIME  LIMIT           All  requirements for a degree in the College must be met within a period of eight  years from the date of matriculation. For transfer students and for students  who are readmitted to the College, the length of time is proportionately  reduced. Transfer credit is not granted for courses taken more than 10 years  before the student's matriculation in the College.                   RESIDENCE  REQUIREMENT           Once  a student enrolls in the College of Arts and Science (first year and/or  transfer), all course work used to satisfy the 128-credit degree requirement  must be completed at NYU. All students must complete their last 32 points while  registered in the College of Arts and Science. In addition, students must be  registered in the College during the semester immediately prior to graduation,  unless officially approved for a leave of absence in that semester. One-half of  the courses used to complete the major or the minor must be taken in the  College. Any transfer courses to be applied toward major or minor requirements  must be approved by the department.                   TRANSFER  STUDENTS           Transfer  students must complete 64 points in the College of Arts and Science with a  cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 overall, in the required major,  and in the optional minor. At least one-half of the courses used to complete  the major and any minor must be courses offered by the College. Any transfer  courses to be applied toward major or minor requirements must be approved by  the department and may not exceed one-half of the required coursework for the  major or minor. Courses in which a grade of C-minus or lower was obtained are  not transferable. Grades earned from external transfer courses are not  calculated in the NYU grade point average.
