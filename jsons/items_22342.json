Mei     Stern School of Business    New York University         Are the Foundations Solid for Emerging Market Real Estate?          The dramatic downturn in the Asian property market has led many investors to question the wisdom of long-term investment in emerging market real estate, especially in Asia. Those who proclaimed the Asian economy a miracle a year ago now call it an Asian mirage and vowed never to invest a penny in Asian real estate again. It is worth noting, however, similar views were also held on New York real estate just a few years ago. Thus, in the midst of an Asian property market crisis, it is important to re-examine the fundamentals of emerging market real estate. In this study, we will try to separate the long-term trends from the short-term fluctuations of the market and offer some suggestions for the long-term investor.         The Foundation Is Still Quite Solid        It is well known that the two main engines of real estate market are population and economic growths. Based on data from the World Bank, emerging markets have 85% of the world population and many of them are expected to grow at several times the growth rate of the U.S. economy. As shown in Figure 1, the population growths of Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are many times that of Japan. Thus, Unlike the Japanese real estate market, which has been suffering from over-valuation and a slowdown in both economic and population growths, the Asian property markets are only suffering from over-development but still enjoy high population growth. Moreover, despite the fact that these economies may go through a period of painful adjustment, economic growths are expected to pick up once the structural reforms proposed by the IMF are made.    Rapid population growth coupled with economic growth has several important implications for real estate market. First, demographic factors in emerging markets are likely to create a strong demand for housing. According to Jim Rohwer in his book, Asia Rising, \"Of the 3.3 billion Asians alive in 1995, some 1.7 billion, or around 52 percent, are under the age of 25. Only 35 percent of Americans and 28 percent of Germans are that young.\" Over the next 20 years, most of these 1.7 billion people will find jobs, get married, and start families. Twenty-five years ago the young families might have chosen to squeeze into an apartment with their parents. With increasing income, however, they will probably prefer to live on their own. This suggests substantial increases in demand for affordable housing by the young families in the future.   Figure 1: Comparison of Population Growth                                                              Data Source: World Bank \"World Development Statistics\", 1995        Second, rising population is causing a serious housing crisis in almost all of the major cities in developing nations. For example, according to official Chinese statistics, the average living space for a family of four in Shanghai was about 400 square feet in 1995. For many families, there is only one bedroom so that parents have to sleep in the same room with their grown children. With the exception of some new high-rise apartment buildings in major cities, many apartments do not have private amenities, such as toilets, running water, and stoves. The situation is even worse in Bombay. More than half of its 14 million residents live on the street or in slums with no access to running water or electricity. A family of six would be considered very lucky if they could live in a 280-square foot public housing unit. There is no doubt that, with increased income and a free housing market, residents in emerging markets will spend a significant amount of money to improve their dreadful housing conditions.    Moreover, massive urbanization caused by rapid industriali-zation and poor infrastructure (roads, electric and telephone service, etc.) will also have a positive impact on urban property market. According to the United Nations study presented in Table 1, by the end of 2015, nine out of the ten largest cities in the world will be in emerging markets and none of them will be in the United States. Massive migration from rural areas to urban centers will exacerbate housing problems in these cities. As shown in Table 2, Thailand and China's rural population accounted for 81% and 72% of the total population. But this large rural population is on the move. The urban population is expected increase quite rapidly from 1992 to 2000. For example, it is estimated that about 100 million Chinese migrant workers will be working in cities in 1998. Many emerging markets are already densely populated. India, for example, has almost 10 times the population density of the United States. South Korea is even more densely populated. Any further migration to cities would make urban land an increasingly scarce resource. Of course, population density is not the only factor affecting real estate market. Other factors, such as existing property supply and their pricing, interest rates and alternative investment opportunities.

There is ample evidence that a scarcity of urban land has already made emerging market cities some of the most expensive places in the world to live and do business. According to a New York Times study in July 1995, the rent of a decent two-bedroom apartment was $1,500 per month in Buenos Aires, $5,000 in Moscow, $6,300 in Shanghai, $7,100 in Hong Kong, and $7,800 in Bombay. The notoriously high rents in New York ($2,300) were actually quite a bargain by emerging market standards.

Property construction is very labor intensive, and the cost of construction labor is rising rapidly in many countries. Between 1991 and 1993, the cost of labor rose 50 percent in China, 22 percent in Mexico, and 20 percent in Korea in dollar terms. Given this rapid rise of real wages, an office building that costs US$200 million to construct today may cost twice as much in less than five years. If the market value of the building reflects its replacement cost, an investor today could reap a capital gain of 50 percent in five years simply by taking advantage of rising labor costs.        Emerging Market Real Estate as a Long-term Investment          The above long-term fundamentals have contributed to quite generous rates of return for emerging market real estate over the past -- rates that are comparable to those from common stocks and well above real estate returns in most developed countries (see Figure 2). While the generous returns in Figure 2 may contain a speculative bubble and are unlikely to be sustainable in future, we believe that the positive long-term fundamentals will continue to help patient investors achieve adequate risk-adjusted returns .     Equally important, real estate is an excellent vehicle to provide the benefits of diversification. It does this in two ways. First, real estate returns have a relatively low correlation with other assets, such as stocks. Second, real estate returns in one part of the world are generally not correlated with those in others. As shown in Figure 1, during the 1988-94 period, when the west and Japan were suffering through one of the worst real estate slumps in history, Asian markets were enjoying a magnificent    Boom. The average correlations between the U.S. and five Asian real estate markets in a study by Quan and Titman were actually negative during the 1988-1994 time period they covered. Thus, putting some share of your portfolio into emerging market properties can reduce the overall risk of your investment program.    And there is an additional advantage. Real estate has been a fairly dependable hedge against inflation in many emerging markets. During periods of double-digit inflation in Hong Kong and other parts of Asia, real estate returns were considerably higher than the rate of inflation, and even higher than the returns from the broad stock market indices in several countries.       Figure 2      0    Source: Quan and Titman, Commercial Real Estate Prices and Stock Market Returns: An International Analysis , 1996.        All of these real estate investment factors -- generous rates of return, risk reduction through diversification, and hedge against inflation -- make emerging market real estate attractive. Moreover, in late 1997, many real estate companies have plunged more deeply than other blue-chip common stocks in emerging markets, especially in Asia. Equity markets fell a staggering 60 percent (in dollar terms) in Thailand and Malaysia, while declines in Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, and Singapore, have exceeded 40 percent from their peak. Provided these countries take the firm steps to further reform their economy, the crisis in 1997 may prove to be a rare buying opportunity for long-term investors.    In summary, with continued economic growth and favorable demographic trends for the next 20 years, we believe that real estate is still a viable investment asset class for long-term investors. That said, we also like to address some of the risks involved in emerging market real estate investment.        Risks in Emerging Market Real Estate         Investors in emerging market real estate incur many risks, such business risk, political risk, and the risk of speculation. The main source of emerging market real estate risk is speculation. Most real estate developers are prone to excess. During the 1980s, there was excessive development all over the world -- Tokyo, London, California, Hawaii, Texas, and New York. The favorite game was always to see who could build the tallest office tower in town or the most luxurious apartments or hotels in the area. While the party lasted, it was fun for everyone; when it ended, bankers and investors were stuck with huge bills. Over-building in Japan caused Tokyo real estate prices to plummet by two-thirds to three-fourths from their peak in the late 1980s. Wild speculation and excess building in Texas led to the failure of hundreds of savings and loans.    Today, the real estate party has moved to the world of emerging markets. From Bangkok to East Berlin and from Shenzhen to Seoul, armies of construction workers are working on roads, apartment blocks, office buildings, shopping malls, and golf courses. While many of these developments have undoubtedly filled large demand gaps, excessive development has also produced a glut of vacant space and see-through buildings in many \"hot\" places. According to Shanghai government estimates, the office vacancy rate skyrocketed from 1 percent to over 50 percent in 1997, and rents have fallen by more than 40 percent in Shanghai. Similarly, over-development in Thailand triggered a financial crisis in the banking sector, which led to the sharp currency devaluation in 1997.    To reduce such speculative risk, we suggest that investors avoid the most lavish development projects. One useful measure for identifying speculative crazes in real estate is the ratio of market value of a property to what it would cost to replace the building. A high market-to-replacement ratio (much greater than one) means that it pays a developer to acquire land in the neighborhood and build a similar building. It implies increasing space supply in the future and more competition. Investors in buildings selling above replacement cost can get stuck with a double loss -- falling rents and falling market value of your property. On the other hand, investors buying during a real estate recession, when market-to-replacement ratios are much smaller than one, can get a double benefit. If space demand picks up, it means rising rents and increasing market value for your property. With the recent sharp decline in equity prices and a looming recession in many parts of Asia and Latin America, we can expect many properties will be put up for \"fire sale\" in the near future, with prices set below replacement costs.    One positive feature that somewhat mitigates the risks is that the property cycles in emerging markets are likely to be shorter than those in developed markets if these markets continue their high economic growth. For example, if Shanghai maintains its 15 percent growth rate in the absorption of space, then even with a 50 percent vacancy rate, it would still achieve full occupancy in four years. On the other hand, it may take a typical American city seven to ten years to fill a 20 percent vacancy if the local economy is only growing at 2 to 3 percent a year.    Another source of risk often cited is the changing business environment. Many observers have suggested that emerging market economies may get more suburban, as happened in the United States, leaving many downtown buildings with large amounts of vacant space. While this may become true in the future, we expect that it will take quite a long time because of the personal nature of business in many emerging markets. Given the poor transportation infrastru-cture for most emerging economies, downtown is still the most efficient place for doing business. While billions of dollars have been spent on the development of new suburban centers, such as the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, so far these suburban centers appear to be complementing the downtown facilities rather than replacing them.    In addition to speculative and business risks, political risk is also a major source of concern for investors. Given its immobility, real estate is most vulnerable to government expropriation and excessive taxes. To manage political risk effectively, it is important to know that it is usually made up of two components, country-specific risk and systematic risk. Country-specific risk, such as change in a nations tax law or military coups, tends to happen independently across different countries. Thus, by constructing a well-diversified portfolio of real estate assets across many emerging market countries, these risks can be reduced. Systematic political risks tend to affect the returns of emerging as well as developed markets, and they can not be diversified away. For instance, the stability of China, Russia, and the Middle East has broad implications for world development. As a result, real estate assets with significant exposures to these risks should carry appropriate risk premiums.             How to Invest in Emerging Market Real Estate         Most individual investors lack both the expertise to evaluate emerging market property investments and the large sums required to purchase them. Moreover, poor liquidity and high transactions costs make it very difficult to turn property investment into cash if an emergency funding requirement arises or the investment prospects change. Thus, given the absence of emerging market REITs, property company stocks listed as American Deposit Receipts (ADRs) offer the only practical vehicle for individual investors in the United States to add some emerging market real estate to their portfolios.    There are a few dozen property and hotel company ADRs with good trading markets. Recently, many developers, such as IRSA and New World, have invested in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Thus, investors can obtain property interests in emerging markets by just purchasing some of the property company shares. These shares are traded like regular stocks, and they are covered by many international accounting firms so that company financial information is easily available (For a complete list of property company ADRs and their valuations, see Malkiel and Mei (1998)).    It is worth noting that many emerging market equity funds already have some exposure to emerging market real estate, as the portfolios of these funds usually include some real estate securities. Global real estate funds, such as the Evergreen Global Real Estate Equity Fund, also have some exposure to emerging market properties. Thus, many investors will not need to purchase property company shares directly. But since this exposure tends to be small, you may wish to increase your real estate holdings if you are very optimistic about the long-term effects of economic and population growth. Moreover, real estate in such countries as Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand is under-represented in many funds.    We also believe that large institutional investors will be well served by adding some emerging market properties to their real estate portfolios. If these admittedly risky properties are combined with real estate in developed countries, the low correlation of their returns can actually reduce the overall risk of the portfolio. Institutions should not only diversify across different countries, but also across different property types. Portfolio managers may do so by investing in shares of local companies or by taking an equity position in some development projects. Our study also suggests that institutional investors with moderate holdings in emerging market real estate are probably better off sitting through the current market storm in Asia rather than offering these assets at fire-sale prices.    In conclusion, our analysis suggests the foundation of emerging market real estate is still quite solid, despite some structural problems, such as excessive market speculation and political risks. Therefore, they should be included in the construction of any well-diversified portfolio.        References:        Crocker Liu and J.P.

Mei     Stern School of Business    New York University         Are the Foundations Solid for Emerging Market Real Estate?          The dramatic downturn in the Asian property market has led many investors to question the wisdom of long-term investment in emerging market real estate, especially in Asia. Those who proclaimed the Asian economy a miracle a year ago now call it an Asian mirage and vowed never to invest a penny in Asian real estate again. It is worth noting, however, similar views were also held on New York real estate just a few years ago. Thus, in the midst of an Asian property market crisis, it is important to re-examine the fundamentals of emerging market real estate. In this study, we will try to separate the long-term trends from the short-term fluctuations of the market and offer some suggestions for the long-term investor.         The Foundation Is Still Quite Solid        It is well known that the two main engines of real estate market are population and economic growths. Based on data from the World Bank, emerging markets have 85% of the world population and many of them are expected to grow at several times the growth rate of the U.S. economy. As shown in Figure 1, the population growths of Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are many times that of Japan. Thus, Unlike the Japanese real estate market, which has been suffering from over-valuation and a slowdown in both economic and population growths, the Asian property markets are only suffering from over-development but still enjoy high population growth. Moreover, despite the fact that these economies may go through a period of painful adjustment, economic growths are expected to pick up once the structural reforms proposed by the IMF are made.    Rapid population growth coupled with economic growth has several important implications for real estate market. First, demographic factors in emerging markets are likely to create a strong demand for housing. According to Jim Rohwer in his book, Asia Rising, \"Of the 3.3 billion Asians alive in 1995, some 1.7 billion, or around 52 percent, are under the age of 25. Only 35 percent of Americans and 28 percent of Germans are that young.\" Over the next 20 years, most of these 1.7 billion people will find jobs, get married, and start families. Twenty-five years ago the young families might have chosen to squeeze into an apartment with their parents. With increasing income, however, they will probably prefer to live on their own. This suggests substantial increases in demand for affordable housing by the young families in the future.   Figure 1: Comparison of Population Growth                                                              Data Source: World Bank \"World Development Statistics\", 1995        Second, rising population is causing a serious housing crisis in almost all of the major cities in developing nations. For example, according to official Chinese statistics, the average living space for a family of four in Shanghai was about 400 square feet in 1995. For many families, there is only one bedroom so that parents have to sleep in the same room with their grown children. With the exception of some new high-rise apartment buildings in major cities, many apartments do not have private amenities, such as toilets, running water, and stoves. The situation is even worse in Bombay. More than half of its 14 million residents live on the street or in slums with no access to running water or electricity. A family of six would be considered very lucky if they could live in a 280-square foot public housing unit. There is no doubt that, with increased income and a free housing market, residents in emerging markets will spend a significant amount of money to improve their dreadful housing conditions.    Moreover, massive urbanization caused by rapid industriali-zation and poor infrastructure (roads, electric and telephone service, etc.) will also have a positive impact on urban property market. According to the United Nations study presented in Table 1, by the end of 2015, nine out of the ten largest cities in the world will be in emerging markets and none of them will be in the United States. Massive migration from rural areas to urban centers will exacerbate housing problems in these cities. As shown in Table 2, Thailand and China's rural population accounted for 81% and 72% of the total population. But this large rural population is on the move. The urban population is expected increase quite rapidly from 1992 to 2000. For example, it is estimated that about 100 million Chinese migrant workers will be working in cities in 1998. Many emerging markets are already densely populated. India, for example, has almost 10 times the population density of the United States. South Korea is even more densely populated. Any further migration to cities would make urban land an increasingly scarce resource. Of course, population density is not the only factor affecting real estate market. Other factors, such as existing property supply and their pricing, interest rates and alternative investment opportunities.

There is ample evidence that a scarcity of urban land has already made emerging market cities some of the most expensive places in the world to live and do business. According to a New York Times study in July 1995, the rent of a decent two-bedroom apartment was $1,500 per month in Buenos Aires, $5,000 in Moscow, $6,300 in Shanghai, $7,100 in Hong Kong, and $7,800 in Bombay. The notoriously high rents in New York ($2,300) were actually quite a bargain by emerging market standards.

Property construction is very labor intensive, and the cost of construction labor is rising rapidly in many countries. Between 1991 and 1993, the cost of labor rose 50 percent in China, 22 percent in Mexico, and 20 percent in Korea in dollar terms. Given this rapid rise of real wages, an office building that costs US$200 million to construct today may cost twice as much in less than five years. If the market value of the building reflects its replacement cost, an investor today could reap a capital gain of 50 percent in five years simply by taking advantage of rising labor costs.        Emerging Market Real Estate as a Long-term Investment          The above long-term fundamentals have contributed to quite generous rates of return for emerging market real estate over the past -- rates that are comparable to those from common stocks and well above real estate returns in most developed countries (see Figure 2). While the generous returns in Figure 2 may contain a speculative bubble and are unlikely to be sustainable in future, we believe that the positive long-term fundamentals will continue to help patient investors achieve adequate risk-adjusted returns .     Equally important, real estate is an excellent vehicle to provide the benefits of diversification. It does this in two ways. First, real estate returns have a relatively low correlation with other assets, such as stocks. Second, real estate returns in one part of the world are generally not correlated with those in others. As shown in Figure 1, during the 1988-94 period, when the west and Japan were suffering through one of the worst real estate slumps in history, Asian markets were enjoying a magnificent    Boom. The average correlations between the U.S. and five Asian real estate markets in a study by Quan and Titman were actually negative during the 1988-1994 time period they covered. Thus, putting some share of your portfolio into emerging market properties can reduce the overall risk of your investment program.    And there is an additional advantage. Real estate has been a fairly dependable hedge against inflation in many emerging markets. During periods of double-digit inflation in Hong Kong and other parts of Asia, real estate returns were considerably higher than the rate of inflation, and even higher than the returns from the broad stock market indices in several countries.       Figure 2      0    Source: Quan and Titman, Commercial Real Estate Prices and Stock Market Returns: An International Analysis , 1996.        All of these real estate investment factors -- generous rates of return, risk reduction through diversification, and hedge against inflation -- make emerging market real estate attractive. Moreover, in late 1997, many real estate companies have plunged more deeply than other blue-chip common stocks in emerging markets, especially in Asia. Equity markets fell a staggering 60 percent (in dollar terms) in Thailand and Malaysia, while declines in Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, and Singapore, have exceeded 40 percent from their peak. Provided these countries take the firm steps to further reform their economy, the crisis in 1997 may prove to be a rare buying opportunity for long-term investors.    In summary, with continued economic growth and favorable demographic trends for the next 20 years, we believe that real estate is still a viable investment asset class for long-term investors. That said, we also like to address some of the risks involved in emerging market real estate investment.        Risks in Emerging Market Real Estate         Investors in emerging market real estate incur many risks, such business risk, political risk, and the risk of speculation. The main source of emerging market real estate risk is speculation. Most real estate developers are prone to excess. During the 1980s, there was excessive development all over the world -- Tokyo, London, California, Hawaii, Texas, and New York. The favorite game was always to see who could build the tallest office tower in town or the most luxurious apartments or hotels in the area. While the party lasted, it was fun for everyone; when it ended, bankers and investors were stuck with huge bills. Over-building in Japan caused Tokyo real estate prices to plummet by two-thirds to three-fourths from their peak in the late 1980s. Wild speculation and excess building in Texas led to the failure of hundreds of savings and loans.    Today, the real estate party has moved to the world of emerging markets. From Bangkok to East Berlin and from Shenzhen to Seoul, armies of construction workers are working on roads, apartment blocks, office buildings, shopping malls, and golf courses. While many of these developments have undoubtedly filled large demand gaps, excessive development has also produced a glut of vacant space and see-through buildings in many \"hot\" places. According to Shanghai government estimates, the office vacancy rate skyrocketed from 1 percent to over 50 percent in 1997, and rents have fallen by more than 40 percent in Shanghai. Similarly, over-development in Thailand triggered a financial crisis in the banking sector, which led to the sharp currency devaluation in 1997.    To reduce such speculative risk, we suggest that investors avoid the most lavish development projects. One useful measure for identifying speculative crazes in real estate is the ratio of market value of a property to what it would cost to replace the building. A high market-to-replacement ratio (much greater than one) means that it pays a developer to acquire land in the neighborhood and build a similar building. It implies increasing space supply in the future and more competition. Investors in buildings selling above replacement cost can get stuck with a double loss -- falling rents and falling market value of your property. On the other hand, investors buying during a real estate recession, when market-to-replacement ratios are much smaller than one, can get a double benefit. If space demand picks up, it means rising rents and increasing market value for your property. With the recent sharp decline in equity prices and a looming recession in many parts of Asia and Latin America, we can expect many properties will be put up for \"fire sale\" in the near future, with prices set below replacement costs.    One positive feature that somewhat mitigates the risks is that the property cycles in emerging markets are likely to be shorter than those in developed markets if these markets continue their high economic growth. For example, if Shanghai maintains its 15 percent growth rate in the absorption of space, then even with a 50 percent vacancy rate, it would still achieve full occupancy in four years. On the other hand, it may take a typical American city seven to ten years to fill a 20 percent vacancy if the local economy is only growing at 2 to 3 percent a year.    Another source of risk often cited is the changing business environment. Many observers have suggested that emerging market economies may get more suburban, as happened in the United States, leaving many downtown buildings with large amounts of vacant space. While this may become true in the future, we expect that it will take quite a long time because of the personal nature of business in many emerging markets. Given the poor transportation infrastru-cture for most emerging economies, downtown is still the most efficient place for doing business. While billions of dollars have been spent on the development of new suburban centers, such as the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, so far these suburban centers appear to be complementing the downtown facilities rather than replacing them.    In addition to speculative and business risks, political risk is also a major source of concern for investors. Given its immobility, real estate is most vulnerable to government expropriation and excessive taxes. To manage political risk effectively, it is important to know that it is usually made up of two components, country-specific risk and systematic risk. Country-specific risk, such as change in a nations tax law or military coups, tends to happen independently across different countries. Thus, by constructing a well-diversified portfolio of real estate assets across many emerging market countries, these risks can be reduced. Systematic political risks tend to affect the returns of emerging as well as developed markets, and they can not be diversified away. For instance, the stability of China, Russia, and the Middle East has broad implications for world development. As a result, real estate assets with significant exposures to these risks should carry appropriate risk premiums.             How to Invest in Emerging Market Real Estate         Most individual investors lack both the expertise to evaluate emerging market property investments and the large sums required to purchase them. Moreover, poor liquidity and high transactions costs make it very difficult to turn property investment into cash if an emergency funding requirement arises or the investment prospects change. Thus, given the absence of emerging market REITs, property company stocks listed as American Deposit Receipts (ADRs) offer the only practical vehicle for individual investors in the United States to add some emerging market real estate to their portfolios.    There are a few dozen property and hotel company ADRs with good trading markets. Recently, many developers, such as IRSA and New World, have invested in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Thus, investors can obtain property interests in emerging markets by just purchasing some of the property company shares. These shares are traded like regular stocks, and they are covered by many international accounting firms so that company financial information is easily available (For a complete list of property company ADRs and their valuations, see Malkiel and Mei (1998)).    It is worth noting that many emerging market equity funds already have some exposure to emerging market real estate, as the portfolios of these funds usually include some real estate securities. Global real estate funds, such as the Evergreen Global Real Estate Equity Fund, also have some exposure to emerging market properties. Thus, many investors will not need to purchase property company shares directly. But since this exposure tends to be small, you may wish to increase your real estate holdings if you are very optimistic about the long-term effects of economic and population growth. Moreover, real estate in such countries as Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand is under-represented in many funds.    We also believe that large institutional investors will be well served by adding some emerging market properties to their real estate portfolios. If these admittedly risky properties are combined with real estate in developed countries, the low correlation of their returns can actually reduce the overall risk of the portfolio. Institutions should not only diversify across different countries, but also across different property types. Portfolio managers may do so by investing in shares of local companies or by taking an equity position in some development projects. Our study also suggests that institutional investors with moderate holdings in emerging market real estate are probably better off sitting through the current market storm in Asia rather than offering these assets at fire-sale prices.    In conclusion, our analysis suggests the foundation of emerging market real estate is still quite solid, despite some structural problems, such as excessive market speculation and political risks. Therefore, they should be included in the construction of any well-diversified portfolio.        References:        Crocker Liu and J.P.

Anthropology of Media    ANTH-UA 123 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Ganti, Ginsburg, Stout. 4 points.   Examines the social and political life of media and how it makes a difference in the daily lives of people as a practice\u2014in production, reception, or circulation. Introduces some key concepts in social theory such as ideology, hegemony, the public sphere, and the nation, which have been critical to the study of the media across disciplines. Provides an overview of the increasing theoretical attention paid to the mass media by anthropologists and focuses on concrete ethnographic examples. Examines cross-culturally how the mass media have become the primary means for the circulation of symbolic forms across time and space and crucial to the constitution of subjectivities, collectivities, and histories in the contemporary world. Topics include the role of media in constituting and contesting national identities, in forging alternative political visions, in transforming religious practice, and in creating subcultures.    Anthropology of Art    ANTH-UA 125 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Geismar, Myers. 4 points.   Introduces students to the \"classic\" literature within the anthropology of art, charts the development and interests of this subdiscipline of anthropology, and uses this material to develop an \"anthropological\" perspective on art that can be used as a key form of critical inquiry into diverse art forms\u2014even those not conventionally explored in the history of anthropology. The starting point for the anthropology of art is to ask, \"What is art?\" in comparative cultural perspective. Analyzes, among other things, the idea of aesthetics in cross-cultural context; the notion of style; the relation between art, technology, and skill; the entanglement of primitivism and modernity; the role of class and taste in appreciating art; art and value in the marketplace; art and museum practice; tourist art and the value of authenticity; and colonial and postcolonial art.

Race, \"Difference,\" and Social Inequality      ANTH-UA 323 Identical to SCA-UA 323. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Khan. 4 points.   Human beings have always grappled with some notion of identity, asking questions about who they are, about who others distinguished from themselves are, and about the ways that perceived similarities and differences are meaningful and important (or not) in social relationships. Examines how historical, social, and cultural contexts shape the forms that identities take, looking in particular at ideas about race and racial identity. We work with two premises: (1) race must be understood in relation to other identity categories: gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on, and (2) race is expressed in both obvious and subtle ways; thus, racial identity is implicit as well as explicitly expressed. We also consider whether race must necessarily be understood as stigma; discuss nonfiction, fiction, and films; and may visit public exhibitions.    Reimagining Community: Race, Nation, and the Politics of Belonging    ANTH-UA 325 Identical to SCA-UA 200. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor.

Language and Law    ANTH-UA 329 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Schieffelin. 4 points.   Arguments and conflicts are part of everyday life, and language is central to both their instigation and resolution. Explores how speakers ranging from small children to litigants in courts attempt to settle their differences. Comparative materials illustrate theories of disputes and dispute resolution, examining the power of language and the language of power in a variety of settings (e.g., mediation, arbitration, trials). Class includes fieldwork trips to small claims court. Students audio-record cases and transcribe and analyze them according to different analytic perspectives. Bilingual students are encouraged to focus on cases that use interpreters.    Gender, Violence, and the Law    ANTH-UA 330 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points.   Examines the global prevalence of gender violence and the varied meanings of violence against women and changes in terminology over time. Examines ways of theorizing gender and violence, including performative ideas of gender. The creation of gender violence as a social problem is a product of social movements in the United States, Europe, India, and many other parts of the world. It is now understood globally as an important human rights violation. Also examines the forms of intervention that have been developed in the United States and globally for diminishing violence against women, including policing, prosecution, and punishment.    Human Rights and Culture    ANTH-UA 331 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points.   Offers an overview of the human rights system, looking at its basic elements and studying how it works. Focuses on the relationships between human rights and culture. Human rights campaigns frequently encounter resistance in the name of protecting cultural differences. This is particularly common with issues concerning women, children, and the family. Explores several issues that raise questions of human rights and culture, such as female genital cutting, honor killing, trafficking of persons, and indigenous peoples' rights to culture. Using these examples, considers how the human rights system deals with tensions between global standards and local ways of life. Examines the meanings of rights and of culture in these debates and shows the implications of adopting an anthropological analysis of these situations. The goal of the course is developing an understanding of human rights in practice.    Body, Gender, and Belief in China    ANTH-UA 350 Identical to RELST-UA 350.

Discusses changing roles of nation-states and the growing significance of transnational, diasporic, and globalized social relations and cultural forms.    Culture Through Food    ANTH-UA 410 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, Rogers. 4 points.   Explores some of the ways that people use food, cuisines, and eating to organize and engage with social worlds. This focus provides a concrete means for deepening our understanding of alternative models of social explanation. Drawing on ethnographic material from a wide range of cultures, as well as feature films and our own observations and interviews, we consider topics such as the material dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption (e.g., how food scarcity or abundance shapes collective possibilities, expectations, and values; the causes, consequences, forms, and myths of globalization) and the cultural meanings and social distinctions encoded in food practices (e.g., how food is used cross-culturally as a marker of social identity\u2014class, gender, and ethnicity\u2014and as a source of meaning\u2014nostalgia, anxiety, and so on). Formations of Indigeneity ANTH-UA 605 Formerly ANTH-UA 320. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Through a case study of materials concerning indigenous people in Australia and North America, this course will investigate the consequences (cultural, sociological, policy) of a development that has taken place throughout the world. Many of the peoples in whom anthropologists have long been interested\u2013those organized into small-scale societies, kinship based\u2013have been encapsulated as indigenous minorities within nation states dominated by other cultural traditions. In this context, the capacity and practices of these peoples, who some have characterized as \u201cFourth World peoples,\u201d to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically reinforced.      Roma in East Central Europe   ANTH-UA 9200 Offered at NYU Prague. 4 points.   Introduces students to the development of Romany politics and culture from a persecuted minority to the emergence of Romany organizations, with an emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe.

Barbarian Europe    ANTH-UA 217 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or permission of the instructor. Crabtree. 4 points.   Between the end of the Ice Age and the expansion of the Roman Empire, temperate Europe witnessed a series of social and economic transformations that represented a transition from a hunting and gathering way of life to urban chiefdoms. Along the way, these hunter-gatherers became agriculturalists and stockherders, learned to use metals, and developed social structures as complex as any found in Old World civilizations. Examines changes in later prehistoric Europe from about 8000 B.C.E. to the arrival of the Romans.    African Archaeology    ANTH-UA 218 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3). Tryon. 4 points.   With the longest record of human occupation in the world and a landmass that represents more than one-fifth the habitable area of the globe, Africa plays a central role in our understanding of human evolution, the prehistory of our species, and the development of complex societies. Explores the experiences of ancient human populations in Africa using evidence drawn from archaeology as well as history, ethnography, linguistics, art history, geography, geology, paleontology, biology, and other disciplines. Focuses not only on the material evidence from across the continent and its interpretation, but also an understanding of the major questions, developing methods of inquiry and problem solving, and situating the African data in the broader context of the archaeological evidence for the evolution of human behavioral diversity. The scope of the course spans hominin origins, the study of Stone Age foragers of the first 2.5 million years of human prehistory, and more recent periods characterized by food production, metallurgy, sedentism, and the development of complex societies (e.g., in Egypt, Mali, Zimbabwe, and the East African coast) with influence and contacts across and outside the continent.    Discovering Archaeology in New York City    ANTH-UA 225 Wright. 4 points.   In this course, New York City is our archaeological site. The period covered is from 10,000 years ago to the beginning of the 20th century and is based on archaeological remains. Its history is both fascinating and mind-expanding as a different perspective on the city emerges in time and space from what is learned. Walking around its various boroughs, students learn that our modern landscape is vastly different from that of earlier eras. Along with our gains as a major cultural center, we will assess some losses brought about by the destruction of aspects of the city\u2019s past. In particular, students come to understand the meaning of stewardship in the context of urban development. At the same time, viewing our place in the city\u2019s 10,000 years of history gives us a deeper sense of time and place and a unity in its shared heritage. Last Hunters-First Farmers ANTH-UA 608 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or instructor permission. Offered every two years. 4 points. Last   Hunters-First Farmers explores the transition from foraging to   agriculture throughout the Eastern Hemisphere and the Americas. The   course begins with a review of the theories that have been proposed to   explain the transition from hunting to gathering to farming and the   archaeological methods that have been used to explore this question.

Why do some primates live in large social groups while others are solitary and yet others live in pairs or cooperatively breeding families? Why are strong social hierarchies seen in some primate taxa but not in others? How do multiple species of primates often manage to coexist in the same habitat? Why are social relationships in some primate species characterized by strong bonds among females while such bonds are absent in other primate societies? Why do some species of primates show marked geographic variability in behavior and social structure? The answers to these and other questions lie in understanding the relationships between each species and its ecological and social setting and in understanding each species' phylogenetic history. Explores the diversity of primate social systems and the evolutionary relationships among the primates and discusses many of the general ecological laws that have been proposed by evolutionary biologists as the keys to understanding important features of primate behavior and ecology.    Health and Disease in Human Evolution    ANTH-UA 55 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Ant\u00f3n, Disotell. 4 points.    Examines human health and disease within an ecological framework, exploring the interactions  of environmental, genetic, physiological, and cultural factors in the expression and distribution of human diseases.

Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2). Offered periodically. 4 points. Increased   social and communicative complexity is one of the defining features of   humans compared to other mammals. Key insights into the evolution of   human communication can come from studying our most closely related   extant relatives, our fellow members of the Primate order. The present   course features a mixture of lectures and discussion classes to consider   contemporary topics in primate (including human) communication. Topics   covered include definitions of communication and consideration of its   major theoretical issues such as the difference between signals and   cues, signal honesty, and concepts of signal information content and   evolutionary signal design. Sections of the class focus on communication   in different sensory modalities\u2014olfactory, auditory, and visual, as   well as multimodal communication\u2014before discussing theories and issues   related to the evolution of language. The class finishes by considering   some of the most contemporary topics in primate communication.    Emerging Diseases    ANTH-UA 80 Disotell, Harrison. 4 points.   Integrates evolutionary biology, genetics, immunology, ecology, and behavioral ecology, along with sociocultural anthropology, politics, and economics, to better understand newly emerging and reemerging diseases as they affect human health.
