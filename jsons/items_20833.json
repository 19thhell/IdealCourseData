Frequently Asked Questions       Why will NYU no longer accept payment by credit card for charges on the student bill through an outside vendor?    Through discussion with the providers of this service within the last few months, the interpretation of New York State law made it clear that a &ldquo;convenience fee&rdquo; could not be added to credit card transactions. NYU will, therefore, no longer utilize the &ldquo;convenience fee model&rdquo; for the payment of charges on the student bill. Our conversations with a number of New York State universities indicate they are doing likewise.      Did NYU make this change to save money?    No. The convenience fee added to credit card transactions by the third party vendor service is retained by them. NYU receives no portion of the fee.      Why can't NYU accept credit cards directly?    Organizations that accept credit cards as a method of payment for goods and services are charged an &ldquo;interchange fee&rdquo; by credit card providers. This is separate and apart from any interest or finance charges that cardholder&rsquo;s pay when carrying a balance on the card. When NYU accepted credit cards directly, prior to the summer of 2002, these fees were costing the University millions of dollars per year.        This change affects my ability to pay my student bill. What can I do?       NYU offers several payment plans to assist in either budgeting or financing your education. For additional information, please visit the Bursar website at: http://www.nyu.edu/bursar/paymentplans       You may also contact the Office of Financial Aid at (212) 998-4444, financial.aid@nyu.edu , or visit the Office of Financial Aid at the Student Services Center at 25 West 4th Street. While NYU cannot guarantee additional funding, there may be other options or resources available to you that you may not have considered or of which you are not aware. Financial Aid counselors are available to guide you through the process.          What can still be paid with a credit card?       Purchases at the NYU Bookstores    Non-Credit tuition payments for the School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS)    Donations to the University    Tickets or other payments for University events    Locker fees at Coles and Palladium       There will not be a convenience fee associated with the use of credit cards for the above mentioned services"}]},

Frequently Asked Questions       Why will NYU no longer accept payment by credit card for charges on the student bill through an outside vendor?    Through discussion with the providers of this service within the last few months, the interpretation of New York State law made it clear that a &ldquo;convenience fee&rdquo; could not be added to credit card transactions. NYU will, therefore, no longer utilize the &ldquo;convenience fee model&rdquo; for the payment of charges on the student bill. Our conversations with a number of New York State universities indicate they are doing likewise.      Did NYU make this change to save money?    No. The convenience fee added to credit card transactions by the third party vendor service is retained by them. NYU receives no portion of the fee.      Why can't NYU accept credit cards directly?    Organizations that accept credit cards as a method of payment for goods and services are charged an &ldquo;interchange fee&rdquo; by credit card providers. This is separate and apart from any interest or finance charges that cardholder&rsquo;s pay when carrying a balance on the card. When NYU accepted credit cards directly, prior to the summer of 2002, these fees were costing the University millions of dollars per year.        This change affects my ability to pay my student bill. What can I do?       NYU offers several payment plans to assist in either budgeting or financing your education.

While NYU cannot guarantee additional funding, there may be other options or resources available to you that you may not have considered or of which you are not aware. Financial Aid counselors are available to guide you through the process.          What can still be paid with a credit card?

This payment option allows you to pay your student account balance in a number of currencies, provides a secure way of initiating payments electronically and incorporates pertinent student information to ensure timely crediting of the payment to the student&rsquo;s bill. NYU and Western Union do not charge a fee for this service; however, you may incur wire transfer fees from your financial institution.    If you want to wire transfer a payment from a U.S. bank account, you may also use this Western Union service; however, we recommend using eCheck in eSuite because it is a less costly and more efficient method for payments from U.S. bank accounts.
