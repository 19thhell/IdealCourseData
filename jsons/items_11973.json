The final section of the course will examine politics as a popular, contemporary genre, especially in film and epic television serials. Examples studied will be Roberto Saviano's hit TV series Come Away With Me (read with Paolo Flores d'Arcais,'s \"Anatomy of Berlusconismo), Armando Iannucci's film In the Loop, and the recent TV series House of Cards. Requirements: One 12-15 page paper and an oral presentation. Students who want to work on a comparative project that brings in film or visual media may do so with instructor's approval.    Introduction to Comp Lit: Necessary Fiction  Basterra We like to think of ourselves as acting freely, creating our own ideas and objects. In other words, we like to think of ourselves as subjects. The self-conscious and autonomous subject constitutes itself in relation to what is \u2018other.\u2019 But what is this \u2018other\u2019? The word \u2018other\u2019 does not always refer to another person: It may also refer to constitutive events, or \u2018necessary fictions.\u2019 These \u2018others\u2019 may be the addressees of our poems, the material and immaterial products of our imaginations, and indeed the otherness we find in ourselves. How do we relate to these \u2018others\u2019? How do desire, action, and ethical duty (but also fate, guilt, and the law), allow us to perceive ourselves as free? We will explore these and other questions as they have been posed in literary works by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Plato, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, Racine, Keats, Poe, Gautier, Baudelaire, Melville, Lorca, Salinas, Kafka, Beckett, paintings by Da Vinci and Vel\u00e1zquez, and philosophical and theoretical writings by Kant, Hegel, Freud, Saussure, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas. Though the tragic fate of Agamemnon or Oedipus appears inevitable, in our reading we explore how fate is a necessary fiction that enables action. Today we have transferred the power of fate onto other essentialized constructs such as the free market, advertising, or intelligence organizations which come to structure our desires and dictate the course of our lives. We will trace how inspiration may be found in negation by reading literary texts on the unknown contents of letters \u2013 as in Poe \u2013or on endless waiting for what will never come\u2014as in Melville and Beckett. Situated at intersection of the different discourses that comprise Comparative Literature \u2013 fiction, poetry, art, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and political theory \u2013 this class aims to problematize the notion of modern subjectivity. Our primary concerns will be at once ethical and poetic: How can what exceeds knowledge and representation signal itself in thought?    Junior Theory Seminar: Philosophy of the Body Bianchi What is a body, and how has the body figured in the history of Western thought? How is the body constituted in relation to its others: mind/spirit/soul? How does the body appear as an object both natural and technological? How do bodies come to bear social and political significance: in relation to sex, gender, class, race, sexuality, and bodily ability among others? How are bodies fashioned and produced by personal and cultural practices? In this class we will address the devaluation of the body and somatophobia in the history of Western philosophy, and track the resurgence of the body in 20th and 21st century thought, including existentialism, phenomenology, feminist theory, race theory, queer theory, disability theory and \u201cnew materialisms.\u201d Lastly, we will examine critical analyses of bodily regimes and practices, which may include (according to class interest) dieting, body modification, bodily violence, medical technologies.  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Comparative Theory and the Intellectual Dopico   Studies in Prose Genres: Autobiography Garcia What is the relationship of autobiographical acts to history? How does the decline of history as an \u201cautonomous and self-authenticating mode of thought,\u201d to borrow from Hayden White, alter how we read autobiographies? Turning to literary analysis, how does autobiography figure in the tasks of autocritique associated with comparative thinking? What happens when we think of autobiographies less as \u201clife stories\u201d and more as \u201cactors,\u201d as Bruno Latour puts it, with which we interact as \u201cco-actors\u201d and by way of complex affects and associations? This course will turn periodically to theorizations of history, selfhood and objecthood. But most of our attention will be devoted to the autobiographical act itself as we explore works by Christopher Isherwood, James Weldon Johnson, Lillian Smith, Anatole Broyard and Jay-Z, among other writers.  Topics: Biopolitics & Violence in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin With the current changes to the world order in general, the economic and sociopolitical situation in Spain in particular, biopolitics\u2014implementing power through the bodies of and generating desired positions for the citizens\u2014offers a critical lens to understand how power operates by convincing, manipulating and criminalizing the masses. Whereas modern biopolitics refers to the State\u2019s ability to insert docile and disciplined bodies into its mechanisms of exercising power (Foucault), it also implies various degrees of violence, exclusion and abjection. Within this framework, this course will explore different forms of biopolitics with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices and as articulated in fiction and film in contemporary Spain. Some of the topics we will attend to include the Spanish Civil War, the Franco regime, nationalism, terrorism, delinquency and crime, and immigration. Primary writers, directors and artists whose works we might examine include: Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Isaac Rosa, Fernando Le\u00f3n de Aranoa, Guillermo del Toro, Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Eloy de la Iglesia, Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Bernardo Atxaga, Bel\u00e9n Gopegui, Iciar Bolla\u00edn, Ricardo Men\u00e9ndez Salm\u00f3n, Chus Guti\u00e9rrez, Manuel Huerga or Agust\u00edn Villaronga. We will examine these literary works together with theoretical readings about biopolitics, violence, war and exclusion, and raise questions about the dynamics in Spain today.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Paranoid Narratives Sanders It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu This course will explore representative works from key moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel, literatura fakta, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression documentary books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films. What accounts for the waxing and waning of the documentary through time, as evident in its recent popularity in American culture? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. Critical and theoretical readings by Eric Barnouw, Roland Barthes, Stella Bruzzi, Jane Gaines, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Barbara Johnson, Bill Nichols, Philip Rosen, Vivian Sobchack, Susan Sontag, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, Edward Said, Alan Sekula, and others.

But most of our attention will be devoted to the autobiographical act itself as we explore works by Christopher Isherwood, James Weldon Johnson, Lillian Smith, Anatole Broyard and Jay-Z, among other writers.  Topics: Biopolitics & Violence in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin With the current changes to the world order in general, the economic and sociopolitical situation in Spain in particular, biopolitics\u2014implementing power through the bodies of and generating desired positions for the citizens\u2014offers a critical lens to understand how power operates by convincing, manipulating and criminalizing the masses. Whereas modern biopolitics refers to the State\u2019s ability to insert docile and disciplined bodies into its mechanisms of exercising power (Foucault), it also implies various degrees of violence, exclusion and abjection. Within this framework, this course will explore different forms of biopolitics with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices and as articulated in fiction and film in contemporary Spain. Some of the topics we will attend to include the Spanish Civil War, the Franco regime, nationalism, terrorism, delinquency and crime, and immigration. Primary writers, directors and artists whose works we might examine include: Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Isaac Rosa, Fernando Le\u00f3n de Aranoa, Guillermo del Toro, Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Eloy de la Iglesia, Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Bernardo Atxaga, Bel\u00e9n Gopegui, Iciar Bolla\u00edn, Ricardo Men\u00e9ndez Salm\u00f3n, Chus Guti\u00e9rrez, Manuel Huerga or Agust\u00edn Villaronga. We will examine these literary works together with theoretical readings about biopolitics, violence, war and exclusion, and raise questions about the dynamics in Spain today.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Paranoid Narratives Sanders It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu This course will explore representative works from key moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel, literatura fakta, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression documentary books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films. What accounts for the waxing and waning of the documentary through time, as evident in its recent popularity in American culture? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. Critical and theoretical readings by Eric Barnouw, Roland Barthes, Stella Bruzzi, Jane Gaines, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Barbara Johnson, Bill Nichols, Philip Rosen, Vivian Sobchack, Susan Sontag, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, Edward Said, Alan Sekula, and others.

This semester\u2019s special topics are 1) the archive and 2) word/image relations.

Topics in Early Modern Written Culture: Literary Matter: The Lucretian Tradition in European Modernity  Lezra     Studies in Prose Genres: J.M. Coetzee &amp; Metafiction Sanders When J.M. Coetzee received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003, he stunned the Swedish Academy in Stockholm by presenting not the customary lecture, but a story. In this tale, entitled \u201cHe and His Man,\u201d Robinson Crusoe sends reports to his \u201cman,\u201d whom Coetzee\u2019s audience recognizes as being Daniel Defoe, since the reports appear to come from books authored by Defoe. The relationship of character and author is turned inside out, in an exciting metafictional performance that also places in question the conventional boundaries of the lecture. The Swedish audience should not have been stunned, however, for some of J.M. Coetzee\u2019s most recent novels, Summertime, Slow Man, and Elizabeth Costello have, in different ways, foregrounded the mechanics of fiction-making typically concealed by the realist novel. Concentrating on these works, as well as Coetzee\u2019s early novels, in which metafiction is the dominant mode for interrogating colonial literary genres, and drawing comparisons with the fiction of Italo Calvino, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Zo\u00eb Wicomb, while at the same time availing ourselves of relevant narrative theory (Mieke Bal, Roland Barthes) and critical commentary (Attwell, Attridge, Spivak, Wicomb), the seminar will explore the aesthetic, ethical and political implications of a writer putting the inner workings of his or her craft on open display. The seminar will culminate with a roundtable on Coetzee\u2019s enigmatic new novel, The Childhood of Jesus.    Interdisciplinary Approaches to Literature: Literary &amp; Performance Theory in Contemporary Black Studies Garcia &amp; Nyong\u2019o This reading-intensive seminar in contemporary black studies ranges across several disciplinary formations and is designed for students seeking to deepen existing knowledge of scholarship and theory related to black writing and expressive cultures, and as an immersion in these literatures for those seeking to hydridize black studies and/or black Atlantic theory with other areas of research. Throughout, we devote attention to key texts from the archive of \u201cblack Atlantic\u201d thought and consider theoretical problems in the field of black studies.  Special Topics in Theory: Does the World Still Appear to Us? Basterra &amp; Iampolski Starting from the beginning of the 20th century Western philosophy renewed its attempts to think the incorporation of human beings into the world. World became an important philosophical category. For Kant World, Nature were only regulative ideas necessary for producing objects of thought, but for thinkers like Husserl or Heidegger our incorporation into the world is a part of what makes us human. The ideas of biologist Jacob von Uexk\u00fcll and his vision of animals as a part of their surrounding (Umwelt) were adopted by philosophical anthropology. Phenomenology analyzes the way the world is revealed to us and opens up its meaning. Its coming is always a meaningful appearance. Nowadays, however, the immediacy of our relation to the world seems to withdraw due to the decay of live experience, the proliferation of media and technology. We live in a world of growing mediations that force the world into a kind of transcendence. This seminar will focus on a history of our relations with the World, question those relations, and ask whether we live in a post-phenomenological age, whether the world still appears to us.    Romanticism and Revolution Sieburth This course will explore various literary &amp; philosophical reactions to the French Revolution in late 18th and early 19th century Germany, England, and France. Is revolution to be understood as a form of repetition or a mode of radical inception? What kind of \u201cmourning sickness\u201d (Comoy) does it induce? Primary readings will include Burke (on the French Revolution &amp; the Sublime), Schiller (On the Aesthetic Education of Man), Frederich Schlegel (Philsophical Fragments), Lacoue-Labarthe &amp; Nancy, The Literary Absolute, Comay on Hegel &amp; the French Revolution, H\u00f6lderlin (Hyperion &amp; selected late hymns), Blake (his prophetic cycle of the early 1790s), Wordsworth (selections from The Prelude), Hugo (his Gothic romance about the (Haitian) Revolution, Bug-Jargal), selections from Joseph de Maistre, &amp; B\u00fcchner (Danton\u2019s Death).    The Nature of Tragedy: Tragedy and the 19th &amp; 20th Century Receptions Bianchi Greek tragedy has had a string of remarkable afterlives in recent centuries. In this course, we will undertake close readings of Greek tragedy, with particular focus on the Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus cycle (Oedipus Tyrranos, Oedipus at Colonus, Antigone) and the Oresteia (Agamemnon, Libation-Bearers, Eumenides). We will examine the role and reception of Greek tragedy in 19th century German thought (Hegel, H\u00f6lderlin, Nietzsche), the intense engagement with classical antiquity in Freud, uptakes of Greek tragedy in 20th century French thought (Lacan, Irigaray, Derrida), as well as 20th century postcolonial receptions of the Oedipus cycle. Some questions on the table will be: What constitutes the lure or persistence of these tales? How does Greek tragedy lend itself to nationalist narratives and projects? How does tragedy work to consolidate and/or undermine patriarchal gender relations?                   Back to Top                     Contact us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
