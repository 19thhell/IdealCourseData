Both undergraduate and graduate composers enjoy the benefits of working in an intimate conservatory setting surrounded by superb performers. The programs live within a large and enriching university environment in the heart of New York City. The undergraduate program offers excellent instruction in musicianship, music history, theory, and technology along with regular readings and performances of new works culminating in portrait concerts during students' junior and senior years. Undergraduate Composition students have performances of their works by an outstanding variety of department performance groups, students, and faculty.    The Steinhardt graduate program offers two distinct but complementary tracks of study in concert and film music. Students from the two disciplines study side by side and are encouraged to take advantage of these specializations, which are supported by an internationally acclaimed faculty representing diverse styles. Graduate film composers are presented in yearly concerts at venues such as The Walter Reade Theatre in collaboration with The Film Society of Lincoln Center, The National Gallery in Washington D.C., the Tribeca Film Festival and intensive film scoring workshops in collaboration with ASCAP . Graduate concert composers participate in a yearlong course in writing for string quartet, which culminates in a performance of their works by the JACK Quartet in a public New York City venue. In addition they have the opportunity to hear their music in concerts throughout the year as well as on portrait concerts of their works at the end of their second year. All composition students have access to all departments at the university and collaborations with choreographers, visual artists, writers, filmmakers, and scholars in other fields are encouraged.    The faculty includes Robert Rowe, Julia Wolfe, Ron Sadoff, Ira Newborn, Michael Gordon, Justin Dello Joio, Mark Snow, Sonny Kompanek, Mark Suozzo, Youngmi Ha, and Tae Hong Park, among others. Guest composers in the last two years have included Steve Reich, Bruce Broughton, Louis Andriessen, Mark Isham, Meredith Monk, Jimmy Webb, DJ Spooky, Carter Burwell, Uri Caine, Morton Subotnick, Don Byron, Martin Bresnick, and more.    The Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions offers a warm and collegial atmosphere. Compositions students enjoy the support of all of the faculty and their peers. Our reputation, faculty, and location provide students with a unique opportunity to develop as composers and gain an understanding of how to pursue a career in music composition.

This will help the  DUGS attend to your questions promptly. Please address all inquiries to         music.dugs@nyu.edu .                   Q: What  undergraduate courses are currently offered in the CAS Department of  Music?          Current  Course Offerings                   Q: How do I  obtain an access code to register for a class?   Access codes can be obtained from Pauline Lum (pl56@nyu.edu).                   Q: How do I  obtain an access code for a class with pre-requisites?   If you have fulfilled the pre-requisites for a course, you will be able  to register once you obtain an access code.            If you have not fulfilled the pre-requisites but would still like to  register for the course, you must contact the instructor for  permission. If he or she waives the pre-requisite for you, you must  then contact Pauline Lum (pl56@nyu.edu) and she will register you for  the course. Please cc the instructor on any correspondence with Ms.Lum.                   Q: How long will it take for changes in my  major/minor status to appear on ALBERT?   Please keep in mind that, if your request requires that information  (i.e. declaration of major/minor, cancellation or change to major/minor  status) be entered into the Student Information System by the DUGS or  the Registrar, this information can take AT LEAST ONE WEEK to appear on  ALBERT.             Q: When do I declare a music major/minor?   Typically, a major/minor is declared between your sophomore and junior  years.  It is best to declare early in the spring semester.                  Q: Can  I have two or more majors/minors?         Yes, you can, although having more than  two majors/minors is discouraged.            If you intend to have two majors, you must decide which is your  \"primary major.\" The advisor in the department of your primary major is  responsible for declaring both majors. You should, however, maintain  contact with the advisor of your second major so he or she can monitor  the completion of your major requirements.            If you already have a minor, the music DUGS cannot declare you on  the Student Information System, but he or she will write a  memo to the registrar to declare your second minor. Please notify  the  DUGS that you already have a declared minor.                   Q: How do I declare a music major/minor?    For CAS students:       Majors and Minors are declared through  the Department of Music DUGS (except for seniors )    Send the DUGS your student ID number and a list of classes that you may have taken toward the major/minor (see below for a list of courses that fulfill the major/minor requirements).    If you have questions about whether or not a particular class counts toward the major/minor, please e-mail the DUGS.    The DUGS will declare you as a major/minor using the online Student  Information System. Please note that it takes up to a week for the  major/minor to appear on ALBERT.      If you are a senior:       Send  the DUGS for student ID number and a list of classes that you  may have taken toward the major/minor.    The  DUGS will write a memo to the registrar's office, which will be  responsible for declaring your major/minor.       For non-CAS  Students (minor only):       Get  a minor declaration form from your host school (e.g. Steinhardt,  Tisch).    Have  your advisor at your host school sign this form to approve your minor.    Write out the list of classes that you expect to take toward the  minor.    Bring the form to the Department of Music DUGS (you may leave the form  with Ms. Pauline Lum) to sign. Once the form has been signed, you may  pick the form up from Ms. Lum and take it back to your host school.    The  DUGS will write a memo to the registrar's office, which will be  responsible for declaring your minor.                        Q: What is required to major in music?   The major consists of 40 course credits, usually distributed across 10  classes of four credits each. All departmental courses must be  passed with a grade of \"C\" or  better to count toward the major.       Harmony and Counterpoint I-IV (V71.0201-0204)*    Two courses from History of European Music (V71.0101-0104)    Four other courses, numbered above V71.0100, one of which must be in Ethnomusicology    Up to four ensemble or performance credits may be applied toward the major.    Sample Major  Course Schedule          Current Course  Offerings                   Q: What is required to minor in music?   The minor consists of 16 course credits,  usually distributed across four classes of four credits each.      Elements of Music*    One course in Music History (Western Art Music)    One course in Ethnomusicology    The fourth course may be chosen from Music Theory, Music History or Ethnomusicology    Up to four ensemble or performance credits may be applied toward the minor.        *Note: If you can already read music, know the basic rudiments such as scales,  key signatures, intervals, chord construction principles, meter  signatures, and basic rhythmic notation, you can take Harmony and  Counterpoint I, a more advanced class. This class is offered only  in the fall semester and requires an access code in order to register.  To get an access code for this course, write to the DUGS explaining  your background in music theory. When the DUGS replies with an  approval, write to Pauline Lum (pl56@nyu.edu) to request an access  code, making sure to cc the DUGS on your message to Pauline.                   Q: Can I place  out of Harmony and Counterpoint I?   In order to place out of Harmony and Counterpoint I, you must take a  diagnostic exam. This exam can be scheduled by contacting the DUGS. The  one and a half hour exam will be taken in the department and students  will not have access to a piano during the exam. Exam results will be  available one week after completing the exam.                   Q:  Do I get credit toward the major/minor if I place out of Elements of  Music?         No, you must take another class instead,  typically the first Harmony and Counterpoint class (offered in the fall  semester only).             Q: Do I need to pass a piano proficiency exam in order to major/minor  in music?         No. This is no longer a requirement of  the major/minor.             Q: Do honors classes fulfill major/minor requirements?         Yes, but permission to register must be  obtained from the instructor, and an access code requested from Pauline  Lum ( pl56@nyu.edu ).             Q: Can I take graduate level courses in order to fulfill major  requirements?         A student will be permitted to enroll in  a graduate level course only in the most exceptional circumstances. The  student must first obtain permission of the instructor of the course  and then notify the DUGS,             Q:  How do I get credit for classes taken outside of CAS?         Send an e-mail to the DUGS that includes  details about the course, the course number, when you took the course  and what your grade was.             Q: How many credits can I get toward the minor from schools other than  CAS?         No more than eight credits.             Q: May I take instrumental or voice lessons for credit toward a music  major or minor?   You can receive a maximum of four  credits for lessons taken at Steinhardt (they can be two-, three- or  four-credit lessons).            Please visit Steinhardt's Department  of Music and Performing Arts Professions web site for details on  how to enroll in lessons.             Q: May I participate in performance ensembles for credit toward a music  major/minor?   You can receive a maximum of four credits for participation in  ensembles (choir, orchestra, jazz band or combo, chamber music, etc.)  through Steinhardt or ensembles organized within the Department of  Music.            Please visit Steinhardt's Ensembles  &amp; Auditions web site for more information.                   Q: How  do I  cancel my music major or minor?   Write an e-mail to the DUGS, stating that you would like to cancel your  major or minor. He or she will officially cancel your major/minor.                   Back to top.                                   Study Abroad   Credits toward the major and minor can be taken while studying abroad.  Typically,  students take one or two classes toward the major, one in music history  and one elective.            Notice that CAS Harmony &amp; Counterpoint courses are not offered abroad, and  that study abroad may interupt/delay your Harmony &amp; Counterpoint  sequence. In some cases, students may take one of Steinhardt's theory  courses while abroad in order to fulfill the major requirement. Please  contact the DUGS if you would like to pursue this option.                  You must obtain preapproval from the  DUGS for classes that you plan to take while abroad.                           Back to top.                                   Independent Studies         Independent studies are usually taken  during your senior year, although exceptions are made for juniors.  These courses are rare and only the most promising, disciplined, and  independent students earn the right to carry them out.            To propose an independent study:                  Typically,        students  who enroll in independent studies also apply to graduate with honors.                Write to the DUGS with a proposal for the study that  includes:         A brief description of the topic    A brief description of the status of research on the topic (who has said what, when, on the topic of your choice)    why you would want to pursue this topic  at this stage    A list of the reading materials along with a schedule for completing the reading    The name or names of professor with whom you may have discussed your ideas for the independent study (indicate whether or not you have asked a professor to sponsor your independent study)           Independent studies can be taken for one or two semesters.    Independent studies beginning in the fall semester are proposed mid- to late-spring semester. The department discourages Spring semester only independent studies.           Back to top.                                   Internships         The department sponsors internships only  for music major and minors.                  To propose an  internship:                Write to the DUGS with the name of the sponsor, an  explanation of your duties and their relation to the degree.    Your sponsor will be responsible for writing two reports,  one at mid-term and one at the semester's end. The first report can be  an e-mail simply stating whether or not you are satisfactorily  fulfilling your duties. The second report must be on letterhead and  signed by your sponsor. It should evaluate your performance in more  detail than the mid-term report. Have your sponsor mail this to the  music DUGS.    It  is your responsibility to make sure that the reports are sent in time  for the DUGS to submit your grade to the registrar.    No  credit is given toward the major or minor for internships.                         Back to top.                                   Honors   Only students with a Grade Point Average of 3.65 or above are eligible  to graduate with honors. The requirements are as follows:                Two honors-level courses , at least one of which must  be an Honors Seminar (V71.0901), taken during the junior or  senior  year. The other may be an additional honors seminar or an indepedent  study, approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies.    A capstone project, which is an extended, original  research project carried out through the senior  year    For  guidelines as to how to propose a project, please refer to the  guidelines for proposing an independent study (see above).    Submission of the honors  portfolio to the DUGS by April 1 of the student's  senior year, or November 20 if graduating in January.                         Back to top.                                   Transfering Students         There is a procedure that must be  followed in order for the registrar to transfer credits. This applies  to students transferring internally (between NYU schools - for example,  from Steinhardt to CAS or from Tisch to CAS) or externally (from  another university or college to NYU).                After meeting with the DUGS, the student will receive a memo from  the DUGS (addressed to CAS advising and Graduation Services) stating  which  transfer credits can be applied toward the music major or minor, and  which requirements they fulfill.    The  student must take this memo to CAS advising. The advisor will  write a memo to Graduation Services,  stating how many credits the student may transfer overall.    Graduation Services will enter this  information into the  system so the credits appear on the student's transcript.                      Back to top.                                           Advanced  Placement Credits for Entering Freshmen         Usually, high AP scores in music theory  translate into being able to register for Harmony and Counterpoint I.  If you feel qualified to be exempt from this class, you may take a  diagnostic exam that is equivalent to the final exam for Harmony and  Counterpoint I.

Both undergraduate and graduate composers enjoy the benefits of working in an intimate conservatory setting surrounded by superb performers. The programs live within a large and enriching university environment in the heart of New York City. The undergraduate program offers excellent instruction in musicianship, music history, theory, and technology along with regular readings and performances of new works culminating in portrait concerts during students' junior and senior years. Undergraduate Composition students have performances of their works by an outstanding variety of department performance groups, students, and faculty.    The Steinhardt graduate program offers two distinct but complementary tracks of study in concert and film music. Students from the two disciplines study side by side and are encouraged to take advantage of these specializations, which are supported by an internationally acclaimed faculty representing diverse styles. Graduate film composers are presented in yearly concerts at venues such as The Walter Reade Theatre in collaboration with The Film Society of Lincoln Center, The National Gallery in Washington D.C., the Tribeca Film Festival and intensive film scoring workshops in collaboration with ASCAP . Graduate concert composers participate in a yearlong course in writing for string quartet, which culminates in a performance of their works by the JACK Quartet in a public New York City venue. In addition they have the opportunity to hear their music in concerts throughout the year as well as on portrait concerts of their works at the end of their second year. All composition students have access to all departments at the university and collaborations with choreographers, visual artists, writers, filmmakers, and scholars in other fields are encouraged.    The faculty includes Robert Rowe, Julia Wolfe, Ron Sadoff, Ira Newborn, Michael Gordon, Justin Dello Joio, Mark Snow, Sonny Kompanek, Mark Suozzo, Youngmi Ha, and Tae Hong Park, among others. Guest composers in the last two years have included Steve Reich, Bruce Broughton, Louis Andriessen, Mark Isham, Meredith Monk, Jimmy Webb, DJ Spooky, Carter Burwell, Uri Caine, Morton Subotnick, Don Byron, Martin Bresnick, and more.    The Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions offers a warm and collegial atmosphere. Compositions students enjoy the support of all of the faculty and their peers. Our reputation, faculty, and location provide students with a unique opportunity to develop as composers and gain an understanding of how to pursue a career in music composition.

This will help the  DUGS attend to your questions promptly. Please address all inquiries to         music.dugs@nyu.edu .                   Q: What  undergraduate courses are currently offered in the CAS Department of  Music?          Current  Course Offerings                   Q: How do I  obtain an access code to register for a class?   Access codes can be obtained from Pauline Lum (pl56@nyu.edu).                   Q: How do I  obtain an access code for a class with pre-requisites?   If you have fulfilled the pre-requisites for a course, you will be able  to register once you obtain an access code.            If you have not fulfilled the pre-requisites but would still like to  register for the course, you must contact the instructor for  permission. If he or she waives the pre-requisite for you, you must  then contact Pauline Lum (pl56@nyu.edu) and she will register you for  the course. Please cc the instructor on any correspondence with Ms.Lum.                   Q: How long will it take for changes in my  major/minor status to appear on ALBERT?   Please keep in mind that, if your request requires that information  (i.e. declaration of major/minor, cancellation or change to major/minor  status) be entered into the Student Information System by the DUGS or  the Registrar, this information can take AT LEAST ONE WEEK to appear on  ALBERT.             Q: When do I declare a music major/minor?   Typically, a major/minor is declared between your sophomore and junior  years.  It is best to declare early in the spring semester.                  Q: Can  I have two or more majors/minors?         Yes, you can, although having more than  two majors/minors is discouraged.            If you intend to have two majors, you must decide which is your  \"primary major.\" The advisor in the department of your primary major is  responsible for declaring both majors. You should, however, maintain  contact with the advisor of your second major so he or she can monitor  the completion of your major requirements.            If you already have a minor, the music DUGS cannot declare you on  the Student Information System, but he or she will write a  memo to the registrar to declare your second minor. Please notify  the  DUGS that you already have a declared minor.                   Q: How do I declare a music major/minor?    For CAS students:       Majors and Minors are declared through  the Department of Music DUGS (except for seniors )    Send the DUGS your student ID number and a list of classes that you may have taken toward the major/minor (see below for a list of courses that fulfill the major/minor requirements).    If you have questions about whether or not a particular class counts toward the major/minor, please e-mail the DUGS.    The DUGS will declare you as a major/minor using the online Student  Information System. Please note that it takes up to a week for the  major/minor to appear on ALBERT.      If you are a senior:       Send  the DUGS for student ID number and a list of classes that you  may have taken toward the major/minor.    The  DUGS will write a memo to the registrar's office, which will be  responsible for declaring your major/minor.       For non-CAS  Students (minor only):       Get  a minor declaration form from your host school (e.g. Steinhardt,  Tisch).    Have  your advisor at your host school sign this form to approve your minor.    Write out the list of classes that you expect to take toward the  minor.    Bring the form to the Department of Music DUGS (you may leave the form  with Ms. Pauline Lum) to sign. Once the form has been signed, you may  pick the form up from Ms. Lum and take it back to your host school.    The  DUGS will write a memo to the registrar's office, which will be  responsible for declaring your minor.                        Q: What is required to major in music?   The major consists of 40 course credits, usually distributed across 10  classes of four credits each. All departmental courses must be  passed with a grade of \"C\" or  better to count toward the major.       Harmony and Counterpoint I-IV (V71.0201-0204)*    Two courses from History of European Music (V71.0101-0104)    Four other courses, numbered above V71.0100, one of which must be in Ethnomusicology    Up to four ensemble or performance credits may be applied toward the major.    Sample Major  Course Schedule          Current Course  Offerings                   Q: What is required to minor in music?   The minor consists of 16 course credits,  usually distributed across four classes of four credits each.      Elements of Music*    One course in Music History (Western Art Music)    One course in Ethnomusicology    The fourth course may be chosen from Music Theory, Music History or Ethnomusicology    Up to four ensemble or performance credits may be applied toward the minor.        *Note: If you can already read music, know the basic rudiments such as scales,  key signatures, intervals, chord construction principles, meter  signatures, and basic rhythmic notation, you can take Harmony and  Counterpoint I, a more advanced class. This class is offered only  in the fall semester and requires an access code in order to register.  To get an access code for this course, write to the DUGS explaining  your background in music theory. When the DUGS replies with an  approval, write to Pauline Lum (pl56@nyu.edu) to request an access  code, making sure to cc the DUGS on your message to Pauline.                   Q: Can I place  out of Harmony and Counterpoint I?   In order to place out of Harmony and Counterpoint I, you must take a  diagnostic exam. This exam can be scheduled by contacting the DUGS. The  one and a half hour exam will be taken in the department and students  will not have access to a piano during the exam. Exam results will be  available one week after completing the exam.                   Q:  Do I get credit toward the major/minor if I place out of Elements of  Music?         No, you must take another class instead,  typically the first Harmony and Counterpoint class (offered in the fall  semester only).             Q: Do I need to pass a piano proficiency exam in order to major/minor  in music?         No. This is no longer a requirement of  the major/minor.             Q: Do honors classes fulfill major/minor requirements?         Yes, but permission to register must be  obtained from the instructor, and an access code requested from Pauline  Lum ( pl56@nyu.edu ).             Q: Can I take graduate level courses in order to fulfill major  requirements?         A student will be permitted to enroll in  a graduate level course only in the most exceptional circumstances. The  student must first obtain permission of the instructor of the course  and then notify the DUGS,             Q:  How do I get credit for classes taken outside of CAS?         Send an e-mail to the DUGS that includes  details about the course, the course number, when you took the course  and what your grade was.             Q: How many credits can I get toward the minor from schools other than  CAS?         No more than eight credits.             Q: May I take instrumental or voice lessons for credit toward a music  major or minor?   You can receive a maximum of four  credits for lessons taken at Steinhardt (they can be two-, three- or  four-credit lessons).            Please visit Steinhardt's Department  of Music and Performing Arts Professions web site for details on  how to enroll in lessons.             Q: May I participate in performance ensembles for credit toward a music  major/minor?   You can receive a maximum of four credits for participation in  ensembles (choir, orchestra, jazz band or combo, chamber music, etc.)  through Steinhardt or ensembles organized within the Department of  Music.            Please visit Steinhardt's Ensembles  &amp; Auditions web site for more information.                   Q: How  do I  cancel my music major or minor?   Write an e-mail to the DUGS, stating that you would like to cancel your  major or minor. He or she will officially cancel your major/minor.                   Back to top.                                   Study Abroad   Credits toward the major and minor can be taken while studying abroad.  Typically,  students take one or two classes toward the major, one in music history  and one elective.            Notice that CAS Harmony &amp; Counterpoint courses are not offered abroad, and  that study abroad may interupt/delay your Harmony &amp; Counterpoint  sequence. In some cases, students may take one of Steinhardt's theory  courses while abroad in order to fulfill the major requirement. Please  contact the DUGS if you would like to pursue this option.                  You must obtain preapproval from the  DUGS for classes that you plan to take while abroad.                           Back to top.                                   Independent Studies         Independent studies are usually taken  during your senior year, although exceptions are made for juniors.  These courses are rare and only the most promising, disciplined, and  independent students earn the right to carry them out.            To propose an independent study:                  Typically,        students  who enroll in independent studies also apply to graduate with honors.                Write to the DUGS with a proposal for the study that  includes:         A brief description of the topic    A brief description of the status of research on the topic (who has said what, when, on the topic of your choice)    why you would want to pursue this topic  at this stage    A list of the reading materials along with a schedule for completing the reading    The name or names of professor with whom you may have discussed your ideas for the independent study (indicate whether or not you have asked a professor to sponsor your independent study)           Independent studies can be taken for one or two semesters.    Independent studies beginning in the fall semester are proposed mid- to late-spring semester. The department discourages Spring semester only independent studies.           Back to top.                                   Internships         The department sponsors internships only  for music major and minors.                  To propose an  internship:                Write to the DUGS with the name of the sponsor, an  explanation of your duties and their relation to the degree.    Your sponsor will be responsible for writing two reports,  one at mid-term and one at the semester's end. The first report can be  an e-mail simply stating whether or not you are satisfactorily  fulfilling your duties. The second report must be on letterhead and  signed by your sponsor. It should evaluate your performance in more  detail than the mid-term report. Have your sponsor mail this to the  music DUGS.    It  is your responsibility to make sure that the reports are sent in time  for the DUGS to submit your grade to the registrar.    No  credit is given toward the major or minor for internships.                         Back to top.                                   Honors   Only students with a Grade Point Average of 3.65 or above are eligible  to graduate with honors. The requirements are as follows:                Two honors-level courses , at least one of which must  be an Honors Seminar (V71.0901), taken during the junior or  senior  year. The other may be an additional honors seminar or an indepedent  study, approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies.    A capstone project, which is an extended, original  research project carried out through the senior  year    For  guidelines as to how to propose a project, please refer to the  guidelines for proposing an independent study (see above).    Submission of the honors  portfolio to the DUGS by April 1 of the student's  senior year, or November 20 if graduating in January.                         Back to top.                                   Transfering Students         There is a procedure that must be  followed in order for the registrar to transfer credits. This applies  to students transferring internally (between NYU schools - for example,  from Steinhardt to CAS or from Tisch to CAS) or externally (from  another university or college to NYU).                After meeting with the DUGS, the student will receive a memo from  the DUGS (addressed to CAS advising and Graduation Services) stating  which  transfer credits can be applied toward the music major or minor, and  which requirements they fulfill.    The  student must take this memo to CAS advising. The advisor will  write a memo to Graduation Services,  stating how many credits the student may transfer overall.    Graduation Services will enter this  information into the  system so the credits appear on the student's transcript.                      Back to top.                                           Advanced  Placement Credits for Entering Freshmen         Usually, high AP scores in music theory  translate into being able to register for Harmony and Counterpoint I.  If you feel qualified to be exempt from this class, you may take a  diagnostic exam that is equivalent to the final exam for Harmony and  Counterpoint I. If you pass the exam, you may then register for Harmony  and Counterpoint II. Please note that Harmony and Counterpoint II is  only offered in the Spring semester.

Students have the option to receive introductory music business training or learn about the history and culture of creative entrepreneurs in recorded music. Students are also introduced to the tools and techniques of recording and begin to use the recording studio as their creative laboratory. In the second year, students deepen their understanding of the art and business of creating and selling recorded music. Students have the opportunity to study the \u201cartist,\u201d how musical talent is identified and cultivated, how material is selected and arranged, how a complete album is constructed in the studio and how the audience and artist have historically influenced each other. Upon completion of a second year review, students work closely with their faculty advisor to develop a personalized course of study focusing on their area of interest. During the third and fourth years, students may pursue advanced level study in business, production, history &amp; criticism, or musicianship via courses offered through the department, as well as through the Stern School of Business, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development, and the College of Arts and Sciences. Also, during their third year, students have the opportunity to study abroad in one of Tisch's study abroad programs, or participate in the department\u2019s required internship program. The \ufb01nal year culminates with the Capstone Project in which students develop a full creative plan to launch themselves as entrepreneurs. Projects have included launching a record label, creating a production company, developing a new media company, and starting an innovative music venue. As is the case with all Tisch programs, professional training is combined with a solid liberal arts education. In addition to the 58 points taken within the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, students are expected to earn a total of 44 general education points in courses offered by Tisch and the College of Arts and Science. Students also complement their study with 26 points in elective courses taken in the areas of their interest.    Internship Opportunites    Students have the opportunity to complete an industry internship at an established, institutional record company such as Universal or Mercury Records; an independent production company such as Epitaph Records; a trade publication such as Billboard or Impact ; a trade broadcast company such as VH1 or MTV; or a music recording association such as the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM), or the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Q: How do I  obtain an access code for a class with pre-requisites?   If you have fulfilled the pre-requisites for a course, you will be able  to register once you obtain an access code.            If you have not fulfilled the pre-requisites but would still like to  register for the course, you must contact the instructor for  permission. If he or she waives the pre-requisite for you, you must  then contact Pauline Lum (pl56@nyu.edu) and she will register you for  the course.

Please keep in mind that, if your request requires that information  (i.e. declaration of major/minor, cancellation or change to major/minor  status) be entered into the Student Information System by the DUGS or  the Registrar, this information can take AT LEAST ONE WEEK to appear on  ALBERT.             Q: When do I declare a music major/minor?   Typically, a major/minor is declared between your sophomore and junior  years.  It is best to declare early in the spring semester.                  Q: Can  I have two or more majors/minors?         Yes, you can, although having more than  two majors/minors is discouraged.            If you intend to have two majors, you must decide which is your  \"primary major.\" The advisor in the department of your primary major is  responsible for declaring both majors. You should, however, maintain  contact with the advisor of your second major so he or she can monitor  the completion of your major requirements.            If you already have a minor, the music DUGS cannot declare you on  the Student Information System, but he or she will write a  memo to the registrar to declare your second minor. Please notify  the  DUGS that you already have a declared minor.                   Q: How do I declare a music major/minor?    For CAS students:       Majors and Minors are declared through  the Department of Music DUGS (except for seniors )    Send the DUGS your student ID number and a list of classes that you may have taken toward the major/minor (see below for a list of courses that fulfill the major/minor requirements).    If you have questions about whether or not a particular class counts toward the major/minor, please e-mail the DUGS.    The DUGS will declare you as a major/minor using the online Student  Information System. Please note that it takes up to a week for the  major/minor to appear on ALBERT.      If you are a senior:       Send  the DUGS for student ID number and a list of classes that you  may have taken toward the major/minor.    The  DUGS will write a memo to the registrar's office, which will be  responsible for declaring your major/minor.       For non-CAS  Students (minor only):       Get  a minor declaration form from your host school (e.g. Steinhardt,  Tisch).    Have  your advisor at your host school sign this form to approve your minor.    Write out the list of classes that you expect to take toward the  minor.    Bring the form to the Department of Music DUGS (you may leave the form  with Ms. Pauline Lum) to sign. Once the form has been signed, you may  pick the form up from Ms. Lum and take it back to your host school.    The  DUGS will write a memo to the registrar's office, which will be  responsible for declaring your minor.                        Q: What is required to major in music?   The major consists of 40 course credits, usually distributed across 10  classes of four credits each. All departmental courses must be  passed with a grade of \"C\" or  better to count toward the major.       Harmony and Counterpoint I-IV (V71.0201-0204)*    Two courses from History of European Music (V71.0101-0104)    Four other courses, numbered above V71.0100, one of which must be in Ethnomusicology    Up to four ensemble or performance credits may be applied toward the major.    Sample Major  Course Schedule          Current Course  Offerings                   Q: What is required to minor in music?   The minor consists of 16 course credits,  usually distributed across four classes of four credits each.      Elements of Music*    One course in Music History (Western Art Music)    One course in Ethnomusicology    The fourth course may be chosen from Music Theory, Music History or Ethnomusicology    Up to four ensemble or performance credits may be applied toward the minor.        *Note: If you can already read music, know the basic rudiments such as scales,  key signatures, intervals, chord construction principles, meter  signatures, and basic rhythmic notation, you can take Harmony and  Counterpoint I, a more advanced class. This class is offered only  in the fall semester and requires an access code in order to register.  To get an access code for this course, write to the DUGS explaining  your background in music theory. When the DUGS replies with an  approval, write to Pauline Lum (pl56@nyu.edu) to request an access  code, making sure to cc the DUGS on your message to Pauline.                   Q: Can I place  out of Harmony and Counterpoint I?   In order to place out of Harmony and Counterpoint I, you must take a  diagnostic exam. This exam can be scheduled by contacting the DUGS. The  one and a half hour exam will be taken in the department and students  will not have access to a piano during the exam. Exam results will be  available one week after completing the exam.                   Q:  Do I get credit toward the major/minor if I place out of Elements of  Music?         No, you must take another class instead,  typically the first Harmony and Counterpoint class (offered in the fall  semester only).             Q: Do I need to pass a piano proficiency exam in order to major/minor  in music?         No. This is no longer a requirement of  the major/minor.             Q: Do honors classes fulfill major/minor requirements?         Yes, but permission to register must be  obtained from the instructor, and an access code requested from Pauline  Lum ( pl56@nyu.edu ).             Q: Can I take graduate level courses in order to fulfill major  requirements?         A student will be permitted to enroll in  a graduate level course only in the most exceptional circumstances. The  student must first obtain permission of the instructor of the course  and then notify the DUGS,             Q:  How do I get credit for classes taken outside of CAS?         Send an e-mail to the DUGS that includes  details about the course, the course number, when you took the course  and what your grade was.             Q: How many credits can I get toward the minor from schools other than  CAS?         No more than eight credits.             Q: May I take instrumental or voice lessons for credit toward a music  major or minor?   You can receive a maximum of four  credits for lessons taken at Steinhardt (they can be two-, three- or  four-credit lessons).            Please visit Steinhardt's Department  of Music and Performing Arts Professions web site for details on  how to enroll in lessons.             Q: May I participate in performance ensembles for credit toward a music  major/minor?   You can receive a maximum of four credits for participation in  ensembles (choir, orchestra, jazz band or combo, chamber music, etc.)  through Steinhardt or ensembles organized within the Department of  Music.

Write an e-mail to the DUGS, stating that you would like to cancel your  major or minor. He or she will officially cancel your major/minor.                   Back to top.                                   Study Abroad   Credits toward the major and minor can be taken while studying abroad.  Typically,  students take one or two classes toward the major, one in music history  and one elective.            Notice that CAS Harmony &amp; Counterpoint courses are not offered abroad, and  that study abroad may interupt/delay your Harmony &amp; Counterpoint  sequence. In some cases, students may take one of Steinhardt's theory  courses while abroad in order to fulfill the major requirement. Please  contact the DUGS if you would like to pursue this option.                  You must obtain preapproval from the  DUGS for classes that you plan to take while abroad.                           Back to top.                                   Independent Studies         Independent studies are usually taken  during your senior year, although exceptions are made for juniors.  These courses are rare and only the most promising, disciplined, and  independent students earn the right to carry them out.            To propose an independent study:                  Typically,        students  who enroll in independent studies also apply to graduate with honors.                Write to the DUGS with a proposal for the study that  includes:         A brief description of the topic    A brief description of the status of research on the topic (who has said what, when, on the topic of your choice)    why you would want to pursue this topic  at this stage    A list of the reading materials along with a schedule for completing the reading    The name or names of professor with whom you may have discussed your ideas for the independent study (indicate whether or not you have asked a professor to sponsor your independent study)           Independent studies can be taken for one or two semesters.    Independent studies beginning in the fall semester are proposed mid- to late-spring semester. The department discourages Spring semester only independent studies.           Back to top.                                   Internships         The department sponsors internships only  for music major and minors.                  To propose an  internship:                Write to the DUGS with the name of the sponsor, an  explanation of your duties and their relation to the degree.    Your sponsor will be responsible for writing two reports,  one at mid-term and one at the semester's end. The first report can be  an e-mail simply stating whether or not you are satisfactorily  fulfilling your duties. The second report must be on letterhead and  signed by your sponsor. It should evaluate your performance in more  detail than the mid-term report. Have your sponsor mail this to the  music DUGS.    It  is your responsibility to make sure that the reports are sent in time  for the DUGS to submit your grade to the registrar.    No  credit is given toward the major or minor for internships.                         Back to top.                                   Honors   Only students with a Grade Point Average of 3.65 or above are eligible  to graduate with honors. The requirements are as follows:                Two honors-level courses , at least one of which must  be an Honors Seminar (V71.0901), taken during the junior or  senior  year. The other may be an additional honors seminar or an indepedent  study, approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies.    A capstone project, which is an extended, original  research project carried out through the senior  year    For  guidelines as to how to propose a project, please refer to the  guidelines for proposing an independent study (see above).    Submission of the honors  portfolio to the DUGS by April 1 of the student's  senior year, or November 20 if graduating in January.                         Back to top.                                   Transfering Students         There is a procedure that must be  followed in order for the registrar to transfer credits. This applies  to students transferring internally (between NYU schools - for example,  from Steinhardt to CAS or from Tisch to CAS) or externally (from  another university or college to NYU).                After meeting with the DUGS, the student will receive a memo from  the DUGS (addressed to CAS advising and Graduation Services) stating  which  transfer credits can be applied toward the music major or minor, and  which requirements they fulfill.    The  student must take this memo to CAS advising. The advisor will  write a memo to Graduation Services,  stating how many credits the student may transfer overall.    Graduation Services will enter this  information into the  system so the credits appear on the student's transcript.                      Back to top.                                           Advanced  Placement Credits for Entering Freshmen         Usually, high AP scores in music theory  translate into being able to register for Harmony and Counterpoint I.  If you feel qualified to be exempt from this class, you may take a  diagnostic exam that is equivalent to the final exam for Harmony and  Counterpoint I. If you pass the exam, you may then register for Harmony  and Counterpoint II. Please note that Harmony and Counterpoint II is  only offered in the Spring semester.    Back to top.

Both undergraduate and graduate composers enjoy the benefits of working in an intimate conservatory setting surrounded by superb performers. The programs live within a large and enriching university environment in the heart of New York City. The undergraduate program offers excellent instruction in musicianship, music history, theory, and technology along with regular readings and performances of new works culminating in portrait concerts during students' junior and senior years. Undergraduate Composition students have performances of their works by an outstanding variety of department performance groups, students, and faculty.    The Steinhardt graduate program offers two distinct but complementary tracks of study in concert and film music. Students from the two disciplines study side by side and are encouraged to take advantage of these specializations, which are supported by an internationally acclaimed faculty representing diverse styles. Graduate film composers are presented in yearly concerts at venues such as The Walter Reade Theatre in collaboration with The Film Society of Lincoln Center, The National Gallery in Washington D.C., the Tribeca Film Festival and intensive film scoring workshops in collaboration with ASCAP . Graduate concert composers participate in a yearlong course in writing for string quartet, which culminates in a performance of their works by the JACK Quartet in a public New York City venue. In addition they have the opportunity to hear their music in concerts throughout the year as well as on portrait concerts of their works at the end of their second year. All composition students have access to all departments at the university and collaborations with choreographers, visual artists, writers, filmmakers, and scholars in other fields are encouraged.    The faculty includes Robert Rowe, Julia Wolfe, Ron Sadoff, Ira Newborn, Michael Gordon, Justin Dello Joio, Mark Snow, Sonny Kompanek, Mark Suozzo, Youngmi Ha, and Tae Hong Park, among others. Guest composers in the last two years have included Steve Reich, Bruce Broughton, Louis Andriessen, Mark Isham, Meredith Monk, Jimmy Webb, DJ Spooky, Carter Burwell, Uri Caine, Morton Subotnick, Don Byron, Martin Bresnick, and more.    The Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions offers a warm and collegial atmosphere. Compositions students enjoy the support of all of the faculty and their peers. Our reputation, faculty, and location provide students with a unique opportunity to develop as composers and gain an understanding of how to pursue a career in music composition.

Q: What  undergraduate courses are currently offered in the CAS Department of  Music?          Current  Course Offerings                   Q: How do I  obtain an access code to register for a class?   Access codes can be obtained from Pauline Lum (pl56@nyu.edu).                   Q: How do I  obtain an access code for a class with pre-requisites?   If you have fulfilled the pre-requisites for a course, you will be able  to register once you obtain an access code.            If you have not fulfilled the pre-requisites but would still like to  register for the course, you must contact the instructor for  permission. If he or she waives the pre-requisite for you, you must  then contact Pauline Lum (pl56@nyu.edu) and she will register you for  the course. Please cc the instructor on any correspondence with Ms.Lum.                   Q: How long will it take for changes in my  major/minor status to appear on ALBERT?   Please keep in mind that, if your request requires that information  (i.e. declaration of major/minor, cancellation or change to major/minor  status) be entered into the Student Information System by the DUGS or  the Registrar, this information can take AT LEAST ONE WEEK to appear on  ALBERT.             Q: When do I declare a music major/minor?   Typically, a major/minor is declared between your sophomore and junior  years.  It is best to declare early in the spring semester.                  Q: Can  I have two or more majors/minors?         Yes, you can, although having more than  two majors/minors is discouraged.            If you intend to have two majors, you must decide which is your  \"primary major.\" The advisor in the department of your primary major is  responsible for declaring both majors. You should, however, maintain  contact with the advisor of your second major so he or she can monitor  the completion of your major requirements.            If you already have a minor, the music DUGS cannot declare you on  the Student Information System, but he or she will write a  memo to the registrar to declare your second minor. Please notify  the  DUGS that you already have a declared minor.                   Q: How do I declare a music major/minor?    For CAS students:       Majors and Minors are declared through  the Department of Music DUGS (except for seniors )    Send the DUGS your student ID number and a list of classes that you may have taken toward the major/minor (see below for a list of courses that fulfill the major/minor requirements).    If you have questions about whether or not a particular class counts toward the major/minor, please e-mail the DUGS.    The DUGS will declare you as a major/minor using the online Student  Information System. Please note that it takes up to a week for the  major/minor to appear on ALBERT.      If you are a senior:       Send  the DUGS for student ID number and a list of classes that you  may have taken toward the major/minor.    The  DUGS will write a memo to the registrar's office, which will be  responsible for declaring your major/minor.       For non-CAS  Students (minor only):       Get  a minor declaration form from your host school (e.g. Steinhardt,  Tisch).    Have  your advisor at your host school sign this form to approve your minor.    Write out the list of classes that you expect to take toward the  minor.    Bring the form to the Department of Music DUGS (you may leave the form  with Ms. Pauline Lum) to sign. Once the form has been signed, you may  pick the form up from Ms. Lum and take it back to your host school.    The  DUGS will write a memo to the registrar's office, which will be  responsible for declaring your minor.                        Q: What is required to major in music?   The major consists of 40 course credits, usually distributed across 10  classes of four credits each. All departmental courses must be  passed with a grade of \"C\" or  better to count toward the major.       Harmony and Counterpoint I-IV (V71.0201-0204)*    Two courses from History of European Music (V71.0101-0104)    Four other courses, numbered above V71.0100, one of which must be in Ethnomusicology    Up to four ensemble or performance credits may be applied toward the major.    Sample Major  Course Schedule          Current Course  Offerings                   Q: What is required to minor in music?   The minor consists of 16 course credits,  usually distributed across four classes of four credits each.      Elements of Music*    One course in Music History (Western Art Music)    One course in Ethnomusicology    The fourth course may be chosen from Music Theory, Music History or Ethnomusicology    Up to four ensemble or performance credits may be applied toward the minor.        *Note: If you can already read music, know the basic rudiments such as scales,  key signatures, intervals, chord construction principles, meter  signatures, and basic rhythmic notation, you can take Harmony and  Counterpoint I, a more advanced class. This class is offered only  in the fall semester and requires an access code in order to register.  To get an access code for this course, write to the DUGS explaining  your background in music theory. When the DUGS replies with an  approval, write to Pauline Lum (pl56@nyu.edu) to request an access  code, making sure to cc the DUGS on your message to Pauline.                   Q: Can I place  out of Harmony and Counterpoint I?   In order to place out of Harmony and Counterpoint I, you must take a  diagnostic exam. This exam can be scheduled by contacting the DUGS. The  one and a half hour exam will be taken in the department and students  will not have access to a piano during the exam. Exam results will be  available one week after completing the exam.                   Q:  Do I get credit toward the major/minor if I place out of Elements of  Music?         No, you must take another class instead,  typically the first Harmony and Counterpoint class (offered in the fall  semester only).             Q: Do I need to pass a piano proficiency exam in order to major/minor  in music?         No. This is no longer a requirement of  the major/minor.             Q: Do honors classes fulfill major/minor requirements?         Yes, but permission to register must be  obtained from the instructor, and an access code requested from Pauline  Lum ( pl56@nyu.edu ).             Q: Can I take graduate level courses in order to fulfill major  requirements?         A student will be permitted to enroll in  a graduate level course only in the most exceptional circumstances. The  student must first obtain permission of the instructor of the course  and then notify the DUGS,             Q:  How do I get credit for classes taken outside of CAS?         Send an e-mail to the DUGS that includes  details about the course, the course number, when you took the course  and what your grade was.             Q: How many credits can I get toward the minor from schools other than  CAS?         No more than eight credits.

Both undergraduate and graduate composers enjoy the benefits of working in an intimate conservatory setting surrounded by superb performers. The programs live within a large and enriching university environment in the heart of New York City. The undergraduate program offers excellent instruction in musicianship, music history, theory, and technology along with regular readings and performances of new works culminating in portrait concerts during students' junior and senior years. Undergraduate Composition students have performances of their works by an outstanding variety of department performance groups, students, and faculty.    The Steinhardt graduate program offers two distinct but complementary tracks of study in concert and film music. Students from the two disciplines study side by side and are encouraged to take advantage of these specializations, which are supported by an internationally acclaimed faculty representing diverse styles. Graduate film composers are presented in yearly concerts at venues such as The Walter Reade Theatre in collaboration with The Film Society of Lincoln Center, The National Gallery in Washington D.C., the Tribeca Film Festival and intensive film scoring workshops in collaboration with ASCAP . Graduate concert composers participate in a yearlong course in writing for string quartet, which culminates in a performance of their works by the JACK Quartet in a public New York City venue. In addition they have the opportunity to hear their music in concerts throughout the year as well as on portrait concerts of their works at the end of their second year. All composition students have access to all departments at the university and collaborations with choreographers, visual artists, writers, filmmakers, and scholars in other fields are encouraged.    The faculty includes Robert Rowe, Julia Wolfe, Ron Sadoff, Ira Newborn, Michael Gordon, Justin Dello Joio, Mark Snow, Sonny Kompanek, Mark Suozzo, Youngmi Ha, and Tae Hong Park, among others. Guest composers in the last two years have included Steve Reich, Bruce Broughton, Louis Andriessen, Mark Isham, Meredith Monk, Jimmy Webb, DJ Spooky, Carter Burwell, Uri Caine, Morton Subotnick, Don Byron, Martin Bresnick, and more.    The Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions offers a warm and collegial atmosphere. Compositions students enjoy the support of all of the faculty and their peers. Our reputation, faculty, and location provide students with a unique opportunity to develop as composers and gain an understanding of how to pursue a career in music composition.

Students have the option to receive introductory music business training or learn about the history and culture of creative entrepreneurs in recorded music. Students are also introduced to the tools and techniques of recording and begin to use the recording studio as their creative laboratory. In the second year, students deepen their understanding of the art and business of creating and selling recorded music. Students have the opportunity to study the \u201cartist,\u201d how musical talent is identified and cultivated, how material is selected and arranged, how a complete album is constructed in the studio and how the audience and artist have historically influenced each other. Upon completion of a second year review, students work closely with their faculty advisor to develop a personalized course of study focusing on their area of interest. During the third and fourth years, students may pursue advanced level study in business, production, history &amp; criticism, or musicianship via courses offered through the department, as well as through the Stern School of Business, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development, and the College of Arts and Sciences. Also, during their third year, students have the opportunity to study abroad in one of Tisch's study abroad programs, or participate in the department\u2019s required internship program. The \ufb01nal year culminates with the Capstone Project in which students develop a full creative plan to launch themselves as entrepreneurs. Projects have included launching a record label, creating a production company, developing a new media company, and starting an innovative music venue. As is the case with all Tisch programs, professional training is combined with a solid liberal arts education. In addition to the 58 points taken within the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, students are expected to earn a total of 44 general education points in courses offered by Tisch and the College of Arts and Science. Students also complement their study with 26 points in elective courses taken in the areas of their interest.    Internship Opportunites    Students have the opportunity to complete an industry internship at an established, institutional record company such as Universal or Mercury Records; an independent production company such as Epitaph Records; a trade publication such as Billboard or Impact ; a trade broadcast company such as VH1 or MTV; or a music recording association such as the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM), or the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
