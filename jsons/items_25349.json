Beginning with an overview of the principles of inheritance such as cell division and Mendelian genetics, we explore the foundations and frontiers of modern human genetics, with an emphasis on understanding and evaluating new discoveries. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how genetic information is encoded in DNA and how mutations affect gene function. These molecular foundations are used to explore the science and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as genetic testing, genetically modified foods, DNA fingerprinting, and the Human Genome Project. Laboratory projects emphasize the diverse methods that scientists employ to study heredity. FALL 2013 MAP-UA.306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. Kiorpes (Neuroscience)  syllabus The relationship of the brain to behavior, beginning with the basic elements that make up the nervous system and how electrical and chemical signals in the brain work to effect behavior. Using this foundation, we examine how the brain learns and how it creates new behaviors, together with the brain mechanisms that are involved in sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the experience of emotions, perception and cognition, memory and the brain's plasticity. Other key topics include whether certain behavioral disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be accounted for by changes in the function of the brain, and how drugs can alter behavior and brain function. Note: Handling of animals and animal brain tissue is required in some labs. FALL 2013 MAP-UA.310 Natural Science II: Molecules of Life Prof. Jordan (College Core Curriculum)  syllabus Our lives are increasingly influenced by the availability of new pharmaceuticals, ranging from drugs that lower cholesterol to those that influence behavior. We examine the chemistry and biology of biomolecules that make up the molecular machinery of the cell. Critical to the function of such biomolecules is their three-dimensional structure that endows them with a specific function. This information provides the scientific basis for understanding drug action and how new drugs are designed. Beginning with the principles of chemical bonding, molecular structure, and acid-base properties that govern the structure and function of biomolecules, we apply these principles to study the varieties of protein architecture and how proteins serve as enzymes to facilitate biochemical reactions. We conclude with a study of molecular genetics and how recent information from the Human Genome Project is stimulating new approaches to diagnosing disease and designing drug treatments. FALL 2013 MAP-UA.313 Natural Science II: The Brain \u2014 A User's Guide Prof. Azmitia (Biology)  syllabus A non-textbook introductory science course aimed at non-science students to teach new and emerging neuroscience information about brain function. The course provides necessary material on fundamental concepts in neurobiology, neuroplasticity, and pharmacology to understand new ideas of drug action and mental disorders. The course begins with history of ideas about the brain. The growth of the brain and the formation of neuronal connections introduce neurotransmitters, receptors and growth factors. These core neurobiological ideas are then developed into more complex topics such as memory, emotions, stress, sex and nutrition. Each lecture provides basic principles and current insights confronting students. The important subjects of drugs and alcohol is covered in a yearly-updated series of talks discussing mechanism of action, abuse of illegal (e.g. mushroom, methamphetamine and ecstasy) and prescription (e.g. Xanax, Oxycodone, and Adderall) drugs. The biological consequences on normal brain functioning of drug consumption, addiction and withdrawal are covered. The course ends with coverage of a number of clinical topics such as depression, suicide, anxiety, developmental disorders (e.g. autism, ADHD) and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s diseases). A weekly laboratory is included in this class which consist of brain dissections, microscopy, and computer assisted morphometry as well as exercises to cover topics such as alcohol measurement, calorie determination, photosynthesis and gender differences. Students are also expected to learn to use DSM psychiatric handbook. The student is introduced to current neuroscience concepts, problems and facts that are useful for meeting the challenges of the 21st century life. All lectures are available as PowerPoint presentations before class and students are encouraged to use their computers or smartphones during class to facilitate discussions and questions. In summary, this class attempts to provide college students with the background to understand how the brain is structured and how it functions. Attention is given to how to protect our brains against many of the stressors, drugs and injuries encountered in college and later in life. Professor Azmitia has spent over 40 years studying the brain and taught undergraduates, graduate and medical students. Material for the course is based on scientific papers, print and digital reports.  Spring SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 305 Natural Science II: Human Origins Prof. Williams (Anthropology)  syllabus This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of biological anthropology and explores the evolutionary history of our lineage. Topics include but are not limited to human and non-human primate genetics, behavior, osteology, paleoanthropology, bioarchaeology, and forensics. Particular emphases are placed on modern human biological variation and the human fossil record. In doing so, we will reconstruct the behavior\u2014locomotor, social, sexual, and cultural\u2014of our ancestors and close relatives using modern analogs including modern humans, our closest living relatives the great apes, and other primates and non-primate animals. This course begins with a review of cellular and molecular biology and evolutionary theory in general, then establishes our place in nature and geological time, and ends with a detailed foray into modern human origins, including fossils, artifacts, and inferred cultural behaviors. Additionally, we will explore modern human variation, including discussions of topics such as race, genetics, and sexuality. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. Fenton (Neural Science)  syllabus This class will explore the relationship between brain and behavior from a neuroscience perspective which describes processes in the brain in terms of the molecules, cells, neurochemicals and network activity that underlie them. The class starts with a discussion of neurons and glia, the two basic building blocks of the brain,and how electrical and chemical signals allow these elements to communicate with each other. Using this knowledge as a foundation, we then explore the workings of the major brain systems that allow us to interact with the world around us, such as the sensory systems that allow us to see hear, feel, smell and taste. Next,we explore the brain\u2019s motor/movement systems. The last section of the class focuses on the so-called higher cognitive functions, which include learning, memory, emotion, cognitive control and language. These latter systems are critical for our individual personalities and creativity. The goal of this course is not only to give students a factual foundation of our current understanding of the brain basis of behavior, but also toprovide students an understanding of how neuroscientists working today use a combination of scientific inquiry together with cutting edge technology to understand the inner workings of the human brain. Note: Handling of animals and animal brain tissue is required in some labs.

We conclude with a study of molecular genetics and how recent information from the Human Genome Project is stimulating new approaches to diagnosing disease and designing drug treatments. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 311 Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere Prof. Volk (Biology)  syllabus Provides a foundation of knowledge about how Earth's biosphere works. This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future within the biosphere? Laboratory experiments are complemented by an exploration at the American Museum of Natural History. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 312 Natural Science II: Earth, Life, &amp; Time Prof. Rampino (Biology)   syllabus Over the last four billion years, life on Earth has evolved in response to changes in the environment. At the same time, major innovations in the history of life have led to transformations of the Earth's physical environment. We examine the history of the intimate relationship between the Earth's changing environment and the evolution of life on the planet. This long-term historical perspective provides a context for understanding current environmental issues such as global warming, tropical deforestation, and loss of biodiversity.  top of page              Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

Using this knowledge as a foundation, we then explore the workings of the major brain systems that allow us to interact with the world around us, such as the sensory systems that allow us to see hear, feel, smell and taste. Next,we explore the brain\u2019s motor/movement systems. The last section of the class focuses on the so-called higher cognitive functions, which include learning, memory, emotion, cognitive control and language. These latter systems are critical for our individual personalities and creativity. The goal of this course is not only to give students a factual foundation of our current understanding of the brain basis of behavior, but also toprovide students an understanding of how neuroscientists working today use a combination of scientific inquiry together with cutting edge technology to understand the inner workings of the human brain. Note: Handling of animals and animal brain tissue is required in some labs. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 310 Natural Science II: Molecules of Life Prof. Jordan (College Core Curriculum)  syllabus Our lives are increasingly influenced by the availability of new pharmaceuticals, ranging from drugs that lower cholesterol to those that influence behavior. We examine the chemistry and biology of biomolecules that make up the molecular machinery of the cell. Critical to the function of such biomolecules is their three-dimensional structure that endows them with a specific function. This information provides the scientific basis for understanding drug action and how new drugs are designed. Beginning with the principles of chemical bonding, molecular structure, and acid-base properties that govern the structure and function of biomolecules, we apply these principles to study the varieties of protein architecture and how proteins serve as enzymes to facilitate biochemical reactions. We conclude with a study of molecular genetics and how recent information from the Human Genome Project is stimulating new approaches to diagnosing disease and designing drug treatments. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 311 Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere Prof. Volk (Biology)  syllabus Provides a foundation of knowledge about how Earth's biosphere works. This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future within the biosphere? Laboratory experiments are complemented by an exploration at the American Museum of Natural History. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 312 Natural Science II: Earth, Life, &amp; Time Prof. Rampino (Biology)   syllabus Over the last four billion years, life on Earth has evolved in response to changes in the environment. At the same time, major innovations in the history of life have led to transformations of the Earth's physical environment. We examine the history of the intimate relationship between the Earth's changing environment and the evolution of life on the planet. This long-term historical perspective provides a context for understanding current environmental issues such as global warming, tropical deforestation, and loss of biodiversity.  top of page              Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "NYU Movement Lab                                                                                                                                         Contact: info@movement.nyu.edu                                                             check out our west coast site at      http://movement.stanford.edu                                 The NYU         Movement Lab is a motion capture         studio and research group dedicated to the analysis         and animation of all forms of human movement.

Labanotation, is a comprehensive notation system for recording the structural features of human movement, attending to spatial   direction, pathway, floor pattern and degrees of flexion, extension and rotation of individual joints. This system is exemplified   by the Dance Notation Bureau in New York whose work is primarily oriented to the documentation of dance choreography. LMA includes   the quantitative analysis but additionally addresses qualitative changes of movement in space and time as well as qualitative   analysis of dynamic elements of movement expression.     In the context of this project we focus on LMA. Using LMA, one can systematically look at a unit or phrase of movement in terms of   the four major movement components of Body, Effort, Shape and Space. These basic components can be identified and examined alone and   in relationship to each other to form phrases that are perceived as \"meaningful\" by someone watching them. The components are seen   as \"irreducible\", meaning that they are the smallest units needed in describing an observed movement. LMA provides analytic tools   for identifying patterns of movement expression that signify both cultural and personal styles. By understanding these elements we   can begin to more effectively appreciate what human beings have in common and how each of us is unique.     In the following we briefly summarize these LMA components:    LMA component: \"Effort\"   EFFORT is the dynamic quality of the movement, the feeling tone, the texture, how the energy is being used. Effort reflects the   mover's attitude toward investing energy in four basic Effort Factors: Flow, Time, Weight and Space. Effort change is generally   associated with change of mood or emotion and, hence, is an inroad to expressivity. Each effort factor can have different degrees   of intensities (values along a continuous range) between opposing poles. In the following we enumerate the four different Effort   Factors:   1) The Effort Factor Flow is the base line of \"goingness\", the continuity of the movement out of which the other effort elements   emerge and return. Flow is frequently related to feelings, either outpouring or containing them. This is a key factor in the   expressive aliveness of the movement. The two opposing poles are called Free Flow and Bound Flow:   High Intensity Bound Flow   Diminished Intensity   High Intensity Free Flow   Controlled, contained, restrained, careful, keeping the inside in or the outside out.   Examples: Trying to do something perfectly-worried motion.     Outpouring, fluid, released, liquid, letting the inside out or the outside in.   Examples: Outpouring joy when the team is winning-\"YES\"     2) The Effort Factor of Weight is understood as the sensing factor, - sensing the physical mass and its relationship to gravity.   The Weight factor is often lost in the animation process. This loss contributes to the animation lacking a sense of groundedness   and personality.   High Intensity Light   Diminished Intensity   High Intensity Strong   Gentle, delicate, fine touch, buoyant   Example: Touching somebody as if your hands were feathers.     Powerful, forceful, firm touch, impactful   Example: Pushing a car.     3) The Effort Factor of Time has to do with your inner attitude toward the time you have, not how long it takes to do the movement,   not quantitative measure of duration.   High Intensity Sudden      Diminished Intensity    High Intensity Sustained       Has a sense of urgent, quick, instantaneous, staccato.   Example: \"I only have five minutes to finish my exam.\"     Has a quality of stretching the time, indulging in the use of it, leisurely, gradual, lingering, prolonging.   Examples:\"I still have five whole minutes to finish my exam.\"     4) The Effort Factor of Space addresses the quality of active attention to the environment. It doesn't deal with the place in space   and it shouldn't be confused with one of the mayor components of the movement, the Space component. (As we mentioned before there   are four major movement componets: Body, Effort, Shape and Space). The two opposite poles are Direct and Indirect .   High Intensity Direct      Diminished Intensity    High Intensity Indirect       Giving attention single focused, channelled, pinpointed, laser-like   Examples: Putting a contact lens into your eye.     Giving active attention to more than one thing at once, multi-focused, flexible attention, all- around awareness, all- encompassing   Example: Taking-in a beautiful natural vista       Generally, Effort Qualities appear in groups of two, known as States, three, known as Drives and occasionally four Effort combinations.   These characteristic combinations and how they phrase and sequence is an important part of a \"Movement Signature.\"  Though current motion capture and animation technologies have made certain strides in simulating this subtle dynamic range,   the need for more sophisticated approaches is essential if life-like human motion is to be recorded.      LMA Component: \"Body\"   The category of BODY addresses issues of the orchestration of body parts. The system identifies phrases of initiation,   follow-through and resolution. It address the question \"where in the body does the movement begins and how does it follow   through to complete the phrase\"? Again we explain these different categories in more detail, since they come often in subtle   form, but are very important, and many computer animations are lacking of these.    Simultaneous . \"Do all active body parts move at once? (i.e. head and both hands make an action at the same time)    Successive . \"Does the movement of one body part flow successively into the movement of the next adjacent body part?\"   (i.e. a succession within one movement phrase: shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand)    Sequential . \"Does the movement of one part of the body flow sequentially into other non-adjacent body parts?\"   (i.e. , a sequence of movement of non-adjacent body parts within one phrase: head, leg, and arm move- one immediately after the other).   Example: We can move our arm forward in a pointing manner, and the movement can be initiated by the hand, which is dragging the   arm forward, or initiated by the upper arm muscles, which is pushing the rest of the arm forward. This are very subtle   differences, and many computer animations have trouble with conveying initiation.  Furthermore the whole body can be organized from six different connective patterns that have their roots in infant reflexes and   early developmental patterning. These Patterns of Total Body Connectivity are the following:    Breath , includes both cellular and lung respiration and is a key to fluidity of movement and internal shaping.    Core - distal Connectivity, includes developing support from the internal core of the body (core support) and minimizing   over-dependence on external muscles. This patterns also coordinates the relationship of each limb to center core and through   center core to the other limbs and out to the world.    Head-Tail Connectivity builds a sense of the individual self connected through the body's internal vertical. This stage   patterns the ability to give attention to the world and enjoy a flexible, sensuous, supportive spine in all three planes.   It's particularly important for level change.    Body-Half Connectivity - organizes the body to be able to work with one side stable while the other side is mobile;   patterns sidedness functions in the brain, aids in clarifying issues.    Cross- Lateral Connectivity - develops diagonal connections through the body and gradated rotation in the proximal joints   to facilitate full three dimensional movement and ability to spiral with complex level change and locomotion; prepares for   multidimensional relational thinking and commitment to action.     Often in computer animations, humans look robotic, with limbs that seem \"disconnected\" from their core. This is because   the animator has conceptually thought about single limb movement, without perceiving how that limb is relating through   the core of the body to a Pattern of Total Body Connectivity that is organizing the whole body.   Example: In the previously mentioned arm moving forward, the arm could be going forward initiated with internal connections   through from the core of the body to underneath the scapula with the right leg stepping forward. (This movement can be seen   in the picture of Peggy Hackney on p. 10) this would be a Body-Half Connective Pattern. If the left leg stepped forward, it   would be a Cross-lateral Pattern. Human beings make habitual choices about connective patterns. Again this is a part of   \"Movement Signature,\" and needs to be addressed for life-life animation.      LMA Component: \"Shape\"     The SHAPE category looks at \"What forms does the body make\"?, \"Is the shape changing in relation to self or in relation to   the environment\"? \"How is the Shape changing- what is the major quality or element which is influencing its process of change\"?   Underlying all shape change is the basic change in the body's form that happens in the process of breathing. This baseline process   of Growing and Shrinking is called Shape Flow Support. Many computer animations are lacking of these, since Shape Flow Support is   often based on subtle nonrigid shape changes that are not supported by current motion capture and animation models. Breath is life!   Without clear ways of capturing and amplifying these subtle shape changes of Widening-Narrowing, Lengthening-Shortening, and   Bulging-Hollowing that occur because of the breath, animation will remain \"lifeless.\"   Modes of Shape Change reveals a variety of inner attitudes and motivations about changing the shape of the body, ranging from   a very self oriented process of shape change to a very external process. This inner attitude need not to be conscious to be   operative. They are called Shape Flow, Directional Movement and Carving. LMA can perceive and notate these changes, which are   also a part of \"Movement Signature.\"      LMA Component: \"Space\":   The last LMA component, Space, articulates the relationship between the human body and the three dimensional matrix of space.   Space aspects include information about the mover's own personal movement sphere, the Kinesphere, and general space, which is   an important part of characterization or personal style. One person may convey a sense of central radiance, while another conveys   a delicate sense of peripheral boundary, and still another seems to be forever creating a sense of mixing many aspects transversely.   This aspect is generally fairly well-covered in Motion Capture.   Due to space limitations, we only explained a few relevant LMA principles of the large body of work. Our main focus will be on   finding computational representations of LMA Effort, certain aspects of LMA Body and LMA Shape."}]}]
