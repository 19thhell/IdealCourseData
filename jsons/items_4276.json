It aims at educating a much needed  new generation of literary translators. The program is supported by all the  faculty members of the prestigious NYU French department and, as such, is  guaranteed to offer an equally top-rate theoretical and analytical education in  translation.         NYU provides the perfect environment for this type of  program in translation. Our two main  advantages are 1) our location in New York City where, besides the French Publishers\u2019  Agency, the vast majority of American publishers likely to publish French books  in translation are located, and 2) the NYU Paris center, where the students  will spend a six-week Summer session allowing them to meet with contemporary  French writers, publishers, and foreign rights managers. For more information, check out our Facebook page and the blog created by Literary Translation students.  Admission The  requirements for admission are a B.A. with a strong concentration of French  (e.g. major in French literature or language, major in Comparative literature  with a specialization in French literature); a statement of purpose (2 pages double-spaced); a translation sample consisting of approximately 3000 words (double-spaced) translated from the French (fiction, drama, essay, poetry, or  social sciences) with a photocopy of the original including all the necessary  references; three letters of recommendation; an official transcript of  undergraduate studies; GRE scores; and TOEFL scores (for those whose native  language is not English). ( http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication )      Applications are accepted for fall admission only .      The application deadline is April 15th, 2015.                      Program content and  requirements This one-year program (Fall and Spring semester in New York,  intensive six-week Summer session in France) will comprise eight four-credit  courses (32 credits in total) plus a thesis. Two thesis formats will be  accepted:      1) The typical thesis will consist of the original translation  of a book-long piece, such as a play, a collection of short stories, poems or  essays, a short novel or a long novella, preceded by a foreword-type analysis  of the specific translation problems raised by the text.      2) For students interested in a more fully analytical  approach, the thesis could consist of a 60- to 100-page comparative study of  existing translations. List of Courses  Fall: Theory of Translation: FREN-GA 1020 A survey course that will inform students on the major  issues at stake in literary translation by means of a broad history of  translation theory, from the Romans to the twentieth century with a particular  focus on French theorists, and through a more focused study of specific  problems in literary translation, such as poetry and translation, translating  dramatic texts, translating the vernaculars, etc.                  Stylistics and Semantics of Written French: FREN-GA 1022 Ce cours propose  un entra\u00eenement intensif \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9crit. Il permet aux \u00e9tudiants d\u2019enrichir et  d\u2019affiner leur comp\u00e9tence \u00e9crite \u00e0 travers un approfondissement de la grammaire  et des relations logiques, envisag\u00e9es d\u2019un point de vue s\u00e9mantique et  stylistique. Workshop in Translation I: FREN-GA 1021 Regular submission, analysis, and discussion of students\u2019  translations of book excerpts in a wide variety of genres, from autobiographies  and memoirs to works of philosophy, religion and history, and self-help and  oenology books to literary fiction. The titles will be provided by the French  Publishers\u2019 Agency and the students\u2019 translation samples will be submitted to  American publishers, via the Agency.                  Spring: French Literature or French Civilization Graduate Course: 4 points Any French Department literature or civilization course.

Workshop in Translation II: FREN-GA 2010 Regular submission, analysis, and discussion of students\u2019  own translation projects, which should constitute the basis for students\u2019 final  theses. This course will take the form  of a seminar, conducted by a professional literary translator. Students will work on methodology and  research issues related to translating a piece of publishable length and learn  about the revising and editing process involved in translation.                      Six-week Summer  Session in France (from mid-May to the end of June): Translation II: FREN-GA 2009/9003 This course will be a course in translation analysis and  comparative poetics. It will teach the students to read and analyze texts in translation and, through comparative  analysis, they will learn about specific issues raised by literary translation  (issues related to textual genres, cultural issues, prosodic and rhythmic  issues, register and dialect issues, etc.) as well as gain a concrete historical  knowledge of translation theory.                  Creative Writing Workshop: FREN-GA 2000/9000 Regular submission and discussion and analysis of student  work in one or more fictional modes (short story, short novel, novel, etc.),  with examination of relevant readings illustrating point of view, plot,  setting, characterization, dialogue, and aspects of style.

It aims at educating a much needed  new generation of literary translators. The program is supported by all the  faculty members of the prestigious NYU French department and, as such, is  guaranteed to offer an equally top-rate theoretical and analytical education in  translation.         NYU provides the perfect environment for this type of  program in translation. Our two main  advantages are 1) our location in New York City where, besides the French Publishers\u2019  Agency, the vast majority of American publishers likely to publish French books  in translation are located, and 2) the NYU Paris center, where the students  will spend a six-week Summer session allowing them to meet with contemporary  French writers, publishers, and foreign rights managers. For more information, check out our Facebook page and the blog created by Literary Translation students.  Admission The  requirements for admission are a B.A. with a strong concentration of French  (e.g. major in French literature or language, major in Comparative literature  with a specialization in French literature); a statement of purpose (2 pages double-spaced); a translation sample consisting of approximately 3000 words (double-spaced) translated from the French (fiction, drama, essay, poetry, or  social sciences) with a photocopy of the original including all the necessary  references; three letters of recommendation; an official transcript of  undergraduate studies; GRE scores; and TOEFL scores (for those whose native  language is not English). ( http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication )      Applications are accepted for fall admission only .      The application deadline is April 15th, 2015.                      Program content and  requirements This one-year program (Fall and Spring semester in New York,  intensive six-week Summer session in France) will comprise eight four-credit  courses (32 credits in total) plus a thesis. Two thesis formats will be  accepted:      1) The typical thesis will consist of the original translation  of a book-long piece, such as a play, a collection of short stories, poems or  essays, a short novel or a long novella, preceded by a foreword-type analysis  of the specific translation problems raised by the text.      2) For students interested in a more fully analytical  approach, the thesis could consist of a 60- to 100-page comparative study of  existing translations. List of Courses  Fall: Theory of Translation: FREN-GA 1020 A survey course that will inform students on the major  issues at stake in literary translation by means of a broad history of  translation theory, from the Romans to the twentieth century with a particular  focus on French theorists, and through a more focused study of specific  problems in literary translation, such as poetry and translation, translating  dramatic texts, translating the vernaculars, etc.                  Stylistics and Semantics of Written French: FREN-GA 1022 Ce cours propose  un entra\u00eenement intensif \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9crit.

It will teach the students to read and analyze texts in translation and, through comparative  analysis, they will learn about specific issues raised by literary translation  (issues related to textual genres, cultural issues, prosodic and rhythmic  issues, register and dialect issues, etc.) as well as gain a concrete historical  knowledge of translation theory.                  Creative Writing Workshop: FREN-GA 2000/9000 Regular submission and discussion and analysis of student  work in one or more fictional modes (short story, short novel, novel, etc.),  with examination of relevant readings illustrating point of view, plot,  setting, characterization, dialogue, and aspects of style.
