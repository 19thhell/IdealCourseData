We are a school with energy and excellence, IQ and EQ, neighborhood roots and global reach.    Stern\u2019s vision begins with people and ideas. Our students and faculty continue to redefine what business can do to create value for shareholders and society. The possibilities for reinvention in the 21st century are endless. It is this potential that inspires what we call An Education in Possible .    An Education in Possible starts with the realization that imagination is the only constraint to innovation and that opportunity sits alongside every problem. Our ability to translate those problems into opportunities requires both rigor inside the classroom and engagement beyond its four walls. Driven by a profound belief that business can be a force for good, we empower students to use business to improve the world.    We take pride in our culture and invite you to explore NYU Stern.    With every good wish,      Peter Henry  Dean                                                    Follow Dean Henry on Twitter: @PeterBlairHenry                 NYU Stern Brand Guidelines   Consult our virtual toolkit on usage standards for the School's logo and tagline, An Education in Possible.

Influencing people to succeed in achieving a common goal. Knowing how to tap into the strengths of others. Today\u2019s leaders are facing a range of new leadership challenges.    At Stern, we are preparing students to meet these challenges with our Leadership Development Initiative and its three pillars:     Leadership Foundation lays the groundwork for effective leadership through specialized workshops and classes    Leadership Personalized uses individual assessments and coaching to help students create a customized action plan    Leadership in Action gives students the opportunity to hone their skills through hands-on leadership experiences    The Stern Leadership Development Initiative helps students understand their leadership abilities, practice core leadership competencies through targeted workshops and activities, and apply what they\u2019ve learned to real leadership experiences such as internships, the Stern Consulting Corps , Stern Signature Projects and club leadership positions.    Incoming Stern students opt into the Leadership Development Initiative and begin work before they arrive on campus, gathering developmental feedback from previous supervisors, colleagues, customers and direct reports through a tailored 360 assessment tool. This process arms participants with important information about their strengths and areas for growth from day one.    Based on feedback from the 360 assessment, and with the support of one-on-one coaching, participants create an Individual Development Plan that serves as a road map for the rest of their Stern experience and beyond. The Individual Development Plan helps students make meaningful choices about how to prioritize and make the most of the different leadership opportunities at Stern.

We are a school with energy and excellence, IQ and EQ, neighborhood roots and global reach.    Stern\u2019s vision begins with people and ideas. Our students and faculty continue to redefine what business can do to create value for shareholders and society. The possibilities for reinvention in the 21st century are endless. It is this potential that inspires what we call An Education in Possible .    An Education in Possible starts with the realization that imagination is the only constraint to innovation and that opportunity sits alongside every problem. Our ability to translate those problems into opportunities requires both rigor inside the classroom and engagement beyond its four walls. Driven by a profound belief that business can be a force for good, we empower students to use business to improve the world.    We take pride in our culture and invite you to explore NYU Stern.    With every good wish,      Peter Henry  Dean                                                    Follow Dean Henry on Twitter: @PeterBlairHenry                 NYU Stern Brand Guidelines   Consult our virtual toolkit on usage standards for the School's logo and tagline, An Education in Possible.

Influencing people to succeed in achieving a common goal. Knowing how to tap into the strengths of others. Today\u2019s leaders are facing a range of new leadership challenges.    At Stern, we are preparing students to meet these challenges with our Leadership Development Initiative and its three pillars:     Leadership Foundation lays the groundwork for effective leadership through specialized workshops and classes    Leadership Personalized uses individual assessments and coaching to help students create a customized action plan    Leadership in Action gives students the opportunity to hone their skills through hands-on leadership experiences    The Stern Leadership Development Initiative helps students understand their leadership abilities, practice core leadership competencies through targeted workshops and activities, and apply what they\u2019ve learned to real leadership experiences such as internships, the Stern Consulting Corps , Stern Signature Projects and club leadership positions.    Incoming Stern students opt into the Leadership Development Initiative and begin work before they arrive on campus, gathering developmental feedback from previous supervisors, colleagues, customers and direct reports through a tailored 360 assessment tool. This process arms participants with important information about their strengths and areas for growth from day one.    Based on feedback from the 360 assessment, and with the support of one-on-one coaching, participants create an Individual Development Plan that serves as a road map for the rest of their Stern experience and beyond. The Individual Development Plan helps students make meaningful choices about how to prioritize and make the most of the different leadership opportunities at Stern.    All Leadership Development Initiative participants also take part in:     Targeted workshops on core leadership competencies that provide students with the tools they need to develop the skills essential for extraordinary leadership    Leadership Simulation in which students participate in a dynamic, high fidelity leadership scenario and receive real-time feedback from trained leadership experts    Peer leadership groups that offer an opportunity for students to reflect on their own leadership development while learning from each other                                                    Take Action      Sign Up for Information    Meet With Us    Apply                                                Student Podcasts    LDI: A Framework for Success   LDI: Enhancing Your Perspective                 News       MBAs Tackle the West Point Boot Camp : Leadership Development Initiative students head to West Point to learn leadership lessons from military experts                 Selected Leadership Luncheon Speakers     Mike Indursky (Stern MBA '90), President of Bliss, addresses MBA students as part of the Leadership Luncheon Series    Other Leadership Luncheon speakers include:     Stephen Sadove , Chairman &amp; CEO, Saks Inc.
