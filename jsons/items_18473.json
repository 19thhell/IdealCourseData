Carlyle Court Towers 2 and 3 will remain open through the Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 terms.     As indicated in an email sent to the NYU residence hall community by Marc Wais, Vice President of Student Affairs and Tom Ellett, Senior Associate Vice President of Student Affairs on February 6, 2015, the University has decided to move forward with significant facility upgrades to Tower 1 at Carlyle Court, upper-class residence hall accommodations. (Towers 2 and 3 will be scheduled for similar renovations the following years.). Consequently, the plan is to close Carlyle Court for renovation beginning December 23, 2015, and to reopen it on August 15, 2016.   Accommodations in Carlyle Court Tower 1 will be part of the 2015-2016 room selection process for upper-class students, and in particular, those planning to either study-away during the Spring 2016 semester or who have December 2015 graduation plans. Fall 2015 residents of Carlyle Court Tower 1 who plan to continue their studies at NYU-New York for the Spring 2016 semester will be reassigned to other space on campus prior to the December 23rd closure of the tower.   Please also note, we are looking forward to re-opening Hayden Hall for first-year students for Fall 2015, which means that some space in University Hall and Palladium Hall may become available for use by upperclassmen.     With the assistance of the NYU Office of Global Programs, we are pleased to announce a number of offerings in place for the Fall 2015 semester only, that seek to address the unique issues posed by a one semester placement in the Carlyle Court Tower 1.   Please review the following information carefully as it may influence your decisions relating to roommates and space selection options:     Spring 2016 Study Away Early Decision Admission - For this year, returning undergraduates may apply for a Spring 2016 Study Away early decision admission process. Students who select into Carlyle Court Tower 1 for the Fall 2015 semester will be eligible for priority notification of their study away admission. Students who meet the Study Away application requirements will receive special consideration for admission into one of their two site preferences. The Spring 2016 Study Away early decision admission application will open on March 2, 2015 and will be available via the &quot;Application Center&quot; on Albert. The deadline for the early admission consideration is May 1, 2015. Students who select into Carlyle Court Tower 1 and meet the deadline will receive priority notification by May 15, 2015.     Room Selection Priority for Academic Year 2016-2017 \u2013 Students who choose to live in Carlyle Court Tower 1 for the Fall 2015 semester will be given top priority for the Academic Year 2016-2017 room selection process.   Programmatic Enhancements - In addition to typical hall programming, there will be themed study away offerings in Carlyle Court Tower 1 designed to prepare students for the study away experience.   Fall Check-out -  Carlyle Court residents in towers 1 will be required to vacate their assignment no later than December 23, 2015. The University will provide appropriate accommodations for those students continuing their Fall 2015 housing assignment through Spring 2016.

Carlyle Court Towers 2 and 3 will remain open through the Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 terms.     As indicated in an email sent to the NYU residence hall community by Marc Wais, Vice President of Student Affairs and Tom Ellett, Senior Associate Vice President of Student Affairs on February 6, 2015, the University has decided to move forward with significant facility upgrades to Tower 1 at Carlyle Court, upper-class residence hall accommodations. (Towers 2 and 3 will be scheduled for similar renovations the following years.). Consequently, the plan is to close Carlyle Court for renovation beginning December 23, 2015, and to reopen it on August 15, 2016.   Accommodations in Carlyle Court Tower 1 will be part of the 2015-2016 room selection process for upper-class students, and in particular, those planning to either study-away during the Spring 2016 semester or who have December 2015 graduation plans. Fall 2015 residents of Carlyle Court Tower 1 who plan to continue their studies at NYU-New York for the Spring 2016 semester will be reassigned to other space on campus prior to the December 23rd closure of the tower.   Please also note, we are looking forward to re-opening Hayden Hall for first-year students for Fall 2015, which means that some space in University Hall and Palladium Hall may become available for use by upperclassmen.     With the assistance of the NYU Office of Global Programs, we are pleased to announce a number of offerings in place for the Fall 2015 semester only, that seek to address the unique issues posed by a one semester placement in the Carlyle Court Tower 1.   Please review the following information carefully as it may influence your decisions relating to roommates and space selection options:     Spring 2016 Study Away Early Decision Admission - For this year, returning undergraduates may apply for a Spring 2016 Study Away early decision admission process. Students who select into Carlyle Court Tower 1 for the Fall 2015 semester will be eligible for priority notification of their study away admission. Students who meet the Study Away application requirements will receive special consideration for admission into one of their two site preferences. The Spring 2016 Study Away early decision admission application will open on March 2, 2015 and will be available via the &quot;Application Center&quot; on Albert. The deadline for the early admission consideration is May 1, 2015. Students who select into Carlyle Court Tower 1 and meet the deadline will receive priority notification by May 15, 2015.     Room Selection Priority for Academic Year 2016-2017 \u2013 Students who choose to live in Carlyle Court Tower 1 for the Fall 2015 semester will be given top priority for the Academic Year 2016-2017 room selection process.   Programmatic Enhancements - In addition to typical hall programming, there will be themed study away offerings in Carlyle Court Tower 1 designed to prepare students for the study away experience.   Fall Check-out -  Carlyle Court residents in towers 1 will be required to vacate their assignment no later than December 23, 2015. The University will provide appropriate accommodations for those students continuing their Fall 2015 housing assignment through Spring 2016.                          Important Updates   Room selection for 2015-2016 is now closed.
