At the beginning of the central corridor--to your right is Room 1141, this is the Undergraduate Sound Lab also known as the Pro Tools Lab. You can use this lab to edit sound for freshman sound classes. You will also be here taking tech seminars to learn the various types of audio software. Continue straight down the hall past the intersection to see the sound studios. On your right you will see room 1142. This is the Recording Studio. You can use this studio to record music scores, either wild or synced to picture. The operation of this studio is covered in the Studio Recording class. Walk further down the hall and take a quick right turn down the side hallway, this will take you to nine sound suites, rooms 1125 to 1134. You will use these rooms to record, edit and mix sound as both a fundamentals sound student as well as an advanced sound editor. Go back out to the main corridor and turn right, on your right is the main sound classroom 1143, where you will take Craft classes dealing with sound as well as your freshman sound classes. Further down the hall is room 1144, The Foley Studio is for recording live sound effects that can then be added to your film. You will use this studio to physically create the sound effects with Foley props in sync to picture. You will also have several floor surfaces to record footsteps. If done properly an audience will never notice the added sound. Next is room 1145, the ADR Studio. This studio is used to record and replace poorly recorded location dialogue. Your actors will come in and record existing lines, add lines and tweak the performance based on the way the picture has been edited. At the end of the hall is room 1146 the Mix Studio. This is the final stage for your sound design. In this studio you will make sure all your sound tracks are at the proper level and that everything plays back the way you want it to in a theatre. If you did all the work necessary leading up to this, it will make your film sound like a winner! Head back toward the elevators and make your first right, walking a few feet forward, on your right will be the Post Production checkout window. There are tables and chairs in front of the check out window. There you can take a seat and collaborate with fellow students and faculty members in our vibrant Post Production Center lounge area. Once you've checked into a lab, studio or suite at the Post Production desk, you can proceed to one of the six multi-station computer-editing labs. These rooms are primarily used by freshman, sophomore and junior filmmakers at Kanbar. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them at the PPC Checkout Window.
