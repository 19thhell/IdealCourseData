After receiving Ph.D. degree in 1977, he joined Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as a Research Associate. He joined EE Department, Polytechnic University (now become NYU-Poly), in September 1978 as Research Assistant Professor and was promoted to full professor in 1986. He initiated and ran a &ldquo;summer research program for college juniors&rdquo; in the EE department from 1985 to 1991. This program, which has gained nationwide popularity, has since been adopted in many universities and national laboratories.   Dr. Kuo&#39;s research activities cover areas in microwave plasma interactions, waves in the ionosphere and magnetosphere, plasma torches, plasma mitigation of shock waves, and plasma for industrial and medical applications. He performed a novel experiment using rapidly created plasma to up-shift the electromagnetic wave frequency. He created the first Plasma Crystal which traps EM wave as well as down-shifts the wave frequency. He developed theory as basis for enhancing the efficiency of generating ELF (extremely low frequency)/VLF (very low frequency) waves in the ionosphere, used for underwater communication and exploring the magnetosphere. He patented a plasma torch module, installed in a wind tunnel to study shock waves in supersonic aircraft. The experiment showed that onboard-generated plasma can eliminate the shock waves in front of the aircraft &ndash; potentially solving the problems of sonic booms and severe wave drag in supersonic flight. Adding microwave, this torch module has been applied to the scramjet engine to improve combustion and to decontaminate biological warfare agents. He also invented an air plasma spray for medical applications, including wound-bleeding control, wound healing and dental treatment.   Dr. Kuo is a fellow of the IEEE. He was Principal Investigator (PI) for more than thirty research projects awarded by the AFOSR, NSF, NASA, and ONR. Twelve students have received doctorates under his supervision.

After receiving Ph.D. degree in 1977, he joined Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as a Research Associate. He joined EE Department, Polytechnic University (now become NYU-Poly), in September 1978 as Research Assistant Professor and was promoted to full professor in 1986. He initiated and ran a &ldquo;summer research program for college juniors&rdquo; in the EE department from 1985 to 1991. This program, which has gained nationwide popularity, has since been adopted in many universities and national laboratories.   Dr. Kuo&#39;s research activities cover areas in microwave plasma interactions, waves in the ionosphere and magnetosphere, plasma torches, plasma mitigation of shock waves, and plasma for industrial and medical applications. He performed a novel experiment using rapidly created plasma to up-shift the electromagnetic wave frequency. He created the first Plasma Crystal which traps EM wave as well as down-shifts the wave frequency. He developed theory as basis for enhancing the efficiency of generating ELF (extremely low frequency)/VLF (very low frequency) waves in the ionosphere, used for underwater communication and exploring the magnetosphere. He patented a plasma torch module, installed in a wind tunnel to study shock waves in supersonic aircraft. The experiment showed that onboard-generated plasma can eliminate the shock waves in front of the aircraft &ndash; potentially solving the problems of sonic booms and severe wave drag in supersonic flight. Adding microwave, this torch module has been applied to the scramjet engine to improve combustion and to decontaminate biological warfare agents. He also invented an air plasma spray for medical applications, including wound-bleeding control, wound healing and dental treatment.   Dr. Kuo is a fellow of the IEEE. He was Principal Investigator (PI) for more than thirty research projects awarded by the AFOSR, NSF, NASA, and ONR. Twelve students have received doctorates under his supervision.
