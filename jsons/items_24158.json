The PGY II year is designed to provide residents a solid foundation in the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic mental illness. Our residents become proficient in the assessment of patients in every part of the health care delivery system: public sector, city and state, private and federal. Residents also have exposure to children and adolescents, consultation-liaison psychiatry, as well as to specialized patient populations. There are also opportunities for research time.\u00a0 Residents end the year competent in the fundamental treatment modalities available to psychiatrists.   The year is divided into thirteen four week blocks. All residents spend between one and five blocks on each of the following over the course of the PGY I and PGY II years.

Every effort is made to accommodate the resident\u2019s preference.   NYU LANGONE MEDICAL CENTER   HCC-10 COOP   This is a 22-bed unit for patients with acute psychiatric illnesses. This rotation provides the resident with the opportunity to serve as the primary psychiatrist while working closely with an attending. A thorough neuro-psychiatric and psychosocial understanding of each patient is emphasized. Because of the diverse patient population, with a focus on complex and refractory clinical conditions, residents gain experience in many treatment modalities including state-of-the-art psychopharmacology, electro-convulsive therapy, individual, group and family psychotherapies.   THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS NEW YORK HARBOR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM (MANHATTAN VA MEDICAL CENTER)   17 North   This is a 23-bed acute psychiatric unit for adult veterans who are predominantly male.

Residents gain experience evaluating and treating seriously and persistently mentally ill patients in a research setting. White Plains Service Center (6 weeks) (Selective)*   Residents gain experience providing active outpatient treatment to seriously and persistently mentally ill adults in a community setting. The diversity of the population, the range of diagnoses and the different levels of functioning enhance residents\u2019 knowledge of treatment outcomes and of the potential for this population to readjust to life in the community through the process of recovery and rehabilitation.   *Selective \u2013 two to six residents can select to work at these sites.   CONSULTATION-LIAISON PSYCHIATRY\u00a0   All residents spend one block of time on the Consultation-Liaison psychiatry service at either Bellevue Hospital Center or the Manhattan VA Medical Center.
