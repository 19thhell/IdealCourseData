Addressing these problems requires creative thinkers focused on the design and adoption of modern methods. But such methods are only effective when they&rsquo;ve been accepted for use.   With this in mind, the MS in Manufacturing Engineering program supplements robust design concepts and production techniques with courses on managing the human side of technological change. By specifically addressing how to overcome cultural barriers, we train our students to identify the most effective means to help high-performance teams succeed.   You will learn how to evaluate and implement production improvements by applying new methods and by using software for design and simulation. By program&#39;s end, you will have not only a working knowledge of advanced methods and techniques used worldwide in manufacturing, but also the hands-on experience required to advance your career in a leadership position. In addition to hands-on projects in your courses, we often make arrangements for our students to obtain internships in local industries.   Admission Requirements   This program is open to those holding an accredited engineering degree (BS or BE); to graduates in physics, chemistry, materials science and the biological sciences; and to those holding an MBA. International students with equivalent backgrounds are also eligible for the program.     This program is also offered online .
