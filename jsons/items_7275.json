Description       Working with the Fiasco Theater Company, this intensive class has two principal goals: to give students training in a variety of acting and performance techniques for the classic stage, and to mobilize those skills towards the interpretation and performance of a Shakespeare play. Each morning, from 10am to 1 pm will be divided in three hour-long workshops, which will focus on such topics as: voice and speech, stage combat, clowning, working with verse, physical metaphor, writing and adapting songs for Shakespearean performance, and ensemble games. The afternoon, from 2pm-5pm will involve collective rehearsal of the Shakespeare play to be performed on the last day. This intensive will be appropriate for all students interested in the performance of Shakespeare, and attention will be paid to providing opportunities for those most interested in directing or designing as well as acting. All students will participate in all activities, but the focus of each student can include a diversity of roles.

This program is unique in that ensemble members work with a director, production team, and graduate assistants to mount a fully produced Shakespeare play on the campus of NYU. Participants investigate how Shakespeare&rsquo;s language resonates for them, within their own personal experiences. The production is supported by designers and stage managers and is documented by a video artist. The 2015 play will be Hamlet . This program will run for four weeks&mdash;June 29th through July 25th. A detailed schedule will be provided to participants in June. The program primarily runs Monday through Friday from 9:00am-3:00pm, but there are at least two Saturday rehearsals as well as evening performances in the final week. Lunch is provided every program day. The experience culminates in four public performances. There is a materials fee that covers the cost of lunches, a performance DVD, and a t-shirt. There are limited merit-based and need-based scholarships available.       Faculty    Dr. Jonathan Jones is a graduate of the master's and doctoral programs at NYU's Program in Educational Theatre.
