The program consists of three semesters of full-time course work, beginning with an exciting Summer Institute.    The curriculum includes two required courses--Introduction to Performance Studies and Projects in Performance Studies--which are complemented by seven courses chosen in consultation with the student\u2019s faculty adviser according to individual interests and needs. Students in the program are also encouraged to apply for internships in dramaturgy, museum curating, and other programs with which the department maintains contact.    Students who earn an interdisciplinary degree through the one-year M.A. program gain an academic edge for application into PhD. programs, not only in performance studies, cultural studies, and visual studies, but also in traditional disciplines such as English, anthropology, theatre, history, and sociology, as well as area studies such as Latin/o America and the Caribbean, African and African American, and Asian American studies.    Graduates of the M.A. program are currently pursuing careers as artists, writers, researchers, editors, performers, choreographers, directors, arts administrators, archivists, curators, radio broadcasters, and teachers.    The M.A. in Performance Studies is awarded by NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science.    Advantages of the One-Year M.A. Format       Complete degree requirements in just 12 months    Concentrated format makes the program easier to finance    Completion in May facilitates students applying to Ph.D. programs for September   Performance Studies Application Requirements M.A. Requirements Tisch Graduate Admissions Page Performance Studies Financial Aid Opportunities Performance Studies Graduate Programs Open House | October 28, 2014  Prospective Graduate Student FAQ  Department of Performance Studies 721 Broadway, 6th Floor New York, NY 10003               Phone:       212 998 1620               Fax:       212 995 4571 performance.studies@nyu.edu           Undergraduate Admissions Graduate Admissions Academic Services Student Life Financial Aid and Scholarships Career Development Counseling Services International Students Incoming Students Graduation Forms What is Special Programs?
