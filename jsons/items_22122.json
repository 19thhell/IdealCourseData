What happens after I submit my application and resume in the system?                                                       Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                            How long do you keep applications on file?                                                       Your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for job opportunities for one year.                                                                                                                                                                            What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.

Academic positions (faculty and research scientists) are advertised in a variety of venues (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, professional journals) by individual schools and/or academic departments within NYU. Therefore, all inquiries should be directed specifically to the appropriate school or department.

If you have any questions or need assistance accessing our system, please contact NYU PeopleLink via e-mail at askpeoplelink@nyu.edu .                                                                                                    Apply for Jobs @ nyucareers.com                                With NYU's automated application system, the process for applying for jobs is fast and efficient.     Within the application you have the opportunity to &quot;cut and paste&quot; your resume and cover letter or upload your resume into the system.   Once you have completed the online application, you will receive a confirmation message. This verifies your application is now in the system.   Resumes of qualified applicants will become part of our general database for future consideration, and will enable us to review qualifications as positions become available.   If you are contacted by a Human Resources representative, you will be asked to sign the Application for Employment at the time of the interview.   Please note that the application process is competitive. Applications are screened and only those applicants who appear to most closely fit the job requirements will be contacted for interviews. In the event you are not contacted, your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for other job opportunities for one year.   In addition to interviews, further screening is conducted for some positions. This may include testing for knowledge of specific software packages or extensive background investigations depending on the type of position.   Should you encounter difficulty in accessing the system or should you require any further assistance, please contact PeopleLink, NYU's new integrated service center for HR, Benefits, and Payroll inquiries, at askpeoplelink@nyu.edu .

What happens after I submit my application and resume in the system?                                                       Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                            How long do you keep applications on file?                                                       Your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for job opportunities for one year.                                                                                                                                                                            What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.

Academic positions (faculty and research scientists) are advertised in a variety of venues (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, professional journals) by individual schools and/or academic departments within NYU. Therefore, all inquiries should be directed specifically to the appropriate school or department.

If you have any questions or need assistance accessing our system, please contact NYU PeopleLink via e-mail at askpeoplelink@nyu.edu .                                                                                                    Apply for Jobs @ nyucareers.com                                With NYU's automated application system, the process for applying for jobs is fast and efficient.     Within the application you have the opportunity to &quot;cut and paste&quot; your resume and cover letter or upload your resume into the system.   Once you have completed the online application, you will receive a confirmation message. This verifies your application is now in the system.   Resumes of qualified applicants will become part of our general database for future consideration, and will enable us to review qualifications as positions become available.   If you are contacted by a Human Resources representative, you will be asked to sign the Application for Employment at the time of the interview.   Please note that the application process is competitive. Applications are screened and only those applicants who appear to most closely fit the job requirements will be contacted for interviews. In the event you are not contacted, your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for other job opportunities for one year.   In addition to interviews, further screening is conducted for some positions. This may include testing for knowledge of specific software packages or extensive background investigations depending on the type of position.   Should you encounter difficulty in accessing the system or should you require any further assistance, please contact PeopleLink, NYU's new integrated service center for HR, Benefits, and Payroll inquiries, at askpeoplelink@nyu.edu .

What happens after I submit my application and resume in the system?                                                       Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.

What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.                                                                                                                                                                            How do I apply for faculty or research positions?                                                       Academic positions (faculty and research scientists) are advertised in a variety of venues (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, professional journals) by individual schools and/or academic departments within NYU. Therefore, all inquiries should be directed specifically to the appropriate school or department.
