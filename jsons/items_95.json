Current News/Projects  Updated June 2014     Pintupi dialogues: reconstructing memories of art, land and Community   through the visual record (Australian Research Council Linkage grant   2010-2013) .\u2028   I am currently completing work on an ARC Linkage grant to use visual   records to animate historical consciousness with the Pintupi   communities of Kintore, NT and Kiwirrkura, WA. This involves not only   returning to my earliest work in Pintupi communities, but also extending   my involvement with visual culture, representations, and art. The   grant is a collaboration with the mainly Pintupi Aboriginal-owned art   cooperative, Papunya Tula Artists Ltd., Dr. Peter Thorley of the   National Museum of Australia, and Professor Nicolas Peterson and Ms.   Philippa Deveson of the Australian National University, Dr Peter Thorley   of the National Museum of Australia, and myself of New York University.   Together with the members of these two remote Western Desert   communities, we are using film and photography to reflect on a pivotal   period in the history of the Pintupi people with whom I have been   working since 1973. In 1964, internationally renowned filmmaker, Ian   Dunlop accompanying then Patrol Officer Jeremy Long, had photographed Pintupi people as among the   last Aboriginal people still living a nomadic life in central   Australia's western desert. He returned in 1974 to film these same   people, now living at the government-supported Yayayi outstation where I   was carrying out my doctoral fieldwork.      (Fred Myers and Marlene Nampitjinpa Spencer discussing her memories of Yayayi) Using these visual records as the basis for a dialogue with the living   Pintupi descendants of those in the film and photographs, we are   reconstructing an account of how the Pintupi sought to fashion their own   modernity, with a particular emphasis on the great transition \u2013   sedentarization and incorporation into the Australian state -- in their   lives that took place in the 1960s and 1970s.     We have produced a film that attends to this dialogue, focusing on   Marlene Spencer Nampitjinpa's reflections on the film, entitled   \"Remembering Yayayi,\" Her reflections about herself and her family as   they appear in the footage incorporate points of view from several other   Pintupi consultants about the earlier film footage and the outstation.     As another distinct part of this, I am writing a book on the early   period of Pintupi living in this remote outstation community,   significant as one of the first outstation or homeland communities   established within the then-new policy framework of \u201cAboriginal   self-determination\u201d articulated by the Whitlam government upon its   election in 1973. The policies of \u201cself-determination\u201d \u2013 an expression   of international as well as local aspirations for colonized people --   have in recent years been heavily criticized by conservatives in   Australia as a failure and a significant cause of the many problems that   continue to plague Indigenous Australia. My goal in writing this book   is to confront these representations with an historically nuanced   account of life and the imaginings of a future in such a community.     Australian Cultural Fields: National and Transnational Dynamics  Australian Research Council Discovery Project (DP140101970) \u2013 2014-2016     I am part of a new group project, funded by the Australian Research   Council and directed by Professor Tony Bennett of the University of   Western Sydney, that is just commencing. \"Australian Cultural Fields\"   examines the forces changing contemporary Australian culture. Focusing   on art, literature, media, sport, music and heritage, it assesses the   influence of transnationalism, digital media, migration and   multiculturalism, and the distinctive presence of Indigenous culture, on   the relations between culture, class, gender, ethnicity and nation.    The concept of \u2018cultural field\u2019 is taken from the work of sociologist   Pierre Bourdieu, who developed the idea to investigate how the   production and consumption of culture are affected by relations between   cultural institutions, policy agencies, and cultural markets. Australian   Cultural Fields will develop this perspective in number of ways. It   will be the first study to examine transnational forces, new information   technologies and the changing salience of migrant and Indigenous   cultures in the contemporary Australian context. Internationally, it   will be the first large-scale study to interrogate the relations between   the fields of cultural production and consumption.     It is going to be a challenge for me to work with new methodologies and   kinds of information, but very exciting. I will be working with some of   the leading scholars in Australian Cultural Studies -- Tony Bennett,   Graeme Turner, Greg Noble, David Rowe, David Carter, Deborah Stevenson,   Emma Waterton, and my old friend Tim Rowse.

Current News/Projects  Updated June 2014     Pintupi dialogues: reconstructing memories of art, land and Community   through the visual record (Australian Research Council Linkage grant   2010-2013) .\u2028   I am currently completing work on an ARC Linkage grant to use visual   records to animate historical consciousness with the Pintupi   communities of Kintore, NT and Kiwirrkura, WA. This involves not only   returning to my earliest work in Pintupi communities, but also extending   my involvement with visual culture, representations, and art. The   grant is a collaboration with the mainly Pintupi Aboriginal-owned art   cooperative, Papunya Tula Artists Ltd., Dr. Peter Thorley of the   National Museum of Australia, and Professor Nicolas Peterson and Ms.   Philippa Deveson of the Australian National University, Dr Peter Thorley   of the National Museum of Australia, and myself of New York University.   Together with the members of these two remote Western Desert   communities, we are using film and photography to reflect on a pivotal   period in the history of the Pintupi people with whom I have been   working since 1973. In 1964, internationally renowned filmmaker, Ian   Dunlop accompanying then Patrol Officer Jeremy Long, had photographed Pintupi people as among the   last Aboriginal people still living a nomadic life in central   Australia's western desert. He returned in 1974 to film these same   people, now living at the government-supported Yayayi outstation where I   was carrying out my doctoral fieldwork.      (Fred Myers and Marlene Nampitjinpa Spencer discussing her memories of Yayayi) Using these visual records as the basis for a dialogue with the living   Pintupi descendants of those in the film and photographs, we are   reconstructing an account of how the Pintupi sought to fashion their own   modernity, with a particular emphasis on the great transition \u2013   sedentarization and incorporation into the Australian state -- in their   lives that took place in the 1960s and 1970s.     We have produced a film that attends to this dialogue, focusing on   Marlene Spencer Nampitjinpa's reflections on the film, entitled   \"Remembering Yayayi,\" Her reflections about herself and her family as   they appear in the footage incorporate points of view from several other   Pintupi consultants about the earlier film footage and the outstation.     As another distinct part of this, I am writing a book on the early   period of Pintupi living in this remote outstation community,   significant as one of the first outstation or homeland communities   established within the then-new policy framework of \u201cAboriginal   self-determination\u201d articulated by the Whitlam government upon its   election in 1973. The policies of \u201cself-determination\u201d \u2013 an expression   of international as well as local aspirations for colonized people --   have in recent years been heavily criticized by conservatives in   Australia as a failure and a significant cause of the many problems that   continue to plague Indigenous Australia. My goal in writing this book   is to confront these representations with an historically nuanced   account of life and the imaginings of a future in such a community.     Australian Cultural Fields: National and Transnational Dynamics  Australian Research Council Discovery Project (DP140101970) \u2013 2014-2016     I am part of a new group project, funded by the Australian Research   Council and directed by Professor Tony Bennett of the University of   Western Sydney, that is just commencing. \"Australian Cultural Fields\"   examines the forces changing contemporary Australian culture. Focusing   on art, literature, media, sport, music and heritage, it assesses the   influence of transnationalism, digital media, migration and   multiculturalism, and the distinctive presence of Indigenous culture, on   the relations between culture, class, gender, ethnicity and nation.    The concept of \u2018cultural field\u2019 is taken from the work of sociologist   Pierre Bourdieu, who developed the idea to investigate how the   production and consumption of culture are affected by relations between   cultural institutions, policy agencies, and cultural markets. Australian   Cultural Fields will develop this perspective in number of ways. It   will be the first study to examine transnational forces, new information   technologies and the changing salience of migrant and Indigenous   cultures in the contemporary Australian context. Internationally, it   will be the first large-scale study to interrogate the relations between   the fields of cultural production and consumption.     It is going to be a challenge for me to work with new methodologies and   kinds of information, but very exciting. I will be working with some of   the leading scholars in Australian Cultural Studies -- Tony Bennett,   Graeme Turner, Greg Noble, David Rowe, David Carter, Deborah Stevenson,   Emma Waterton, and my old friend Tim Rowse.

Drawing on nearly two years of fieldwork in France, my book Trade of the Tricks: Inside the Magician\u2019s Craft (California, 2011) explores the production, circulation, and display of secrets within the subculture of entertainment magicians. More recently, I have written about intercultural magic performances in colonial contact zones, and the resignification of magical practices by evangelical Christian conjurers. In collaboration with Bambi Schieffelin, I have also written extensively about Computer-Mediated Communication, with a particular focus on reflexive language. At MIT, I teach classes on a range of subjects, including: the anthropology of play; mediated communication; and ethnographic methods.

Race, \"Difference,\" and Social Inequality      ANTH-UA 323 Identical to SCA-UA 323. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Khan. 4 points.   Human beings have always grappled with some notion of identity, asking questions about who they are, about who others distinguished from themselves are, and about the ways that perceived similarities and differences are meaningful and important (or not) in social relationships. Examines how historical, social, and cultural contexts shape the forms that identities take, looking in particular at ideas about race and racial identity. We work with two premises: (1) race must be understood in relation to other identity categories: gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on, and (2) race is expressed in both obvious and subtle ways; thus, racial identity is implicit as well as explicitly expressed. We also consider whether race must necessarily be understood as stigma; discuss nonfiction, fiction, and films; and may visit public exhibitions.

Examines the global prevalence of gender violence and the varied meanings of violence against women and changes in terminology over time. Examines ways of theorizing gender and violence, including performative ideas of gender. The creation of gender violence as a social problem is a product of social movements in the United States, Europe, India, and many other parts of the world. It is now understood globally as an important human rights violation. Also examines the forms of intervention that have been developed in the United States and globally for diminishing violence against women, including policing, prosecution, and punishment.    Human Rights and Culture    ANTH-UA 331 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points.   Offers an overview of the human rights system, looking at its basic elements and studying how it works. Focuses on the relationships between human rights and culture. Human rights campaigns frequently encounter resistance in the name of protecting cultural differences. This is particularly common with issues concerning women, children, and the family. Explores several issues that raise questions of human rights and culture, such as female genital cutting, honor killing, trafficking of persons, and indigenous peoples' rights to culture. Using these examples, considers how the human rights system deals with tensions between global standards and local ways of life. Examines the meanings of rights and of culture in these debates and shows the implications of adopting an anthropological analysis of these situations. The goal of the course is developing an understanding of human rights in practice.    Body, Gender, and Belief in China    ANTH-UA 350 Identical to RELST-UA 350.

Culture Through Food    ANTH-UA 410 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, Rogers. 4 points.   Explores some of the ways that people use food, cuisines, and eating to organize and engage with social worlds. This focus provides a concrete means for deepening our understanding of alternative models of social explanation. Drawing on ethnographic material from a wide range of cultures, as well as feature films and our own observations and interviews, we consider topics such as the material dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption (e.g., how food scarcity or abundance shapes collective possibilities, expectations, and values; the causes, consequences, forms, and myths of globalization) and the cultural meanings and social distinctions encoded in food practices (e.g., how food is used cross-culturally as a marker of social identity\u2014class, gender, and ethnicity\u2014and as a source of meaning\u2014nostalgia, anxiety, and so on). Formations of Indigeneity ANTH-UA 605 Formerly ANTH-UA 320. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Through a case study of materials concerning indigenous people in Australia and North America, this course will investigate the consequences (cultural, sociological, policy) of a development that has taken place throughout the world. Many of the peoples in whom anthropologists have long been interested\u2013those organized into small-scale societies, kinship based\u2013have been encapsulated as indigenous minorities within nation states dominated by other cultural traditions. In this context, the capacity and practices of these peoples, who some have characterized as \u201cFourth World peoples,\u201d to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically reinforced.

Between the end of the Ice Age and the expansion of the Roman Empire, temperate Europe witnessed a series of social and economic transformations that represented a transition from a hunting and gathering way of life to urban chiefdoms. Along the way, these hunter-gatherers became agriculturalists and stockherders, learned to use metals, and developed social structures as complex as any found in Old World civilizations. Examines changes in later prehistoric Europe from about 8000 B.C.E. to the arrival of the Romans.    African Archaeology    ANTH-UA 218 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3). Tryon. 4 points.   With the longest record of human occupation in the world and a landmass that represents more than one-fifth the habitable area of the globe, Africa plays a central role in our understanding of human evolution, the prehistory of our species, and the development of complex societies. Explores the experiences of ancient human populations in Africa using evidence drawn from archaeology as well as history, ethnography, linguistics, art history, geography, geology, paleontology, biology, and other disciplines. Focuses not only on the material evidence from across the continent and its interpretation, but also an understanding of the major questions, developing methods of inquiry and problem solving, and situating the African data in the broader context of the archaeological evidence for the evolution of human behavioral diversity. The scope of the course spans hominin origins, the study of Stone Age foragers of the first 2.5 million years of human prehistory, and more recent periods characterized by food production, metallurgy, sedentism, and the development of complex societies (e.g., in Egypt, Mali, Zimbabwe, and the East African coast) with influence and contacts across and outside the continent.

The period covered is from 10,000 years ago to the beginning of the 20th century and is based on archaeological remains. Its history is both fascinating and mind-expanding as a different perspective on the city emerges in time and space from what is learned. Walking around its various boroughs, students learn that our modern landscape is vastly different from that of earlier eras. Along with our gains as a major cultural center, we will assess some losses brought about by the destruction of aspects of the city\u2019s past. In particular, students come to understand the meaning of stewardship in the context of urban development. At the same time, viewing our place in the city\u2019s 10,000 years of history gives us a deeper sense of time and place and a unity in its shared heritage.

Why do some primates live in large social groups while others are solitary and yet others live in pairs or cooperatively breeding families? Why are strong social hierarchies seen in some primate taxa but not in others? How do multiple species of primates often manage to coexist in the same habitat? Why are social relationships in some primate species characterized by strong bonds among females while such bonds are absent in other primate societies? Why do some species of primates show marked geographic variability in behavior and social structure? The answers to these and other questions lie in understanding the relationships between each species and its ecological and social setting and in understanding each species' phylogenetic history.
