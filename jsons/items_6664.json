Within in a comparative perspective we will consider the diverse sources & modes of representation, including American travelers\u2019 exoticizing accounts of the \u201cHoly Land,\u201d early Zionist utopianist narratives, Palestinian documentarist photography & contemporary historicizing anthologies of past images. We will study the ways images of maps, landscapes, archeological sites, villages, cities, houses, & communities have come to constitute a kind of visual archive that both document the past & serves as \u201cevidence\u201d for specific historical narratives. In recent photographic anthologies, historical texts, tourist guidebooks, memoirs, novels, as well as in documentary & fictional films, such visual material prior to the partition of Palestine has played an important role in the battle over representation. In context of partition & displacement, we will argue, dominant & counter media also play in defining national identity & communal belonging. Rather than taking for granted such notions as \u201cseeing is believing\u201d & \u201cimages do not lie,\u201d we will address the complex relationship between image & word, & between text & context. The seminar will be organized around key concepts & questions having to do with the orientalist imaginary, national allegory, & diasporic narratives.

The purpose of this doctoral course, \u201cSpecial Topics in Critical Theory: Marx,\u201d is to read key works by Marx, supplemented by some contemporary texts in western Marxist political theory, with the ultimate goal of understanding the various political & philosophical debates with which these texts engage. The course emphasizes Marxism as as a political theory, but will also address Marxism as a scholarly methodology for critique applicable to disciplines beyond political theory. Some attention is given to the so-called cultural turn in twentieth-century Marxist thought, including Marx's influence on feminism, identity, representation, & visual culture. Themes include: the commodity, alienation & reification, surplus value, ideology, consumerism, subjectivity, postfordism, community, & communism.

More particularly, the course will consider the ways that the modern category \u201cinformation\u201d has emerged in relation to different media & different genres. What are the social, material, institutional, & semantic conditions that have worked to align communication with truth or authenticity? What routes can be discerned between a history of media & a history of objectivity? Significant attention will be paid to the elaboration of key terms & concepts as well as to different disciplinary & interdisciplinary resources that shape such an inquiry.

This class offers a counterpoint by examining the legacies of these experiences in visual & cultural studies. It suggests a different history of the present than is usually told, with particular regard to visuality in film, art & performance. Each participant will undertake a research project using materials in the Tamiment Library (& elsewhere if needed) & will present the results in a mini-conference at the end of the semester.

From e-mail to texting, from online gaming to online banking, from You Tube to Hulu, from DoS attacks to Second Life sit-ins, nearly every traditional aspect of our lives has found a new expression in its digital proxy. In order to understand the cultural, social, political & economic consequences of this development, we must look to the origins of today\u2019s cyberculture, in the futuristic visions (both dystonian & utopian) that shaped the development of today\u2019s networked technologies. We will trace the genealogy of these visions, as they developed in tandem with the growing digital communications infrastructure over the past three quarters of a century, & evolved into new forms that even the most forward-thinking of visionaries could not have predicted. Ultimately, one can argue the the Internet has both exceeded & fallen short of the hype that surrounded its birth & development, & by comparing the myth to the reality, we may better understand what aspects of the human condition are likely to persist regardless of technological development.

It will center on understanding how cultural hegemony is attained, but how established norms are subverted & challenged, particularly along political & cultural fronts. Examples will be drawn from the contemporary United States, France & other countries, including global social justice movements. A variety of media formats will be reviewed, from film & print media, to social media, to protest & occupation.

We will examine a range of forms of mediated production & consumption understood broadly in relation to political, economic, & cultural power, & situate these forms in relation to contemporary theorizing about global cultural convergence, divergence, & hybridity.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2381            Topics in Globalization: Global Consumer Culture           Consumer culture by its nature is intensely local & inevitably global. Its locality is tied up with the intimacy of food, clothing, & shelter, & the elasticity of the relationship between bodies & things, between needs & desires, yet its meanings & messages are globally circulated & produced. This course explores critical approaches to the globalization of consumer culture by examining how bodies & things shape each other through long histories (colonial, postcolonial, global) of production, distribution, & fashion. Students will study the social world of global consumers as an analytic entry point into the complex networks of cultural practice which mediate the perennial tension between habituation & novelty.

Focuses on case studies of the supranational regional players in some of the most important geo-linguistic world markets, where the tensions between global/transnational media flows & local interests are most evident, engaging with theoretical positions ranging from critiques of the homogenizing effects of globalization to those that affirm the changing power relations of counter-flows based on audience preferences.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-UE 1306            Transnational Media Flows           This class examines the intersecting dynamics of media genres & geo-linguistic cultural markets in the configuration of global & regional media flows. It looks in particular at the way media genres travel & how their circulation raises issues about the cultural power of certain media narratives in specific historical, political & social conditions of consumption. We will examine the battle for national, regional, & global media markets as a struggle for the \u2018legitimate\u2019 cultural & political view of the world expressed through information (news), scientific discourse (documentaries), & popular culture (films, tele novels, reality television, music) to understand the complex global flow of television programs & films.

In recent photographic anthologies, historical texts, tourist guidebooks, memoirs, novels, as well as in documentary & fictional films, such visual material prior to the partition of Palestine has played an important role in the battle over representation. In context of partition & displacement, we will argue, dominant & counter media also play in defining national identity & communal belonging.

Emphasis will be given on how space socially organizes human meaning & on the ?inscription? of space. How do people, through, their practices & their being in the world, form relationships with the locales they occupy (both the natural world & the build environment)? How do they attach meanings to spaces to create places? & how do the experiences of inhabiting viewing & hearing those places shape their meanings, communicative practices, cultural performance memories & habits? Course themes include; mapping & the imagination; vision & space, soundscape, architecture & landscape; new media & space/time compression; space & identity; spatial violence; spatialization of memory.

The purpose of this doctoral course, \u201cSpecial Topics in Critical Theory: Marx,\u201d is to read key works by Marx, supplemented by some contemporary texts in western Marxist political theory, with the ultimate goal of understanding the various political & philosophical debates with which these texts engage. The course emphasizes Marxism as as a political theory, but will also address Marxism as a scholarly methodology for critique applicable to disciplines beyond political theory. Some attention is given to the so-called cultural turn in twentieth-century Marxist thought, including Marx's influence on feminism, identity, representation, & visual culture. Themes include: the commodity, alienation & reification, surplus value, ideology, consumerism, subjectivity, postfordism, community, & communism.

The aim of this particular course is to chart the history of how consumerism has been theorized since the nineteenth century, & to make clear the connections between the literature on consumerism/consumption & the literature on visual consumption & the relationship of modernity & visuality. The course will thus trace an arc from the literature on nineteenth century practices of visual consumption & the rise of consumer society to contemporary debates about the relationship of consumerism to philanthropy, neoliberalism & global capitalism, & theories of cultural resistance in the context of new media practices.

More particularly, the course will consider the ways that the modern category \u201cinformation\u201d has emerged in relation to different media & different genres. What are the social, material, institutional, & semantic conditions that have worked to align communication with truth or authenticity? What routes can be discerned between a history of media & a history of objectivity? Significant attention will be paid to the elaboration of key terms & concepts as well as to different disciplinary & interdisciplinary resources that shape such an inquiry.

We begin with an overview of cybernetics, information theory, systems theory, distributed communications networks, & theories of postmodernity. Next, we examine the rise of immaterial labor in the service economies & the extension of codified labor practices into the realm of daily life. The seminar will also consider the ramifications of informatic capture & the formation of coded objects & bodies. Finally, we explore networked struggle &, through it, a political theory of the present moment. The course will favor both close readings of specific technologies as well as social & cultural claims about the information age.

This class offers a counterpoint by examining the legacies of these experiences in visual & cultural studies. It suggests a different history of the present than is usually told, with particular regard to visuality in film, art & performance. Each participant will undertake a research project using materials in the Tamiment Library (& elsewhere if needed) & will present the results in a mini-conference at the end of the semester.

From e-mail to texting, from online gaming to online banking, from You Tube to Hulu, from DoS attacks to Second Life sit-ins, nearly every traditional aspect of our lives has found a new expression in its digital proxy. In order to understand the cultural, social, political & economic consequences of this development, we must look to the origins of today\u2019s cyberculture, in the futuristic visions (both dystonian & utopian) that shaped the development of today\u2019s networked technologies. We will trace the genealogy of these visions, as they developed in tandem with the growing digital communications infrastructure over the past three quarters of a century, & evolved into new forms that even the most forward-thinking of visionaries could not have predicted. Ultimately, one can argue the the Internet has both exceeded & fallen short of the hype that surrounded its birth & development, & by comparing the myth to the reality, we may better understand what aspects of the human condition are likely to persist regardless of technological development.

It will center on understanding how cultural hegemony is attained, but how established norms are subverted & challenged, particularly along political & cultural fronts. Examples will be drawn from the contemporary United States, France & other countries, including global social justice movements. A variety of media formats will be reviewed, from film & print media, to social media, to protest & occupation.

Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2384            Topics in Globalization: Cultural Globalization in France           Course provides students with a critical understanding of how international flows of information & entertainment products \u2013 from news & information to movies, television & lifestyle brands -- play a role in shaping & reshaping global economic, political, military, & cultural realities. We will examine a range of forms of mediated production & consumption understood broadly in relation to political, economic, & cultural power, & situate these forms in relation to contemporary theorizing about global cultural convergence, divergence, & hybridity.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2381            Topics in Globalization: Global Consumer Culture           Consumer culture by its nature is intensely local & inevitably global. Its locality is tied up with the intimacy of food, clothing, & shelter, & the elasticity of the relationship between bodies & things, between needs & desires, yet its meanings & messages are globally circulated & produced. This course explores critical approaches to the globalization of consumer culture by examining how bodies & things shape each other through long histories (colonial, postcolonial, global) of production, distribution, & fashion. Students will study the social world of global consumers as an analytic entry point into the complex networks of cultural practice which mediate the perennial tension between habituation & novelty.

Course Page               45    4            MCC-GE 2167            Transnational Media Flows           Analyzes the global flow of media products, in particular the circulation of television & film in transnational contexts, at the intersection of political economy (economic, business, & institutional frameworks) with cultural economy (the cultural meanings of these television & film products). Focuses on case studies of the supranational regional players in some of the most important geo-linguistic world markets, where the tensions between global/transnational media flows & local interests are most evident, engaging with theoretical positions ranging from critiques of the homogenizing effects of globalization to those that affirm the changing power relations of counter-flows based on audience preferences.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-UE 1306            Transnational Media Flows           This class examines the intersecting dynamics of media genres & geo-linguistic cultural markets in the configuration of global & regional media flows. It looks in particular at the way media genres travel & how their circulation raises issues about the cultural power of certain media narratives in specific historical, political & social conditions of consumption. We will examine the battle for national, regional, & global media markets as a struggle for the \u2018legitimate\u2019 cultural & political view of the world expressed through information (news), scientific discourse (documentaries), & popular culture (films, tele novels, reality television, music) to understand the complex global flow of television programs & films.

Students examine work in the philosophy & social study of technology to understand the rich & sometimes troubling relationship between values & technical design. Course will ask: Is technology neutral? Who should make key decisions? What is the role of scientists & engineers? The course examines specific cases, such as, the Internet, search engines, web-cookies, & data mining from philosophical, empirical, & technical perspectives.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2450            Video Game Theory           The purpose of this class is both to provide a general introduction to the field of video game studies, & to suggest a host of divergent directions such research may take in the near future. From the phenomenology of thumbs to the ethical thickets of codes & cheats, the class will address the key questions facing game researchers today; true to the field\u2019s intent interdisciplinary nature, methodologies considered will very from ethnography to semiotic analysis. Relevant examples will be provided throughout, & no preexisting knowledge of gaming is necessary.

Within in a comparative perspective we will consider the diverse sources & modes of representation, including American travelers\u2019 exoticizing accounts of the \u201cHoly Land,\u201d early Zionist utopianist narratives, Palestinian documentarist photography & contemporary historicizing anthologies of past images. We will study the ways images of maps, landscapes, archeological sites, villages, cities, houses, & communities have come to constitute a kind of visual archive that both document the past & serves as \u201cevidence\u201d for specific historical narratives. In recent photographic anthologies, historical texts, tourist guidebooks, memoirs, novels, as well as in documentary & fictional films, such visual material prior to the partition of Palestine has played an important role in the battle over representation. In context of partition & displacement, we will argue, dominant & counter media also play in defining national identity & communal belonging. Rather than taking for granted such notions as \u201cseeing is believing\u201d & \u201cimages do not lie,\u201d we will address the complex relationship between image & word, & between text & context. The seminar will be organized around key concepts & questions having to do with the orientalist imaginary, national allegory, & diasporic narratives.

No more is this the case than when we talk about the issue of race. While biological notions of race have lost their scientific validity, race remains a salient issue in American life as a social & political reality sustained through a wide variety of media forms. The broad purpose of this course is to better understand how notions of race have been defined & shaped in & through these mediated forms. Specific attention may be given o the ways that race is articulated in forms of mass media & popular culture.

We explore a range of histories, archeologies & ethnographies of sound & listening, as it intersects with topics in media studies, science & technology studies, political economy & musicology. How has our experience of sound changed as we move from the piano to the personal computer, from the phonoautograph to the mp3? How have political, commercial, & cultural forces shaped what we are able to listen to, & how we listen to it? Finally, how have performers, physiologists, acousticians, engineers & philosophers worked to understand this radical transformation of the senses?

How has the sound of Africa been transcribed, recorded, stored, transported, & represented in the West? What can this tell us about global cultural flow? How do specific recording techniques articulate with global music markets? The course analyzes the transatlantic feedback between Africa, America & Europe; evaluates the politics of transcription, ethnographic description, & recording; & examines the changing role for traditional African music in a global world.

Emphasis will be given on how space socially organizes human meaning & on the ?inscription? of space. How do people, through, their practices & their being in the world, form relationships with the locales they occupy (both the natural world & the build environment)? How do they attach meanings to spaces to create places? & how do the experiences of inhabiting viewing & hearing those places shape their meanings, communicative practices, cultural performance memories & habits? Course themes include; mapping & the imagination; vision & space, soundscape, architecture & landscape; new media & space/time compression; space & identity; spatial violence; spatialization of memory.

The purpose of this doctoral course, \u201cSpecial Topics in Critical Theory: Marx,\u201d is to read key works by Marx, supplemented by some contemporary texts in western Marxist political theory, with the ultimate goal of understanding the various political & philosophical debates with which these texts engage. The course emphasizes Marxism as as a political theory, but will also address Marxism as a scholarly methodology for critique applicable to disciplines beyond political theory. Some attention is given to the so-called cultural turn in twentieth-century Marxist thought, including Marx's influence on feminism, identity, representation, & visual culture. Themes include: the commodity, alienation & reification, surplus value, ideology, consumerism, subjectivity, postfordism, community, & communism.

The aim of this particular course is to chart the history of how consumerism has been theorized since the nineteenth century, & to make clear the connections between the literature on consumerism/consumption & the literature on visual consumption & the relationship of modernity & visuality. The course will thus trace an arc from the literature on nineteenth century practices of visual consumption & the rise of consumer society to contemporary debates about the relationship of consumerism to philanthropy, neoliberalism & global capitalism, & theories of cultural resistance in the context of new media practices.

More particularly, the course will consider the ways that the modern category \u201cinformation\u201d has emerged in relation to different media & different genres. What are the social, material, institutional, & semantic conditions that have worked to align communication with truth or authenticity? What routes can be discerned between a history of media & a history of objectivity? Significant attention will be paid to the elaboration of key terms & concepts as well as to different disciplinary & interdisciplinary resources that shape such an inquiry.

We will survey the ways scholars in STS\u2014whose research methods range from historical epistemology to medical anthropology to the sociology of science\u2014have understood the natural world, technical systems, human perception, & the social order to be co-produced. Following Bruno Latour, throughout the course we will investigate \u201cmatters of fact\u201d as always \u201cmatters of concern.\u201d      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 3152            Special Topics in Technology Studies: AudioVision: Sound and Listening in Film and Other Media           This seminar examines audiovisual phenomena, placing the various senses of sound & image in opera, music theater, video (& gaming), & especially cinema in historical & theoretical contexts. The course examines a history of relationships between the senses of sight & cultural conditions for the shifting modalities of visual & sonic experience, the course attempts to interrogate the ideological stakes of this dichotomy. The course will examine the history of a lopsided dichotomy of the senses in writers ranging from Plato & Boethius via Kant & Schopenhauer to Deleuze, Derrida, & Chion.

We begin with an overview of cybernetics, information theory, systems theory, distributed communications networks, & theories of postmodernity. Next, we examine the rise of immaterial labor in the service economies & the extension of codified labor practices into the realm of daily life. The seminar will also consider the ramifications of informatic capture & the formation of coded objects & bodies. Finally, we explore networked struggle &, through it, a political theory of the present moment. The course will favor both close readings of specific technologies as well as social & cultural claims about the information age.

This class offers a counterpoint by examining the legacies of these experiences in visual & cultural studies. It suggests a different history of the present than is usually told, with particular regard to visuality in film, art & performance. Each participant will undertake a research project using materials in the Tamiment Library (& elsewhere if needed) & will present the results in a mini-conference at the end of the semester.

We ask whether climate can be considered a medium in its own right as the interface between humans & the biosphere, taking the sea as a particular example. This course situates climate change in relation to visual culture & cultural studies, examining the implications of the global & visual history of climate in relation to the current debate on the politics of climate change.

From e-mail to texting, from online gaming to online banking, from You Tube to Hulu, from DoS attacks to Second Life sit-ins, nearly every traditional aspect of our lives has found a new expression in its digital proxy. In order to understand the cultural, social, political & economic consequences of this development, we must look to the origins of today\u2019s cyberculture, in the futuristic visions (both dystonian & utopian) that shaped the development of today\u2019s networked technologies. We will trace the genealogy of these visions, as they developed in tandem with the growing digital communications infrastructure over the past three quarters of a century, & evolved into new forms that even the most forward-thinking of visionaries could not have predicted. Ultimately, one can argue the the Internet has both exceeded & fallen short of the hype that surrounded its birth & development, & by comparing the myth to the reality, we may better understand what aspects of the human condition are likely to persist regardless of technological development.

Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2381            Topics in Globalization: Global Consumer Culture           Consumer culture by its nature is intensely local & inevitably global. Its locality is tied up with the intimacy of food, clothing, & shelter, & the elasticity of the relationship between bodies & things, between needs & desires, yet its meanings & messages are globally circulated & produced. This course explores critical approaches to the globalization of consumer culture by examining how bodies & things shape each other through long histories (colonial, postcolonial, global) of production, distribution, & fashion. Students will study the social world of global consumers as an analytic entry point into the complex networks of cultural practice which mediate the perennial tension between habituation & novelty.

Focuses on case studies of the supranational regional players in some of the most important geo-linguistic world markets, where the tensions between global/transnational media flows & local interests are most evident, engaging with theoretical positions ranging from critiques of the homogenizing effects of globalization to those that affirm the changing power relations of counter-flows based on audience preferences.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-UE 1306            Transnational Media Flows           This class examines the intersecting dynamics of media genres & geo-linguistic cultural markets in the configuration of global & regional media flows. It looks in particular at the way media genres travel & how their circulation raises issues about the cultural power of certain media narratives in specific historical, political & social conditions of consumption. We will examine the battle for national, regional, & global media markets as a struggle for the \u2018legitimate\u2019 cultural & political view of the world expressed through information (news), scientific discourse (documentaries), & popular culture (films, tele novels, reality television, music) to understand the complex global flow of television programs & films.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1002 - Space and Place in Human Communication   This course will build on a core concept of Lewis Mumford who understood media ecology as a component of spatial and urban ecology. Emphasis will be given on how space socially organizes human meaning and on the inscription of space. How do people, through their practices and their being in the world, form relationships with the locales they occupy (both the natural world and the build environment)? How do they attach meaning to spaces to create places? And how do the experiences of inhabiting, viewing, and hearing those places shape their meanings, communicative practices, cultural performances, memories, and habits? Course themes include: mapping and the imagination; vision and space, soundscape, architecture and landscape, new media and space/time compression; space and identity; spatial violence; spatialization of memory.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1010 - Censorship in American Culture   An upper level course on the topic of censorship in American culture, from the late 19th century to the present. The broader context for our exploration will be the public sphere, understood in two ways: as the classic, liberal ideal-a space for civil, and equitable exchange of ideas and opinions open to all citizens-and in the more contemporary reality-a highly contested space of public discussion, where the boundaries concerning who can participate, what topics are allowed, and how the exchange takes place are drawn and redrawn. The tension between ideal and real forms of public communication plays out in highly charged debates around censorship, which take place in diverse public spaces, including literature, film, theatre, art galleries, the press, the internet, sidewalks, courts, and bars. Because these debates are cultural and legal ones, and are frequently deeply divisive within American society, the goal is for the students to have an enhanced understanding of the historical contexts in which important cultural and legal struggles over censorship took place, and to bring that understanding to bear on contemporary debates about the arts, sexuality, gender, privacy, national security, media technology, and government involvement in the marketplace of ideas and images. View sample syllabus              MCC-UE 1011 - Media and Migration   The course examines the role of media in the lives and cultures of transnational immigrant communities.

It will also focus on how elected officials set political and legislative agendas, use public relations strategies to shape public policy, and otherwise engage in the process of political deliberation. The media in which these processes take place will be an additional focus, including the influence of news outlets, political campaign advertising, and the work of political advocacy groups of various kinds.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1016 - Media Audiences   Communication scholars have long concerned themselves with the relationship between various media/technologies and &lsquo;the audience.&rsquo;  Different intentions and perspectives inform the discourse and research on how media and communication technologies and their audiences/users interact.  This course will proceed historically, theoretically, and methodologically, always questioning the construction of audiences and media users -- constructions that are shaped by commercial, academic, political and cultural contexts. Students will reflect on some historical analyses of &lsquo;emergent&rsquo; audiences and critical responses to institutional constructions of audiences.  Students will critique mass communication &lsquo;positivist&rsquo; studies and questions of &lsquo;media effects&rsquo; that dominated debates about audiences beginning in the early twentieth century and still continue today. In addition, students will examine how media and audiences are both situated in particular multiple contexts that have a bearing on how media are generated and circulated, and how audiences experience and make meaning of media/technologies. Methodologically, students will investigate how audiences are conceptualized and researched by scholars and cultural critics.  Throughout the course, students will explore the thinking and multiple contexts that frame various conceptualizations of media/technologies and audiences, and how these different approaches inform the concerns, questions, methods, findings, and implications of audience/user research . View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1017 - Youth Media and Social Change   This course explores the theory, practice, and impact of the non-profit youth media organizations and school-based programs working in this field locally and around the world.

Research projects will document and investigate how youth media is supporting the development of young people's capacities for 21st century skills of digital communication, critical literacy, and civic engagement. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1018 - Kids in Media Culture   In this course, students will examine how young people of different ages and backgrounds use, value, and find meaning in different media in different kinds of contexts, and we discuss the social, cultural, and political implications of these lived experiences. In addition, we will explore how we might address the issues raised by the contemporary communication environment, and by the realities of young people's complex interactions with popular media. Books required are David Buckingham's After the Death of Childhood: Growing Up in the Age of Electronic Media and Fisherkeller's Growing up with Television: Everyday Learning Among Young Adolescents. A packet of readings will include cultural audience studies investigating different actual kids' relationships to different media in a variety of social contexts. The culminating assignment for this class requires students to write a paper addressing a 'real' audience outside of the classroom informing them about the issues of the course, and proposing how that audience might take a course of action in response.

MCC-UE 1025 - Race and Media   America&#39;s founding principles of equality and equal opportunity have long been the subject of interpretation, debate, national angst and widespread (often violent) conflict. No more is this the case than when we talk about the issue of race. While biological notions of race have lost their scientific validity, race remains a salient issue in American life as a social and political reality sustained through a wide variety of media forms. The broad purpose of this course is to better understand how notions of race have been defined and shaped in and through these mediated forms. Specific attention may be given to the ways that race is articulated in forms of mass media and popular culture.

Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1030 - Architecture as Media: Communication Through the Built Environment   This class reads architecture and the built environment through the lenses of media, communication, and culture. The course takes seriously the proposition that spaces communicate meaningfully and that learning to read spatial productions leads to better understanding how material and technological designs are in sustained conversation with the social, over time. Through analyses of a range of spaces from Gothic Cathedrals to suburban shopping malls to homes, factories, skyscrapers and digital cities students will acquire a vocabulary for relating representations and practices, symbols and structures, and for identifying the ideological and aesthetic positions that produce settings for everyday life. View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1031 - Digital Media: Theory and Practice   This course offers students a foundational understanding of the technological building blocks that make up digital media and culture, and of the ways they come together to shape myriad facets of life. Students will acquire a working knowledge of the key concepts behind coding, and survey the contours of digital media architecture, familiarizing themselves with algorithms, databases, hardware, and similar key components. These technological frameworks will be examined as the basic grammar of digital media and related to theories of identity, privacy, policy, and other pertinent themes.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1032 - Social Media Networking   This course will examine &ldquo;social media&rdquo; from a cultural perspective, with a focus on how media technologies figure in practices of everyday life and in the construction of social relationships and identities. We will work from an expansive definition of what constitutes &ldquo;social media,&rdquo; considering social network sites, smartphone apps, and online games, among other technologies. The course itself will involve communication in social media channels in addition to the traditional seminar format, thus we will be actively participating in the phenomena under study as we go.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1033 Critical Making (NEW for Spring 2015!)   Critical making is hands-on hardware practice as a form of reflection and analysis: a way of thinking through what (and how) computing and digital media mean by understanding how they work , building on the literature of media studies and the digital humanities . By turning from software to hardware, to the physicality of computation and communications infrastructure, we will take objects apart, literally and figuratively, and in the process will learn to interpret and to intervene -- using prototyping, reverse engineering, hardware hacking and circuit bending, design fiction, electronics fabrication and other approaches -- in the material layer of digital technologies.

Commercial venues,  from restaurants to rest rooms, pipe Muzak into its spaces; radios broadcast  more music than any other content today; soundtracks imprint the texture of  signifying associations for television shows and films; we carry personal  playlists on mobile music players; and musical media and technologies for  making music are more readily available to us on our home computers than ever  before. We examine music and media from a variety of perspectives, including  its cultural, sensory, technological, ideological and metaphysical dimensions;  as well as the relation of music to mass media (radio, television, the  internet) and the film and music industries.       Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1040 - Health Media and Communication   The meanings of health and disease are shaped not only by  scientific and medical discourses, but by media, communication, and the  cultures of health. This course examines  the impact of media and health cultures on what counts as normal and  pathological, how medical environments are understood and experienced, popular  tactics for communicating and contesting biomedical information, public  understandings of biotechnology, and how media representation and popular  culture help to shape understandings of disease and health. Through the topic  of health, we will look at nationhood and population management,  subject-formation and stigma, individual and environmental risk. At the level  of language, we will question the metaphoric uses of disease and their  consequences. Readings, films (and other sources) will be drawn from a variety  of genres, including epidemiology, public health, anthropology, history,  communication studies, and medical memoir.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1065 - Media Events and Spectacle   This course examines the role played by media events and spectacle in the shaping of belief, attitudes, and actions, with particular attention paid to the concept of the masses and its changed meaning over time.

MCC-UE 1140 - Screening History: The Construction of American History in Hollywood Films   This course explores the ways in which popular Hollywood films construct the historical past, the ensuing battles among historians and the public over Hollywood's version of American history, and the ways that such films can be utilized as historical documents themselves. We will consider films as products of the culture industry; as visions of popularly understood history and national mythology; as evidence for how social conflicts have been depicted; and as evidence of how popular understanding and interpretations of the past have been revised from earlier eras to the present.    View sample syllabus              MCC-UE 1151 - Media History of New York   New York has played a crucial role in the history of media, and media have played a crucial role in the history of New York. New York has been represented by media since Henry Hudson wrote his reports to the Dutch.

Summer 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 Communication &amp; Persuasion - Film Classics of Propaganda Instructor: Terence Moran , Mon/Wed 5:10-8:10 PM    Topic: Communication and Persuasion: Film Classics of Propaganda   An examination of classics of film propaganda in terms of their ideologies and mythic structures and messages. We will examine three powerful ideologies of the 20 th Century via analyses of films that exemplify and promote the values and life styles of Communism in Battleship Potemkin (Soviet Union, 1925), Fascisim in Triumph des Willens (National Socialist Germany, 1934-35), and Capitalism in Sex and the City (United States, 2008). Our analyses of these films will be based upon selected readings in Jacques Ellul&rsquo;s Propaganda, The Formation of Men&rsquo;s Attitudes and Joseph Campbell&rsquo;s The Hero With a Thousand Faces with regard to propaganda and the myth of the hero. Background readings, class lectures, and models for analyzing communication and propaganda will be used to structure an environment in which our class will examine specific case studies involving films from American and foreign sources, and covering films from the silent era to the 21 st Century.    Fall 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 / Topic: The Raw Data of Intimate Life Instructor: Roger Friedland, Tuesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Social research tries to make sense of &ldquo;raw data&rdquo;, doubly so in this case as they refer to quantitative information about the sexual, romantic and religious lives of young people. This seminar seeks to teach students the basics of quantitative social research, a particular kind of sense-making that both makes and manipulates the data. This seminar will consider both the generation and testing of hypotheses using survey data on intimate life recently collected by the instructor through social network sites, the blogsphere and university course websites in the United States and Muslim-majority countries in the Near East. Students will learn to use STATA, a statistical software, in order to calculate distributions of values, cross-tabulations, and potentially regression analyses. Students will use these skills to develop and test their own hypothesis for the final paper for this seminar. Students need not have any previous statistical training. Note: This is not a course on social media; it uses social media to generate samples of media users for explanatory analysis.    MCC-UE 1200-002 / Topic: Black Lives Matter - Race, Media, and Social Movements Instructor: Nicholas Mirzoeff, Tuesdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This seminar concentrates on the use of media by and for the Black Lives Matter movement. We will historicise the movement by examining Reconstruction, Civil Rights and the Black Power movement. We will contextualize it by learning about the prison-industrial complex and the New Jim Crow. At the heart of our discussion will be media in and for the movement. We'll look at performative resistance like Hands Up, Don't Shoot; Die Ins; and Black Brunch; and the role of social media in shaping resistance. We will get to the heart of what happened in Ferguson by reading the grand jury depositions. We'll look at how #BlackLivesMatter has challenged art, cinema and museums. And we'll consider what actions to take next.    MCC-UE 1200-003 / Topic: Media Landscapes - \"The Wire\" Instructor: Arvind Rajagopal , Thursdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This course will investigate the landscapes brought into view by a specific media artifact, in this case the critically acclaimed HBO show, The Wire. The Wire&rsquo;s extraordinary success as a TV series about a &ldquo;black site&rdquo; stretched across the American heartland, namely the African American urban underclass, has been copiously studied and commented upon. It has been seen as an example of the critical and creative turn taken by a segment of the cultural industry, as a maturation of the audience and a de-massification of viewer tastes in the era of addressable mass culture. David Simon himself, among others, has also described it as a move away from postmodern irony and narrative fragmentation and towards ancient Greek myth. In this class we will explore the show as a case study in making the black underclass simultaneously spectacular and theoretically invisible.The show will provide a set of texts for students to undertake detailed textual analysis, and to deepen their readings drawing on other texts provided in the class, and on students' own readings of the world.    MCC-UE 1200-004 / Topic: Digital Media, Advocacy, and Equal Rights, in the U.S. and Abroad Instructor: Isra Ali, Mondays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    In this course we will examine different moments in which digital media plays a significant role in the advocacy for equal rights related to gender and sexuality. We will look at domestic, transnational, and international advocacy. We will consider how the political, economic, and social, impacts the way digital media is deployed, paying particular attention to forces such as militarism, nationalism, and corporate interest. We will identify who utilizes digital media to participate in the discourse, how that usage impacts and relates to offline activism, and the role digital media plays in reshaping the conversation about gender and sexuality. We will look at how people engaged in these causes use digital media to speak to one another, and to traditional media outlets that want to hear from them as a result of the presence they build on digital media. We will also examine how the notion of gender and sexual equality is articulated through social media, and think critically about the concepts of gender, sexuality, and equality, and the institutionalization of this advocacy.    MCC-UE 1200-005 / Topic: Mediating Israel/Palestine Instructor: Helga Tawil-Souri, Wednesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Israel-Palestine &ndash; whether approached as a particular place, a political problem, a conflict, or even a metaphor &ndash; is fraught with controversies, contradictions, questions, and misunderstandings. More often that not, the more one learns about Israel-Palestine, the more likely the result is of a feeling of political paralysis (&ldquo;there is simply no solution to this intractable conflict!&rdquo;). This senior seminar will attempt to reverse this by having students collectively work on one media-related problem having to do with Israel-Palestine in order to solve it, as one would do as part of an architecture studio for example. A &ldquo;problem&rdquo; will be decided on during the first sessions of the class (for example: build an equitable and shared media infrastructure; improve reporting on the conflict in mainstream media; launch a marketing campaign for a one-state solution). As with any course, students will be introduced to a range of materials; most of the time however students will be asked to bring in readings, graphics and other materials based on individual research to help the collective obtain a deeper understanding of the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; and ways to solve it. Each student will also bring his/her own expertise (e.g. historical research, photography, archival work, interviews, sketching, software coding) in order to tackle the various components of the problem we are attempting to solve. Throughout this process, students will gain an in-depth understanding of the complexities of Israel-Palestine, and end the course with a collectively-built solution.    MCC-UE 1200-006 / Topic: Time and Technology Instructor: Kate Brideau, Thursdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Many of our concerns about modern technologies have to do with time&mdash;for instance, the growing inability to sustain attention for an extended period of time, or the ways email and mobile devices seem to expand the hours of the &ldquo;work day&rdquo; indefinitely. But this is not new; technology has long had an impact on our experiences and notions of time. This course will explore that relationship, considering how technology relates both to the deep time of human history, and also to our everyday lives. Technological developments have had a significant impact on how we think about history, memory, life, death, and immortality; the rhythms by which our cities move; the speeds at which we live life, and the ways we think about labor and leisure. In this course we will engage with media archaeology, read historical and philosophical works, and analyze photography, film, recorded music, digital media, and the possibilities of biotechnology. In addition to learning about the mutability of time as it relates to technology, this course will encourage students to think critically about how technology is affecting time as they experience it today, and what relationship to time they would like to have. Should we now be turning back toward slowness as we seem to be moving ever more quickly into the future?             MCC-UE 1210 - Senior Honors in Media, Culture, and Communication   Prerequisite: senior standing and department approval to pursue honors in the major. Open only to MCC majors with senior standing.

View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1303 - Privacy and Media Technology   Few values have been as unalterably disturbed by developments in new media as privacy. This course presents a philosophical, social, and legal inquiry into the impact of digital communications upon privacy &amp; its meanings, in order to prepare students to recognize, contextualize, and analyze privacy challenges created by new information technologies. We will explore the philosophical roots of privacy as a deeply held social value and consider how it may conflict with other values, such as freedom of speech, anonymity, efficiency, accountability, and national security. Our discussions will be situated in leading ethical and legal controversies concerning new media tools (e.g., social networks, mobile apps, digital e-readers, wearable health sensors), practices (e.g., online tracking, behavioral advertising, automated face recognition, video surveillance), platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and Google Maps), and other topics shaping today's privacy discourse.

Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1306 - Transnational Media Flows   This class examines the intersecting dynamics of media genres and geo-linguistic cultural markets in the configuration of global and regional media flows. It looks in particular at the way media genres travel and how their circulation raises issues about the cultural power of certain media narratives in specific historical, political and social conditions of consumption. We will examine the battle for national, regional, and global media markets as a struggle for the ?legitimate? cultural and political view of the world expressed through information (news), scientific discourse (documentaries), and popular culture (films, telenovelas, reality television, music) to understand the complex global flow of television programs and films.    View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1310 - Culture and Media in Urban China   What  does it mean to be &ldquo;urban&rdquo; in China and how is Chinese urbanism mediated by new  cultural formations?

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1342 - Sounds In and Out of Africa   This course investigates cultural influence and exchange between Africa, the African diaspora, Europe, and America with a particular emphasis on sound and music. How has the sound of Africa been transcribed, recorded, stored, transported, and represented in the West? What can this tell us about global cultural flow? How do specific recording techniques articulate with global music markets? The course analyzes the transatlantic feedback between Africa, America and Europe; evaluates the politics of transcription, ethnographic description, and recording; and examines the changing role for traditional African music in a global world. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1345 - Fashion and Power   This course examines fashion as a form of communication and culture. Through cultural and media studies theory, we will examine how fashion makes meaning, and how it has been valued through history, popular culture and media institutions, focusing on the relationship between fashion, visual self-presentation, and power. The course will situate fashion both in terms of its production and consumption, addressing its role in relation to identity and body politics (gender, race, sexuality, class), art and status, nationhood and the global economy, celebrity and Hollywood culture, youth cultures and subversive practices. Note: This course is also offered abroad at NYU Paris under course code MCC-UE 9345. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1346 - Fame   Fame, notoriety, renown &ndash; the desire to be recognized and immortalized is the most enduring and perhaps the most desirable form of power. Culture, commerce, politics, and religion all proffer promises of fame &ndash; whether for fifteen minutes or fifteen centuries. This course departs from the insight that fame is a uniquely human ambition and a central force for social life. Together, we will investigate this subject by asking, what is fame?, Why do people want it?, How do they get it?, What can they do with it?, How does it affect those around them, and the generations that come after? In other words, what kind of good is fame? Drawing on texts from history, ethnography, theory, literature, philosophy, and contemporary media, this course will reflect on the ethics, erotics, pragmatics and pathologies of fame. We will compare fame to other forms of recognition (reputation, honor, etc.), and look at how fame operates in various social and historical circumstances, from small agricultural communities to enormous, hyper-mediated societies such as our own. Is fame, in our contemporary understanding, possible before photography? We&rsquo;ll consider the enduring question of fame as it is transformed by the technological conditions of reproducing reputation across space, time, and societies.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1347 - Culture of the Screen: From the Cinematic to the Handheld   Whether large, small, wide, high-definition, public, personal, shared, or handheld, screens are one of the most pervasive technologies in everyday life. From spaces of work to spaces of leisure, screens are sites for collaboration, performance, surveillance, and resistance. This course traces the cultural history of screens through a range of forms -- from the panorama to the cinema, from the radar system to the television, and from the terminal to the mobile device -- to provide a way of thinking about the development of the screen as simultaneously architectural, material, representational and computational. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1351 - War As Media   This course examines the proposition that contemporary war should be understood as media. War has become mediatized and media has been militarized.

View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1403 - Postcolonial Visual Culture   This courses addresses how colonialism and postcolonialism are shaped and mediated through images and the gaze. The dynamics of colonial history motivate and shape colonial and postcolonial perceptions and influence their patterns of global circulation when the boundary between the world out there and the nation at home is increasingly blurred. We will survey a range of image texts through various media (photography, television, cinema) and sites (war, the harem, refugee camps, prisons, disasters): nationalist mobilization, counter-insurgency, urban conflict, disaster management, the prison system, and the war on terror. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1404 - Media and the Culture of Money   This course examines the culture of money and finance, and the role of the media and popular culture in making sense of economics.

In introducing students to the concept of the visual construction of the social field, the course compares the means by which cultures visualize themselves in forms ranging from the imagination to the encounter between people and visualized media. The course takes as its fundamental premise that visual culture circulates and creates meaning in increasing global flows and that the very foundations of global capital, global culture, and global media are based on the dynamics of visuality and the power systems it both affirms and challenges. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1411 - Visual Culture of Science and Technology   This course examines the imagery of science and technology, the role of visuality in the construction of scientific knowledge, artistic renditions of science, and the emergence of visual technologies in modern society. It looks at how visuality has been key to the exercise of power through such practices as cataloguing and identification; the designation of abnormality, disease, and pathologies; medical diagnosis; scientific experimentation; and the marketing of science and medicine. We will examine the development of the visual technologies in the emerging scientific practices of psychiatry and criminology; explore the sciences of eugenics, genetics, pharmacology, brain and body scans, and digital medical images of many kinds; the marketing of pharmaceuticals, and the emerging politics of scientific activism. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1412 - Introduction to Visual Culture   Visual images pervade our everyday lives. We negotiate the world through visual culture, and the world itself is negotiated politically through visuality and visual images. This class is an introduction to the key issues of visual culture. It will examine the politics of images, the role that images play in producing cultural meaning, visuality and power relations, and how images are forms of visual communication. We will examine how images circulate through digital media, remakes, and viral networks, and the cross-fertilization of images between various social arenas, such as art, advertising, popular culture, news, science, entertainment media, video games, theme parks, and design.
