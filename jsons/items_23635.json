TST was designed to provide an integrated and highly coordinated system of services guided by the specific understanding of the nature of child traumatic stress. Specifically, this model conceptualizes the development of a \u2018Trauma System\u2019, which is comprised of two main elements:   A traumatized child who is not able to regulate emotional states   A social environment and/or system of care that is not sufficiently able to help the child contain this dysregulation     A \u2018Trauma System\u2019 thus emerges when a failure of the natural systemic balance between the developing child and her/his social environment occurs. Healthy development requires a regulatory balance or \u2018goodness of fit\u2019 between the child and her/his social environment such that the social environment is properly equipped to help the child. When the child enters service systems, this \u2018goodness of fit\u2019 includes the system of care, such as school or social services departments.     Given the presence of a \u2018Trauma System \u2019, the essence of TST is to help the child gain control over emotions and behavior via enhancing the child\u2019s capacity to regulate emotion and diminishing the ongoing stresses and threats in the social environment . TST was also designed to build the capacity of significant others in the child\u2019s environment to help the child control her or his emotional and behavioral responses.   TST is a phase based model; as such, a dual assessment is conducted of both the youth\u2019s emotional/behavioral regulation and the stability of the social environment. Utilizing the TST assessment grid below, the youth is assessed as being in one of 5 phases (surviving, stabilizing, enduring, understanding, transcending).   The TST phase determines the appropriate interventions to use at the time of assessment. Interventions address the stability of both the youth and the environment.

TST is about breaking down barriers between service systems, understanding a child\u2019s symptoms in the context of his or her world, and building on a family\u2019s strengths and dreams. TST is about leaving a better system. Welcome to our TST community.   Trauma Systems Therapy (TST) provides effective, evidence-based services and interventions to help children and families who have experienced traumatic events. \u00a0A clinical and research program of the NYU Child Study Center and the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at NYU's School of Medicine, the program is overseen by Dr. Glenn Saxe, Director and Chair and a team of faculty and trainees.   TST, developed by Dr. Saxe and Dr. Heidi Ellis at Boston University School of Medicine and Children\u2019s Hospital Boston, continues to grow and expand its ability to offer meaningful intervention, through its collaborations in more than 26 programs within 17 agencies across 10 states.   While the core elements of TST remain intact, many developments have taken place since Dr. Saxe\u2019s arrival at NYU, as a result of being part of such a rich clinical, academic and research environment. \u00a0The opportunities for collaboration in this dynamic setting have helped TST to grow, and will continue to help move it into exciting new directions.

TST was designed to provide an integrated and highly coordinated system of services guided by the specific understanding of the nature of child traumatic stress. Specifically, this model conceptualizes the development of a \u2018Trauma System\u2019, which is comprised of two main elements:   A traumatized child who is not able to regulate emotional states   A social environment and/or system of care that is not sufficiently able to help the child contain this dysregulation     A \u2018Trauma System\u2019 thus emerges when a failure of the natural systemic balance between the developing child and her/his social environment occurs. Healthy development requires a regulatory balance or \u2018goodness of fit\u2019 between the child and her/his social environment such that the social environment is properly equipped to help the child. When the child enters service systems, this \u2018goodness of fit\u2019 includes the system of care, such as school or social services departments.     Given the presence of a \u2018Trauma System \u2019, the essence of TST is to help the child gain control over emotions and behavior via enhancing the child\u2019s capacity to regulate emotion and diminishing the ongoing stresses and threats in the social environment . TST was also designed to build the capacity of significant others in the child\u2019s environment to help the child control her or his emotional and behavioral responses.   TST is a phase based model; as such, a dual assessment is conducted of both the youth\u2019s emotional/behavioral regulation and the stability of the social environment. Utilizing the TST assessment grid below, the youth is assessed as being in one of 5 phases (surviving, stabilizing, enduring, understanding, transcending).   The TST phase determines the appropriate interventions to use at the time of assessment. Interventions address the stability of both the youth and the environment.
