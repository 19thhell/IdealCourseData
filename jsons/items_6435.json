At WWF, Nadia worked in the Education department where she managed the Education for Nature scholarship program for Central and West Africa. Before WWF, Nadia was the Administrative Coordinator for the Center for Digital Economy Research at the Stern School of Business.         Nadia has a distinctive accent, a mishmash picked up from growing up in Cameroon, West Africa, attending a British boarding school for girls in the tea plantations of Kenya, East Africa, living on Long Island for four years and NYC for 2 years. She speaks and reads French fluently.     She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in film studies and production from Hofstra University and     is pursuing a Master of Public Administration degree in International Public Policy and Management at NYU's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.     Nadia's hobbies include website design and development, the cinema (somewhat of a film noir aficionado), watching television (someone get her TIVO! ), dancing all night, and reading mystery, suspense, thriller novels.
