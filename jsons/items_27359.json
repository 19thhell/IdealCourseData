The curriculum emphasizes project-based learning. Students, faculty and visiting talent work on editorial and web development projects together, typically with media partners who themselves need to find new approaches or face problems in succeeding online. By participating in these projects and later running their own project, students learn to grapple with all the factors that go into updating journalism for the digital era. The program seeks to draw together a diversely talented team of students who can produce excellent work that pushes the field forward and realizes some of the possibilities inherent in a multi-media, interactive and constantly evolving platform for journalism\u2014 namely, the World Wide Web and its mobile extensions.\u00a0 Studio classes provide a \"hub\" for organizing activity and a common space for inquiry and reflection around the program's various projects. Students are expected to be flexible and curious, generous in sharing skills, eager to pick up new knowledge and willing to adapt to what the project \u2014 and its deadlines \u2014 demand.\u00a0 The curriculum has three parts: 1.) the traditional requirements of two basic reporting classes plus \"digital thinking;\" 2.) a core of three project-based classes called Studio I, II and III; and 3.) elective enrichment courses that allow students to pursue interests and work on initiatives of their own. In their third and final semester, students design\u00a0 their own projects \u00a0with an appropriate media partner and try to create innovation--as well as a name--for themselves.   For a list of typical projects go here .   Each year Studio 20 recruits a mix of writers, editors, videographers, audio journalists, programmers, designers, Web producers and smart people who may have no journalism training at all\u2014 under the principle of \"bring skills, share skills, learn new stuff.\" Recruiting emphasizes students comfortable in more than one medium and ready to tackle new challenges. One of our mottos is: \"Everyone works on everything.\" In 2009-10, one of Studio 20's major partners was the New York Times. Working with editors at the Times, students and faculty designed and planned a hyperlocal news site for the East Village neighborhood in Manhattan. It launched in September, 2010:\u00a0 The Local East Village . The site was edited and produced at NYU, but ran on nytimes.com Studio 20 students could publish there, and if they had ideas for improvements they could pitch them.   In the spring of 2013 that site evolved into Bedford + Bowery , which is co-published by NYU Journalism and New York Magazine (nymag.com). The editor, Daniel Maurer, explained at the time: \"We\u2019ll still be covering the East Village and Lower East Side but we\u2019ll also be jumping on the L train to cover Williamsburg, Bushwick and Greenpoint \u2013 where, of course, the East Village already has a\u00a0 strong presence.\" \u00a0The\u00a0change was covered here .   In 2010-11 Studio 20's major project was a\u00a0 collaboration \u00a0with ProPublica, the investigative reporting non-profit. Students experimented with the genre of \"the explainer,\" a form of journalism that provides essential background knowledge and brings clarity to complex issues in the news. Read more\u00a0 here \u00a0and see the project site,\u00a0 Explainer.net . Don't miss\u00a0 The Fracking Song , which came out of that work. Time magazine named it one of the most creative videos of 2011.\u00a0 In December of 2010, NYU\u00a0 announced \u00a0that the renowned Internet thinker\u00a0 Clay Shirky \u00a0would be joining the Carter Institute and Studio 20, where he will teach courses and consult on projects.\u00a0   In 2011-12, Studio 20's major project was a collaboration with The Guardian around a different approach to election coverage. You can read about it here \u00a0and here .\u00a0   In 2012-13, Studio 20's big project revolved around networked reporting. Five media partners were involved: The Wall Street Journal, ProPublica (again), Fast Company, Mashable.com and Pando Daily. You can read about it here and here . The Pando Daily project was featured\u00a0 here .   Our students get jobs in new media and old , and they advance in their careers.

The curriculum emphasizes project-based learning. Students, faculty and visiting talent work on editorial and web development projects together, typically with media partners who themselves need to find new approaches or face problems in succeeding online. By participating in these projects and later running their own project, students learn to grapple with all the factors that go into updating journalism for the digital era. The program seeks to draw together a diversely talented team of students who can produce excellent work that pushes the field forward and realizes some of the possibilities inherent in a multi-media, interactive and constantly evolving platform for journalism\u2014 namely, the World Wide Web and its mobile extensions.\u00a0 Studio classes provide a \"hub\" for organizing activity and a common space for inquiry and reflection around the program's various projects. Students are expected to be flexible and curious, generous in sharing skills, eager to pick up new knowledge and willing to adapt to what the project \u2014 and its deadlines \u2014 demand.\u00a0 The curriculum has three parts: 1.) the traditional requirements of two basic reporting classes plus \"digital thinking;\" 2.) a core of three project-based classes called Studio I, II and III; and 3.) elective enrichment courses that allow students to pursue interests and work on initiatives of their own. In their third and final semester, students design\u00a0 their own projects \u00a0with an appropriate media partner and try to create innovation--as well as a name--for themselves.   For a list of typical projects go here .   Each year Studio 20 recruits a mix of writers, editors, videographers, audio journalists, programmers, designers, Web producers and smart people who may have no journalism training at all\u2014 under the principle of \"bring skills, share skills, learn new stuff.\" Recruiting emphasizes students comfortable in more than one medium and ready to tackle new challenges. One of our mottos is: \"Everyone works on everything.\" In 2009-10, one of Studio 20's major partners was the New York Times. Working with editors at the Times, students and faculty designed and planned a hyperlocal news site for the East Village neighborhood in Manhattan. It launched in September, 2010:\u00a0 The Local East Village . The site was edited and produced at NYU, but ran on nytimes.com Studio 20 students could publish there, and if they had ideas for improvements they could pitch them.   In the spring of 2013 that site evolved into Bedford + Bowery , which is co-published by NYU Journalism and New York Magazine (nymag.com). The editor, Daniel Maurer, explained at the time: \"We\u2019ll still be covering the East Village and Lower East Side but we\u2019ll also be jumping on the L train to cover Williamsburg, Bushwick and Greenpoint \u2013 where, of course, the East Village already has a\u00a0 strong presence.\" \u00a0The\u00a0change was covered here .   In 2010-11 Studio 20's major project was a\u00a0 collaboration \u00a0with ProPublica, the investigative reporting non-profit. Students experimented with the genre of \"the explainer,\" a form of journalism that provides essential background knowledge and brings clarity to complex issues in the news. Read more\u00a0 here \u00a0and see the project site,\u00a0 Explainer.net . Don't miss\u00a0 The Fracking Song , which came out of that work. Time magazine named it one of the most creative videos of 2011.\u00a0 In December of 2010, NYU\u00a0 announced \u00a0that the renowned Internet thinker\u00a0 Clay Shirky \u00a0would be joining the Carter Institute and Studio 20, where he will teach courses and consult on projects.\u00a0   In 2011-12, Studio 20's major project was a collaboration with The Guardian around a different approach to election coverage. You can read about it here \u00a0and here .\u00a0   In 2012-13, Studio 20's big project revolved around networked reporting. Five media partners were involved: The Wall Street Journal, ProPublica (again), Fast Company, Mashable.com and Pando Daily. You can read about it here and here .

The curriculum emphasizes project-based learning. Students, faculty and visiting talent work on editorial and web development projects together, typically with media partners who themselves need to find new approaches or face problems in succeeding online. By participating in these projects and later running their own project, students learn to grapple with all the factors that go into updating journalism for the digital era. The program seeks to draw together a diversely talented team of students who can produce excellent work that pushes the field forward and realizes some of the possibilities inherent in a multi-media, interactive and constantly evolving platform for journalism\u2014 namely, the World Wide Web and its mobile extensions.\u00a0 Studio classes provide a \"hub\" for organizing activity and a common space for inquiry and reflection around the program's various projects. Students are expected to be flexible and curious, generous in sharing skills, eager to pick up new knowledge and willing to adapt to what the project \u2014 and its deadlines \u2014 demand.\u00a0 The curriculum has three parts: 1.) the traditional requirements of two basic reporting classes plus \"digital thinking;\" 2.) a core of three project-based classes called Studio I, II and III; and 3.) elective enrichment courses that allow students to pursue interests and work on initiatives of their own. In their third and final semester, students design\u00a0 their own projects \u00a0with an appropriate media partner and try to create innovation--as well as a name--for themselves.   For a list of typical projects go here .   Each year Studio 20 recruits a mix of writers, editors, videographers, audio journalists, programmers, designers, Web producers and smart people who may have no journalism training at all\u2014 under the principle of \"bring skills, share skills, learn new stuff.\" Recruiting emphasizes students comfortable in more than one medium and ready to tackle new challenges. One of our mottos is: \"Everyone works on everything.\" In 2009-10, one of Studio 20's major partners was the New York Times. Working with editors at the Times, students and faculty designed and planned a hyperlocal news site for the East Village neighborhood in Manhattan. It launched in September, 2010:\u00a0 The Local East Village . The site was edited and produced at NYU, but ran on nytimes.com Studio 20 students could publish there, and if they had ideas for improvements they could pitch them.   In the spring of 2013 that site evolved into Bedford + Bowery , which is co-published by NYU Journalism and New York Magazine (nymag.com). The editor, Daniel Maurer, explained at the time: \"We\u2019ll still be covering the East Village and Lower East Side but we\u2019ll also be jumping on the L train to cover Williamsburg, Bushwick and Greenpoint \u2013 where, of course, the East Village already has a\u00a0 strong presence.\" \u00a0The\u00a0change was covered here .   In 2010-11 Studio 20's major project was a\u00a0 collaboration \u00a0with ProPublica, the investigative reporting non-profit. Students experimented with the genre of \"the explainer,\" a form of journalism that provides essential background knowledge and brings clarity to complex issues in the news. Read more\u00a0 here \u00a0and see the project site,\u00a0 Explainer.net . Don't miss\u00a0 The Fracking Song , which came out of that work. Time magazine named it one of the most creative videos of 2011.\u00a0 In December of 2010, NYU\u00a0 announced \u00a0that the renowned Internet thinker\u00a0 Clay Shirky \u00a0would be joining the Carter Institute and Studio 20, where he will teach courses and consult on projects.\u00a0   In 2011-12, Studio 20's major project was a collaboration with The Guardian around a different approach to election coverage. You can read about it here \u00a0and here .\u00a0   In 2012-13, Studio 20's big project revolved around networked reporting. Five media partners were involved: The Wall Street Journal, ProPublica (again), Fast Company, Mashable.com and Pando Daily. You can read about it here and here . The Pando Daily project was featured\u00a0 here .   Our students get jobs in new media and old , and they advance in their careers.

As borders between media shift, contemporary sculpture and installation work may include new uses of video, ceramics, architecture, fabric, drawing, or performance, as well as classic skills such as woodworking, welding, or moldmaking.    The sculpture facility covers a full floor of the Barney building. It is divided into a wood and metal shop which includes a panel saw, Sawstop table saw, compound miter saw, vertical and horizontal bandsaws for both metal/woodworking, an air compressor system and downdraft table for sanding. In addition, we have a 800 sq/ft critique space for the presentation of student art work, as well as a plaster and moldmaking studio with a self contained spray booth room. Shop technicians are available for information and oversight of the studio. The sculpture faculty includes Area Director Sue De Beer, Beverly Semmes, Rico Gatson, Curtis Mitchell, Dave Hardy, Ian Cooper, and other innovative practitioners.    Craft Sculpture: Ceramics, Metalsmithing, Fabric, and Glass    The renewed connection between fine arts and craft media has become the focus of a new cross-disciplinary movement in contemporary art. Courses in ceramics, mixed media sculpture, metalsmithing, jewelry, and sewn fabrics allow artists to expand their ideas and practices through a wide range of materials and skills in the Art Department&rsquo;s studio facilities. Through a unique liaison with Urban Glass, the largest facility in the world dedicated to glass as an art form, students can expand their creative vocabulary in this medium, as well. Area Director Judith Schwartz is on of the world&rsquo;s leading authors and curators in ceramics. Faculty including Matt Nolen, Beverly Semmes, Klaus Burgel, Shida Kuo, and discuss work within a historical and contemporary framework, designed to help students gain both technical and critical skills.    Photography    Our darkroom, on the second floor of Barney Building, is complete with a 30&rdquo; Colex color processor, group black &amp; white and color darkrooms, as well as eight individual color darkrooms. There are two classrooms, equipped with iMacs, video and slide projectors, digital photo printers, flatbed scanners and negative scanners. Each classroom can also be converted into a photo studio, each with black, white and grey seamless backdrop rolls. We have a large selection of equipment for loan, which includes, but not limited to, 35mm cameras, medium and large format cameras, digital SLRs, HD video cameras, sound recorders, tungsten lighting kits, strobe lighting kits, tripods and a green screen kit. For MFAs, BFAs, and students registered in photo classes, all equipment can be checked out of the Darkroom for 72 hours at a time, free of charge. Classes offered include B&amp;W, Color, Digital, Documentary, and Photography &amp; Performance, as well as studio courses including lighting &amp; medium and large format cameras. Artists, critics, and historians share faculty duties in this challenging area, led by performance artist Gerald Pryor. Photography faculty include Lyle Ashton Harris, Hiroshi Sunairi, Adam Putnam, and Dan Torop.    Barney Darkroom Blog &amp; Hours . 212-998-5755    Design/Video Studio &amp; Digital Imaging    The Design Studio is an iMac computer lab equipped with a full range of software for design, photography, video and new media. The Design Studio houses 16 iMac computers, HD projection and HD television facilities, as well as a lounge for laptop use and class discussions. This studio provides students with powerful tools to learn, create and collaborate.    The Digital Imaging Studio is an iMac classroom equipped with large format archival printing. This studio houses 18 iMac computers with a full range of software for photography, drawing, design, video, 3D modeling, sound, web and open source projects. Mobile HD projection equipment is available for check out to students and faculty. The Digital Imaging Studio provides students with hands-on experience and advanced skills in printing with new media.    Digital Fabrication Studio     The Digital Fabrication Studio is a multidisciplinary hackerspace equipped to explore new media and design. The studio houses iMac and PC computers, an Epilog Helix 24 Laser Engraver, Makerbot and Formlabs 3D printers, a full range of electronics prototyping equipment and hardware, a CNC plotter and access to a Shopbot Desktop CNC router. HD projection and HD television allow instructors and students to share, explore and adapt to the rapid cultural and technological innovation the world faces today.    Painting and Drawing    The skills of painting and drawing enable the artist-student to transform ideas, be they internal or external, to the planarity of a piece of paper or canvas. This process of converting thoughts and signs into visually accessible shapes is complex and, at times, very direct. For this reason, painting and drawing will always be considered by many to be at the heart and soul of the visual arts.    The recent resurgence of interest in traditional hand made media speaks to many issues in contemporary life, and the demand for courses in these areas is higher than ever. Our painting and drawing faculty, led by Area Director Maureen Gallace, with the support of John Torreano, Jesse Bransford, Ross Bleckner, Peter Rostovsky, and Jason Tomme reflects the broad range of acclaimed artists working in classical materials.    Print    Print provides contemporary artists with a extensive array of possibilities and working methods, from photocopy to etching to digital 3-D printing, from unique to multiple to installation. The NYU Print Studio is dedicated to an environment where this range is encouraged along with experimentation and personal exploration.    The print studio, with 14' high ceilings and northern light, is equipped to realize ideas in multiple techniques, including silkscreen (photo-process darkroom), etching (two Charles Brand etching presses), relief print, book arts and letterpress (Vandercook UNI-1 press), digital imaging/printing (Epson 4900 Archival Printer, Epson scanner, AccuRIP software, Xante PostScript large formate laser printer), as well as Departmental facilities for laser cutting and 3-D printing. New York City at large provides a unique context for the study of print, which includes numerous special print exhibitions, vast museum collections, the annual New York City Print Week, and a vibrant diy, zine, and street art scene. The print area faculty, led by Area Head Mark Johnson, includes Kiki Smith, Valerie Hammond, Noah Breuer, and Ruby Sky Stiler.    Environmental Activism    Faculty member Natalie Jeremijenko, one of the most visible and dynamic forces working at the intersection of art, technology, engineering, and environmental studies, has established the Environmental Health Clinic, a laboratory to diagnose environmental ills and create prescriptions for a greener tomorrow. Working with designers, gardeners, and computer scientists, Jeremikenko, who is herself an engineer as well as an artist, is establishing a cross-disciplinary team of artists and researchers to contribute to a slate of poetic and political project                        This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;        by New York University.
