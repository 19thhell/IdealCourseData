A culminating course integrating models of interpretation derived from the liberal arts with the analytical tools developed in media, culture, and communication coursework. Reflects current research interests within the department and encourages students to explore emerging issues in the field, including media and globalization, professional ethics, and the interaction between audiences and texts.    Summer 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 Communication &amp; Persuasion - Film Classics of Propaganda Instructor: Terence Moran , Mon/Wed 5:10-8:10 PM    Topic: Communication and Persuasion: Film Classics of Propaganda   An examination of classics of film propaganda in terms of their ideologies and mythic structures and messages. We will examine three powerful ideologies of the 20 th Century via analyses of films that exemplify and promote the values and life styles of Communism in Battleship Potemkin (Soviet Union, 1925), Fascisim in Triumph des Willens (National Socialist Germany, 1934-35), and Capitalism in Sex and the City (United States, 2008). Our analyses of these films will be based upon selected readings in Jacques Ellul&rsquo;s Propaganda, The Formation of Men&rsquo;s Attitudes and Joseph Campbell&rsquo;s The Hero With a Thousand Faces with regard to propaganda and the myth of the hero. Background readings, class lectures, and models for analyzing communication and propaganda will be used to structure an environment in which our class will examine specific case studies involving films from American and foreign sources, and covering films from the silent era to the 21 st Century.    Fall 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 / Topic: The Raw Data of Intimate Life Instructor: Roger Friedland, Tuesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Social research tries to make sense of &ldquo;raw data&rdquo;, doubly so in this case as they refer to quantitative information about the sexual, romantic and religious lives of young people. This seminar seeks to teach students the basics of quantitative social research, a particular kind of sense-making that both makes and manipulates the data. This seminar will consider both the generation and testing of hypotheses using survey data on intimate life recently collected by the instructor through social network sites, the blogsphere and university course websites in the United States and Muslim-majority countries in the Near East. Students will learn to use STATA, a statistical software, in order to calculate distributions of values, cross-tabulations, and potentially regression analyses. Students will use these skills to develop and test their own hypothesis for the final paper for this seminar. Students need not have any previous statistical training. Note: This is not a course on social media; it uses social media to generate samples of media users for explanatory analysis.    MCC-UE 1200-002 / Topic: Black Lives Matter - Race, Media, and Social Movements Instructor: Nicholas Mirzoeff, Tuesdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This seminar concentrates on the use of media by and for the Black Lives Matter movement. We will historicise the movement by examining Reconstruction, Civil Rights and the Black Power movement. We will contextualize it by learning about the prison-industrial complex and the New Jim Crow. At the heart of our discussion will be media in and for the movement. We'll look at performative resistance like Hands Up, Don't Shoot; Die Ins; and Black Brunch; and the role of social media in shaping resistance. We will get to the heart of what happened in Ferguson by reading the grand jury depositions. We'll look at how #BlackLivesMatter has challenged art, cinema and museums. And we'll consider what actions to take next.    MCC-UE 1200-003 / Topic: Media Landscapes - \"The Wire\" Instructor: Arvind Rajagopal , Thursdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This course will investigate the landscapes brought into view by a specific media artifact, in this case the critically acclaimed HBO show, The Wire. The Wire&rsquo;s extraordinary success as a TV series about a &ldquo;black site&rdquo; stretched across the American heartland, namely the African American urban underclass, has been copiously studied and commented upon. It has been seen as an example of the critical and creative turn taken by a segment of the cultural industry, as a maturation of the audience and a de-massification of viewer tastes in the era of addressable mass culture. David Simon himself, among others, has also described it as a move away from postmodern irony and narrative fragmentation and towards ancient Greek myth. In this class we will explore the show as a case study in making the black underclass simultaneously spectacular and theoretically invisible.The show will provide a set of texts for students to undertake detailed textual analysis, and to deepen their readings drawing on other texts provided in the class, and on students' own readings of the world.    MCC-UE 1200-004 / Topic: Digital Media, Advocacy, and Equal Rights, in the U.S. and Abroad Instructor: Isra Ali, Mondays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    In this course we will examine different moments in which digital media plays a significant role in the advocacy for equal rights related to gender and sexuality. We will look at domestic, transnational, and international advocacy. We will consider how the political, economic, and social, impacts the way digital media is deployed, paying particular attention to forces such as militarism, nationalism, and corporate interest. We will identify who utilizes digital media to participate in the discourse, how that usage impacts and relates to offline activism, and the role digital media plays in reshaping the conversation about gender and sexuality. We will look at how people engaged in these causes use digital media to speak to one another, and to traditional media outlets that want to hear from them as a result of the presence they build on digital media. We will also examine how the notion of gender and sexual equality is articulated through social media, and think critically about the concepts of gender, sexuality, and equality, and the institutionalization of this advocacy.    MCC-UE 1200-005 / Topic: Mediating Israel/Palestine Instructor: Helga Tawil-Souri, Wednesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Israel-Palestine &ndash; whether approached as a particular place, a political problem, a conflict, or even a metaphor &ndash; is fraught with controversies, contradictions, questions, and misunderstandings. More often that not, the more one learns about Israel-Palestine, the more likely the result is of a feeling of political paralysis (&ldquo;there is simply no solution to this intractable conflict!&rdquo;). This senior seminar will attempt to reverse this by having students collectively work on one media-related problem having to do with Israel-Palestine in order to solve it, as one would do as part of an architecture studio for example. A &ldquo;problem&rdquo; will be decided on during the first sessions of the class (for example: build an equitable and shared media infrastructure; improve reporting on the conflict in mainstream media; launch a marketing campaign for a one-state solution). As with any course, students will be introduced to a range of materials; most of the time however students will be asked to bring in readings, graphics and other materials based on individual research to help the collective obtain a deeper understanding of the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; and ways to solve it. Each student will also bring his/her own expertise (e.g. historical research, photography, archival work, interviews, sketching, software coding) in order to tackle the various components of the problem we are attempting to solve. Throughout this process, students will gain an in-depth understanding of the complexities of Israel-Palestine, and end the course with a collectively-built solution.    MCC-UE 1200-006 / Topic: Time and Technology Instructor: Kate Brideau, Thursdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Many of our concerns about modern technologies have to do with time&mdash;for instance, the growing inability to sustain attention for an extended period of time, or the ways email and mobile devices seem to expand the hours of the &ldquo;work day&rdquo; indefinitely. But this is not new; technology has long had an impact on our experiences and notions of time. This course will explore that relationship, considering how technology relates both to the deep time of human history, and also to our everyday lives. Technological developments have had a significant impact on how we think about history, memory, life, death, and immortality; the rhythms by which our cities move; the speeds at which we live life, and the ways we think about labor and leisure. In this course we will engage with media archaeology, read historical and philosophical works, and analyze photography, film, recorded music, digital media, and the possibilities of biotechnology. In addition to learning about the mutability of time as it relates to technology, this course will encourage students to think critically about how technology is affecting time as they experience it today, and what relationship to time they would like to have. Should we now be turning back toward slowness as we seem to be moving ever more quickly into the future?

Summer 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 Communication &amp; Persuasion - Film Classics of Propaganda Instructor: Terence Moran , Mon/Wed 5:10-8:10 PM    Topic: Communication and Persuasion: Film Classics of Propaganda   An examination of classics of film propaganda in terms of their ideologies and mythic structures and messages. We will examine three powerful ideologies of the 20 th Century via analyses of films that exemplify and promote the values and life styles of Communism in Battleship Potemkin (Soviet Union, 1925), Fascisim in Triumph des Willens (National Socialist Germany, 1934-35), and Capitalism in Sex and the City (United States, 2008). Our analyses of these films will be based upon selected readings in Jacques Ellul&rsquo;s Propaganda, The Formation of Men&rsquo;s Attitudes and Joseph Campbell&rsquo;s The Hero With a Thousand Faces with regard to propaganda and the myth of the hero. Background readings, class lectures, and models for analyzing communication and propaganda will be used to structure an environment in which our class will examine specific case studies involving films from American and foreign sources, and covering films from the silent era to the 21 st Century.    Fall 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 / Topic: The Raw Data of Intimate Life Instructor: Roger Friedland, Tuesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Social research tries to make sense of &ldquo;raw data&rdquo;, doubly so in this case as they refer to quantitative information about the sexual, romantic and religious lives of young people. This seminar seeks to teach students the basics of quantitative social research, a particular kind of sense-making that both makes and manipulates the data. This seminar will consider both the generation and testing of hypotheses using survey data on intimate life recently collected by the instructor through social network sites, the blogsphere and university course websites in the United States and Muslim-majority countries in the Near East. Students will learn to use STATA, a statistical software, in order to calculate distributions of values, cross-tabulations, and potentially regression analyses. Students will use these skills to develop and test their own hypothesis for the final paper for this seminar. Students need not have any previous statistical training. Note: This is not a course on social media; it uses social media to generate samples of media users for explanatory analysis.    MCC-UE 1200-002 / Topic: Black Lives Matter - Race, Media, and Social Movements Instructor: Nicholas Mirzoeff, Tuesdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This seminar concentrates on the use of media by and for the Black Lives Matter movement. We will historicise the movement by examining Reconstruction, Civil Rights and the Black Power movement. We will contextualize it by learning about the prison-industrial complex and the New Jim Crow. At the heart of our discussion will be media in and for the movement. We'll look at performative resistance like Hands Up, Don't Shoot; Die Ins; and Black Brunch; and the role of social media in shaping resistance. We will get to the heart of what happened in Ferguson by reading the grand jury depositions. We'll look at how #BlackLivesMatter has challenged art, cinema and museums. And we'll consider what actions to take next.    MCC-UE 1200-003 / Topic: Media Landscapes - \"The Wire\" Instructor: Arvind Rajagopal , Thursdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This course will investigate the landscapes brought into view by a specific media artifact, in this case the critically acclaimed HBO show, The Wire. The Wire&rsquo;s extraordinary success as a TV series about a &ldquo;black site&rdquo; stretched across the American heartland, namely the African American urban underclass, has been copiously studied and commented upon. It has been seen as an example of the critical and creative turn taken by a segment of the cultural industry, as a maturation of the audience and a de-massification of viewer tastes in the era of addressable mass culture. David Simon himself, among others, has also described it as a move away from postmodern irony and narrative fragmentation and towards ancient Greek myth. In this class we will explore the show as a case study in making the black underclass simultaneously spectacular and theoretically invisible.The show will provide a set of texts for students to undertake detailed textual analysis, and to deepen their readings drawing on other texts provided in the class, and on students' own readings of the world.    MCC-UE 1200-004 / Topic: Digital Media, Advocacy, and Equal Rights, in the U.S. and Abroad Instructor: Isra Ali, Mondays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    In this course we will examine different moments in which digital media plays a significant role in the advocacy for equal rights related to gender and sexuality. We will look at domestic, transnational, and international advocacy. We will consider how the political, economic, and social, impacts the way digital media is deployed, paying particular attention to forces such as militarism, nationalism, and corporate interest. We will identify who utilizes digital media to participate in the discourse, how that usage impacts and relates to offline activism, and the role digital media plays in reshaping the conversation about gender and sexuality. We will look at how people engaged in these causes use digital media to speak to one another, and to traditional media outlets that want to hear from them as a result of the presence they build on digital media. We will also examine how the notion of gender and sexual equality is articulated through social media, and think critically about the concepts of gender, sexuality, and equality, and the institutionalization of this advocacy.    MCC-UE 1200-005 / Topic: Mediating Israel/Palestine Instructor: Helga Tawil-Souri, Wednesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Israel-Palestine &ndash; whether approached as a particular place, a political problem, a conflict, or even a metaphor &ndash; is fraught with controversies, contradictions, questions, and misunderstandings. More often that not, the more one learns about Israel-Palestine, the more likely the result is of a feeling of political paralysis (&ldquo;there is simply no solution to this intractable conflict!&rdquo;). This senior seminar will attempt to reverse this by having students collectively work on one media-related problem having to do with Israel-Palestine in order to solve it, as one would do as part of an architecture studio for example. A &ldquo;problem&rdquo; will be decided on during the first sessions of the class (for example: build an equitable and shared media infrastructure; improve reporting on the conflict in mainstream media; launch a marketing campaign for a one-state solution). As with any course, students will be introduced to a range of materials; most of the time however students will be asked to bring in readings, graphics and other materials based on individual research to help the collective obtain a deeper understanding of the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; and ways to solve it. Each student will also bring his/her own expertise (e.g. historical research, photography, archival work, interviews, sketching, software coding) in order to tackle the various components of the problem we are attempting to solve. Throughout this process, students will gain an in-depth understanding of the complexities of Israel-Palestine, and end the course with a collectively-built solution.    MCC-UE 1200-006 / Topic: Time and Technology Instructor: Kate Brideau, Thursdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Many of our concerns about modern technologies have to do with time&mdash;for instance, the growing inability to sustain attention for an extended period of time, or the ways email and mobile devices seem to expand the hours of the &ldquo;work day&rdquo; indefinitely. But this is not new; technology has long had an impact on our experiences and notions of time. This course will explore that relationship, considering how technology relates both to the deep time of human history, and also to our everyday lives. Technological developments have had a significant impact on how we think about history, memory, life, death, and immortality; the rhythms by which our cities move; the speeds at which we live life, and the ways we think about labor and leisure. In this course we will engage with media archaeology, read historical and philosophical works, and analyze photography, film, recorded music, digital media, and the possibilities of biotechnology. In addition to learning about the mutability of time as it relates to technology, this course will encourage students to think critically about how technology is affecting time as they experience it today, and what relationship to time they would like to have. Should we now be turning back toward slowness as we seem to be moving ever more quickly into the future?
