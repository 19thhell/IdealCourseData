Colloids are often spherical, although other shapes such as rods and ellipsoids are common. The forces between spherical colloids are almost always isotropic, that is, they are the same in all directions radially outward from the particle.        Recently, we developed a method to make &ldquo;patchy colloids.&rdquo; These are nearly spherical colloids that have small patches on their surfaces. The patches are coated with a special &ldquo;molecular glue&rdquo; made from short strands of DNA, the molecule from which genetic material is made. The glue can be designed to be sticky only for temperatures below about 40&deg;C (body temperature). The glue is typically designed in many different variants that are only very selectively sticky to each other.                                         Making patchy colloids: First make colloidal clusters    We start with solid colloidal spheres that are all the same size and then encapsulate them in droplets of oil. The oil droplets are dispersed in water. The movie on the right shows such an oil droplet that has a number of plastic (polystyrene) spheres in it. If we let the oil evaporate into the water, the droplet squeezes the colloidal spheres into a compact cluster. Press on the arrow to run the movie and watch a cluster form. It turns out that there are 7 spheres in this particular droplet. The cluster that forms when the droplet evaporates is a ring of 5 spheres that form a pentagon, with a sixth sphere above the ring and a seventh below the ring (not visible) near the center of the pentagon. This movie was obtained using a conventional optical microscope that forms images with light. A sharper picture of the same kind of cluster is visible at the far right of the figure below. That picture was obtained with an electron microscope.                Colloidal clusters viewed using an electron microscope ( see other page for more information ). Scale bar: 500 nm.             Making patchy colloids: Second swell clusters with styrene monomer, then polymerize.    The polystyrene spheres in the clusters above act like tiny sponges when exposed certain liquids like styrene, the molecule from which polystyrene is made. Adding just the right amount, we first swell the polystyrene spheres with styrene until the spheres can hold no more, at which point a styrene droplet begins to appear around the cluster. By carefully controlling how much styrene liquid we add, we make a single droplet of styrene with the extremities of the cluster it encapsulates sticking out. The styrene is then polymerized making the liquid droplet become solid and resulting in the patchy particles seen below.            Patchy particles with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp; 7 patches from left to right.           Making patchy colloids: Third attach sticky-ended DNA to patches.    The patches have amadine molecules on the their surface to which we attach double stranded DNA with single stranded sticky ends. The sticky-ended DNA molecules on the patches of different particles are designed to stick to each other. Because the particles stick to each other only where there is sticky DNA, which is only on the patches, the particles form directional bonds, as shown below.

Colloids are small particles suspended in a liquid by thermal agitation. Thus, colloidal particles are sufficiently small that collisions with the molecules of the liquid in which they are immersed are sufficient to keep them from sinking or floating under the influence of gravity. This means that colloidal particles are generally smaller than a few micrometers, since larger particles usually sink or float. There is no lower limit to the size of colloids, other than to note that because they are made up of many atoms or molecules, they are generally larger than a nanometer or so. Many everyday products are colloids, including milk, paint, ink, bacteria, viruses, as well as globular proteins. Opals are dried out colloids.                       FIG. 1. Colloidal crystal. Notice that there are both hexagonal and square planes visible, which is consistent with a face-centered cubic lattice.       Self assembly of colloids    A suspension of identical colloidal particles can spontaneously self assemble to form a regularly-spaced lattice. Figure 1 on the right shows such a lattice, a \"colloidal crystal\", that has been photographed using an electron microscope. The particles in the photograph are made from polystyrene, a common commercial plastic. The water in which the particles were suspended was evaporated to facilitate taking the photograph, but the same ordered structure of particles apparent in the figure was present before the water was removed.    The lattice shown in Fig. 1 is a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, an arrangement favored by grocers stacking oranges. Other types of lattices can be made by mixing two or more particles of different sizes in just the right ratio. However, the kinds of lattices that can be made with simple spheres is is somewhat limited.                FIG. 2. Colloidal clusters of 3 to 10 silica spheres (diameter 900 nm).       Shaping colloidal particles: Colloidal clusters    Colloids can be any shape in principle. Proteins often fold up into complex oddly-shaped globules. Many viruses are shaped like rods. Artificial colloids, however, such as those synthesized for use in paint, are typically spherical, so the repertoire of particles we can actually make is rather limited.      In order to expand the kinds of structures that can be made with colloids, we have developed methods for assembling colloids in to small aggregates with well-defined structures. Figure 2 shows a series of colloidal clusters consisting of 3 to 10 particles. The emulsion encapsulation method we developed for making these clusters results in a unique configuration of particles for all clusters of a given number: for example, all 7-mers look exactly the same &ndash; there are no isomers. The absence of isomers has been explained by Eric Lauga and Michael Brenner in Physical Review Letters 93, 238301 (2004) . You can read more about the clusters in Fig. 2 (and a few more), including how they are fabricated in the following publications: Science 301, 483-487 (2003) [&amp; Supplementary materials ], Advanced Materials 16, 1204-1208 (2004) , and MRS Bulletin 29, 91-95 (2004) .                FIG. 3. Colloidal clusters made from particles of two different sizes using emulsion encapsulation method.       Hybrid colloidal clusters from bidisperse colloids    Working with our collaborators at the Korea Advanced Institute for Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea, we have generalized our emulsion encapsulation method in order to form complex clusters made from colloidal particles of two different sizes. Figure 3 shows some of the results. From left to right, the clusters consist of 1, 2, or 3 large particles (2.3 &mu;m diameter, shown in pink) and many small particles (0.23 &mu;m diameter, shown in white). In this photograph, all the spheres are silica, but we made other clusters where the small and large particles were made out of different materials.

Colloids are often spherical, although other shapes such as rods and ellipsoids are common. The forces between spherical colloids are almost always isotropic, that is, they are the same in all directions radially outward from the particle.        Recently, we developed a method to make &ldquo;patchy colloids.&rdquo; These are nearly spherical colloids that have small patches on their surfaces. The patches are coated with a special &ldquo;molecular glue&rdquo; made from short strands of DNA, the molecule from which genetic material is made. The glue can be designed to be sticky only for temperatures below about 40&deg;C (body temperature). The glue is typically designed in many different variants that are only very selectively sticky to each other.                                         Making patchy colloids: First make colloidal clusters    We start with solid colloidal spheres that are all the same size and then encapsulate them in droplets of oil. The oil droplets are dispersed in water. The movie on the right shows such an oil droplet that has a number of plastic (polystyrene) spheres in it. If we let the oil evaporate into the water, the droplet squeezes the colloidal spheres into a compact cluster. Press on the arrow to run the movie and watch a cluster form. It turns out that there are 7 spheres in this particular droplet. The cluster that forms when the droplet evaporates is a ring of 5 spheres that form a pentagon, with a sixth sphere above the ring and a seventh below the ring (not visible) near the center of the pentagon. This movie was obtained using a conventional optical microscope that forms images with light. A sharper picture of the same kind of cluster is visible at the far right of the figure below. That picture was obtained with an electron microscope.                Colloidal clusters viewed using an electron microscope ( see other page for more information ). Scale bar: 500 nm.             Making patchy colloids: Second swell clusters with styrene monomer, then polymerize.    The polystyrene spheres in the clusters above act like tiny sponges when exposed certain liquids like styrene, the molecule from which polystyrene is made. Adding just the right amount, we first swell the polystyrene spheres with styrene until the spheres can hold no more, at which point a styrene droplet begins to appear around the cluster. By carefully controlling how much styrene liquid we add, we make a single droplet of styrene with the extremities of the cluster it encapsulates sticking out. The styrene is then polymerized making the liquid droplet become solid and resulting in the patchy particles seen below.            Patchy particles with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp; 7 patches from left to right.           Making patchy colloids: Third attach sticky-ended DNA to patches.    The patches have amadine molecules on the their surface to which we attach double stranded DNA with single stranded sticky ends. The sticky-ended DNA molecules on the patches of different particles are designed to stick to each other. Because the particles stick to each other only where there is sticky DNA, which is only on the patches, the particles form directional bonds, as shown below.

Colloids are small particles suspended in a liquid by thermal agitation. Thus, colloidal particles are sufficiently small that collisions with the molecules of the liquid in which they are immersed are sufficient to keep them from sinking or floating under the influence of gravity. This means that colloidal particles are generally smaller than a few micrometers, since larger particles usually sink or float. There is no lower limit to the size of colloids, other than to note that because they are made up of many atoms or molecules, they are generally larger than a nanometer or so. Many everyday products are colloids, including milk, paint, ink, bacteria, viruses, as well as globular proteins. Opals are dried out colloids.                       FIG. 1. Colloidal crystal. Notice that there are both hexagonal and square planes visible, which is consistent with a face-centered cubic lattice.       Self assembly of colloids    A suspension of identical colloidal particles can spontaneously self assemble to form a regularly-spaced lattice. Figure 1 on the right shows such a lattice, a \"colloidal crystal\", that has been photographed using an electron microscope. The particles in the photograph are made from polystyrene, a common commercial plastic. The water in which the particles were suspended was evaporated to facilitate taking the photograph, but the same ordered structure of particles apparent in the figure was present before the water was removed.    The lattice shown in Fig. 1 is a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, an arrangement favored by grocers stacking oranges. Other types of lattices can be made by mixing two or more particles of different sizes in just the right ratio. However, the kinds of lattices that can be made with simple spheres is is somewhat limited.                FIG. 2. Colloidal clusters of 3 to 10 silica spheres (diameter 900 nm).       Shaping colloidal particles: Colloidal clusters    Colloids can be any shape in principle. Proteins often fold up into complex oddly-shaped globules. Many viruses are shaped like rods. Artificial colloids, however, such as those synthesized for use in paint, are typically spherical, so the repertoire of particles we can actually make is rather limited.      In order to expand the kinds of structures that can be made with colloids, we have developed methods for assembling colloids in to small aggregates with well-defined structures. Figure 2 shows a series of colloidal clusters consisting of 3 to 10 particles. The emulsion encapsulation method we developed for making these clusters results in a unique configuration of particles for all clusters of a given number: for example, all 7-mers look exactly the same &ndash; there are no isomers. The absence of isomers has been explained by Eric Lauga and Michael Brenner in Physical Review Letters 93, 238301 (2004) . You can read more about the clusters in Fig. 2 (and a few more), including how they are fabricated in the following publications: Science 301, 483-487 (2003) [&amp; Supplementary materials ], Advanced Materials 16, 1204-1208 (2004) , and MRS Bulletin 29, 91-95 (2004) .

Shaping colloidal particles: Colloidal clusters    Colloids can be any shape in principle. Proteins often fold up into complex oddly-shaped globules. Many viruses are shaped like rods. Artificial colloids, however, such as those synthesized for use in paint, are typically spherical, so the repertoire of particles we can actually make is rather limited.      In order to expand the kinds of structures that can be made with colloids, we have developed methods for assembling colloids in to small aggregates with well-defined structures. Figure 2 shows a series of colloidal clusters consisting of 3 to 10 particles. The emulsion encapsulation method we developed for making these clusters results in a unique configuration of particles for all clusters of a given number: for example, all 7-mers look exactly the same &ndash; there are no isomers. The absence of isomers has been explained by Eric Lauga and Michael Brenner in Physical Review Letters 93, 238301 (2004) . You can read more about the clusters in Fig. 2 (and a few more), including how they are fabricated in the following publications: Science 301, 483-487 (2003) [&amp; Supplementary materials ], Advanced Materials 16, 1204-1208 (2004) , and MRS Bulletin 29, 91-95 (2004) .                FIG. 3. Colloidal clusters made from particles of two different sizes using emulsion encapsulation method.       Hybrid colloidal clusters from bidisperse colloids    Working with our collaborators at the Korea Advanced Institute for Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea, we have generalized our emulsion encapsulation method in order to form complex clusters made from colloidal particles of two different sizes. Figure 3 shows some of the results. From left to right, the clusters consist of 1, 2, or 3 large particles (2.3 &mu;m diameter, shown in pink) and many small particles (0.23 &mu;m diameter, shown in white). In this photograph, all the spheres are silica, but we made other clusters where the small and large particles were made out of different materials.
