                       Applicants for the MSW program may complete an application online. We encourage you to submit your application before the deadline date. Our admissions committee, made up of faculty, strives to evaluate complete applications within four to six weeks. Please note that the committee does not evaluate incomplete applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                              MSW General Requirements for Admission                                                                    The general requirements for admission to the master's program are:     A baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university. Applicants should have a broad liberal arts background that includes study in the social, behavioral, and biological sciences with a minimum of 60 liberal arts credits. Course work relating to diverse cultures, social conditions, and social problems is favorably considered. Academic credit is not given for life experience in lieu of field education or course requirements.       A strong academic record and demonstrated intellectual capacity for graduate education.     An ability to think logically and conceptually and to formulate mature judgments.     Excellent writing and verbal communication skills.     Knowledge of the field and evidence of a commitment to social work as a profession.     Evidence of emotional maturity, concern for people, and capacity for self-awareness and personal growth.     Demonstrated concern and commitment to the values underlying professional social work.     Respect for diversity.     The GRE is NOT required.       Indications of motivation and readiness for social work education include related work or volunteer experience and undergraduate or graduate courses in social and behavioral sciences or social work. When these are lacking, weight is given to the applicant's involvement in community activities or participation in organizations committed to humanistic values.

Dual-Degree Programs     The Silver School of Social Work evaluates applicants using the same criteria as are used for admission to the two-year program, described above. Those interested in entering a dual-degree program must fill out a separate application for each school. Each school will evaluate the application based on its own requirements. No special admission standards are applied to dual-degree applicants at either school. Once admitted to both schools, the student qualifies for the dual-degree program.

Courses will not transfer if they were credited toward a previous conferred degree or if they were taken more than five years ago.     Readmission of Intermitted Students     Readmission to any of our programs is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. At minimum we reserve the right to require a full application to any of our programs after an absence of a year or longer for any reason.     Reapplication     Some applicants may wish to reapply to the MSW program at the Silver School of Social Work at NYU.

Applicants who have earned a degree from an institution where the language of instruction is exclusively English regardless of country are exempt from submitting a TOEFL or IELTS score. General Requirements apply.   All foreign academic records must be submitted with official translation to English or a notarized translation to English must be included along with official transcripts from international institutions. All applicants with international credentials are required to include a professional evaluation of the degree to determine if it is equivalent to the U.S. bachelor\u2019s degree. Evaluations are required. We accept foreign credentials evaluated by companies listed on the NACES website . Applicants with such credentials should file their applications well in advance of the term for which they are applying.   Minimum scores for the TOEFL are: paper based (PBT): 580; computer based (CBT): 237; Internet based (IBT): 92-93. Our TOEFL code is 2506. We will accept an unofficial score until the official one arrives.   Admission criteria for the IELTS is an overall score of 7.0 or higher (no individual scores less than 7 in any category).   These exams (TOEFL and IELTS) should be taken far enough in advance of the term in which the applicant wishes to be admitted. An application is not complete until all official scores are submitted, and they must be submitted by the printed deadlines. Test scores (both TOEFL and IELTS) are considered valid for two years.   Applicants residing in the New York City area may take their English proficiency test at NYU's American Language Institute, located at 48 Cooper Square, Room 200, New York, NY 10003-7154, U.S.A. An appointment to take the test may be made by telephoning (212) 998-7040. Learn more about ALI and its services .
