As a result of the condensed five week format of the CERT July Summer Institute courses are highly intensive and rigorous. During the CERT July Summer Institute coursework period from July 6th to August 7th, 2015, we are requiring a full-time, 40 hour/week commitment for class attendance. This does not include readings and homework. Thus, students are unable to maintain other professional responsibilities, clinical or otherwise, during this time period.   CERT Certificate Track Summary:   For those who possess an advanced degree (e.g. MPH, MS), but who do not have training in comparative effectiveness research.

Return to Top   Mentorship   All MSCI-CER Master\u2019s Program students will receive mentorship. Certificate students are not required to receive mentorship for program completion.   The CER training program emphasizes the value of applying classroom learning through an in-depth a mentored research initiative in CER. We have adopted an approach to mentorship in which each scholar will be mentored at multiple levels, as described below. This model reflects the fact that scholars\u2019 needs for mentoring fall in multiple domains, including technical research advice, teaching, professional and personal guidance, sponsorship, role-modeling, career crafting, and socialization into the profession.   Besides present mentorship, each scholar will be matched with a comparative effectiveness focused mentor. Scholars and mentors are expected to meet at least twice a month to discuss research, readings and complementary education. Each scholar will also be expected to meet quarterly with Dr. Scott Braithwaite to review progress, coordinate advice and provide constructive feedback.   Return to Top   CER Course Descriptions   View detailed CER course descriptions   Return to Top   Faculty &amp; Staff   Program Director      Maria Khan, PhD , is an Associate Professor in the Section on Value and Effectiveness in the Division of Comparative Effectiveness and Decision Science. She completed her doctoral degree in infectious disease epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2007 and her post-doctoral fellowship in the NIDA-funded Behavioral Sciences Training Program at the National Development and Research Institutes (NDRI) in 2009.   Dr. Khan studies social determinants of sexually transmitted infections including HIV (STI/HIV) in vulnerable populations. She has considerable expertise in the study of criminal justice system involvement and STI/HIV risk, including measurement of the effects of incarceration on sexual risk behavior, changes in sexual networks, and STI/HIV. She is PI on a longitudinal cohort study conducted among African American men released from prison to measure the influence of the dissolution of committed relationships that occurs during incarceration on mental health status and HIV-related sexual risk behaviors and drug use during community re-entry. In a second line of research conducted, Dr. Khan uses the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to examine the influence of adverse events in childhood and adolescence on adulthood incarceration and STI/HIV risk. Dr. Khan also examines social determinants of STI/HIV in global settings. Her most recent international project focused on measuring mobility and STI/HIV among pregnant women in a semi-urban area located at the epicenter of the 2010 earthquake.
