This course explores feminist works in different fields and brings them into fuller relationship with each other, with literature, and specifically poetry, as a site in which their intercrossing becomes both accessible and dramatic. A major theme will be definitions of selfhood. Topics will include feminist literary criticism, anthropology, psychology, history, political theory, cultural studies, law; reading theorists such as Harold Bloom, Carole Gilligan, Michel Foucault, Catherine MacKinnon, Jean Bethke Elshtain. Literary figures studied will include Emily Dickinson, Frances Harper, Charlotte Gilman (prose and poetry), Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Muriel Rukeyser, Gwendolyn Brooks, Marianne Moore along with other short prose.
