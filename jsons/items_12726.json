Much of his work has revolved around the ways people  respond to upheaval and traumatic changes that they associate with modernity  and can seem at once liberating and disturbing.         Gerson has  pursued such questions by exploring, first, the resonance of local memory in  post-revolutionary France (through history, archeology, literary magazines,  historical pageants, and the like). His book The  Pride of Place: Local Memories and Political Culture in Nineteenth-Century  France (Cornell, 2003) won the Jacques Barzun Prize in Cultural History  and the Laurence Wylie Prize in French Cultural Studies.

A first project revolves around the politics of technological and  natural disasters in the nineteenth century.    He is testing the notion that the disaster and its aftermath helped the  French state extend its presence in society (though a politics of legitimation,  empathy, and expertise) while leaving open spaces for grassroots responses that  had their own cultural and political contours.    This project brings together the event and its afterlife as well as  metropole and colonies. Gerson\u2019s other project is a dual micro-history of two  couples before, during, and after WW2: a couple of Belgian Jewish refugees in  Nice and the policeman who, with his wife, saved them. This is at once an inquiry into the ordinary  aspects and extraordinary aspects of war, a ground-level analysis of survival  and rescue, and an exploration of familial memory and silence in France and  Belgium.      Gerson\u2019s  final area of interest revolves around the writing of history. He explored  historian Alain Corbin\u2019s approach to cultural history in a special issue of French Politics, Culture &amp; Society  which he guest-edited in 2004.

My first book, on the French aircraft industry, examined the internal dynamics of a politically turbulent industry from the Great Depression through the early Cold War. I am now finishing a book on the social and economic reconstruction of France after the Second World War with a focus on why government elites and a variety of social groups came to regard state authority in new ways during what I call the \u201clong Liberation\u201d from 1944 to 1962. This project makes comparisons across several areas of public policy--industrial renewal, family policy, immigration, taxation, and the regulation of the retail trade--where state intervention took controversial new forms. I also have an abiding interest in comparative history and work that examines France in a broader European, colonial, and trans-Atlantic context. In this spirit I have written on steel towns in the U.S. and Europe, have co-authored a textbook stressing inter-regional comparisons in Europe, and have co-edited books on democratization across the globe, on labor relations, and on \u201cRace in France\u201d as understood through French-American comparisons. My current research interests include issues of race and ethnicity, cultures of work, postwar state planning, and center-periphery dynamics in twentieth-century France. I also serve as the editor of the journal French Politics, Culture & Society, which is jointly sponsored by NYU's Institute of French Studies and Harvard University's Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies.

First, it examines France\u2019s history and political culture in the 20 th   century. Public controversies, media campaigns, regime changes, mass demonstrations,  riots, etc.: from the Dreyfus Affair (1894-1906) to the 2005 riots in the  suburban projects, crises have shaped the political chronology of France in the  long twentieth century. Second, this course explores the phenomenon of  political crises, and pays close attention to their fluidity by carefully  scrutinizing their surge, unfolding, resolution, and impact on individual  lives. The approach is interdisciplinary: we use various primary sources  (journalism, literature, films), and we put diverse critical methods to work (history,  sociology, and anthropology).          READINGS      The book below is  available at the NYU bookstore. The other readings may be downloaded from the  course\u2019s Blackboard website.          Charles Sowerwine, France since 1870: Culture, Politics and  Society (Palgrave McMillan, 2009)          REQUIREMENTS      This course relies on  your commitment as a student. This entails your curiosity and preparedness, your  close and critical reading of the texts, your willingness to share your ideas  with the class.      1. Class Attendance and Participation (25% of  final grade). Punctual  attendance is required. Points will be deducted for each missed class. Beyond  four missed classes, you will lose your participation grade. If you need to  miss class for a medical reason or an emergency, please email me beforehand.  Class begins on time. Participation is essential. Make sure that you analyze all  readings critically, paying attention to historical context as well as  arguments. Always bring your readings to class. Laptops are allowed in class  for note-taking purposes only. All wireless devices must be turned off: no  emailing, \u201cgoogling\u201d or texting.      2. Responses to Readings (35%). Please write a question about the session\u2019s  readings and then answer it. This exercise primarily targets the second goal of  the course: exploring political crises. Your response should grapple with a  theme you deem important and analyze, ponder, make associations between different  political crises. This assignment is due seven times over the course of the  semester (two-to-three pages, double-spaced), and you choose one session in  each of the seven units of the course. Please email it to me (in the body of  the message, not as an attachment) before 9:00 am on the day when the session  meets. You must submit at least two responses before Wednesday, October 5.      3. Mid-term and Final Exams (40%). Both exams are primarily about the first goal  of the course: understanding France\u2019s history and political culture in the 20 th   century. You will contextualize and analyze various documents related to the  course material, deploying as much knowledge and critical thinking as you can.

Much of his work has revolved around the ways people  respond to upheaval and traumatic changes that they associate with modernity  and can seem at once liberating and disturbing.         Gerson has  pursued such questions by exploring, first, the resonance of local memory in  post-revolutionary France (through history, archeology, literary magazines,  historical pageants, and the like). His book The  Pride of Place: Local Memories and Political Culture in Nineteenth-Century  France (Cornell, 2003) won the Jacques Barzun Prize in Cultural History  and the Laurence Wylie Prize in French Cultural Studies. His second book probed changing relationships  to fear, uncertainty, trauma, and the future by examining the Nostradamus  phenomenon from the Renaissance to the present.    Nostradamus: How an Obscure Renaissance Astrologer  Became the Modern Prophet of Doom came out with St. Martin\u2019s Press in  2012. Gerson also co-edited a new  Penguin Classics edition of Nostradamus\u2019 Prophecies (2012).     Gerson\u2019s  current research interests are twofold.    A first project revolves around the politics of technological and  natural disasters in the nineteenth century.    He is testing the notion that the disaster and its aftermath helped the  French state extend its presence in society (though a politics of legitimation,  empathy, and expertise) while leaving open spaces for grassroots responses that  had their own cultural and political contours.    This project brings together the event and its afterlife as well as  metropole and colonies. Gerson\u2019s other project is a dual micro-history of two  couples before, during, and after WW2: a couple of Belgian Jewish refugees in  Nice and the policeman who, with his wife, saved them. This is at once an inquiry into the ordinary  aspects and extraordinary aspects of war, a ground-level analysis of survival  and rescue, and an exploration of familial memory and silence in France and  Belgium.      Gerson\u2019s  final area of interest revolves around the writing of history. He explored  historian Alain Corbin\u2019s approach to cultural history in a special issue of French Politics, Culture &amp; Society  which he guest-edited in 2004. With Laura Lee Downs, he edited a  collection of autobiographical essays by American historians of France: Why  France? American Historians Reflect on an Enduring Fascination (Cornell,  2007; Le Seuil, 2008). This book seeks to unearth the intellectual,  professional, and personal reasons why thousands of American historians have  devoted their careers to France over the course of the twentieth century.     Gerson\u2019s  teaching includes cultural history, cultural theory, and historical  methodology. He has also created a course that trains doctoral students to  teach French civilization.

My first book, on the French aircraft industry, examined the internal dynamics of a politically turbulent industry from the Great Depression through the early Cold War. I am now finishing a book on the social and economic reconstruction of France after the Second World War with a focus on why government elites and a variety of social groups came to regard state authority in new ways during what I call the \u201clong Liberation\u201d from 1944 to 1962. This project makes comparisons across several areas of public policy--industrial renewal, family policy, immigration, taxation, and the regulation of the retail trade--where state intervention took controversial new forms. I also have an abiding interest in comparative history and work that examines France in a broader European, colonial, and trans-Atlantic context. In this spirit I have written on steel towns in the U.S. and Europe, have co-authored a textbook stressing inter-regional comparisons in Europe, and have co-edited books on democratization across the globe, on labor relations, and on \u201cRace in France\u201d as understood through French-American comparisons. My current research interests include issues of race and ethnicity, cultures of work, postwar state planning, and center-periphery dynamics in twentieth-century France. I also serve as the editor of the journal French Politics, Culture & Society, which is jointly sponsored by NYU's Institute of French Studies and Harvard University's Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies.

First, it examines France\u2019s history and political culture in the 20 th   century. Public controversies, media campaigns, regime changes, mass demonstrations,  riots, etc.: from the Dreyfus Affair (1894-1906) to the 2005 riots in the  suburban projects, crises have shaped the political chronology of France in the  long twentieth century. Second, this course explores the phenomenon of  political crises, and pays close attention to their fluidity by carefully  scrutinizing their surge, unfolding, resolution, and impact on individual  lives. The approach is interdisciplinary: we use various primary sources  (journalism, literature, films), and we put diverse critical methods to work (history,  sociology, and anthropology).          READINGS      The book below is  available at the NYU bookstore. The other readings may be downloaded from the  course\u2019s Blackboard website.          Charles Sowerwine, France since 1870: Culture, Politics and  Society (Palgrave McMillan, 2009)          REQUIREMENTS      This course relies on  your commitment as a student. This entails your curiosity and preparedness, your  close and critical reading of the texts, your willingness to share your ideas  with the class.      1. Class Attendance and Participation (25% of  final grade). Punctual  attendance is required. Points will be deducted for each missed class. Beyond  four missed classes, you will lose your participation grade. If you need to  miss class for a medical reason or an emergency, please email me beforehand.  Class begins on time. Participation is essential. Make sure that you analyze all  readings critically, paying attention to historical context as well as  arguments. Always bring your readings to class. Laptops are allowed in class  for note-taking purposes only. All wireless devices must be turned off: no  emailing, \u201cgoogling\u201d or texting.      2. Responses to Readings (35%). Please write a question about the session\u2019s  readings and then answer it. This exercise primarily targets the second goal of  the course: exploring political crises. Your response should grapple with a  theme you deem important and analyze, ponder, make associations between different  political crises. This assignment is due seven times over the course of the  semester (two-to-three pages, double-spaced), and you choose one session in  each of the seven units of the course. Please email it to me (in the body of  the message, not as an attachment) before 9:00 am on the day when the session  meets. You must submit at least two responses before Wednesday, October 5.      3. Mid-term and Final Exams (40%). Both exams are primarily about the first goal  of the course: understanding France\u2019s history and political culture in the 20 th   century. You will contextualize and analyze various documents related to the  course material, deploying as much knowledge and critical thinking as you can.
