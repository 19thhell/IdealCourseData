During that time he served as Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Chair of the Department of Classics. Educated at\u00a0Yale University and the\u00a0University of Toronto, he specializes in the social and economic history of Hellenistic, Roman and Late Antique Egypt. He has held many leadership positions in the fields of classics and papyrology; he is co-founder of a multi-university consortium creating the\u00a0Advanced Papyrological Information System. Among his best-known works are\u00a0Egypt in Late Antiquity (1993),\u00a0The Demography of Roman Egypt (1994; with Bruce Frier),\u00a0Reading Papyri, Writing Ancient History (1995),\u00a0Early Christian Books in Egypt (2009), and\u00a0Everyday Writing in the Graeco-Roman East (2010). His edition (with Giovanni Ruffini) of the first volume of\u00a0Ostraka from Trimithis inaugurated ISAW's\u00a0series of digital books. He has also edited many volumes of papyri and other ancient texts. He directs\u00a0NYU's excavation project at Amheida (jointly sponsored with Columbia) in the Dakhla Oasis in Egypt. He is a member of the\u00a0American Philosophical Society and the\u00a0Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Belgique, as well as a Fellow of the\u00a0American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the\u00a0British Academy.
