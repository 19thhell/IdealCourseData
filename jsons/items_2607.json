New York State law requires that an employee be given sufficient time to vote. Sufficient time is defined as four consecutive non-working hours while polls are open. (For example, an employee would have sufficient time to vote during non-working hours if his or her workday ends at 5 p.m. and polls are open until 9 p.m.) If, due to unusual circumstances, an employee requests time off from work to vote, contact the Employee Relations or the Vice President for Human Resources to discuss the request.   For Local 1 and Local 810 employees, please refer to the applicable contract for all information about voting. For non-union service staff, please contact the Office of Employee Relations .
