Students who secure an internship through or with the assistance of NYU Washington, DC must confirm their spot in the program and enroll in the internship class in order to accept the internship. Many NYU departments (including SCA &amp; Environmental Studies) allow the Washington, DC internship course to satisfy major requirements. Always consult with your academic adviser to confirm how the internship course and other courses you will take while away fit in with your academic progress towards degree fulfillment. Students are required to pursue a minimum of 10 hours/week in their internships to earn course credit. NYU Washington, DC advises that students pursue no more than 20 hrs/week in internship commitments.

Students are highly encouraged to consult NYU Washington DC staff for assistance with these decisions.

We ask employers to think of interns as individuals to mentor. We expect that students will not displace regular employees, but rather work under their close observation.    Guidelines    We welcome professional opportunities relevant to the study of media, culture, and communication. In order for your post to be listed, opportunities must meet the high standards of the Department and will be activated at our discretion.    Interns must have a supervisor, a physical office space to work in, and may not telecommute or be asked to use their own personal equipment such as a laptop or camera. Students may not work on commission, may not be asked to promote products on campus, and may not replace a position normally performed by a paid staff member. We ask employers to review carefully the Department of Labor's Advisor for Trainees (interns) Under The Fair Labor Standards Act .    Postings will not be approved if submitted with a personal email address (i.e. gmail, yahoo, hotmail) or without a valid company address, website, and phone number.    Please note: We often have more than 200 employers seeking interns; therefore, we cannot guarantee applicants or send an email blast for each individual posting. It is up to students to review postings and to decide which positions to apply for.    How to Post an Opportunity    If you would like to post an internship specifically for students in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication, please complete our internship posting form . Please format the text, including line breaks, bold font, and bullets.    After you submit the form, you will receive an email asking for verification of the submission. Once verified, it will be reviewed by our staff. If approved, students will view your listing on our password-protected online database.    It is best to post your opportunity approximately 6-8 weeks in advance of the traditional academic semester. Your posting will remain visable to students until the end of the semester's registration period .    Additional Recruitment Resources @ NYU    Our database is accessed by students in the NYU Department of Media, Culture, and Communication. For interns with production or business backgrounds, you may consider posting your ad through:       Career Net NYU's Wasserman Center for Career Development (viewable by all NYU students) 133 East 13th Street | 212-998-4730 | careerdevelopment.employers@nyu.edu    If you are seeking students with journalism experience, contact: Craigh Barboza , Career Services Specialist Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute | 212-998-3837 | Craigh.Barboza@nyu.edu    If you are seeking students with technical skills in production or post-production, contact: NYU Tisch School of the Arts    If you are seeking students with a business or MBA background, contact: NYU Stern Office of Career Development | 212-998-0623 | ocd@stern.nyu.edu       Credit or Pay?    We strongly recommend that employers offer compensation to interns . Compensation is not only a recruitment tool, but it allows students to focus on their course-work and internship experience while relieving some of the financial burden of studying and living in NYC. If the internship is paid, the student can choose whether or not they want to register for academic credit. Additionally, credit is not legally required if the internship is unpaid.    In order to earn credit for an internship our students must be at the junior, senior or graduate level, and must register by the end of the drop/add period . Typically, this period is within the first 2 weeks of the semester. Students can choose to earn either two or four credits per semester (not to exceed 6 during their academic career) based on how many working hours are spent at the company. These are MINIMUM hours worked, i.e. students can decide to work as many hours as acceptable under federal employment law and earn only one credit.    Credit to Hours Worked Ratio 2 credits = 90 hours worked 4 credits = 180 hours worked    Students handle the registration process with their academic advisor to intern for course credit.    Registration Process    It is our students' responsibility to register for internship credit.  Step One Students determine if they are eligible to intern for credit and, if so, how many credits they would like to take towards the internship. See the eligibility requirements .    Step Two Students register by submitting an Internship Agreement Form . This form has a section that the employer fills out and a section that the student fills out. Since an original signature is needed from the employer, ideally students should plan to meet with the supervisor in person and complete the form together. It is designed to create an opportunity for the student and employer to discuss goals for the internship and facilitate a clear line of communication in terms of expectations.    Step Three Students may either fax the form to the attention of \"Media, Culture, and Communication Advisement Staff\" at 212-995-4046, email it to comm.advisors@nyu.edu, or bring it to the department front desk at 239 Greene Street, 8th Fl. Once the form is approved, the internship will be added to the student's course schedule.    Registering for a credit-based internship is considered an academic undertaking. Students are asked to read through our guidelines and understand the evaluation standards for the course, including the portfolio assignment required of students receiving academic credit.    How Students Are Evaluated    Students who earn credit for their internships are asked to conduct an in-depth analysis of the company. Depending on the company, this could be a description of the news stories produced, journal articles written, press releases made or press kits assembled, events organized, new talent recruited, etc.    Among other research methods, we strongly encourage students to read the company website and annual report, decipher the ownership structure of the company, and conduct informational interviews with key people at the company. Please be as accommodating as possible to make their experience educational.    Finally, we ask that the company complete our intern evaluation form. Students can either email this to their supervisor or bring in a hard copy of the form. Some companies also choose to write the student a general letter of reference that they may present on future interviews.
