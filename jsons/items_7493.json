Description       The United States began the 21st century with a prison crisis unparalleled anywhere in the world. With more than seven million currently under the supervision of the criminal justice system, including over two million in jails and prisons and five million on parole or probation, the U.S. imprisons more of its population than any other nation. Women are being imprisoned at a faster rate than any other group. Children are charged as - and locked away with - adults in New York State. One out of ten Black men are incarcerated nationwide. In this course, we will examine the intersection of race, class, gender, punishment, judicial institutions, and profit-motive as we explore their impact on mass incarceration. Drawing on a growing body of both scholarly research and grassroots resources, we will explore interdisciplinary frameworks for critically examining the relationships, implications and utilities of mass incarceration. Students will collaborate on a final project analyzing a specific aspect of the 'prison industrial complex' and assessing proposed solutions. To encourage innovative approaches to research, and to link scholarship to lived experiences of incarceration, students will prepare group presentations, and have opportunities to organize and participate in correctional facility visits, performances, screenings, discussions, and arts-based workshops with formerly and currently incarcerated artists and prison activists. Texts will include Are Prisons Obsolete and Abolition Democracy by Angela Davis, The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander, Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paulo Freire and Theater of the Oppressed by Augusto Boal among others.

This course examines the structure of the criminal justice system, including the costs borne at the state and federal levels of government; and the causes and consequences of the rising incarceration rates that the nation has witnessed over the past 30 years, including the role of politics in driving society's appetite for locking people up, the labor market effects of having a prison record, and the &quot;spill-over&quot; effects that incarceration has on ex-offenders' communities and families. The course explores its subject matter from an interdisciplinary perspective, connecting ideas from economics, political science, sociology, and law. It will combine conceptual and quantitative approaches to analysis. Possible texts include Bruce Western,\u00a0 Punishment \u00a0\u00a0 and Inequality in America; \u00a0Glenn C.
