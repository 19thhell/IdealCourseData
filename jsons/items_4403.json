The overview investigates not only the country's experiments with authoritarianism - the experiences of mass murder, war and division - but also its emergence as a democratic leader, in the arts and human rights, and as Europe's power broker. We examine questions of citizenship and diversity, Germany's 'special' responsibility as a leader in Europe, the role of the Holocaust in State governance, Berlin's status and development as an industrial and cosmpolitan metropolis, and new avenues for German identity. We ask how these histories have made today's Berlin Europe's most exciting capital - a nexus of youth culture and the interational arts scene - and Germany a vanguard of the arts, sustainable energy, technical development and global politics.   Sample Syllabus                                  German Language        All students are required to take a German language course (or course taught in German) for graded credit.

Sample Syllabus                                                                    Introduction to German Literature - GERM-UA 9152 - 4 points                               Conducted in German. Postintermediate - 100 level.   Der Kurs f\u00fchrt in die Geschichte der deutschen Literatur vom 18. Jahrhundert bis in die Gegenwart ein. Anhand repr\u00e4sentativer Werke vermittelt er einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die verschiedenen Epochen und Gattungen, erste literaturwissenschaftliche Fachbegriffe werden erl\u00e4utert. Kontinuit\u00e4ten und Br\u00fcche, die als signifikante Entwicklungslinien oder Z\u00e4suren die Literaturgeschichte markieren, werden im historischen und gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhang diskutiert. Der Kurs wird durchg\u00e4ngig in deutscher Sprache unterrichtet.  Es ist das Ziel, in gemeinsamen close readings a) ein Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr die jeweiligen Texte und ihre politischen, kulturellen und sozialen Kontexte zu erarbeiten und b) die F\u00e4higkeit zur wissenschaftlichen Diskussion zu entwickeln. Gef\u00f6rdert wird dies auch durch kleinere spielerische Ein-heiten, in denen wir die Texte in die Gegenwart transferieren und so nach der Aktualit\u00e4t der Werke fragen.   The course provides an introduction into the history of German Literature from the 18th century until today. By reading representative texts, the student will receive an overview of various epochs and genres. In addition, basic terminology of literary studies will be explained. Continuities and disruptions, which influence the history of literature in significant ways, are discussed in their historical and social contexts. The class is taught entirely in German.  The course objectives are a) to develop an understanding of the texts and their political, cultural, and social contexts and b) to develop an ability of critical discussion through a close reading of literary works. This is also fostered by some playful teaching units, in which we transfer the texts into the present and investigate their current relevance.

Berlin,  a city in constant transformation itself, offers an enormous variety of sites and  layers of history, providing locations and ambience for both an environmental  as well as personal investigation into identity. The emphasis of the course will  be on learning to see and to develop one\u2019s own personal viewpoint.

Eluding most attempts at tidy classification, sound art can share formal elements and concerns with traditional sculpture, film and video, performance art, conceptual art, architecture, installation, and of course with music. This studio course will explore sound across its many and sometimes contradictory vectors, allowing students intensive work on sounds and their composition, as well as on projects that explore the broad and rich interaction of sound with other disciplines of art.    There are two main tenets of the course. The first is that issues fundamental to sound art engage some of the key problems of modern and contemporary art. Rather than viewing sound as a peripheral practice, we will see how it has been decisive in the narrative of 20th and 21st century art, exciting many of the key debates that carry through to this day. The second principle is that listening, or careful observation, can be primary in the creative process, coming before expression. From John Cage onward, the value of listening, of observation as a primary creative act, has re-attuned many strains of western art (from conceptual, minimal, and land art to media and installation art) to new ideas of process, complexity, and ecology.    This course can be approached from any level of experience. No previous work with sound or with digital media is required, only a willingness to explore the boundaries of art-making that is a natural outgrowth of working with sound as an artistic medium.     Sample Syllabus                                                                        Studio Projects: Autobiography / Berlin - ART-UE 9916 - 3 points                               This course will carry a supplies &amp; studio fee for all non-Steinhardt Studio Art majors.

Sample Syllabus                                                                    Contemporary Art - ARTCR-UE 9052 - 3 points                               Museums mount blockbuster shows. Rappers shoot videos in art galleries. Biennials  proliferate, art fairs geographically expand, and auction sales hit new records. At the  same time, public arts funding is systematically slashed, emerging artists still struggle,  and art criticism remains in its perpetual crisis. The international contemporary art  world is a convoluted interplay of aesthetics and economics; ego and idealism. Berlin\u2019s  art world may be more production-based and experimental than the art scenes of other  major western cities, but it is still a microcosm of larger movements.  Through readings of art theory and criticism, discussions, site visits, guest speakers,  and short- and long-form response writing, this course offers an overview of the  conventions, trends, history, current developments and myriad structures and  substructures of the contemporary art world in general and Berlin\u2019s in particular. The  course delves into contemporary art\u2019s current prevailing discourse via methodological  analysis, practical observation, and input from professionals currently working in the  art\u2019s institutional and commercial sectors. It also offers a critical look at how these  larger art-world structures translate to Berlin.

NYU Sociology Students: This course counts as an advanced seminar.   Berlin is a unique modern Metropolis, its alternating history with often-drastic changes  offers a comprehensive background to explore and investigate the nature of  architecture in correlation to the various development processes of urban culture and life.  Architecture is embedded in the urban fabric for which place and time serve as main  threads, constantly changing their multifaceted and layered relationships. This urban  fabric provides the fertile soil for urban culture and life, which literally takes place in various scales  between the public and the private realm, two more threads intertwined to the urban fabric.  Experiencing the city through walking, is essential for learning how to observe, see  and read, &quot;Place, Building and Time&quot; in Berlin.  Tours will alternate with classroom discussions and workshops.

NYU Sociology Students: This course counts as an advanced seminar.   The course is a mixture of classroom discussions and field trips (in conjunction with discussions in rooms provided by the National Museums of Berlin) to different museums in Berlin, with a focus on the five major museums on the Museum Island, which have been build over a period of 100 years (1830-1930). We will also talk about the newest addition to the Museumsinsel, the Humboldt Forum scheduled to open its doors in the reconstructed city palace on the Schlossplatz in 2019. Discussions will focus on the nature and social function of museums as well as their role as places where the image of the state and its civil society are constantly reshaped, until the era of global migration. Other topics include museums architecture, museum and identity, museum and education, museum and the 21st century. Previous knowledge of art history, architecture, or German history is not required, but useful.

We will also consider the ways in which material conditions guide and constrain social life, from natural resources to disease. Fundamentally, students will learn to apply social scientific insights in order to theorize &quot;environment&quot; and &quot;society&quot; (or nature-culture) as inseparable and mutually constitutive, rather than opposed and mutually exclusive.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    European Environmental Policy - ENVST-UA 9460 or SASEM-UG 9100 - 4 points                               The course gives an introduction to various aspects of EU environmental policy making and policy implementation. After a brief recap of the basics of policy making in the EU, students will learn about the guiding principles and developments within EU environmental policy, the main actors and their interests in and influence on policy making. An optional part of the course might be a visit to the European House of the European Commission (EC) in Berlin where students either have the opportunity to role-play the decision-making process of the EC on the introduction of CO2-standards for cars or to engage in a debate with an EC representative. The second half of the course analyses EU environmental policies in different issue areas (e.g. climate change, biodiversity, waste) for their effectiveness in solving environmental problems. Different policy instruments are discussed for their merits and shortcomings (one example will be the EU Emissions Trading System) and linkages to other issue areas of EU policy making (e.g. industry and agriculture) are discussed. Finally, the course provides an international perspective on EU environmental policy making: sessions will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of EU environmental policy making at home and in international negotiations, compare it with US environmental politics, and discuss future challenges (e.g. EU enlargement) and trends for EU environmental governance.

European Integration is understood in this course to mean the co-operation, which EU  Member states organize in the framework of the Union, and the direction in which this  co-operation evolves. For these twenty-eight diverse countries, integration constitutes  an increasingly essential component and extension of their own state structure. It  permits them to conceive of, to decide on, and to carry out a growing number of  important state tasks in common, and under the roof of the European Union.  You will consider the milestones of postwar European integration. You will analyze the  institutions, procedures and instruments of European integration as well as major EU  policies and the distribution of competencies between Member States and Union. And  you will get acquainted with theoretical models to explain the nature of European  integration up to the present.

The in-depth discussion  will be based upon historical documents and cultural texts with equal attention to sources  from America/the US and Europe/Germany in an effort to explore and evaluate the major  theoretical and rhetorical paradigms (and the shifts therein) informing the perceptions as well  as cultural constructions of the \u201cother\u201d past and present. Moreover, the course will investigate  and evaluate recent manifestations of Anti-Americanism and analyse the ideo-logical and  cultural coordinates of current anti-American concepts in Europe/Germany as well as concepts  of Europe as a socio-cultural model for the 21st century. In conclusion, the politics of the  current US-Administration will be discussed in terms of their impact on transatlantic relations  as well as on dealing with global challenges, particularly in the Middle East.

The course will begin with an introduction to film analysis, giving special attention to the relationship between film and city. We will go on to discuss a number of influential productions from East, West and reunified Germany, and draw comparisons to other German as well as non-German city films. Through seminar discussions, reading responses, and critical essays, you will gain an understanding of how the cinema has engaged with the city of Berlin and its transformations since the end of the Second World War.

This course explores the interstices between State power and the individual in the context of Modern  Berlin and German history. Our exploration of individual confrontations with politics includes a  discussion of how individuals react to State terror\u2013\u2013through collaboration or resistance\u2013\u2013and how  identities flourish, transform or are extinguished under State policies. One important location for  individual responses to the State is the arts, and we explore in depth how State power has promoted or  stifled these creative voices throughout Europe. Special topics include coercive acculturation in Jewish-  German intellectual life, the destruction of the 20s musical Avant-garde, the rise of the Nazi Aesthetic in  Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s documentaries, the intrusion of State Security (the Stasi) in private life, the photorealist  reflections of painter Gerhard Richter on terrorism in Berlin in the 1970s, and Germany\u2019s literary  reassessment of individual and collective war guilt following reunification. Readings and lectures are  supplemented with walking tours of Berlin and its museums, to look at traces of historical, social and  cultural change that has affected individual experience in situ.

Accordingly, students will investigate different aspects of Berlin ranging from its cultural richness in the Weimar Period to the devastation of the city during World War II; from the division in the postwar period, which produced two separate literary systems, to polyphonic and transcultural texts after reunification. The course will focus on publications of canonical authors such as Alfred D\u00f6blin and Christa Wolf, but also confront the students with minority literature by Jewish and German-Turkish authors. In its theoretical approach, the course offers insights into new paradigms of cultural studies such as \u201cspatial turn\u201d or \u201curbanism\u201d as well as seeking to enhance academic skills in the reflection of gender aspects. The corpus of readings covers different literary periods and genres from realism to postmodernism, from prose to plays and lyrics.

The history of Germany in the twentieth century offers rich material to explore various approaches to organizing modern society. Beginning with Imperial Germany in 1900 and moving forward to today\u2019s reunited Germany, we will look at different ways in which the relationship between the state and the individual, and relationship between politics, economy, and society developed over five different political systems. We will interrogate how these institutional arrange\u00acments were envisioned and structured and how they were experienced in everyday negotiations. In this course, principle narra-tives and events will be situated in a European and global context, allowing us to place the concept of German modernity in a comparative framework. Lectures will provide an overview of Germany in the twentieth century; readings and in-class discussions will explore different approaches to analyzing German history and society. During mu\u00acseum vis\u00acits and walking tours, we will analyze contestations over the various attempts to inte\u00acgrate \u2013 both in concerted efforts to memorialize as well as to forget and erase \u2013 Germany\u2019s oft-problematic pasts within the narrative of Germany\u2019s present.

This course explores the interstices between State power and the individual in the context of Modern  Berlin and German history. Our exploration of individual confrontations with politics includes a  discussion of how individuals react to State terror\u2013\u2013through collaboration or resistance\u2013\u2013and how  identities flourish, transform or are extinguished under State policies. One important location for  individual responses to the State is the arts, and we explore in depth how State power has promoted or  stifled these creative voices throughout Europe. Special topics include coercive acculturation in Jewish-  German intellectual life, the destruction of the 20s musical Avant-garde, the rise of the Nazi Aesthetic in  Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s documentaries, the intrusion of State Security (the Stasi) in private life, the photorealist  reflections of painter Gerhard Richter on terrorism in Berlin in the 1970s, and Germany\u2019s literary  reassessment of individual and collective war guilt following reunification. Readings and lectures are  supplemented with walking tours of Berlin and its museums, to look at traces of historical, social and  cultural change that has affected individual experience in situ.

What makes them effective or ineffective? This course analyses the various social movements that organized in response to environmental concerns. Both historical and sociological dimensions of environmental movements are covered, with particular attention given to how issues of environmental protection and social justice intersect. At NYU Berlin, the course includes American (I), European, and in particular German (II), as well as global movements (III).                                                                        Global Connections: Berlin Trends - SCA-UA 9634 - 4 points                               This course examines diverse current urban trends in Berlin and their connections to  worldwide phenomena. It focuses on the way that different social groups (according to  class, milieu, origin, gender or sexuality) appropriate urban space and constitute  place-specific identities.  It uses the city of Berlin with its multiple layers of history as a laboratory for  contemporary urban research with historical, empirical and theoretical material. We will  study key debates on urban developments, partly as field visits, in regard to housing,  migration, gentrification, and we will search for the creative and the sustainable city.  You will be introduced to the contemporary discourses on those trends and to new  ways of reading and seeing a city.

Our exploration of political theory will proceed from a  close reading and analysis of seminal texts that are presented both conceptually and,  for the most part, chronologically. The primary focus will be placed on examining the  historical antecedents of some of the foundational concepts and practices that  distinguish our political behavior and institutions today. While taking account of the  historical complexities and stylized conventions of each text, the course will highlight  the recurrent themes that animate these influential writings and continue to shape our  contemporary understanding of politics. In particular, the lectures and discussions will  be geared towards tracing the conceptual underpinnings of current forms of political  organization, such as the nation-state and liberal democracy, and their effects on the  concerns of law, justice and morality. Some of the critical issues to be discussed  include the divergent views of human nature and ideal society, the structure of  authority and sovereignty, states of emergency, the defense of liberty, equality and  justice, and the different models of democratic practice.

The history of Germany in the twentieth century offers rich material to explore various approaches to organizing modern society. Beginning with Imperial Germany in 1900 and moving forward to today\u2019s reunited Germany, we will look at different ways in which the relationship between the state and the individual, and relationship between politics, economy, and society developed over five different political systems. We will interrogate how these institutional arrange\u00acments were envisioned and structured and how they were experienced in everyday negotiations. In this course, principle narra-tives and events will be situated in a European and global context, allowing us to place the concept of German modernity in a comparative framework. Lectures will provide an overview of Germany in the twentieth century; readings and in-class discussions will explore different approaches to analyzing German history and society. During mu\u00acseum vis\u00acits and walking tours, we will analyze contestations over the various attempts to inte\u00acgrate \u2013 both in concerted efforts to memorialize as well as to forget and erase \u2013 Germany\u2019s oft-problematic pasts within the narrative of Germany\u2019s present.

European Integration is understood in this course to mean the co-operation, which EU  Member states organize in the framework of the Union, and the direction in which this  co-operation evolves. For these twenty-eight diverse countries, integration constitutes  an increasingly essential component and extension of their own state structure. It  permits them to conceive of, to decide on, and to carry out a growing number of  important state tasks in common, and under the roof of the European Union.  You will consider the milestones of postwar European integration. You will analyze the  institutions, procedures and instruments of European integration as well as major EU  policies and the distribution of competencies between Member States and Union. And  you will get acquainted with theoretical models to explain the nature of European  integration up to the present.     Sample Syllabus                              Sociology        The Label \"Advanced Seminar\" attached to certain courses below is relevant ONLY for NYU Sociology majors and minors. It designates a course category internal to the NYU Sociology Department characterized by a seminar format and instruction by a regular member of the faculty. These seminars focus on the specific, most often interdisciplinary, research interests of the instructor and hence are not intended to be foundational offerings at either an elementary or advanced level in sociology or any other single discipline. For students other than NYU Sociology majors and minors, these courses should be considered ordinary seminars. For further clarification, please contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies of the NYU Sociology Department, Professor Thomas Ertman, at te11@nyu.edu .                                                  Sociological Theory - SOC-UA 9111 - 4 points                               This course introduces the distinctive concerns and main perspectives of  sociological theorizing, and examines the value as well as the problematics of  'theorizing' modern (global) society through an introduction to the major  contributions of Tocqueville, Marx, Durkheim, Simmel and Weber. Attention will  be paid to the social and intellectual context of these thinkers, but the primary  focus will be on their ideas and their relevance to the analysis of modern society  and social processes.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Sociology of Education: \u00a0Global Education in the 21st Century - SOC-UA 9415                               This course is designed as a collaborative project between NYUB and Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin offering students a unique opportunity for academic and cultural exchange in a classroom that serves as a test lab for global education. The course will focus on the current realities and future possibilities of global higher education at the backdrop of its historical and conceptual coordinates. A glance at the con-temporary higher education landscape reveals ambivalent trends and directions: Excellence and internationalization protrude as paradigms that drive universities to secure their stakes in the global higher education market. National politics of education further enhance this competition among institutional front-runners by launching excellence initiatives or entering in supranational Bologna-type arrangements to facilitate cross-border academic exchange and knowledge production. Hence a range of distinct regional approaches to global education have emerged from national models and practices of education.    This course will serve as a site of academic dialogue between NYU and HU students in one classroom by pursuing the following three steps. First, it seeks to familiarize its participants with the visions and promises of global education while also paying attention to potential perils involved in globalizing national models of education. Among others, we will address questions such as: How are modes of producing and disseminating knowledge affected when education crosses borders? What does global education demand from student learners and how are globally educated citizens envisioned? How can experiences of knowledge production and education specific to one context be made operable in another? In a second step, the course introduces and compares regional approaches to global education. Different national histories of higher education yield different answers to the questions formulated in the first step. Yet, debates center around (one) global education, not educations. This tension requires scrutiny and, in a third step, it will ask students to develop an informed and critical position on the stakes of global education.  In order to make use of the unique classroom setting the course will employ independent (out-of-class) and in-class, individual and collective, analytical and interpretive formats. Students will be particularly encouraged to fully embrace the learning impulses resulting from the inter-cultural encounter between NYU and Humboldt students. The language we are going to acquire in this course is called global education. By starting to learn its rules and formulas, students are likely to see possible future trajectories of educational development and might even envision their future role in it. The class work will culminate in a colloquium at which both NYU and HU students will present their final group projects.

NYU Sociology Students: This course counts as an advanced seminar.   Berlin is a unique modern Metropolis, its alternating history with often-drastic changes  offers a comprehensive background to explore and investigate the nature of  architecture in correlation to the various development processes of urban culture and life.  Architecture is embedded in the urban fabric for which place and time serve as main  threads, constantly changing their multifaceted and layered relationships. This urban  fabric provides the fertile soil for urban culture and life, which literally takes place in various scales  between the public and the private realm, two more threads intertwined to the urban fabric.  Experiencing the city through walking, is essential for learning how to observe, see  and read, &quot;Place, Building and Time&quot; in Berlin.  Tours will alternate with classroom discussions and workshops.

NYU Sociology Students: This course counts as an advanced seminar.   The course is a mixture of classroom discussions and field trips (in conjunction with discussions in rooms provided by the National Museums of Berlin) to different museums in Berlin, with a focus on the five major museums on the Museum Island, which have been build over a period of 100 years (1830-1930). We will also talk about the newest addition to the Museumsinsel, the Humboldt Forum scheduled to open its doors in the reconstructed city palace on the Schlossplatz in 2019. Discussions will focus on the nature and social function of museums as well as their role as places where the image of the state and its civil society are constantly reshaped, until the era of global migration. Other topics include museums architecture, museum and identity, museum and education, museum and the 21st century. Previous knowledge of art history, architecture, or German history is not required, but useful.

The in-depth discussion  will be based upon historical documents and cultural texts with equal attention to sources  from America/the US and Europe/Germany in an effort to explore and evaluate the major  theoretical and rhetorical paradigms (and the shifts therein) informing the perceptions as well  as cultural constructions of the \u201cother\u201d past and present. Moreover, the course will investigate  and evaluate recent manifestations of Anti-Americanism and analyse the ideo-logical and  cultural coordinates of current anti-American concepts in Europe/Germany as well as concepts  of Europe as a socio-cultural model for the 21st century. In conclusion, the politics of the  current US-Administration will be discussed in terms of their impact on transatlantic relations  as well as on dealing with global challenges, particularly in the Middle East.

The seminar not only delves into the origins of these prominent traditions  of modern Western thought, but also underscores their relevance in modern social  theories and poetics. Hence, the course will also include references to the writings of  their contemporaries, as well as explications of the direct and indirect influences of  Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud on other writers.

Accordingly, students will investigate different aspects of Berlin ranging from its cultural richness in the Weimar Period to the devastation of the city during World War II; from the division in the postwar period, which produced two separate literary systems, to polyphonic and transcultural texts after reunification. The course will focus on publications of canonical authors such as Alfred D\u00f6blin and Christa Wolf, but also confront the students with minority literature by Jewish and German-Turkish authors. In its theoretical approach, the course offers insights into new paradigms of cultural studies such as \u201cspatial turn\u201d or \u201curbanism\u201d as well as seeking to enhance academic skills in the reflection of gender aspects. The corpus of readings covers different literary periods and genres from realism to postmodernism, from prose to plays and lyrics.
