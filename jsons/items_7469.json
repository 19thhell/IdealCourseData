Good scholarship requires careful reading and critical analysis of information.   Basic evaluation criteria for all sources, adapted from The Information-Literate Historian by Jenny L. Presnell (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), include the following:   Author Authority Who created the item? What is his or her affiliation?   Audience and Purpose Who is the intended audience? Why was the item created?   Accuracy and Completeness Is the evidence reliable? Are the important points covered?   Footnotes and Documentation Are the author's sources clearly identified with complete citations to allow you to find the original source yourself?   Perspective and Bias How do the author's bias and perspective inform the arguments and evidence presented?

Comments (0)                                         Citing and Quoting from Unpublished Manuscripts and Archival Collections                        It is important to take accurate notes when doing research in unpublished manuscripts and archival material so you can find items again if you need to, and so other researchers will be able to go back to the source when following your footnote or bibliography entry.   Accurately record the collection name, box number, folder number and document details when taking notes. If you are citing correspondence, record the author as well as the recipient, and the date of the letter, if known.   Format your citations as instructed in the finding aid for the collection.      If you wish to quote from unpublished materials in a special library collection, you must request permission from the repository as well as from the appropriate copyright holders. It is often wise to check with archivists before quoting to make sure there are no use restrictions.  Contact NYU Special Collections or NYU Shanghai Library.

Researchers are encouraged to search all three, even though there will likely be some overlap in search results, to ensure that they have not overlooked relevant collections.   Archive Grid - Database with collection level descriptions of archival holdings and search capability within finding aids contributed by thousands of libraries, museums, and archives.   National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections (NUCMC) - A gateway for searching OCLC WorldCat (Manuscript materials) provided by the Library of Congress. Contains nearly 1.5 million catalog records describing archival and manuscript collections and individual manuscripts in public, college and university, and special libraries located throughout North America and around the world.   WorldCat - Contains records for more than 1 billion items in more than 10,000 libraries worldwide. Use the advanced search feature to limit results to archival materials.   N.B. All repositories have collections that have not yet been arranged and described. Unprocessed collections will not turn up in searches of these databases and may not appear in a library's own catalog. Contact repositories directly to inquire about the availability of unprocessed archival collections.   Consult the Archives Beyond Bobst research guide for additional information.

The content includes available journals in humanities, social sciences, medicine, and science and engineering.   Another database we are trying out is Duxiu , a huge index of Chinese publications of all sorts, including e-books. It does not provide full text for everything it indexes, however, and the amount of text you can see varies. If you come across something for which the full text is not available, please request it via InterLibrary Loan or contact me to discuss the possibility of purchasing it for the library.     We now subscribe to China Local Gazetteers from Wangfang Data, which provides comprehensive coverage of places throughout China.             Comments (0)                                         Chinese Search Tips                 BobCat and WorldCat can now be searched using \u6c49\u5b57! Give it a try. But if you don't find what you are looking for (there are sometimes technical complications), do a search using the English alphabet also. BobCat and WorldCat use the Library of Congress romanization system for Chinese, which is based on the principles of the pinyin  system. Except for proper nouns, there is a space between the romanized form of every character. Omitting spaces can affect your search results! For example, the title of Liu Dajie's book on the development of the history of Chinese literature is romanized as Zhongguo wen xue fa zhan shi, so a keyword search on \"wenxue\" spelled without a space will not retrieve any results.
