Email the Election Coordinator: law.sba@nyu.edu   *The Student Senator serves on the Student Senators Council with Senators from all of the NYU Graduate, Undergraduate and Professional Schools.     Election Rules     Purpose of the Rules   The purpose of these rules is to make sure that candidates are not spending too much time or money on their campaigns, and that voters are not too heavily bothered by the campaigns. The Elections Committee wants to promote collegial elections.   Voting  All JD and LLM Students may vote for the Student Senator. Only current 1Ls may vote for the 1L representatives, only current LLMs may vote for the LLM representatives, and only transfer students in their first semester as transfer students at NYU Law may vote for transfer rep.   Petitions  Completed petitions must be returned to the Student Group Reimbursement box in Kushner Lounge by 4:00 pm on Thursday, March 12 . Students may sign petitions for more than one candidate for the same position. All students may sign petitions for the Student Senator position. 1Ls may sign petitions for the 1L Representatives for candidates in their section only , and only current LLMs may sign petitions for the LLM Representatives. As stated above, transfer students do not have to submit signatures, but must submit the first page of the petition and a personal statement. Candidates must sign the petition to evidence that they have read the election rules and understand that violation of the rules is grounds for disqualification.   Personal Statements  Candidates are also required to submit a personal statement via email to law.sba@nyu.edu . Personal statements for positions must be no more than 500 words in length. They can be as short as the candidate would like. Candidates may include a photo of themselves in the email for publication along with their personal statements. If candidates wish to include a photograph, they should include it in their personal statement and format it as they would like it to appear. All of the personal statements and photographs will be made available to the student body before and during the election.   Posters  Candidates are allowed a maximum of two posters, each no larger than 11\" by 14\" Candidates must follow the building's posting policy in Mercer and D'Ag to get their posters up. If candidates want to share posters with other candidates, then their number of posters is correspondingly increased -- i.e. two candidates who share all posters get four posters maximum.   Phoning  Telephoning individual students is permitted. Telephoning students on behalf of a candidate is not permitted. Mass texting by the candidate or on behalf of a candidate is also not permitted.   Campaign Materials  Any form of leafletting is not permitted. Stickers may be handed out and worn by students. Don\u2019t stick stickers to walls or furniture and make more work for maintenance staff.   Electronic Communication  Emailing your friends to ask them or remind them to vote for you is permitted. However, mass messages (emails directed to 10 or more students) are restricted to three times during the campaign period. A posting to any school listserve counts as one mass message. On mass emails, candidates should \"cc\" law.sba@nyu.edu . Note that all e-mails sent by or reasonably interpreted to be on behalf of the candidate count toward the limit, so please use good judgment. A mass email on a candidate\u2019s behalf will, at the discretion of the Election Committee, count towards the candidate\u2019s email limit.   Candidates may make their Facebook, GChat, and Twitter (or equivalent) status messages reflect their candidacy. Candidates may create Facebook Groups, but Facebook Messages are governed by the same rules as mass messages for emails. Any mass message on email or Facebook will count towards the 3 mass message limit. Wall postings do not count as messages, but please do not make a lot of wall postings.   Parties   During the election period (from when petitions are available until after the election), candidates are NOT permitted to hold or have held for them election parties. Election parties are defined by the SBA as those parties where candidates or others in support of those candidates post or hand out campaign materials, give a speech on behalf of any individual\u2019s candidacy, or where groups of 10 or more students gather to plan campaigning activities.   Chalking and Classroom Announcements   Candidates are allowed to chalk classroom boards once during the period leading up to the election. However, please be respectful of classroom decorum and mindful of other groups that use chalkboard space to advertise their events. Do not take up more space than is necessary. Additionally, should any campaign messages be deemed inappropriate by the Elections Committee, a candidate may be disqualified. Campaign messages, chalking, or announcements may be deemed inappropriate for referencing other candidates or individuals.   Classroom announcements are permitted, subject to the discretion of the professor. Please note that professors are not required to allow campaign announcements during class. This will help ensure that the election process does not hinder the learning environment, which should always be the first priority for classroom activities during scheduled class times.   Violations  Any violation of these election rules may result in the disqualification of a candidate, whether the violation is performed by the candidate or by a candidate\u2019s supporter. Complaints regarding violations should be submitted in writing and will be considered by the Elections Committee. Complaints or questions should be emailed to law.sba@nyu.edu . The Election Committee has the final decision on election matters.   The Election Committee is compromised of all 3Ls currently on the SBA.
