Program Description    The NYU Dietetic Internship is a full-time program that requires enrollment in three NYU semesters or two semesters and a summer session, which is about 13 months total. The program includes one full semester of coursework (academic component), followed by 27 weeks of supervised practice (on-site component) for a total of 1200 full-time, supervised hours.    First Semester    Interns must complete five graduate courses (12 credits) before entering supervised clinical practice. You must receive a B or better on each required internship course in order to be placed in the 27-week supervised practice component.    These courses are:    NUTR-GE 2000.02  New Graduate Student Seminar: Nutrition Section (0) (F, Sp) NUTR-GE 2190.01  Research Methods (3) (F, Sp) NUTR-GE 2037    Medical Nutrition Therapy (4) (F, Sp) NUTR-GE 2037.002  Medical Nutrition Therapy Recitation NUTR-GE 2196    Nutrition-Focused Physical Assessment (2) (F, Sp) NUTR-GE 2198    Nutrition Counseling Theory &amp; Practice (3) (F, Sp)    Note: No master's level (NUTR-GE 2xxx) courses may be taken pass/fail.

The supervised practice takes place in one of many affiliated hospitals, institutions, and agencies located throughout the New York metropolitan area.

The study of nutrition and food provides a solid academic education and practical training for a variety of career opportunities . These fields also encompass some of the most critically important &ndash; and hotly debated &ndash; issues affecting modern society, among them world hunger and problems related to safety, bioengineering, and globalization of food. Through positions in health care, business, government service, private practice, the food and food service industries, and educational and community programs, nutrition and food professionals help individuals and the public make better informed choices about food and nutritional health.    Students in the undergraduate program may specialize in one of two closely related areas of concentration:       Concentration in Food Studies    Concentration in Nutrition and Dietetics       Or may choose to combine either of these areas of concentration with Global Public Health:       Global Public Health/Food Studies    Global Public Health/Nutrition and Dietetics       The two concentrations in Food Studies and Nutrition and Dietetics and the combined majors in Global Public Health share many liberal arts and core courses in common. This means that students can enroll in one of the areas, and take courses in each of them. Students are encouraged to take courses across all of the areas during their entire undergraduate career.    Half of all total credits are taken in NYU's College of Arts and Sciences , and our program gives all students a strong liberal education along with specialization in food or nutrition or global public health.

Program Description    The NYU Dietetic Internship is a full-time program that requires enrollment in three NYU semesters or two semesters and a summer session, which is about 13 months total. The program includes one full semester of coursework (academic component), followed by 27 weeks of supervised practice (on-site component) for a total of 1200 full-time, supervised hours.    First Semester    Interns must complete five graduate courses (12 credits) before entering supervised clinical practice. You must receive a B or better on each required internship course in order to be placed in the 27-week supervised practice component.    These courses are:    NUTR-GE 2000.02  New Graduate Student Seminar: Nutrition Section (0) (F, Sp) NUTR-GE 2190.01  Research Methods (3) (F, Sp) NUTR-GE 2037    Medical Nutrition Therapy (4) (F, Sp) NUTR-GE 2037.002  Medical Nutrition Therapy Recitation NUTR-GE 2196    Nutrition-Focused Physical Assessment (2) (F, Sp) NUTR-GE 2198    Nutrition Counseling Theory &amp; Practice (3) (F, Sp)    Note: No master's level (NUTR-GE 2xxx) courses may be taken pass/fail.

The supervised practice takes place in one of many affiliated hospitals, institutions, and agencies located throughout the New York metropolitan area.

If you begin the academic component of the dietetic internship in the fall semester, then you begin the on-site supervised component around January/February. If you begin the academic component of the dietetic internship in the spring semester, then you begin the on-site component around July/August. Specific start dates vary amongst hospitals.    Holidays + Personal Days    While in the on-site component of the internship, dietetic interns follow their respective hospital's calendar regarding holidays. Personal days must be approved by the on-site clinical nutrition manager and any sick or personal days must be made up for.
