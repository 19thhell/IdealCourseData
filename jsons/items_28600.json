The DMDL studio-based curriculum is complemented by an excellent internship program with host sites in all areas of educational technology and media.    Unlike programs that are focused on the application of existing technologies to formal schooling (such as how to use PowerPoint in teaching high school), our program is appropriate for people who wish to design the media and technology of the future for all kinds of learning environments, or who wish to conduct academic research on how people learn with technology.    Our alumni work in a variety of areas, including the ed tech and media industries, the education sector, government and policy, and research and development. Previously called Educational Communications and Technology, the program has a rich history dating back more than 60 years.    By selecting electives from a specified list of courses, students may optionally concentrate in Games for Learning within the DMDL degree. The concentration is notated on the transcript, and does not lengthen the degree.    The complete program description and requirements may be found in the DMDL Guide for the Master of Arts and Advanced Certificate Programs .    Program Goals and Mission    The project-based curriculum of Digital Media Design Learning prepares students to design rich technology-based, multimedia learning environments and to understand and evaluate their use in wide-ranging educational settings. The program exposes students to the design of computer-based, multimedia simulations and games for learning, dramatic and documentary narratives, media that support advocacy and advance social justice, the educational potential of social media, and educational applications of media and technology for international development. The program employs media design principles and theoretical perspectives drawn from the cognitive sciences, the learning sciences, developmental models of learning, constructivist and constructionist philosophies of learning, and social learning theories.    Student Learning Outcomes       Students will use the instructional design process to develop educational media for wide-ranging educational and training settings and diverse distribution platforms and channels: (a) conduct and document needs assessments; (b) make and document theoretically-grounded media design decisions based on needs assessments; (c) design and produce media or prototypes of media; (d) plan implementations of media or prototypes in order to conduct formative evaluations of their effeciveness; and (e) use outcomes of formative evaluations to revise media or prototypes (iterative design).    Students will demonstrate knowledge of (a) learning theories widely used to inform the design of educational media, e.g., theories in the learning sciences, cognitive science theories of learning, developmental psychology theories of learning, social learning theories, and constructivist and constructionist theories of learning; (b) implications of such learning theories for media design principles and models; and (c) knowledge of how to use these learning theories, and the principles and models based on them, to make sound media design decisions.    Students will demonstrate technical skills required to produce media, including computer-based multimedia, web-based media, media for mobile tablets and phones, and video-based media.    Students will able to identify and critique major twentieth and twenty-first century historical developments, benchmarks, theoretical shifts, and broad trends in practice in the field of educational technology.    Students will be able to identify, and will have skills to access, sources of information and organizations for the purpose of keeping in the field of educational technology.
