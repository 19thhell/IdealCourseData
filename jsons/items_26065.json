Our curriculum is designed for the serious young musician who is seeking a program that fully integrates the study of voice with the study of acting. We are committed to the traditions of classically-based vocal training while at the same time allowing students to explore the demanding repertoire that is expected of professional singers in today's ever-expanding world of music theatre performance.    In addition to voice, acting and dance, as well as courses in music theatre repertoire and history, the core of our program's music theatre specialization training takes place through an intensive series of music theatre workshops. These workshops explore such critical areas as movement, speech, diction, song study, scene study, audition skills, and business skills - the essential \"tools of the trade\" that a young artist needs in order to pursue a professional career.    In addition to the work in classrooms and studios, the program offers performance opportunities in fully-staged productions under the guidance of professional directors, choreographers, conductors, musical directors, and designers. Our guest artists and faculty are drawn from New York's vibrant community of professional artists who count Broadway, off-Broadway, regional theatre and national tours among their credits.    Students specializing in Music Theatre make their New York \"debut\" in their final semester as they are presented to New York's agents, casting directors, directors, and producers in their graduation showcase - a revue designed to feature the work of each student and help them make their first professional contacts in the industry.    The Department's acclaimed programs of study in Music Business (B.M., M.A.), Music Technology (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Jazz (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Music Composition (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), and Music Education (B.M., M.A., Ph.D.) provide a rich and valuable array of elective courses for music performance majors that prepare them for an ever-changing music industry and musical climate.

NYU faculty member Gustave Reese was one of the founding members of The American Musicological Society in 1934, and by mid-century the department had attracted a world-renowned group of scholars and musicians, from the pioneering musicologist Curt Sachs to composers of both concert and popular music such as Marion Bauer and Percy Grainger. Building on this legacy, the Department established its ethnomusicology sub-field in 1978, and a composition and theory sub-field in 1992.

The NYU Department of Music offers studies in historical musicology, ethnomusicology, and composition and theory at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. With its leading research faculty, the Department grants degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy. The Department also sponsors a colloquium series, musical ensembles, graduate and undergraduate concerts, the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society concert series, and a range of interdisciplinary symposia/conferences. Our facilities include early and world music instrument collections, the Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media , and the Waverly Labs for Music and Computing , which provide faculty and students with equipment, lab and workshops spaces for research and creation in music and sound art.

Justin Stanley   Justin Stanley is the founder of, and hornist for, the Wenham Street Brass , and the Education Director at A Street Music LLC . He started playing the horn when he was 11 years old. He had early successes in music performance &ndash; such as winning first chair in the Texas All-State competition &ndash; and he moved to New York to study with Joseph Anderer at New York University in 2004.    Justin gained a great deal of experience during his time in New York through regularly attending performances at the Metropolitan Opera, performing in NYU orchestra and wind ensemble concerts, or creating music with artists around New York. In 2006, Justin was a finalist for the wind-concerto competition and performed with the NYU Wind Ensemble. Performing chamber music at NYU, mainly in woodwind quintets, was important as it led to a deep love of chamber music and to the creation of the Wenham Street Brass in 2010. Justin views chamber music as an optimal medium to draw audiences and musicians alike into artistic experiences.    In 2008, Justin moved to Boston to attend the New England Conservatory and study with Jean Rife. Justin performed with the school&rsquo;s Philharmonia Orchestra under Hugh Wolf, Benjamin Zander and others, but focused mainly on chamber music and Music-in-Education. His horn quartet was a finalist for the NEC Wind Concert Competition with their performance of Schumann&rsquo;s Konzertst&uuml;ck. Justin completed his Masters Degree in horn performance with academic honors and a Music-in-Education concentration in 2010.    Music-in-Education (MIE), a program of study at NEC, focuses strongly on the idea of Artist-Teacher-Scholar, a framework that promotes the evolution and growth musical artistry, teaching artistry, and scholarship in NEC students. Justin applied these ideas to his own musicianship, and also began teaching regularly to private students, as an intern in public schools, as a teaching assistant for NEC graduate classes, in musical outreach through chamber ensembles, and eventually through A Street Music LLC, where he created an education program (including lessons, community outreach, student/teacher concerts, and summer camps).    Justin formed the Wenham Street Brass (WSB), a collective of brass players in Boston, for the purpose of achieving the highest musical standards and for teaching through artistic engagement. The WSB has commissioned music from notable composers (including Nathan Ball and an ongoing collaboration with Derek David), performed numerous outreach programs and recitals in its first year. Justin is the director of two summer music camps for children in the Boston area. Justin also performs regularly around the Boston area.

Helena Basilova   Helena Basilova , born in Russia to two established pianists/composers but raised in The Netherlands and currently living in Amsterdam, subverts all the other stereotypes. But her personal history did &ndash; undeniably - instill a sense of melancholy in her. This wistfulness is never stronger than in her connection to Russian music and its widespread influence in (Eastern) Europe. Though Helena performs repertoire from all periods and styles, it has led Helena time and again to Russian composers such as Prokofiev, Rachmaninov, Scriabin and Shostakovich.    Her piano career took off after being awarded the 'Debut Series Concert Tour' in March 2008. She performed at major venues in The Netherlands, including The Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. This tour led to concerts all over Europe including, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Iceland, Russia and the Americas. More recently, Helena performed Scriabin's 9th sonata at Carnegie Hall&rsquo;s Weill Hall and Shostakovich's Second Piano Concerto at Symphony Space New York City.    Having a special connection to the music by Leos Janacek resulted in the recording of a CD with piano works by this Czech composer released in January 2013 by Quintone Records. This CD has garnered praise by European press leading to concerts in Japan, India, The States, Russia and Denmark.    Besides her solo career Helena has a big love for chamber music, last season she played Messiaen's Quartet for the End of Time in New York and Beethoven's violin sonatas in San Antonio, Texas. She also collaborates frequently with contemporary jazz musicians and finds it important to be in touch with living composers. In December 2012 Helena premiered a newly written work by Molly Herron, specially written and dedicated to her.    Recent appearances include solo recitals in Moscow, New York City, Copenhagen, India, and China; an educational project in high schools involving Olivier Messiaen; chamber music projects with Reinier Baas (guitar), Diamanda le Berge Dramm (violin), and Eva van Grinsven (saxophone); and the start of a new long-term project: performing and publishing music of her father, composer Alexander Basilov.

He is a regular recording studio musician, tours constantly, and teaches while finding time to work on his own exciting creative projects. Recently he made two European tours: one with the legendary Lee Konitz Nonet and one with the Paradox Trio. The tour with the Lee Konitz Nonet included travel to the north of France near Reims, then to Zagrab in Croatia, then Milan, and finally London. Greg will be touring Europe again during the summer of 2007 to play at numerous festivals. Greg is a member, with Grammy-nominated reed player Matt Darriau (of Klezmatics renown), of The Paradox Trio. A recent tour with that group brought Greg to Berne in Switzerland, as well as Vienne in the South of France. In 2007, Greg will record his own album and play with the Lee Knoitz Nonet at the JVC Jazz Festival at Carnegie Hall. Also in 2007, along with fellow NYU Alum Natacha Diels, Greg will be playing in an Off-Broadway production of \"Betrothed,\" an original work produced by the Ripetime Theater group (ripetime.org).

Greg developed a \"passion\" for this during his studies at NYU. Jeff created a technique through which he plays the cello and controls the concomitant electronics with his feet. That technique came to fruition in 2006 when he demonstrated it for Jazz pianist Vijay Iyer. Iyer subsequently hired Greg to use his technique in \"Betrothed\"; Iyer is the Musical Director of the new show.

Wayne Shorter   Wayne Shorter (Steinhardt Music, B.S., 1956) More than half a century after embarking on his lifelong musical adventure, Shorter is universally regarded as a living legend in jazz. His great body of work as a composer for (themselves) legendary groups such as Art Blakey&rsquo;s Jazz Messengers, Miles Davis&rsquo; mid &lsquo;60s quintet, and Weather Report is enough to ensure him an historic place in jazz. But even if this prolific composer had never written a single composition, his signature sound and unparalleled expression on both tenor and soprano saxes would have earmarked him for historic recognition. When this legendary writing prowess is combined with legendary performances with some of the greatest jazz artists of the last 50 years, the result is a jazz immortal. &ldquo;Life is so mysterious, to me,&rdquo; says Shorter. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop at any one thing to say, &lsquo;Oh, this is what it is.&rsquo; And I think it&rsquo;s always becoming, always becoming. That&rsquo;s the adventure. And imagination is part of that adventure.\"    Born in Newark, New Jersey on August 25, 1933, Wayne Shorter had his first great jazz epiphany as a teenager: &ldquo;I remember seeing Lester Young when I was 15 years old. It was a Norman Granz Jazz at the Philharmonic show in Newark and he was late coming to the theater. A couple of other guys and me were waiting out front of the Adams Theater and when he finally did show up, he had the pork pie hat and everything. Then we were trying to figure out how to get into the theater from the fire escape around the back. We eventually got into the mezzanine and saw that whole show -- Stan Kenton and Dizzy Gillespie bands together on stage doing &lsquo;Peanut Vendor,&rsquo; Charlie Parker with strings doing &lsquo;Laura&rsquo; and stuff like that. And Russell Jacquet&hellip;IIlinois Jacquet. He was there doing his thing. That whole scene impressed me so much that I just decided, &lsquo;Hey, man, let me get a clarinet.&rsquo; So I got one when I was 16, and that&rsquo;s when I started music.&rdquo;    Switching to tenor saxophone, Shorter formed a teenage band in Newark called The Jazz Informers and later got some invaluable bandstand experience with the Jackie Bland Band, a progressive Newark orchestra that specialized in bebop. While still in high school, Shorter participated in several cutting contests in Newark's jazz scene, including one memorable encounter with sax great Sonny Stitt. He was accepted to the Music Department in The Steinhardt School at New York University and immediately started soaking up the Manhattan jazz scene by frequenting popular nightspots like Birdland and Cafe Bohemia. Shorter worked his way through NYU by playing with the Nat Phipps orchestra. Upon graduating NYU in 1956, he worked briefly with Johnny Eaton and the Princetonians, and Shorter earned the nickname \"The Newark Flash\" for his speed and facility on the tenor saxophone. But just as he was beginning to make his mark, Shorter was drafted into the Army. He recalls a memorable jam session at the Cafe Bohemia just days before he was shipped off to Fort Dix, New Jersey. \"A week before I went into the Army I went to the Cafe Bohemia to hear music, I said, for the last time in my life. I was standing at the bar having a cognac and I had my draft notice in my back pocket. That&rsquo;s when I met Max Roach. He said, 'You&rsquo;re the kid from Newark, huh? You&rsquo;re The Flash.' And he asked me to sit in. They were changing drummers throughout the night, so Max played drums, then Art Taylor, then Art Blakey. Oscar Pettiford was on cello. Jimmy Smith came in the door with his organ. He drove to the club with his organ in a hearse. And outside we heard that Miles was looking for somebody named Cannonball. And I&rsquo;m saying to myself, 'All this stuff is going on and I gotta go to the Army in about five days!'\"    Following his time in the service, Shorter had a brief stint in 1958 with Horace Silver and later played in the house band at Minton's Playhouse in Harlem. It was around this time that Shorter began jamming with fellow tenor saxophonists John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. In 1959, Shorter had a brief stint with the Maynard Ferguson big band before joining Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers in August of that year. He remained with the Jazz Messengers through 1963, becoming Blakey's musical director and contributing several key compositions to the band's book during those years. Shorter made his recording debut as a leader in 1959 for the Vee Jay label and in 1964 cut the first of a string of important recordings for the Blue Note label. He joined the Miles Davis band in 1964 and remained with the group through 1970, contributing such landmark compositions as \"Nefertiti,\" \"E.S.P.,\" \"Pinocchio,\" \"Sanctuary,\" \"Fall\" and \"Footprints.\"    In 1970, Shorter co-founded the group Weather Report with keyboardist and Miles Davis alum, Joe Zawinul. It remained the premier fusion group through the '70s and into the early '80s before disbanding in 1985 after 16 acclaimed recordings, including the Grammy Award-winning double-live LP, 8:30, in 1980. Shorter formed his own group in 1986 and produced a succession of electric jazz albums for the Columbia Records: Atlantis (1986), Phantom Navigator (1987), and Joy Ryder (1988). He re-emerged on the Verve Records label with High Life in 1995. After the tragic loss of his wife in 1996 (she was aboard the ill-fated Paris-bound flight TWA 800), Shorter returned to the scene with the release of 1+1 (1997), an intimate duet recording with pianist and former Miles Davis quintet bandmate Herbie Hancock. Hancock and Shorter spent 1998 touring as a duet. Also in that year, Shorter was given the most prestigious award in jazz, the NEA Jazz Masters Award. In the summer of 2001 Shorter began touring as the leader of a talented young lineup featuring pianist Danilo Perez, bassist John Patitucci and drummer Brian Blade, each a celebrated recording artist and bandleader in his own right. The group's amazing chemistry was well documented in the acclaimed Footprints Live! (2002). Shorter followed in 2003 with Alegria, an expanded vision for large ensemble which earned him a Grammy Award that year. In addition, he has received 9 Grammy Awards and 13 Grammy nominations in his career, which are ground shaking numbers. Most recently, Mr. Shorter&rsquo;s album, Beyond the Sound Barrier, received the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Jazz Album.    top photo: Jazz legend and Alumnus Wayne Shorter &amp; Dr. Dave Schroeder at Commencement 2010         Vocal Performance               Douglas Ullman   Douglas Ullman , Jr. Vocal Performance 2005, studied at NYU Steinhardt with Carolann Page.

An evening featuring an interview with the venerable tunesmith Jimmy Webb, by Steinhardt Songwriter-in-Residence Phil Galdston, was followed by an awards ceremony and concert. Writers and performers presented by BMI, SESAC, ASCAP, SHOF (The Songwriters Hall of Fame), and The Songwriters' Guild of America then performed before a packed audience in NYU Steinhardt's Frederick Loewe Theatre. Marenberg performed his song \"We'll Catch Fire\" with David at the piano and Hugh Wilson as vocalist.    Born March 6, 1987, David Marenberg began to seriously pursue composition upon attending Amherst College, where he wrote his first symphony, &ldquo;Symphony No. 1 &ndash; California.&rdquo; Eager to continue collaborating with visual artists, David has now enrolled in the NYU Steinhardt program in Scoring for Film and Multimedia. He is currently scoring commercials and films, but still maintains a healthy interest in the concert world.    In the recent summer of 2010, David was invited, as one of 5 composers worldwide, to spend a month in Aspen, CO, composing and studying with major film composers Jeff Rona, David Newman and Jack Smalley. His score, &ldquo;My City, She Never Sleeps,&rdquo; was performed and recorded by the American Academy of Conducting at Aspen Orchestra.

His newest work, &ldquo;Ave Maria&rdquo;, commissioned by the Amherst College Choral Society, was performed in early May 2010. The piece, written for 8-part chorus and 3 soloists, juxtaposes phrases of Gregorian chant with neo-tonal and neo-modal harmonies.    Even in his concert works, David writes with the purpose of evoking emotion from the listener. Although subtle in his use of fluid meter and structure, David uses a decidedly accessible harmonic palette to reach a more diverse audience. Taking elements from turn-of-the-century French impressionism and post-modern Romanticism, David places strong emphasis on melody and orchestral color.    David currently splits his time between New York and Los Angeles. To view a portion of David's acceptance performance, click the video below.
