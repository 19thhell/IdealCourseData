                                                         What Is Philosophy?   Philosophy \u2014 perhaps the oldest academic discipline \u2014 explores enduring fundamental questions about the world and our place in it: What is the ultimate nature of reality? What really exists, and what is mere appearance? What, if anything, can we genuinely know? How are our conscious minds related to our physical bodies? What is value, and which values should we adopt? What makes for a good or valuable life? Are we ever responsible for the actions we perform, or are we merely victims of our environment and our genetic inheritance? How should societies be organized? How should we understand the relationship between science and religion, or between reason and faith?   Such questions are not the inventions of philosophers, of course. Many of us ponder them as children. Yet later we come to ignore them \u2014 or simply accept answers to them unreflectively. Philosophers, though, strive to keep pondering, and to address these questions as thoroughly as possible through reasoned discussion and argument.   By engaging in this process, philosophers illuminate aspects of the world that people routinely take for granted: phenomena such as perception, causation, consciousness, meaning, and obligation structure our lives and our practices in ways we rarely notice or pause to consider. We are everywhere guided by unexamined assumptions about truth, knowledge, reality, goodness, beauty, freedom, and justice. Philosophy lays bare these assumptions and then analyzes and questions them. And so those who aspire to live reflective lives cannot help but be gripped by philosophical inquiry. For them, philosophy is essential.                                                                                                                                   Capstone               The capstone project in Philosophy represents the culmination of your work in the Philosophy major. It is a substantial work of written scholarship that enables you to explore a philosophical problem that is of particular personal interest to you and to make a scholarly contribution to ongoing discussions of that problem.                                                                                       Concentration               The concentration in Philosophy provides students with a strong foundation of philosophical knowledge and trains students to engage with a wide array of philosophical problems. It is designed to help students develop the analytical, logical, and persuasive skills required by nearly all professional pursuits and to enrich students\u2019 intellectual lives.
