Stocks   are ownership shares in a company.   Here's a common-sense introduction   .      Mutual funds . A mutual fund, otherwise known as an investment   company, is a corporation which pools together investor's money generally   to purchase stocks and bonds. Investors participate in the mutual fund by  purchasing shares of the entire pool of assets, thus diversifying their investment.  The pooled assets are invested by professional managers who buy and sell  securities on behalf of the investors.      Because mutual funds pass all gains, losses and tax obligations/benefits   through to investors, mutual funds receive preferential tax treatment under   the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.      A closed-end fund has a fixed number of shares outstanding  and is traded just like other stocks on an exchange or over the counter.  The more common open-end funds sell and redeem shares at any time  directly to shareholders. Sales and redemption prices of open-end funds are  fixed by the sponsor based on the fund's net asset value; closed-end funds  may trade a discount (usually) or premium to net asset value.      Much  more information here.           Bonds of various different varieties (e.g., they may be  Eurobonds, domestic bonds, fixed interest / floating rate notes, etc.). Bonds  are medium to long-term negotiable debt securities issued by governments,  government agencies, federal bodies (states), supra-national organisations  such as the World Bank, and companies. Negotiable means that they  may be freely traded without reference to the issuer of the security. That  they are debt securities means that in the event that the company  goes bankrupt. bond-holders will be repaid their debt in full before   the holders of unsecuritised debt get any of their principal back.           Short term (\"money market\") negotiable debt securities    such as T-Bills (issued by governments), Commercial Paper (issued by companies)   or Bankers Acceptances. These are much like bonds, differing mainly in their  maturity \"Short\" term is usually defined as being up to 1 year in maturity.  \"Medium term\" is commonly taken to mean form 1 to 5 years in maturity, and  \"long term\" anything above that.      Over the Counter (\"OTC\") money market products such as  loans / deposits. These products are based upon borrowing or lending. They  are known as \"over the counter\" because each trade is an individual contract  between the 2 counterparties making the trade. They are neither negotiable  nor securitised. Hence if I lend your company money, I cannot trade that  loan contract to someone else without your prior consent. Additionally if  you default, I will not get paid until holders of your company's debt   securities are repaid in full. I will however, be paid in full before  the equity holders see a penny.      Spot Foreign Exchange . This is the buying and selling  of foreign currency at the exchange rates that you see quoted on the news.  As these rates change relative to your \"home currency\" (dollars if you are  in the US), so you make or lose money.      Commodities . These include grain, pork bellies, coffee  beans, orange juice, etc.         The core of the US financial markets is the market for debt issued  by the US government, which issues US Treasury bills, notes and bonds.     US Treasuries     The US Treasury Department periodically borrows money and issues  IOUs in the form of bills, notes, or bonds (\"Treasuries\"). The differences   are in their maturities and denominations:                                     Bill       Note       Bond                 Maturity       up to 1 year       1 - 10 years       10 - 30/40 years                 Denomination       $1,000       $1,000       $1,000                 Minimum       $10,000       $1,000       $1,000                       Treasuries are auctioned. Short term T-bills are auctioned every  Monday, and longer term bills, notes, and bonds are auctioned at other intervals.   A recording maintained by the Kansas City Federal Reserve will tell you the  purchase price, auction date, issue date, series number, coupon rate and  effective annualized yield for each of the most recent treasury auctions.   To find out the results of the latest auction, dial the KC Fed information   line at (800) 333-2919 using a touch-tone phone. Press \"1\", then \"4\", then  \"1\". You don't have to wait for the recordings to complete before entering  each digit. Unfortunately, this number is not reachable from all areas of  the country.     T-Notes and Bonds pay a stated interest rate semi-annually, and  are redeemed at face value at maturity. Exception: Some 30 year and longer   bonds may be called (redeemed) at 25 years.     T-bills work a bit differently. They are sold on a \"discounted basis.\"  This means you pay, say, $9,700 for a 1-year T-bill. At maturity the Treasury  will pay you (via electronic transfer to your designated bank checking account)  $10,000. The $300 discount is the \"interest.\" In this example, you receive  a return of $300 on a $9,700 investment, which is a simple rate of slightly  more than 3%.     Treasuries can be bought through a bank or broker, but you will  usually have to pay a fee or commission to do this. They can also be bought  with no fee using the Treasury Direct program, which is described elsewhere   in the FAQ.     In practice, the first T-bill purchase requires you to send a certified   or cashiers check for the full face value, and within a week or so, after   the auction sets the interest rate, the Treasury will return the discount   ($300 in the example above) to your checking account. For some reason, you  can purchase notes and bonds with a personal check.     Treasuries are negotiable. If you own Treasuries you can sell them  at any time and there is a ready market. The sale price depends on market   interest rates. Since they are fully negotiable, you may also pledge them   as collateral for loans.     Treasury bills, notes, and bonds are the standard for safety. By  definition, everything is relative to Treasuries; there is no safer investment  in the U.S. They are backed by the \"Full Faith and Credit\" of the United States.        Interest on Treasuries is taxable by the Federal Government in the  year paid. States and local municipalities do not tax Treasury interest income.   T-bill interest is recognized at maturity, so they offer a way to move income  from one year to the next.     The US Treasury also issues Zero Coupon Bonds. The ``Separate Trading   of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities'' (a.k.a. STRIPS) program   was introduced in February 1986. All new T-Bonds and T-notes with maturities   greater than 10 years are eligible. As of 1987, the securities clear through   the Federal Reserve's books entry system. As of December 1988, 65% of the   ZERO-COUPON Treasury market consisted of those created under the STRIPS program.        However, the US Treasury did not always issue Zero Coupon Bonds.  Between 1982 and 1986, a number of enterprising companies and funds purchased  Treasuries, stripped off the ``coupon'' (an anachronism from the days when  new bonds had coupons attached to them) and sold the coupons for income and  the non-coupon portion (TIGeRs or Strips) as zeroes. Merrill Lynch was the  first when it introduced TIGR's and Solomon introduced the CATS. Once the  US Treasury started its program, the origination of trademarks and generics  ended. There are still TIGRs out there, but no new ones are being issued.        Agencies     Other US government debt obligations include US Savings Bonds (Series   E/EE and H/HH) and bonds from various US Government agencies, including the  ones that are known by cutesy names like Freddie Mac, as well as the Mae  sisters, Fannie, Ginnie and Sallie. US Government Agency Bonds, in general,  pay slightly more interest but are somewhat less predictible than Treasuries.  For example, mortgage-backed-bond returns will vary if mortgages are redeemed  early. Some agency bonds, technically, are not general obligations of the  United States, so may not be purchased by certain institutions and local  governments. The \"common sense\" of many people, however, is that the Congress  will never allow any of those bonds to default.     Munis     US municipal bonds are free of Federal income taxes. The taxable  equivalent yield is equal to the tax free yield divided by the sum of 100  minus the current tax bracket. For example the taxable equivalent yield of  a 6.50% tax free bond for someone in the 32% tax bracket would be: 6.5/(100-32)   = 0.0955882 or 9.56%                                                  More about The    Stern School of Business    &#8226; The Instructor    &#8226; Global Financial   Markets    &#8226; Prof Giddy's   International Financial Management course    &#8226; Prof Giddy's   Corporate Finance course    &#8226; Prof Giddy's   Debt Instruments and Markets course    &#8226; Corporate Financial Restructuring    &#8226; Prof Giddy's short courses and seminars                    giddy.org         | financefixit.com         | ABSresearch.com         | cloudbridge.org         |    contact          Copyright &copy;2003     Ian Giddy.

Merrill Lynch was the  first when it introduced TIGR's and Solomon introduced the CATS. Once the  US Treasury started its program, the origination of trademarks and generics  ended. There are still TIGRs out there, but no new ones are being issued.        Agencies     Other US government debt obligations include US Savings Bonds (Series   E/EE and H/HH) and bonds from various US Government agencies, including the  ones that are known by cutesy names like Freddie Mac, as well as the Mae  sisters, Fannie, Ginnie and Sallie. US Government Agency Bonds, in general,  pay slightly more interest but are somewhat less predictible than Treasuries.  For example, mortgage-backed-bond returns will vary if mortgages are redeemed  early. Some agency bonds, technically, are not general obligations of the  United States, so may not be purchased by certain institutions and local  governments. The \"common sense\" of many people, however, is that the Congress  will never allow any of those bonds to default.     Munis     US municipal bonds are free of Federal income taxes. The taxable  equivalent yield is equal to the tax free yield divided by the sum of 100  minus the current tax bracket. For example the taxable equivalent yield of  a 6.50% tax free bond for someone in the 32% tax bracket would be: 6.5/(100-32)   = 0.0955882 or 9.56%                                                  More about The    Stern School of Business    &#8226; The Instructor    &#8226; Global Financial   Markets    &#8226; Prof Giddy's   International Financial Management course    &#8226; Prof Giddy's   Corporate Finance course    &#8226; Prof Giddy's   Debt Instruments and Markets course    &#8226; Corporate Financial Restructuring    &#8226; Prof Giddy's short courses and seminars                    giddy.org         | financefixit.com         | ABSresearch.com         | cloudbridge.org         |    contact          Copyright &copy;2003     Ian Giddy.

A Recap of This Book      Back to the top of this document              About the Book     This book is about the financial markets, domestic and international, that are used by multinational corporations, government agencies, and banks in the conduct of their business. While it is not about financial management per se, it explains much about the markets in which corporate international financial managers have to deal. It is used in courses such as one taught by the author . The global financial markets include the market for foreign exchange, the Eurocurrency and related money markets, the international capital markets, notably the Eurobond and global equity markets, the commodity market and last but not least, the markets for forward contracts, options, swaps and other derivatives. The book seeks to explain how these markets work both in the context of basic principles of finance and by means of examples and applications. The aim of the book is to construct a story employing the most current state of the art in the markets themselves with a solid foundation of theory.    The markets and institutions of international finance have, in recent years, undergone significant changes. To great extent the institutions that dominated global finance in earlier decades--commercial banks and supranational organizations like the International Monetary Fund--have been displaced by disintermediated, private finance. There has been an enormous shift of expertise and market power away from banks and towards corporations. The latter increasingly issue commercial paper, bonds and medium term notes, and manage their financial risks internally. Some have created finance subsidiaries that have become powerful financial service firms in their own right. Banks' functions have broadened accordingly: a few have become more like investment banks, performing underwriting and distribution of securities to investors rather than lending money themselves. Many have developed capabilities in risk management instruments, such as options, swaps and more complex derivatives. All successful market participants must have a far more sophisticated understanding of financial risks, and of the tools to manage them, than was once the case. The asset-liability management task in commercial banks has become more complex as the variety of products, both on and off their balance sheets, proliferates.     The International Monetary Fund, originally designed to resurrect the post-World War II international monetary system, has become a lender to less developed countries in financial distress and no longer performs in the main arena of the international financial circus. National capital markets have gained importance, to some extent at the expense of external markets like the Eurobond market, as barriers are eroded and domestic institutions face the harsh wind of international competition.    All these changes make the field one of continual excitement, a case study that never ends. Global Financial Markets is written in a style that reflects the author's view that learning at its best is an active process, not passive absorption. Frequent examples, case studies and illustrations give the reader the opportunity to see the markets through the eyes of the practicing banker or corporate financial officer. In many cases these are thinly-disguised real life dilemmas faced by companies and banks. They invite the reader to work through the situations by proxy. Doing so helps one develop the mental skills and familiarity with techniques that are the true goals of the book.    As the Table of Contents suggests, the book is divided up into five major parts. Part I, the framework, includes the international financial system and the basic \"foundation\" markets of the system, the foreign exchange and international money markets. A newcomer to the field should certainly read these first, for much of the rest of the book relates back to the practices and principles described in these first chapters. Chapter Five, the last in the section, contains a simple framework that ties together some well-known relationships of the foreign exchange markets. It provides a good starting-point for Part II, which deals with currency forecasting and hedging tools such as forwards, futures and options. The three chapters in this section are must reading for anyone interested in the management of foreign exchange risk by corporations.    The third part of the book covers credit instruments such as multiple-option loan facilities, money market instruments such as Eurocommercial paper, and less developed country debt, all in the arena of international banking. Part IV is entitled \"The International Capital Market,\" and contains chapters on the global bond markets, the equity and commodity markets, and the burgeoning market for currency and interest rate swaps. Borrowers and investors worldwide have become increasingly reliant on the swap and capital markets described in these chapters, and financial institutions of all kinds are hastening to develop capabilities in the design and trading of capital market and derivative instruments.    Part V considers the use of the international money, capital and derivative markets by corporations and other borrowers. It offers a logical framework for selecting among the myriad choices available to major borrowers in today's global market. Chapter Seventeen is devoted to explaining the role of financial innovations, including hybrid Eurobonds, in international corporate financing. As elsewhere in the book, the reader is given numerous opportunities to learn by example how the techniques work and how they are employed by companies and banks in practice.    The last section is designed for those who wish to review key concepts covered in the book. Chapter 18 provides a precis and recap, and is followed by a comprehensive glossary.
