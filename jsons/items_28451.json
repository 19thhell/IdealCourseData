Everyone should have openFrameworks installed in advance by following the instructions here\u00a0 http://openframeworks.cc/ download/ \u00a0We will discuss the structure of an openFrameworks app, basics of C++ syntax, and walk through the process of building a simple application. We will look at some OF tools including the examples, documentation, tutorials, and forum, as well as exploring the huge ofxAddons community. We will focus on the features of openFrameworks that set it apart from other toolkits and languages, like high-speed low-latency interaction, cutting-edge tools for computer vision, or the ability to interface with new hardware.     This will be run by Kyle McDonald. \u00a0Given space limitations, this workshop is open to ITP students only.     \u00a0                                                      Tuesday, November 11th, 2014           mly2 | Events                                                                                                    home     program     projects     people     news     contact     student resources"}]}]
