Please feel free to contact the Arts and Science Office of Summer Programs with any questions or comments at (212) 998-3890. We very much appreciate your help.     Checklist for Department Administrators :     1.    Appoint all faculty teaching in the Study Abroad program.     2.    Manage myTime for 119s.     3.    Book flights for program staff using the department\u2019s BTA account.     For more information and instructions on how to accomplish these tasks, please refer to the below guidelines:     1.  Appointments:     Faculty/Instructors Appointments     Department Administrators should appoint all faculty who are teaching in the Study Abroad program through regular FAS Payroll appointment processes. Appointments should be submitted to Payroll.     For 102s, the Additional Compensation form should be used to appoint faculty to teach their course (non-titled). For 112s, the appointment should be made on the New Appointment Form or the Turnaround Document Form (TAD) from the PAF database. As a general note, please do not cross out current appointments when marking up the Turnaround Document form (TAD).     For local faculty (900s) at the program site, the appointment processes vary by country and program.     Important Note:     When appointing full time NYU faculty (102s) and adjunct instructors (112s), on the Turnaround document (TAD), under \"clarification\", please write the following:          \"Please make a lump sum payment of [$AMOUNT] on the payment date of [DATE*] for work during Summer\"     * The date should be July 1 for summer session I and August 1 for summer session II.     Please remember to use the summer chartfield 10-95006 and Q number of your program on the form.          Administrative Appointments    Program Directors (102s)     The A &amp; S Office of Summer Programs prepares and submits the appointment paperwork for the Study Abroad Directors.     Program Assistants (119s)     Department administrators prepare the paperwork for Program Assistants (PAs) as 119 appointments. Please disseminate the following instructions to prospective Program Assistants:     1.    Go to this website: www.nyu.edu/careerdevelopment/students/oncampus.php and select the appropriate path link.     2.    Complete and print out the On-Campus Student Employee Application or visit the Wasserman Center for Career Development to obtain the form. If you are a new NYU employee additional forms must be completed (W-4 and I-9 forms).     3.    Have the On-Campus Student Employee Application form signed by a staff member at the Wasserman Center . Student signature is also required on the form.     4.    Bring all signed forms + Turnaround Document (TAD) to the below location:          attn: Payroll    5 Washington Square North , GL mailroom            Resident Assistants (119s)     Resident Assistants (RAs) are also appointed as 119s. Please provide RAs the same guidelines specified above for PA appointments. Payment and Airfare for RAs follow the same guidelines as for PAs.            2.  Payment and myTime for 119s:     PAs and RAs receive a summer stipend.    The hourly rate, the amount of hours worked per week, and the stipend amount for work during the program are each set by the A &amp; S Office of Summer Programs.     These 119 positions are paid by an hourly rate submitted in myTime . This also applies to their payment of the summer stipend set by the A &amp; S Office of Summer Programs.     During the spring, Department Administrators should keep track of the hours worked by PAs in the corresponding bi-weekly pay period, and make sure 119s report them accordingly in myTime. Department Administrators should approve timesheets in myTime.        3.    Airfare:     Department Administrators book flights for Program Directors, PAs and RAs (unless PA or RA are on group flight).    All program staff approved for travel will be allowed to book one roundtrip economy ticket from New York City to their program destination site for the dates of the program only. Staff may not book a flight to a different city or include stopovers or other additional travel/extended stays . Should the tickets include stopovers or different travel arrangements than those specified, the person flying is responsible for paying the difference between what the trip would cost without the stopovers or special arrangements and the regular economy flight to the program\u2019s city.        *** Any special travel arrangements (i.e., stopovers, travel to different location, extended stays) require prior approval from the Office of Summer Programs.***         Please follow the guidelines below:        1.   Directors/Faculty/PA &amp; RA place a reservation on hold with a travel agent.      2.   Program staff must provide travel reservation to Department Administrator.    3.   The Department Administrator will make sure the person requesting the flight is approved for airfare on the program budget provided by the Office of Summer Programs.     ** Please call the Fiscal Office if a ticket is being purchased before your department receives the budget spreadsheet.**     4.   The Department Administrator will forward copy of the travel reservation to the Fiscal Office for approval prior to payment.     5.   Once approval has been granted, the Administrator will provide payment to the travel agent using the Department\u2019s AMEX BTA.     6.   Once the final itinerary and flight receipt arrives, the Administrator will review it and send copies of both to the Office of Summer Programs.     7.   When the Administrator receives the Department\u2019s AMEX BTA bill showing the charge for the purchased flight, the Administrator will prepare the Business Payment Form (BUS5000) using the summer program\u2019s chartfield and respective Q number and attach the AMEX BTA bill along with a copy of the final itinerary confirmation. Please submit all paperwork directly to the Office of Summer Programs for signature.    8.   Fiscal will submit signed paperwork to Accounts Payable for payment to AMEX BTA and will forward a copy to the department.        ALL PROGRAM STAFF TRAVELING ABROAD MUST RETAIN TICKET STUBS AND BOARDING PASSES FROM THEIR FLIGHTS AND RETURN THEM TO THE OFFICE OF SUMMER PROGRAMS.         Alternatively, if program staff book and pay for their ticket themselves, the Office of Summer Programs can reimburse them, but only once travel is completed and they must provide their boarding passes and all original receipts.    Important Note: This is not the preferred method of payment.        Note on Airfare budgets:  We have used the standard economy round trip airfare to each location when projecting the budget. Actual airfare may be slightly higher or lower, but if it is significantly higher than the given projection (more than $200), our office must review the cost for approval.
