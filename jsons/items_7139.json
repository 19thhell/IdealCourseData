Our goal is to study the national economy in a way that situates basic economic insights in a political and historical context in order to fully understand the legislative and institutional environment in which policy decisions are made; and existing programs, policies, and outcomes, such as the Social Security Program, state and federal welfare programs, the &quot;death&quot; tax, the Federal Reserve's Quantitative Easing (QE) initiatives, and the $1.1 trillion budget deficit.

Why is government intervention so controversial in the United States? In this course students will learn how an economy functions at the macroeconomic level while also learning about the structure of the U.S. government and the way that the political process shapes economic policies. Our goal is to study the national economy in a way that situates basic economic insights in a political and historical context in order to fully understand the legislative and institutional environment in which policy decisions are made; and existing programs, policies, and outcomes, such as the Social Security Program, state and federal welfare programs, the &quot;death&quot; tax, the Federal Reserve's Quantitative Easing (QE) initiatives, and the $1.1 trillion budget deficit.
