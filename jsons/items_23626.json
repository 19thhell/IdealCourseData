Designed in the Practitioner-Scholar Model, the Program consists of three tracks and aims to facilitate a smooth transition from doctoral study to professional functioning, teaching advanced clinical skills that integrate theory and practice. Interns in all tracks carry caseloads of adults, adolescents, children, groups and families.   The Adult Psychology Track provides broad-based training in a variety of clinical modalities with a wide demographic range of patients.   The Child and Adolescent Psychology Track combines training in child and adolescent cognitive-behavioral, evidence-based therapies with clinical experiences treating adults.   The Forensic Psychology Track combines the resources of Bellevue Hospital Center and Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, providing exposure to the wide range of clinical issues unique to forensic psychology.   All psychology interns, regardless of track, obtain advanced training in assessment, diagnosis, and numerous intervention and treatment modalities. The Program is dedicated to upholding the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct.   The NYU-Bellevue clinical population is extremely diverse, including individuals from an array of cultures, ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations and socio-economic levels. The Program deeply respects and attends to the many cultural issues that come into play when working with so broad a population.   All interns have opportunities to gain expertise in areas including childhood development, adolescent behavior, individual adult psychotherapy, neuropsychology, health psychology, inpatient and outpatient assessment and treatment, as well as family and group psychotherapy. Supervision of psychotherapy is conducted according to numerous theoretical orientations including brief dynamic, cognitive, behavioral, and psychodynamic.   The Program takes pride in its long and distinguished history of training fine psychologists who make valuable contributions to clinical, academic, research and public policy arenas, both nationally and internationally.

The clinical population served by the FSP includes traditional as well as non-traditional families and couples. Through the FSP interns gain didactic and theoretical instruction as well as direct and indirect clinical experience in family and couples therapy. Each intern participates on a team with at least two other supervisees: another intern and, frequently, a child/adolescent psychiatry fellow. Two senior supervisors work with each team in an intensive supervisory model. Each intern will have the opportunity to be the primary therapist or co-therapist on a case, as well as a member of the observing team on their colleagues\u2019 cases. Sessions are conducted in front of a one-way mirror, and the \u2018live\u2019 supervision transpires as the session occurs, providing immediate feedback to the therapist. Such supervision typically consists of telephone call-ins during the session, inter-session conferences with supervisors and colleagues, and occasional co-therapy with a supervisor. As team members, interns actively participate in their colleagues\u2019 cases through pre- and post-session discussion and the \u2018reflecting team\u2019 process.     The theoretical orientation of the family program is systemic at base, but integrative and collaborative as it incorporates new developments in the field and the expanding resources of the Child Study Center. General orientation to family therapy theory and technique is provided to all interns through scheduled seminars early in the year.     The FSP also provides interns with training in PREP\u00ae (Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program). PREP\u00ae is a workshop-based preventive program for all couples, including non-traditional and GLBTQ couples, who are interested in enhancing the quality of their relationship and learning skills to improve communication and problem-solving. Interns who elect to receive this training will have the opportunity to serve as coaches for couples during one of the one-day PREP\u00ae workshops held over the course of the year.

Designed in the Practitioner-Scholar Model, the Program consists of three tracks and aims to facilitate a smooth transition from doctoral study to professional functioning, teaching advanced clinical skills that integrate theory and practice. Interns in all tracks carry caseloads of adults, adolescents, children, groups and families.   The Adult Psychology Track provides broad-based training in a variety of clinical modalities with a wide demographic range of patients.   The Child and Adolescent Psychology Track combines training in child and adolescent cognitive-behavioral, evidence-based therapies with clinical experiences treating adults.   The Forensic Psychology Track combines the resources of Bellevue Hospital Center and Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, providing exposure to the wide range of clinical issues unique to forensic psychology.   All psychology interns, regardless of track, obtain advanced training in assessment, diagnosis, and numerous intervention and treatment modalities. The Program is dedicated to upholding the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct.   The NYU-Bellevue clinical population is extremely diverse, including individuals from an array of cultures, ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations and socio-economic levels. The Program deeply respects and attends to the many cultural issues that come into play when working with so broad a population.   All interns have opportunities to gain expertise in areas including childhood development, adolescent behavior, individual adult psychotherapy, neuropsychology, health psychology, inpatient and outpatient assessment and treatment, as well as family and group psychotherapy. Supervision of psychotherapy is conducted according to numerous theoretical orientations including brief dynamic, cognitive, behavioral, and psychodynamic.   The Program takes pride in its long and distinguished history of training fine psychologists who make valuable contributions to clinical, academic, research and public policy arenas, both nationally and internationally.

The Adult Psychology Track provides broad-based training in a variety of clinical modalities with a wide demographic range of patients.   The Child and Adolescent Psychology Track combines training in child and adolescent cognitive-behavioral, evidence-based therapies with clinical experiences treating adults.   The Forensic Psychology Track combines the resources of Bellevue Hospital Center and Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, providing exposure to the wide range of clinical issues unique to forensic psychology.   All psychology interns, regardless of track, obtain advanced training in assessment, diagnosis, and numerous intervention and treatment modalities. The Program is dedicated to upholding the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct.   The NYU-Bellevue clinical population is extremely diverse, including individuals from an array of cultures, ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations and socio-economic levels. The Program deeply respects and attends to the many cultural issues that come into play when working with so broad a population.   All interns have opportunities to gain expertise in areas including childhood development, adolescent behavior, individual adult psychotherapy, neuropsychology, health psychology, inpatient and outpatient assessment and treatment, as well as family and group psychotherapy. Supervision of psychotherapy is conducted according to numerous theoretical orientations including brief dynamic, cognitive, behavioral, and psychodynamic.   The Program takes pride in its long and distinguished history of training fine psychologists who make valuable contributions to clinical, academic, research and public policy arenas, both nationally and internationally.

Clinical and supervisory experiences include psychotherapy with individuals, groups, children and adolescents, families and couples as well as a rigorous psychopharmacology curriculum and outpatient psychopharmacology practice. Our varied training sites provide a rich opportunity to treat a diverse outpatient population that includes patients of all ages and from a broad spectrum of socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. All residents are based at Bellevue Hospital Center's Adult Mental Health Clinic and also see patients and perform new evaluations at the NYU Behavioral Health Program. In addition, residents treat patients at the New York University Counseling Service at Washington Square, and at the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System Outpatient Mental Health Clinic.   PGY\u00a0III Course Curriculum   Bellevue Hospital Center's Adult Mental Health Clinic   The Adult Mental Health Clinic at Bellevue Hospital Center is the major training site for residents training in ambulatory psychiatry. Under close supervision, residents treat a broad spectrum of patients in need of outpatient psychiatric care, ranging from the severely and persistently mentally ill to high functioning patients. The clinic provides state-of-the-art psychopharmacology, incorporating the most recent treatment developments in the field. Residents are trained in a variety of psychotherapeutic modalities including psychodynamic, cognitive, supportive, individual, family, brief, group and dialectical behavioral therapies. Residents work in a multi-disciplinary treatment environment, co-leading groups with psychology interns (from the NYU Psychology Internship) and working with social workers and nursing staff.   The Bellevue clinic is staffed with NYU faculty members, experienced in the different treatment modalities, who provide direct supervision to all trainees. The clinic has many didactic opportunities, and residents participate in weekly case conferences.   The Adult Mental Health Clinic at Bellevue is primarily committed to serving the community and patients who are seen in the other Bellevue clinics. Due to its close affiliation with New York University, the Bellevue clinic also serves patients referred by the NYU Student Health Center. Patients are also referred from the NYU Survivor of Torture Clinic and from homeless agencies throughout the city.   Interested residents can also elect to participate in the Bilingual Treatment Program, which provides therapy, groups and medications to mono-lingual Spanish speaking patients.   NYU Behavioral Health Program at NYU Langone Medical Center   The NYU Behavioral Health Program provides an opportunity for residents to learn about and gain experience in the clinical, administrative, and fiscal issues facing psychiatrists in a private practice setting. From initial telephone contact and triage with patients, to determinations of the most appropriate treatment and the provision of a wide range of therapies, residents become exposed to a diversity of assessment and treatment options, within a private practice model.   Most patients (approximately 65%) have mood disorders, often with concomitant Axis II pathology. The rest have other psychotic disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, ADHD and adjustment disorders. Approximately 90% of the patients are treated in psychotherapy, including psychodynamic, cognitive/behavioral and supportive treatments, either with or without pharmacotherapy. The remaining 10% are receiving primary pharmacotherapy.   The New York University Counseling and Behavioral Health Service   All residents spend one half-day per week, for six months, at this mental health clinic, which serves NYU undergraduate and graduate students. The Counseling and Behavioral Health Service provides assessment, crisis intervention, short-term dynamic and supportive treatments, and psychopharmacological management of patients.   The VA New York Harbor Healthcare System Outpatient Mental Health Clinic   All residents spend one half-day per week, for six months, at this mental health clinic, which treats veterans. Residents learn about the full range of issues confronting military personnel returning from combat, and develop an awareness of the different services within the VA, including residential facilities for PTSD and substance abuse, military sexual trauma counseling services, and readjustment programs for veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq.   Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinic at Bellevue Hospital Center   The Bellevue Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinic is a New York State licensed program that serves children between the ages of 2 and 17 years with a variety of psychiatric problems. The clinic offers many types of treatment, including play therapy, psychodynamic therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, supportive therapy, psychopharmacology, behavior management, parent education and group therapy. Some of the special programs in the clinic are a Psychopharmacology Clinic, a Therapeutic Group for Pre-schoolers, an Early Latency Age Social Skills Group, medication groups, and parent education groups. There is also a special education program for grades 3 to 12 located onsite (P811M); many of the students attending this school receive weekly individual therapy and group therapy though the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinic. Third year residents carry one child and one adolescent case, with an option to carry these patients into the fourth year of training.   Child and Adolescent Outpatient Experience   The outpatient child and adolescent clinical experience is yearlong and is based at the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinic at Bellevue Hospital Center. Each resident is assigned both a child and an adolescent case for on-going treatment. In addition, every resident learns about child &amp; adolescent psychiatric evaluations by participating in new child &amp; adolescent clinic evaluations and pediatric emergency room evaluations in Bellevue Hospital's pediatric CPEP. During these evaluations, the residents are directly supervised by an attending in the child and adolescent psychiatry department.   Group and Family Therapy   Residents run groups at the multiple teaching sites. Group experiences available to NYU residents include Women\u2019s groups, HIV-positive groups, groups in the Survivors of Torture Program, and substance abuse groups. Groups are co-led with a member of the psychology faculty.   Residents also have a family therapy experience based at Bellevue Hospital Center, with expert supervisors from the renowned Ackerman Institute for the Family .   Supervision   All PGY III residents receive weekly supervision in psychopharmacology, dynamic psychotherapy, supportive and supportive-expressive psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, child and adolescent psychiatry, substance abuse, group and family work.   Didactics   In the PGY III year, classes in the core didactic curriculum are held on Wednesday mornings in 4 hours of protected time, yearlong. Classes focus on out-patient evaluation and a variety of treatment modalities including psychopharmacology, cognitive behavioral therapy, dynamic and interpersonal psychotherapies, group, family therapy and sex therapy, and therapies for severe personality disorders. In addition, there are classes in cultural and gender issues in psychiatry, out-patient substance abuse, forensics and neuropsychiatry.   There is also a weekly Monday teaching conference in which each resident presents a case that is on-going. An attending faculty expert interviews the patient in front of the resident class. In addition, there are conferences dedicated to the evaluation process, split treatment, resident research and morbidity and mortality conferences discussing untoward outcomes to improve future care.   Medical Student Teaching   In either the PGY III or IV year, all residents are required to lead a six week small group seminar with preclinical NYU medical students, introducing them to their first patient-interviewing experience.   On-Call   The on-call obligation in the PGY III year is twice per month overnight in July and August. From September through June, residents take call in a night-float system. On-call residents cover consultations and psychiatric emergencies at Tisch Hospital and at Bellevue Hospital Center. Each resident is on \"short-call\" one weeknight every four weeks. Night float averages to three weeks over the course of the year.   Vacation   Residents are entitled to four weeks of vacation during their PGY-III year.
