For any student applying for transfer admission in the first semester of the freshman year of college/university, the focus of our evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance.          Because our applicants come from a broad range of secondary schools around the world, we understand that the options available to students will vary widely based on the schools they attend. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools:   4 years of English with a heavy emphasis on writing;  3-4 years of history/social studies;  3-4 years of mathematics;  3-4 years of laboratory sciences; and  3-4 years of a foreign language.   Students who are highly competitive for admission will choose the most demanding coursework available in their schools, with four years in each of the subjects above.     Proof of Graduation  Admitted students must provide the Office of Undergraduate Admissions with proof of graduation by July 1 of the year they plan to enroll. Extensions will only be granted for international students who attend schools that operate on a different academic calendar. In all cases, proof of graduation must be provided prior to beginning the first semester of classes at NYU.   The following documents serve as proof of secondary school graduation:       A final high school transcript submitted directly from the student\u2019s school. We will not accept a high school transcript submitted by the student. The final high school transcript must show the date of graduation.   Results from the General Education Development (GED) Test. Click here for more information about obtaining a GED.     Original or officially certified copies of nationally recognized high school graduation examination results, such as the Advanced Level General Certificate of Education or the International Baccalaureate Diploma.     A homeschool diploma, a certificate of completion of a homeschool program that is considered the equivalent of a high school diploma in the applicant's home state, or GED test results as listed above.       Final transcripts may be submitted by a school official through the Common Application website. All hardcopy materials should bear an official stamp, be signed and mailed from a student's school in a sealed envelope to:   New York University  Office of Undergraduate Admissions  665 Broadway, 11th Floor  New York, New York 10012  USA.   Documents may also be emailed to admissions.ops@nyu.edu but must still bear an official stamp, come from a school official, and be sent from an official school email address.

For any student applying for transfer admission in the first semester of the freshman year of college/university, the focus of our evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance.          Because our applicants come from a broad range of secondary schools around the world, we understand that the options available to students will vary widely based on the schools they attend. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools:   4 years of English with a heavy emphasis on writing;  3-4 years of history/social studies;  3-4 years of mathematics;  3-4 years of laboratory sciences; and  3-4 years of a foreign language.   Students who are highly competitive for admission will choose the most demanding coursework available in their schools, with four years in each of the subjects above.     Proof of Graduation  Admitted students must provide the Office of Undergraduate Admissions with proof of graduation by July 1 of the year they plan to enroll. Extensions will only be granted for international students who attend schools that operate on a different academic calendar. In all cases, proof of graduation must be provided prior to beginning the first semester of classes at NYU.   The following documents serve as proof of secondary school graduation:       A final high school transcript submitted directly from the student\u2019s school. We will not accept a high school transcript submitted by the student. The final high school transcript must show the date of graduation.   Results from the General Education Development (GED) Test. Click here for more information about obtaining a GED.     Original or officially certified copies of nationally recognized high school graduation examination results, such as the Advanced Level General Certificate of Education or the International Baccalaureate Diploma.     A homeschool diploma, a certificate of completion of a homeschool program that is considered the equivalent of a high school diploma in the applicant's home state, or GED test results as listed above.       Final transcripts may be submitted by a school official through the Common Application website. All hardcopy materials should bear an official stamp, be signed and mailed from a student's school in a sealed envelope to:   New York University  Office of Undergraduate Admissions  665 Broadway, 11th Floor  New York, New York 10012  USA.   Documents may also be emailed to admissions.ops@nyu.edu but must still bear an official stamp, come from a school official, and be sent from an official school email address.

Students in the master's degree program with appropriate mathematical background may take their graduate mathematics courses at NYU's world-renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.    We have two master's degree options:       An initial certification for teaching middle school and high school mathematics. This program requires 43 points.    A professional certification for teaching middle school and high school mathematics for those who already meet the requirements for initial secondary mathematics certification in the state of New York.       Members of the mathematics education faculty have been, and continue to be, active at the highest levels of professional associations and in current areas of professional research. In this capacity, they encourage and support students in the programs to become actively involved in both professional activities and ongoing research projects. Program faculty also serve as the directors and coordinators of numerous teacher training and research projects in which students in the Mathematics Education program are able to participate. Current research activities of the mathematics education faculty listed on their websites. The current faculty include:       Anne Burgunder - Master Teacher in Mathematics Education    Jasmine Ma - Assistant Professor in Mathematics Education    Orit Zaslavsky - Professor of Mathematics Education       Financial Aid Opportunities    NYU Steinhardt offers generous scholarships for full-time MA study.    Career Opportunities    Our graduates have many career opportunities open to them both within and outside the academic community here and abroad. These include the teaching of mathematics and related subjects (including computer science) at all levels from secondary school through college; serving as a mathematics specialist or coordinator in a school or a school district; training new teachers in a college or university; and working in the private sector as a trainer or a specialist in an area of applied mathematics.

For any student applying for transfer admission in the first semester of the freshman year of college/university, the focus of our evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance.          Because our applicants come from a broad range of secondary schools around the world, we understand that the options available to students will vary widely based on the schools they attend. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools:   4 years of English with a heavy emphasis on writing;  3-4 years of history/social studies;  3-4 years of mathematics;  3-4 years of laboratory sciences; and  3-4 years of a foreign language.   Students who are highly competitive for admission will choose the most demanding coursework available in their schools, with four years in each of the subjects above.     Proof of Graduation  Admitted students must provide the Office of Undergraduate Admissions with proof of graduation by July 1 of the year they plan to enroll. Extensions will only be granted for international students who attend schools that operate on a different academic calendar. In all cases, proof of graduation must be provided prior to beginning the first semester of classes at NYU.   The following documents serve as proof of secondary school graduation:       A final high school transcript submitted directly from the student\u2019s school. We will not accept a high school transcript submitted by the student. The final high school transcript must show the date of graduation.   Results from the General Education Development (GED) Test. Click here for more information about obtaining a GED.     Original or officially certified copies of nationally recognized high school graduation examination results, such as the Advanced Level General Certificate of Education or the International Baccalaureate Diploma.     A homeschool diploma, a certificate of completion of a homeschool program that is considered the equivalent of a high school diploma in the applicant's home state, or GED test results as listed above.       Final transcripts may be submitted by a school official through the Common Application website. All hardcopy materials should bear an official stamp, be signed and mailed from a student's school in a sealed envelope to:   New York University  Office of Undergraduate Admissions  665 Broadway, 11th Floor  New York, New York 10012  USA.

For any student applying for transfer admission in the first semester of the freshman year of college/university, the focus of our evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance.          Because our applicants come from a broad range of secondary schools around the world, we understand that the options available to students will vary widely based on the schools they attend. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools:   4 years of English with a heavy emphasis on writing;  3-4 years of history/social studies;  3-4 years of mathematics;  3-4 years of laboratory sciences; and  3-4 years of a foreign language.   Students who are highly competitive for admission will choose the most demanding coursework available in their schools, with four years in each of the subjects above.     Proof of Graduation  Admitted students must provide the Office of Undergraduate Admissions with proof of graduation by July 1 of the year they plan to enroll. Extensions will only be granted for international students who attend schools that operate on a different academic calendar. In all cases, proof of graduation must be provided prior to beginning the first semester of classes at NYU.   The following documents serve as proof of secondary school graduation:       A final high school transcript submitted directly from the student\u2019s school. We will not accept a high school transcript submitted by the student. The final high school transcript must show the date of graduation.   Results from the General Education Development (GED) Test. Click here for more information about obtaining a GED.     Original or officially certified copies of nationally recognized high school graduation examination results, such as the Advanced Level General Certificate of Education or the International Baccalaureate Diploma.     A homeschool diploma, a certificate of completion of a homeschool program that is considered the equivalent of a high school diploma in the applicant's home state, or GED test results as listed above.       Final transcripts may be submitted by a school official through the Common Application website. All hardcopy materials should bear an official stamp, be signed and mailed from a student's school in a sealed envelope to:   New York University  Office of Undergraduate Admissions  665 Broadway, 11th Floor  New York, New York 10012  USA.   Documents may also be emailed to admissions.ops@nyu.edu but must still bear an official stamp, come from a school official, and be sent from an official school email address.

Students in the master's degree program with appropriate mathematical background may take their graduate mathematics courses at NYU's world-renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.    We have two master's degree options:       An initial certification for teaching middle school and high school mathematics. This program requires 43 points.    A professional certification for teaching middle school and high school mathematics for those who already meet the requirements for initial secondary mathematics certification in the state of New York.       Members of the mathematics education faculty have been, and continue to be, active at the highest levels of professional associations and in current areas of professional research. In this capacity, they encourage and support students in the programs to become actively involved in both professional activities and ongoing research projects. Program faculty also serve as the directors and coordinators of numerous teacher training and research projects in which students in the Mathematics Education program are able to participate. Current research activities of the mathematics education faculty listed on their websites. The current faculty include:       Anne Burgunder - Master Teacher in Mathematics Education    Jasmine Ma - Assistant Professor in Mathematics Education    Orit Zaslavsky - Professor of Mathematics Education       Financial Aid Opportunities    NYU Steinhardt offers generous scholarships for full-time MA study.    Career Opportunities    Our graduates have many career opportunities open to them both within and outside the academic community here and abroad. These include the teaching of mathematics and related subjects (including computer science) at all levels from secondary school through college; serving as a mathematics specialist or coordinator in a school or a school district; training new teachers in a college or university; and working in the private sector as a trainer or a specialist in an area of applied mathematics.
