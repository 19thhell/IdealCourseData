These Spanish Civil War veterans recognized the importance of preserving the history of the role of North American volunteers. They formed the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives organization ( ALBA ) and began to collect letters, writings, oral histories, photographs, posters, artifacts, and ephemera that would preserve this history and contextualize it within the ongoing struggle for radical social change. The Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives Collection was initially deposited with Brandeis University. In December, 2000 it was relocated to New York University's Tamiment Library.    The core of the archive is the roughly 300 individual collections documenting the life stories of Lincoln Brigade and Medical Bureau volunteers. Soldiers, nurses, and doctors are represented in these collections which contain documentation on approximately 10% of the U.S. volunteers who fought in Spain. There are also more than 10,000 photographs, 200 full color posters, postcards, oral history interviews, biographical materials, radio scripts, and artifacts (buttons, badges, uniforms, and a rifle).    The Tamiment Library continues to build the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives, and is always interested in hearing from families and friends of volunteers, as well as researchers and collectors who may have relevant material to contribute to the archives.    The following research tools are available to assist with access to the ALBA collections in the Tamiment Library. Follow the links to electronic finding aids, where available.    ALBA Collections List     An alphabetically arranged Collections List of the archival, audio, video, photograph, printed ephemera (called vertical files here), and non-print ALBA collections with links to electronic finding aids or brief collection descriptions.    ALBA Bibliography   Consult this selected bibliography to find books useful for research on the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.    Pamphlets    The Tamiment Library holds tens of thousands of pamphlets in its collections. Three individual pamphlet collections within those holdings relate to the Spanish Civil War and the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. See the library's Pamphlets Research Guide to learn about these materials.    ALBA Vertical Files   The ALBA Vertical Files are a rich source for background information on the people, events and topics related to the ALBA collections in the Tamiment Library and include coverage of the International Brigades as well. The files contain a variety of documents such as newspaper clippings, flyers, brochures, biographical material, anniversary and exhibit programs, obituaries, and other items. The materials are divided into two separate collections:     1) The ALBA Vertical File on Individuals collection contains biographical material related to specific people.     2) The ALBA Vertical File on Subjects contains material related to topics and events.    Posters    A selection of ca. 35 Spanish posters from Tamiment's collections which were produced by different (and sometimes opposing) leftist political parties, labor unions, and other organizations that supported the Spanish Republican government during Spain's Civil War from 1936 to 1938, have been digitized and are on display via ARTstor (available to NYU-affiliated researchers only). Selected posters and other images are also featured in online exhibits via the Tamiment website. Some, but not all, of these digitized images may be reproduced.    International Brigades Archive (Moscow)    At the end of the Spanish Civil War the administrative records of the International Brigades were taken to Moscow so that they would not be seized by Franco. They are deposited in the Russian State Archive for Social and Political History where they form part of the Comintern Archive. Sections of the IB records relating to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade were microfilmed for ALBA and the microfilm is now part of the collection at NYU. These administrative records of the International Unit and Brigades of the Spanish Republican Army include: selected files of the Military Commission, Communist Party organizations (Spanish and international), official military bulletins, records relating to: command and headquarters, mail service and censorship, transport, supplies, training, and prisoners. These records document the way the Abraham Lincoln Brigade was organized and functioned, its relationships with other international brigades, its political organizations, and relations with Spain's Republican government.    See the International Brigades Archive (Moscow): Collection Guide , a translation of the original Russian-language guide, which describes the International Brigades Records comprising Fond 545 of the Comintern Archives in Moscow, for additional information.    The U.S. personnel files are included on the microfilm. Many of these include detailed questionnaires filled out by individual volunteers, and some contain photographs. Files may also include employment records, reports on illnesses and injuries, IB documents and communications, and copies of correspondence with family, friends, and fellow volunteers.    See the U.S. Personnel Files Names Index, an alphabetical list of the American Personnel Files in Fond 545, Opis 6 (Files 855-1019) of the Comintern Archives in Moscow, which is available in three binders at the Reference Desk in the Tamiment Library.

This course has three related primary objectives. First, it will introduce students to key issues in translation theory, analyzing proposals by key authors who reflect on the study of translation and its practical implications. Second, it will explore the practical consequences which these theoretical reflections have for the practice of translation. To this end, students will translate selected texts to test the impact\u2014or not\u2014of the theoretical proposals of the translation theorists studied. Finally, students will put theory and practice together through analysis and discussion of the practical application of translation theory to literary and non-literary translation.    Pragmatics and Second Language Acquisition and Instruction    SPAN-GA 9105 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course provides an introduction to the theoretical foundations of pragmatics as well as its application to second language acquisition and instruction, mainly in Spanish. Speech act theory, cooperation and relevance principles, and politeness theory will be analyzed cross-culturally. After examining the different features of verbal and non-verbal communication, as well as the characteristics of intercultural environments, students will then work on analyzing Interlanguage pragmatics: the non-native speaker's use and acquisition of pragmatic knowledge in a second language. Methodology includes individual presentations, practical activities, readings with assigned tasks, and a final paper.    History, Geography, and Politics of the Spanish Language    SPAN-GA 9106 Required of all students for the concentration in Applied Linguistics. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course provides an overview of the history, geography, and politics of the Spanish language from its origins to today: its Latin roots and characteristics in comparison to other Romance languages, its territorial expansion throughout the Iberian Peninsula and the world, its geographic and social variations and their distribution, and questions of identity and politics when Spanish comes into contact and competition with other languages. The course aims to equip students with the analytical tools needed for study in the fields of historical linguistics, dialectology, sociolinguistics, and linguistic policy.    Applied Linguistics: A Survey of Issues in the Study of Language, Language Learning, and Translation    SPAN-GA 9107 Required of all students for the concentration in Applied Linguistics. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This introductory course will provide a survey of the development of applied linguistics from the late 1960s to the present, as well as an overview of new trends in academic research. The course is divided into three modules, each taught by a specialist, that represent three key areas within the field of applied linguistics: 1) An introduction to social and psychological aspects of the study of language; 2) Language learning: how language systems are cognitively internalized and taught; and 3) An overview of applied linguistics in translation studies and theory. The course aims to provide students with the relevant theoretical frameworks needed to pursue these three key areas of linguistic study at graduate level.    Stylistics and Semantics of Written Spanish    SPAN-GA 9108 4 points. 2013-14. The main objective of this course is to reinforce the linguistic foundations for advanced students of Spanish, aiming to improve communicative competence through a systematic study of grammatical, discursive, and pragmatic systems together with a practical study of form, function and usage in Spanish. Students will gain practice on several levels as well as guidance for their own language teaching through: 1) advanced grammar review, with special emphasis on difficult points for native English speakers, 2) identification of different grammatical structures in literary texts and journalism, allowing students to provide their own examples from other course materials, 3) a broadening of students' mastery of Spanish with specific exercises and writing activities based on textual models.    Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language    SPAN-GA 9201 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course comprises a weekly three-hour seminar combined with observations of \"Spanish as a second language (ELE)\" classes from NYU Madrid's undergraduate program. The practical component is supplemented through English Teaching Assistantships in local schools. All seminars are developed through lectures, peer commentary, and practical examples providing an overview of theories in pedagogy to be elaborated upon in future coursework. Students will prepare didactic activities, a teaching portfolio with a Statement of Teaching Philosophy, and a final written work for the course, as well as share their work with their peers in oral presentations in Spanish. Seminars will cover the following aspects of language teaching: communicative competence; new approaches to teaching grammar; acquisition of pragmatic competence; teaching culture and intercultural issues; the development of different linguistic skills (auditory, oral, written, reading comprehension); correction of errors; and language level assessment. The hours allocated to fieldwork include student collection and analysis of field data.    Applied Methodology for Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language    SPAN-GA 9202 4 points. 2013-14. This course follows the Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language course offered in the Fall semester as a continued study of materials, approaches, and techniques used to teach language skills to second and foreign language learners while applying language acquisition theories to practice. In addition, this course emphasizes practical issues of day-to-day lesson planning to develop teaching skills, plus different methods for promoting student motivation and positive reinforcement through classroom communication. All students will observe one another's student teaching and subsequently discuss the experience together in class. A range of 3 undergraduate courses at NYU Madrid\u2014at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels\u2014will be used to offer the MA students teaching experience.    Advanced Workshop in Contemporary Hispanic Issues    SPAN-GA 9203 4 points. 2013-14. This course aims to improve Spanish language fluency and accuracy through the study of political and social issues in the Spanish-speaking world today. Through the study of contemporary issues in Latin America and Spain the course is designed to familiarize future teachers with ways of addressing cultural issues in a language context in the classroom.    Hispanic Dialectology and Sociolinguistics    SPAN-GA 9208 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course provides a comprehensive overview of different factors that influence geographic and sociolinguistic variation in Spanish. In addition to geographic variation, students will explore gender- and age-based linguistic differences, as well as sociolinguistic variants due to social and cultural factors in Spain, Latin America, and the United States. Students will be introduced to theoretical and methodological concepts of dialectal, social, and linguistic variants in research on language contact. Through this analysis, the course will explore language as a source of cultural identity. Students will conduct their own research on specific varieties of Spanish and their social context for a final paper and will be expected to present a portion of this material and participate actively in class discussions.    Translation of Literary, Legal, Medical, and Business Texts    SPAN-GA 9301 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course aims to introduce students to translation theory by working through relevant readings and, above all, practical exercises in translating literary, legal, medical and business texts. In this way, students will become familiar with the use of translation instruments (dictionaries, maps, etc.) and translation techniques (borrowing, the decision to translate proper nouns, transposition, etc.), confronting problems associated with both direct and inverse translation. These include: translating groups and clich\u00e9s; differences in customs, civilization, and culture; literal\" translation; adaptations; and casual and intentional historical allusions. Throughout the course students will have the opportunity to work on different kinds of texts related to Spain and Latin America.    Cervantes: Don Quijote    SPAN-GA 9472 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The Quijote is one of the most renowned and read works in the world, and its ability to generate critical literature seems to have no limits. In Cervantes' work, the reader assumes the role of interpreter, with both writing and reading subjected to revisions which transform the idea of literature and the fiction it represents. Students will address questions posed by the critical canon and recent studies: the Quijote as the first modern novel; its transgression of works that came before it; its inscription in a category of burlesque, humorous literature; its ability to appropriate nearly all literary models from its time. The course will situate Cervantes within the history of ideas in order to approach vital questions such as the ethical value of good intentions resolved with negative effects; the construction of identity; the dispersion and agony of the subject; reality conceived as a limitless text; the function of objects and their nominalization.    Introduction to Textual Criticism    SPAN-GA 9555 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course aims to provide students with a graduate-level introduction to criticism by studying Spanish and Latin American texts and writing analytical academic essays. The course analyzes texts from different eras in diverse literary genres (narrative, poetry, theater &amp; essay), as well as film and other contemporary cultural practices, applying different analytical tools and literary, film, and cultural theory.    Applied Phonetics and Spoken Contemporary Spanish    SPAN-GA 9556 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The objective of this course is to introduce students to the study of Spanish phonology and phonetics in order to analyze various features of spoken Spanish. The course will also explore the current state of teaching phonetics in second language acquisition and the linguistic disciplines in which phonetics proves to be a useful tool to study language. The course has both theoretical and practical components that include analyzing the distinct features of the sound systems of peninsular and American variants of spoken Spanish, allowing students to distinguish regional and social varieties of the language.    History, Memory, and Nostalgia in Contemporary Spain    SPAN-GA 9833 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The course will examine the profound imprint left by the history of Spain in the first half of the 20thcentury on the consolidation\u2014or not\u2014of a Spanish identity after the 1960s. It begins with representations in film and novels of the unresolved or unprocessed past of the Spanish Civil War. After examining the dialog between fiction and history in the \"historiographic metafiction\" of the Transition, it turns to the role of memory in cultural production, paying attention to the political debate on the recuperation of historical memory. It concludes by analyzing the nostalgic transformation of the past in the television series Cu\u00e9ntame c\u00f3mo pas\u00f3. The course aims to develop an understanding of the production and consumption of culture as a site of social action and intervention, through which power relations are established and potentially unsettled. Materials studied will include theoretical readings, cinema, television, fiction and journalism.    Photography: A Critical History    SPAN-GA 9847 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The course offers an introduction to the history of photography, from the invention of the medium to the present. The course is subdivided into a chronological study of artists, schools and genres. Interdisciplinary approaches to the studied material are encouraged through reading assignments in contemporary and critical thought (Barthes, Benjamin, Burgin, Krauss, Sontag, among others), as well as formal approaches. Literary and aesthetic texts related to the images will be read in order to examine the historical &amp; social conditions of photography from a contemporary perspective. Other topics addressed are genre studies, the relationship between text &amp; image, etc. After a general introduction on the study of form, class discussion will focus on case studies of photographic production in its historical context. The theoretical classes will be followed by mandatory practical sessions at the Reina Sof\u00eda and other museums or institutions.    Cultural History of Spain    SPAN-GA 9945 Required of all students for the concentration in Literary and Cultural Studies. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course, divided into three modules, each taught by a different specialist, aims to provide an overview of critical concepts and debates in Hispanic studies through an interdisciplinary approach to the study of Spanish culture from the Middle Ages to the present. Visits to research centers, museums, and urban spaces in Madrid form an integral part of the program of studies. The modules are: I. The Multicultural Middle Ages; II. Early Modern Bodies; III. Modernization and the City.    Cultural History of Latin America    SPAN-GA 9946 Required of all students for the concentration in Literary and Cultural Studies. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15.

Film screenings and visits to museums and research centers in Madrid form an integral part of the program of studies. The modules are: I. Transculturation and Colonialism; II. The Nation and its Discontents; III. Postmodernity, Mass Culture, and the Media.    Research Skills Workshop    SPAN-GA 9825 Required of all students. 2 points. 2013-14, 2014-15.    Literary Encounters: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Medieval Spain    SPAN-GA 9966 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course aims to study the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian cultural heritage of Medieval Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on the contributions of Muslims, Christians, and Jews on Spanish Literature, the history of Spain, religion, philosophy, and the arts and sciences. A large part of the course will be dedicated to a comparative study among these contributions. We will also analyze the social circumstance of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in both Christian and Muslim contexts as well as the roles women played in both. The course will also analyze the problems of integration in al-Andalus and Christian Spain, as well as break from the convivencia, the Inquisition, the expulsion of the Jews, and the end of Muslim rule in 1492. Particular attention will be paid to questions of identity in minority groups in a multicultural environment. In class we will analyze, comment and discuss primary sources translated into Spanish, from each one of the three cultures, as well as documents from the era.    Literature &amp; Modernity in 19th Century Latin America    SPAN-GA.9967 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course explores the relationships between literature and discourses of political and cultural modernity in nineteenth-century Latin America. Reading critical essays, short stories and novels, we will examine how writers responded, ideologically and formally, to three key challenges in the historical transformation of political independence from Spain: the construction of modern nation-states in ethnically heterogeneous societies, political and cultural decolonization, and the commodification of social relations. We will focus on the ways in which these authors received, adapted, and contested forms of European modernity; we will analyze their rhetorical strategies and will explore how they tried to resolve profound social, cultural, and economic divisions between the criollo elites and the non-white majority, as well as between men and women.    Topics in Art History: The Power of Images in Spain and Its American Viceroyalties, 16th-18th Centuries    SPAN-GA 9990 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The colonization of Spanish America in the 16th century coincided with the rise of the power of images throughout Counter-Reformation Europe. This course looks at images, and especially paintings, as instruments of persuasion on both sides of the Atlantic. Through a series of thematic units, students will learn about the various roles that images played in all spheres of life from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Special emphasis will be placed on how paintings helped forge identities, both individual and collective, and how the same types of images could transmit different ideas depending on audience and setting. The two central aims of the course are for students to gain a greater awareness of how images are not mere illustrations of history but, on the contrary, themselves construct historical discourse; and secondly, of how cultural transfer\u2014the imposition of Spanish culture on Spanish America\u2014was accompanied by complex processes of adaptation and transformation. The course will include class visits to local museums and collections, including the Prado Museum, the convent of the Descalzas Reales, and the Museo de Am\u00e9rica, preceded by a session on how museums construct history.

These Spanish Civil War veterans recognized the importance of preserving the history of the role of North American volunteers. They formed the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives organization ( ALBA ) and began to collect letters, writings, oral histories, photographs, posters, artifacts, and ephemera that would preserve this history and contextualize it within the ongoing struggle for radical social change. The Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives Collection was initially deposited with Brandeis University. In December, 2000 it was relocated to New York University's Tamiment Library.    The core of the archive is the roughly 300 individual collections documenting the life stories of Lincoln Brigade and Medical Bureau volunteers. Soldiers, nurses, and doctors are represented in these collections which contain documentation on approximately 10% of the U.S. volunteers who fought in Spain. There are also more than 10,000 photographs, 200 full color posters, postcards, oral history interviews, biographical materials, radio scripts, and artifacts (buttons, badges, uniforms, and a rifle).    The Tamiment Library continues to build the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives, and is always interested in hearing from families and friends of volunteers, as well as researchers and collectors who may have relevant material to contribute to the archives.    The following research tools are available to assist with access to the ALBA collections in the Tamiment Library. Follow the links to electronic finding aids, where available.    ALBA Collections List     An alphabetically arranged Collections List of the archival, audio, video, photograph, printed ephemera (called vertical files here), and non-print ALBA collections with links to electronic finding aids or brief collection descriptions.    ALBA Bibliography   Consult this selected bibliography to find books useful for research on the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.    Pamphlets    The Tamiment Library holds tens of thousands of pamphlets in its collections. Three individual pamphlet collections within those holdings relate to the Spanish Civil War and the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. See the library's Pamphlets Research Guide to learn about these materials.    ALBA Vertical Files   The ALBA Vertical Files are a rich source for background information on the people, events and topics related to the ALBA collections in the Tamiment Library and include coverage of the International Brigades as well. The files contain a variety of documents such as newspaper clippings, flyers, brochures, biographical material, anniversary and exhibit programs, obituaries, and other items. The materials are divided into two separate collections:     1) The ALBA Vertical File on Individuals collection contains biographical material related to specific people.     2) The ALBA Vertical File on Subjects contains material related to topics and events.    Posters    A selection of ca. 35 Spanish posters from Tamiment's collections which were produced by different (and sometimes opposing) leftist political parties, labor unions, and other organizations that supported the Spanish Republican government during Spain's Civil War from 1936 to 1938, have been digitized and are on display via ARTstor (available to NYU-affiliated researchers only). Selected posters and other images are also featured in online exhibits via the Tamiment website. Some, but not all, of these digitized images may be reproduced.    International Brigades Archive (Moscow)    At the end of the Spanish Civil War the administrative records of the International Brigades were taken to Moscow so that they would not be seized by Franco. They are deposited in the Russian State Archive for Social and Political History where they form part of the Comintern Archive. Sections of the IB records relating to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade were microfilmed for ALBA and the microfilm is now part of the collection at NYU. These administrative records of the International Unit and Brigades of the Spanish Republican Army include: selected files of the Military Commission, Communist Party organizations (Spanish and international), official military bulletins, records relating to: command and headquarters, mail service and censorship, transport, supplies, training, and prisoners. These records document the way the Abraham Lincoln Brigade was organized and functioned, its relationships with other international brigades, its political organizations, and relations with Spain's Republican government.    See the International Brigades Archive (Moscow): Collection Guide , a translation of the original Russian-language guide, which describes the International Brigades Records comprising Fond 545 of the Comintern Archives in Moscow, for additional information.    The U.S. personnel files are included on the microfilm. Many of these include detailed questionnaires filled out by individual volunteers, and some contain photographs. Files may also include employment records, reports on illnesses and injuries, IB documents and communications, and copies of correspondence with family, friends, and fellow volunteers.

The practical component is supplemented through English Teaching Assistantships in local schools. All seminars are developed through lectures, peer commentary, and practical examples providing an overview of theories in pedagogy to be elaborated upon in future coursework. Students will prepare didactic activities, a teaching portfolio with a Statement of Teaching Philosophy, and a final written work for the course, as well as share their work with their peers in oral presentations in Spanish. Seminars will cover the following aspects of language teaching: communicative competence; new approaches to teaching grammar; acquisition of pragmatic competence; teaching culture and intercultural issues; the development of different linguistic skills (auditory, oral, written, reading comprehension); correction of errors; and language level assessment. The hours allocated to fieldwork include student collection and analysis of field data.    Applied Methodology for Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language    SPAN-GA 9202 4 points. 2013-14. This course follows the Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language course offered in the Fall semester as a continued study of materials, approaches, and techniques used to teach language skills to second and foreign language learners while applying language acquisition theories to practice. In addition, this course emphasizes practical issues of day-to-day lesson planning to develop teaching skills, plus different methods for promoting student motivation and positive reinforcement through classroom communication. All students will observe one another's student teaching and subsequently discuss the experience together in class. A range of 3 undergraduate courses at NYU Madrid\u2014at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels\u2014will be used to offer the MA students teaching experience.    Advanced Workshop in Contemporary Hispanic Issues    SPAN-GA 9203 4 points. 2013-14.

Hispanic Dialectology and Sociolinguistics    SPAN-GA 9208 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course provides a comprehensive overview of different factors that influence geographic and sociolinguistic variation in Spanish. In addition to geographic variation, students will explore gender- and age-based linguistic differences, as well as sociolinguistic variants due to social and cultural factors in Spain, Latin America, and the United States. Students will be introduced to theoretical and methodological concepts of dialectal, social, and linguistic variants in research on language contact. Through this analysis, the course will explore language as a source of cultural identity. Students will conduct their own research on specific varieties of Spanish and their social context for a final paper and will be expected to present a portion of this material and participate actively in class discussions.    Translation of Literary, Legal, Medical, and Business Texts    SPAN-GA 9301 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course aims to introduce students to translation theory by working through relevant readings and, above all, practical exercises in translating literary, legal, medical and business texts. In this way, students will become familiar with the use of translation instruments (dictionaries, maps, etc.) and translation techniques (borrowing, the decision to translate proper nouns, transposition, etc.), confronting problems associated with both direct and inverse translation. These include: translating groups and clich\u00e9s; differences in customs, civilization, and culture; literal\" translation; adaptations; and casual and intentional historical allusions. Throughout the course students will have the opportunity to work on different kinds of texts related to Spain and Latin America.    Cervantes: Don Quijote    SPAN-GA 9472 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The Quijote is one of the most renowned and read works in the world, and its ability to generate critical literature seems to have no limits. In Cervantes' work, the reader assumes the role of interpreter, with both writing and reading subjected to revisions which transform the idea of literature and the fiction it represents. Students will address questions posed by the critical canon and recent studies: the Quijote as the first modern novel; its transgression of works that came before it; its inscription in a category of burlesque, humorous literature; its ability to appropriate nearly all literary models from its time. The course will situate Cervantes within the history of ideas in order to approach vital questions such as the ethical value of good intentions resolved with negative effects; the construction of identity; the dispersion and agony of the subject; reality conceived as a limitless text; the function of objects and their nominalization.    Introduction to Textual Criticism    SPAN-GA 9555 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course aims to provide students with a graduate-level introduction to criticism by studying Spanish and Latin American texts and writing analytical academic essays.

Applied Phonetics and Spoken Contemporary Spanish    SPAN-GA 9556 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The objective of this course is to introduce students to the study of Spanish phonology and phonetics in order to analyze various features of spoken Spanish. The course will also explore the current state of teaching phonetics in second language acquisition and the linguistic disciplines in which phonetics proves to be a useful tool to study language. The course has both theoretical and practical components that include analyzing the distinct features of the sound systems of peninsular and American variants of spoken Spanish, allowing students to distinguish regional and social varieties of the language.    History, Memory, and Nostalgia in Contemporary Spain    SPAN-GA 9833 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The course will examine the profound imprint left by the history of Spain in the first half of the 20thcentury on the consolidation\u2014or not\u2014of a Spanish identity after the 1960s. It begins with representations in film and novels of the unresolved or unprocessed past of the Spanish Civil War. After examining the dialog between fiction and history in the \"historiographic metafiction\" of the Transition, it turns to the role of memory in cultural production, paying attention to the political debate on the recuperation of historical memory. It concludes by analyzing the nostalgic transformation of the past in the television series Cu\u00e9ntame c\u00f3mo pas\u00f3. The course aims to develop an understanding of the production and consumption of culture as a site of social action and intervention, through which power relations are established and potentially unsettled. Materials studied will include theoretical readings, cinema, television, fiction and journalism.    Photography: A Critical History    SPAN-GA 9847 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The course offers an introduction to the history of photography, from the invention of the medium to the present. The course is subdivided into a chronological study of artists, schools and genres. Interdisciplinary approaches to the studied material are encouraged through reading assignments in contemporary and critical thought (Barthes, Benjamin, Burgin, Krauss, Sontag, among others), as well as formal approaches. Literary and aesthetic texts related to the images will be read in order to examine the historical &amp; social conditions of photography from a contemporary perspective. Other topics addressed are genre studies, the relationship between text &amp; image, etc. After a general introduction on the study of form, class discussion will focus on case studies of photographic production in its historical context. The theoretical classes will be followed by mandatory practical sessions at the Reina Sof\u00eda and other museums or institutions.

Literary Encounters: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Medieval Spain    SPAN-GA 9966 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course aims to study the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian cultural heritage of Medieval Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on the contributions of Muslims, Christians, and Jews on Spanish Literature, the history of Spain, religion, philosophy, and the arts and sciences. A large part of the course will be dedicated to a comparative study among these contributions. We will also analyze the social circumstance of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in both Christian and Muslim contexts as well as the roles women played in both. The course will also analyze the problems of integration in al-Andalus and Christian Spain, as well as break from the convivencia, the Inquisition, the expulsion of the Jews, and the end of Muslim rule in 1492. Particular attention will be paid to questions of identity in minority groups in a multicultural environment. In class we will analyze, comment and discuss primary sources translated into Spanish, from each one of the three cultures, as well as documents from the era.    Literature &amp; Modernity in 19th Century Latin America    SPAN-GA.9967 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course explores the relationships between literature and discourses of political and cultural modernity in nineteenth-century Latin America. Reading critical essays, short stories and novels, we will examine how writers responded, ideologically and formally, to three key challenges in the historical transformation of political independence from Spain: the construction of modern nation-states in ethnically heterogeneous societies, political and cultural decolonization, and the commodification of social relations. We will focus on the ways in which these authors received, adapted, and contested forms of European modernity; we will analyze their rhetorical strategies and will explore how they tried to resolve profound social, cultural, and economic divisions between the criollo elites and the non-white majority, as well as between men and women.    Topics in Art History: The Power of Images in Spain and Its American Viceroyalties, 16th-18th Centuries    SPAN-GA 9990 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The colonization of Spanish America in the 16th century coincided with the rise of the power of images throughout Counter-Reformation Europe. This course looks at images, and especially paintings, as instruments of persuasion on both sides of the Atlantic. Through a series of thematic units, students will learn about the various roles that images played in all spheres of life from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Special emphasis will be placed on how paintings helped forge identities, both individual and collective, and how the same types of images could transmit different ideas depending on audience and setting. The two central aims of the course are for students to gain a greater awareness of how images are not mere illustrations of history but, on the contrary, themselves construct historical discourse; and secondly, of how cultural transfer\u2014the imposition of Spanish culture on Spanish America\u2014was accompanied by complex processes of adaptation and transformation. The course will include class visits to local museums and collections, including the Prado Museum, the convent of the Descalzas Reales, and the Museo de Am\u00e9rica, preceded by a session on how museums construct history.
