In this course we look for universals in forms and patterns across the disciplines. To understand why such universals appear we must examine function. The key concept is indeed the relation between form and function. Topics explored with the viewpoint of form and function include biology (from cells to ecosystems), psychology, sociology, linguistics, literature, art, architecture, engineering, mythology, politics, and religion. Students learn a powerful methodology for thinking and problem solving. They are encouraged to pursue individual interests while participating in an environment of sharing.    TYLER VOLK , Associate Professor of Biology , specializes in understanding the role of life in Earth?s biogeochemical cycles and has conducted research for NASA. With a passion for the interdisciplinary, he also investigates the generation of pattern in the widest sense, at all levels of culture and nature. Spanning the technical to the popular, his numerous articles have appeared in such magazines as Nature, Bioscience, New Scientist, The Sciences , and Natural History . He has published three books: Metapatterns across Space, Time, and Mind; Gaia?s Body: Toward a Physiology of Earth ; and What Is Death?: A Scientist Looks at the Cycle of Life .    Baseball and American Culture (V50.0206; call # 72301) Instructor: Carl E. Prince Wednesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    Baseball is neither a metaphor for life nor a perfect explanation for the uniqueness of American culture or American character. But sport?and, for some cogent reasons, baseball in particular? does provide a way into an examination of major contemporary historical questions in the areas of race, gender, and class. The Brooklyn Dodgers? pioneering role in American racial integration in the years after World War II, for example, and the Yankees? early failure to follow suit provide useful laboratories for a study of race. The strongly macho character of baseball reveals basic gender aspirations and prejudices more subtly evoked in other areas of American life. To the extent that baseball is indeed a workingclass game, fan involvement reveals much about the nature of urban class values and tensions in the 20th century. A fulllength baseballrelated research paper is required.    CARL E. PRINCE is Professor of History Emeritus and past president of the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic. He has published four books and numerous articles on early American political culture and edited the five-volume Papers of William Livingston . A former baseball player and lifelong fan, he is also the author of Brooklyn?s Dodgers: The Bums, the Borough, and the Best of Baseball (1996), which opened for him a new academic field.    Computer Simulation (V50.0207; call # 72302) Instructor: Charles S. Peskin Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00?3:15 p.m. Prerequisites: AP calculus and physics    Since the starting point for any computer simulation is a mathematical model (i.e., a collection of equations that describe the phenomenon to be simulated), the true prerequisite for this seminar is a love of mathematics, especially calculus. Computer simulation is one way that mathematics gets applied to the real world. In this handson course students learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological processes. Examples include the orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of epidemic and endemic diseases in a population, including the evolution of a population in response to an endemic disease; the production of sound by musical instruments; the flow of traffic on a highway or in a city; and the electrical activity of nerves. The seminar meets alternately in a classroom and in a computer laboratory setting. The techniques needed to perform computer simulations, and to present the results in terms of elementary graphics, animations, and sounds, are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by students working individually or in teams. Topics for student projects may be drawn from those discussed in class as listed above, but students are also free to do other projects that reflect their own interests.    CHARLES S. PESKIN is Professor of Mathematics and Neural Science . His field of research is mathematical modeling and computer simulation applied to biology and medicine. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a former MacArthur Fellow, and a recipient of the Mayor?s Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, as well as the Great Teacher Award of the NYU Alumni Association.    Professional Responsibility: Markets, Ethics, and Law (V50.0208; call # 72303) Instructor: Daniel Diamond Monday, 11:00 a.m.?1:30 p.m.    Every individual, regardless of his or her chosen field of study or occupation, will in time function as a professional or manager in a business, notforprofit, or government organization. This course is designed to enable individuals to think critically about the ethical context and consequences of the decisions they will make in their respective professional and organizational settings. In previous generations understanding and practicing one?s professional responsibilities was a desirable, if not required, behavior. In our society today it is a necessity. We explore the reasons for this change and, by examining the interactions between the marketplace, societal norms, and the law, develop the ethical analytical and reasoning tools necessary to identify and weigh often competing interests. Ideally this enables individuals to make decisions that simultaneously cause no harm to the affected parties?customers, coworkers, community, etc.?further the goals of the organization, and enhance the professional career of the decision maker. The requisite ethical reasoning tools are developed through a series of cases and related readings dealing with a variety of topics, including ethics of the individual business professional, product liability, the social responsibility of the corporation, moral standards across borders, ethical issues in financial markets, termination and downsizing, sexual harassment, and privacy. Since this is a case course, students play an active role in the learning process during class sessions.    DANIEL DIAMOND is Professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business. He served as Dean of the Stern Undergraduate College and as Vice Dean of the Stern School from 1985 to 1995. He also held the position of Dean of the College of Management Science at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell and Director of the Northeast Region Small Business Development Center. He has published extensively in the areas of U.S. economic history, labor force trends, and labor policy. He currently teaches \"The Global Business Environment: International Macroeconomics and Finance\" and \"Professional Responsibility\" in the Stern School?s M.B.A. program.    Great Poems (V50.0209; call # 72304) Instructor: David Lehman Tuesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    The aim of this course is to change your life. We will read a selection of the greatest poems in the English language and consider what makes them great. We will discuss what distinguishes American from British poetry, and we will give some attention to questions of poetic influence and methods of composition. But the primary focus will be on reading, interpreting, and evaluating the poems themselves. The poets under consideration will include Shakespeare, Donne, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Byron, Whitman, Dickinson, Yeats, Eliot, Frost, Stevens, Auden, and Bishop. The course will conclude with some examples of contemporary American poetry.    DAVID LEHMAN is a celebrated poet, distinguished critic, and influential editor. In 1988 he initiated \"The Best American Poetry,\" and he continues as the general editor of this acclaimed anthology series. In 1991 he published a critique of deconstruction entitled Signs of the Times: Deconstruction and the Fall of Paul de Man . His other books include The Evening Sun , his most recent collection of poems, and The Perfect Murder , a study of murder mysteries. The Last AvantGarde: The Making of the New York School of Poets appeared in 1998. He is editor of the forthcoming new edition of The Oxford Book of American Poetry . He has also taught at Columbia University, New School University, Bennington College, and Hamilton College.    Language and Reality in 20th Century Science and Literature (V50.0210; call # 72305) Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00?3:15 p.m.    The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the socalled two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \"postmodern\" literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg?s \"uncertainty principle\" and the \"undecidability\" of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon and from nontechnical texts on quantum and chaos theories.    FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German and Director of Undergraduate Studies in the department. Winner of the College?s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching, the University?s Distinguished Teaching Medal, and its Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master?s Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on 20thcentury German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.    Understanding the Vietnam War (V57.0216; call # 74290) Instructor: Marilyn B. Young Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.?1:30 p.m.    The Vietnam War, which ended over twenty years ago, continues to resonate in American society. It is often described as more \"divisive\" than any other war in American history with the exception of the Civil War. This seminar explores the history of the war and its impact. In addition to reading competing historical analyses, we shall read novels, screen movies, and discuss the war with both participants and participant observers. When possible, the authors of some of the books we read will take part in the class. By the end of the term we may not be able to answer the old question \"Why Vietnam?\" but we shall certainly be closer to understanding how it happened and perhaps even what it meant.    MARILYN B. YOUNG is Professor of History . She teaches Asian history and the history of U.S. relations with Asia and is the author of The Vietnam Wars, 1945?1990 and of numerous essays on the war and the way it has been remembered.    Cinema and Affect: Why the Movies Move Us (V50.0217; call # 74291) Instructor: Charles Affron Thursday, 9:30 a.m.?12:00 noon    Popular cinema most obviously appeals to its viewers by telling stories and representing a semblance of life. But if the movies ultimately move us they do so because they convey story and truetolifeness through style and through the specific properties of the cinematic medium. This seminar focuses on \"conventional\" narrative films of the 1930s and 1940s to examine how (1) the weight of style and (2) the intrinsically emotional elements of the medium elicit the viewer?s affective response. The model of life serves the model of art; viewers respond to the medium when its conditions echo those of life. Film beguiles viewers to enter into its processes, and then uses those processes to capture lifelike representations of emotional situations. How do framing, display, staging, camera movement, sound, theatricality, irony, and duration conspire with narrative to move us to tears? How are viewers impelled to move with moving pictures, to be moved by them?    CHARLES AFFRON is Professor of French and Director of Graduate Studies in that department. In addition to books on the French novel and on the French Romantic theater and poetry, he has published Star Acting: Gish, Garbo, Davis, Divine Garbo (in French) , Cinema and Sentiment , and Sets in Motion (with Mirella Jona Affron), a study of the relationship between set design and narrative in cinema. In 2001 he published the biography Lillian Gish: Her Legend, Her Life .    The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America (V50.0218; call # 72306) Instructor: John E. Sexton Monday, 6:45?8:45 p.m.    Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of Church and State; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a 21st century liberal constitutional democracy.    JOHN E. SEXTON , President of New York University , was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and he has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.    Literature, Film, and the Artistic Environment of Arab Society in the 20th Century (V50.0223; call # 72307) Instructor: Mona N. Mikhail Wednesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    This seminar investigates themes in the Arabic artistic and literary milieu over the course of the 20th century. Through the primary lens of poetry and prose (including essays, novels, and short stories), it examines the crossmedia influences on cultural production and artists? engagement with political events of the 20th century. Students view films and documentaries, especially those produced from the works of the Nobel Prize?winning novelist Naguib Mahfouz ( Midaq Alley, Miramar, etc.), and discuss the influence of major crossover themes from literature (EastWest dialogue, nationalism, antiimperialism, and existentialism) on filmmakers. Attention is also paid to similar themes in plastic arts and architecture, as represented by the artists Moukhtar, Mahmoud Said, and Wissa Wassef and the architect Hassan Fathy.    MONA N. MIKHAIL , Associate Professor of Middle Eastern Studies , is the author of numerous books, notably Studies in the Short Fiction of Naguib Mahfouz and Yusuf Idris , and has written extensively on the cultural, social, and political context of modern Arabic literature, while also translating several important Arabic works into English. She is currently working on the growing body of women?s literature in the Arab world and exploring women?s role in popular culture/literature in oral genres such as proverbs, drama, song, and humor. Seen and Heard will be published in summer 2003. She also recently directed and produced a documentary about the theater in Egypt.    Freedom, Classical Liberal Principles, and 21stCentury Problems (V50.0227; call # 72308) Instructor: Mario J. Rizzo Monday, 4:55?7:25 p.m.    The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the principles of classical liberalism through the discussion of theoretical and empirical issues in economics, law, and ethics. \"Classical liberalism\" is the political, economic, social, and moral philosophy that is severely skeptical of the power of the state and seeks to reduce its power over the citizen. It advances the view that society, under the rule of law, is largely selfregulating, and so government intervention, whether in economic or social affairs, is either unnecessary or simply makes problems worse. Sometimes classical liberalism is called \"19thcentury liberalism,\" but its development has roots in ancient Roman thought, in the 18thcentury Scottish Enlightenment, as well as in many strains of 20thcentury philosophy and economics. Its leading thinkers have included Adam Smith, F. A. Hayek, and Milton Friedman. The course considers philosophical principles and empirical issues in the context of contemporary problems, such as free trade, property rights, income distribution, and socialreligious toleration.    MARIO J. RIZZO is Associate Professor of Economics in the Department of Economics, as well as codirector of the Austrian Economics Program. His fields of research lie at the interface of a number of academic subjects, including the economic analysis of law; ethics and economics; and the methodology and philosophy of economics. He also has a longstanding interest in political philosophy. He is the author (with Gerald O?Driscoll) of The Economics of Time and Ignorance , many articles in law journals, and philosophically oriented articles on economic theory.    Punk to Postmodernism: The Downtown New York Avant-Garde Scene since 1975 (V50.0232; call # 74606) Instructor: Marvin J. Taylor Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.?12:00 noon    Punk, performance art, postmodernism, graffiti art, minimalism, conceptual art?these are just some of the topics examined in this course. Following the Vietnam War, artists, writers, and musicians moved into the abandoned industrial lofts of Soho and the Lower East Side, and an explosion of creative activity produced one of the most important outsider art movements of this century. The first half of the course focuses on the Soho scene, where, outside of the mainstream of the art and literary world of uptown venues, artists began to forge a new way of looking at the creation of works of art that has forever changed American culture. After the gentrification of Soho, the scene shifted to the East Village, where the work became more hardedged and influenced by the ethnic mix of the Lower East Side. The second half of the course focuses on this distinct scene. It centers on some of the major questions that arise from the works of downtown artists and the scene in which they worked: what is inside/outside, high/low, modern/postmodern, art/activism, sex/sexuality, and identity/performance. Works studied include literature, photography, film, and performance art by such artists as Kathy Acker, Dennis Cooper, David Wojnarowicz, Keith Haring, Nan Goldin, Barbara Kruger, Lynne Tillman, Laurie Anderson, Michel Foucault, and JeanFran?ois Lyotard.    MARVIN J. TAYLOR , Director of the Fales Library and Special Collections at NYU , is also the curator of the Downtown New York Collection, the only archive of books, manuscripts, photos, film, and other materials related to the downtown scene. He has published in scholarly and popular magazines, assemblings, and avantgarde anthologies, including The Crimes of the Beats and the Japanese publication American Book Jam . Among his other research interests are Victorian fiction, queer theory, and the epistemology of libraries.    First Amendment Freedom of Expression (V50.0235; call # 72309) Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00?3:15 p.m.    Conflicts over freedom of speech erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A tobacco company sues a major television network for libel. Press disclosures threaten the fairtrial rights of defendants in major criminal trials. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests of society. This course begins by examining the struggle against seditious libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. Students examine freedom of speech through the prism of a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons; political dissent that advocates overthrow of the government; prior restraints against publication; obscenity and pornography; flag burning; free press versus fair trial; and inflictions of emotional distress. Students read and analyze important decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.    STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is Associate Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication and Director of the Program in Business and Economic Reporting. He teaches courses on First Amendment law in which he focuses on the legal rights of the press. His research interests include both law and business, and he writes frequently on both topics for national publications. He is coauthor of Building 6: The Tragedy at Bridesburg , an investigation of cancer deaths at a chemical company, and is currently working on a book about the First Amendment religion case Abington School District v. Schemp.    Performance and Society (V50.0238; call # 73992) Instructor: Richard Schechner Wednesday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    What are the many ways that performance inflects personal and social life? How can a grasp of performance theories inform us about society? What can we learn about the performances of everyday life, the life roles that we each play? How do these relate to sacred and secular rituals, sports and other popular entertainments, trials and the legislative process, the performance of medicine and business, the internet, and the performing arts? In this seminar we explore performance as a broad spectrum of activities by focusing on particular examples drawn from specific genres of performance. These include Trinidad Carnival, the Ramlila Cycle Play of northern India, the trial of those accused of witchcraft in 17thcentury Salem, Massachusetts, and the trial of O. J. Simpson, the modern Olympic Games, the performance of race and gender, and the performance of medicine. In most of these instances we compare how materials are treated socially to how they are treated aesthetically (e.g., the rendering of the Salem witch trials in court records of the time and in Arthur Miller?s play The Crucible ). In addition to readings and discussions, seminar members attend selected performances in New York ranging from theater to sports to trials to surgery.    RICHARD SCHECHNER is a University Professor of Performance Studies who teaches at the Tisch School of the Arts and the NYU Law School. He is also a professional theater director whose most recent work is Yokastas, coauthored with Saviana Stanescu and produced at La Mama in March?April 2003. Schechner is a widely published author and editor of the renowned journal TDR: The Drama Review . His 2002 book, Performance Studies, An Introduction , is the basic text used in the seminar.    In Search of Lost Time (V50.0240; call # 72311) Instructor: Marcelle Clements Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.?1:30 p.m.    We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically? with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel in seven volumes and 4,500 pages, In Search of Lost Time addresses literature?s richest theme: desire?its remembrance, loss, perversion, defeat, triumph, and final resurgence in the form of art. Almost 100 years old, it remains a dazzling portrait of turnofthecentury French beau monde and, even more, of the power and elegance of its narrator?s sensibility. It is still unparalleled in how it combines breadth, virtuosity, and irony, the author?s extraordinary psychological acuity and the glamour of his world, as well as how it merges social history, ennui, and lust. It is also one of the world?s greatest, most pleasurable, and elating reads. Although Marcel Proust (1871?1922) is usually assumed to be France?s greatest novelist, his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move on, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while the texture of In Search of Lost Time (association, evocation, magnification, play of words and memory) may have been its most radical contribution to the art of the novel, this work cannot be understood until it has been read in its entirety. In this seminar, we will keep moving at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, Time Regained.    MARCELLE CLEMENTS is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Her articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations ; a novel, Rock Me ; and a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman: Single Women Reinventing Single Life . Her most recent book is a novel, Midsummer.    Rethinking Who We Are: Interpersonal Approaches to the Person (V50.0247; call # 73677) Instructor: Michael Westerman Monday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    There are unresolved tensions in the field of psychology between individualcentered and interpersonal models of the person. The seminar is based on the belief that in order to make progress on these unresolved issues we need to recognize that they refer to a longstanding fundamental question philosophers began wondering about centuries before the discipline of psychology came into existence?What place do our relationships with other people have in our lives? Moreover, we need to engage in an inquiry that involves a dynamic interplay between psychological and philosophical considerations. Participants in the seminar learn about work in several specific areas where these tensions appear, including models of child development, approaches to psychopathology, and basic questions about psychotherapy. We also consider more \"interpersonal\" versus more individualcentered ways in which psychologists think about interpersonal interaction itself. The final topic concerns the philosophy of the social sciences. We look at recent contributions by psychologists and philosophers suggesting that we replace traditional concepts of the process of psychological research with a social view of that process. Throughout the seminar, we refer to classic philosophical texts and contributions by historians of ideas to explore critically the ways in which contemporary efforts by psychologists reflect concepts of the person from our philosophical tradition.    MICHAEL A. WESTERMAN is Associate Professor of Psychology and a member of the faculty in the clinical psychology doctoral training program. He has conducted research on several topics concerning interpersonal relationships, including studies of motherchild interaction, family systems, and the patienttherapist relationship in psychotherapy. His publications also include articles on issues in philosophical psychology. He is currently involved in a program of research based on an interpersonal reconceptualization of psychological defenses he has developed, which is called the theory of interpersonal defense.    New Media Law and Content Creation (V50.0253; call # 72314) Instructor: Karl P. Kilb Monday, 6:20?8:50 p.m.    This course explores the legal and journalistic issues surrounding the creation and distribution of content in the \"Electronic Information Age.\" Content is a commodity that is packaged in many forms, known as \"media.\" We are all consumers of content, which is tailored by each media organization to target specific audiences. Consumers base their content choices on the type of information, as well as on the method of delivery. The traditional print and broadcast media have found a powerful, relatively inexpensive new means of distribution: the Internet. The rapid packaging of content by means of new technology has forced content creators and distributors to develop new interpretations to fundamental intellectual property issues, including copyright law. The seminar will promote active research and discussions with leaders in the media and legal professions, and explore how legislation and industry practices are responding to new technology.    KARL P. KILB, ESQ. , is the General Counsel of Bloomberg LP, managing a global Legal/Contracts Department. Before becoming an attorney in 1995, he was a broadcast journalist at FNN, CNBC, 1010 WINS Radio, Bloomberg, and various other networks and stations in New York for twelve years, having graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in broadcast journalism from NYU. He frequently lectures at universities and industry organizations about media and intellectual property law.    School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies (V50.0255; call # 74604) Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum Tuesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    The decades of the 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation and of New York University. This course aims to develop an appreciation of information seeking and recording in a research environment. In essence, students will research NYU?s recent history by means of library research methods learned in the course. Through the examination of primary and secondary materials, accompanied by the personal narratives of faculty who were on campus during those times, students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition to doing shared background readings, class members will develop a research paper or a finding aid about their chosen topic.    ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is an Associate Curator in the Bobst Library and an Adjunct Professor in the English Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science. He is currently the librarian for education in the Social Sciences Department. First as a student and then as faculty, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.    Modern Concepts of Matter and the Cosmos (V50.0256; call # 72315) Instructor: Daniel Zwanziger Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.?12:15 p.m. Prerequisite: high school physics    Since the 1970s our understanding of matter has been dominated by a paradigm known as \"the Standard Model\" of elementary particle physics. According to this model, the basic forces of nature are the strong and electroweak forces that are transmitted by \"gauge\" fields, and the gravitational force that is described by general relativity. Elementary particles are either the quanta of the gauge fields themselves, including gluons and photons, or quarks and leptons that interact and are bound by the exchange of these quanta. This seminar reviews the Standard Model and the evidence for it. The geometric character of gauge and gravitational fields is described. Modern theories of the cosmos are presented, in the light of recent observations. Since the nature of modern physical theories is quite mathematical and geometrical, students taking this course should be intrigued by mathematical concepts.    DANIEL ZWANZIGER is Professor of Physics . His special research interest is quantum field theory applied to elementary particles. His most recent publications deal with the theory of quarks and gluons known as quantum chromodynamics.    The Serotonin System: The Master Regulator of the Brain (V50.0258; call # 74603) Instructor: Efrain Azmitia Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.?12:00 noon    The human brain, one of the most fascinating and challenging frontiers in modern science, contains hundreds of individual chemical systems that form interacting networks adapted for the survival of the organism and the species. This course focuses on the cells that release a small aminoacid derivative called serotonin. Serotonin has been implicated in a vast array of functions, ranging from aggression, sexual behavior, sleeping, and learning to regulation of hormone release, eating, and neurotrophic factor secretion. Many mindaltering drugs (LSD, psilocybin, ecstasy, cocaine, alcohol, etc.) act on serotonin neurons. In humans, serotonin dysfunction is associated with such mental disorders as bulimia, depression, autism, Down?s syndrome, and Alzheimer?s disease. The course assumes no prior knowledge of neurosceince. Its interdisciplinary approach crosses traditional fields like biology, chemistry, psychology, anthropology, pharmacology, anatomy, neurology, and psychiatry. Readings and discussions are complemented by laboratory visits, demonstrations, and films.    EFRAIN AZMITIA is head of NYU's Laboratory of Molecular Neuroplasticity in the Department of Biology , member of the Center for Neural Science, Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry at the NYU Medical Center, and a National Institute of Mental Health Career Scientist awardee. He has held appointments in Great Britain, France, Japan, and Israel, as well as in the United States. He has written over 200 articles, edited four books, organized over 20 international meetings, and lectured thoughout the world. He is on the editorial board of Brain Research, Synapse, NeuroscienceNet (www.neuroscience.com), and other professional journals.    The Etruscans (V50.0261; call # 74601) Instructor: Larissa Bonfante Monday and Wednesday, 2:00?3:15 p.m.    This course deals with the arts, history, and language of the wealthy Etruscan cities that flourished in central Italy from 1000 to 100 B.C. Because their language is unrelated to any other in the world and their own literature has disappeared, we must study them through their art?of which a considerable amount has survived. The class reads what the Greeks and Romans, their rivals and neighbors, said about them, compares this to the reality of their religion, society, and customs, and learns about their remarkable technical achievements in divination, jewelry making, metalwork, road building, and other crafts. New excavations and discoveries are constantly bringing forth fresh proof of their importance in the ancient Mediterranean world, in which they traded with the Near East, Carthage, Greece, and Rome, and their influence in Rome and in Europe, to which they brought the culture of cities. Work with the Classics Department?s collection of Etruscan antiquities allows students to see original Etruscan art and inscriptions and to have handson experience with Etruscan archaeological material.    LARISSA BONFANTE is Professor of Classics and the author of books and articles on Etruscan language, society, culture, and influence. Etruscan Life and Afterlife , which she edited, is used as a textbook in universities in the United States and in Europe.

From Milton to Mingus (V50.0264; call # 72317) Instructor: Perry Meisel Monday and Wednesday, 3:30?4:45 p.m.    This course examines the relation between influence and originality in canonical artists from Milton to Charles Mingus, and how it impacts culture at large. A growing preoccupation with mediocrity defines the history of literature from the Renaissance to modernism, and makes imaginative autonomy the site of ideal artistic success; in jazz, the tension between group and soloist is present from the start. What are the ironies that assail these histories? What are the paradoxes that both install their ideals and deconstruct their possibility? Recognizing the unconscious influences that guide the reader?s or the listener?s responses is the course?s second, and parallel, focus. Readings include Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Keats, Whitman, Pater, Freud, Virgina Woolf, and Ralph Ellison. Musicians include Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis; Lester Young, Charlie Parker, and John Coltrane; and Charles Mingus.    PERRY MEISEL , Professor of English , is the author of numerous books and articles, including The Myth of the Modern and The Cowboy and the Dandy . In addition to writing about literature, psychoanalysis, and critical theory, he has also written extensively about jazz and rock, principally for the Village Voice . He has taught at NYU since 1975.    Terrorism, Nihilism, and Modernity (V50.0267; call # 72320) Instructor: James Gilligan Thursday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    The past century has witnessed violence the character and scale of which are so unique and unprecedented that we have had to create a new vocabulary to describe it (genocide, terrorism) and the ideologies that underlie it (totalitarianism, fundamentalism). To understand modern violence, we will examine the origin of the modern mind in the 17th century, when science, based on universal doubt, ended the Age of Faith, and the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority lost credibility. Nietzsche called this the \"death of God\" (and the Devil); it could also be called the death of Good and Evil, leading to another set of new words (nihilism, agnosticism, anomie, anarchy). We will study the origins and implications of these developments by reading Shakespeare and John Donne, Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, Beckett and Wittgenstein, Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well as modern mass murderers from Hitler to bin Laden. Finally, we will ask whether the modern human sciences can help us understand how to reverse or at least limit this escalation of violence.    JAMES GILLIGAN headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry. He is now an Adjunct Professor at NYU, Director of the Center for the Study of Violence, a member of President Clinton?s National Commission on Youth Violence, and author of Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic and Preventing Violence: An Agenda for the Coming Century . He has been a consultant to the Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention at the World Health Organization, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and numerous other organizations.    The Art of the Enemy (V50.0270; call # 72323) Instructor: Hector Feliciano Wednesday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    The destruction of the art of the enemy, or cultural looting, has almost always been one of the staple byproducts of international, civil, or religious strife. From ancient or biblical times to the recent wars in the former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, art plunder and the willful destruction of cultural patrimony?from palaces, museums, libraries, churches, mosques, and synagogues to paintings, statues, icons, and books?have been used by the victors as a supplementary means to conquer, annihilate, and humiliate the enemy. By studying some examples of destruction and looting, we will explore the enemies? fascinating political, aesthetic, or religious justifications for these acts. We will also consider why some enemies destroy, while others simply take along, sell, or abandon; we will describe the positive and negative role of museums in some of these events, and learn how the \"values of collecting\" and the creation of museums may have helped to preserve art destined to be destroyed or looted by others. Above all, we will constantly be redefining what art is and what it means? to us and to our enemies. There will be guest speakers and field trips to museums.    HECTOR FELICIANO is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Formerly cultural writer for the Paris bureaus of the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times , he is the author of The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World?s Greatest Works (1997); first published in French, this work has since been translated into several other languages. He served on the Panel of Experts of the Presidential Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States. He is the organizer of the First International Symposium on Cultural Property and Patrimony (Columbia University, 1999) and of a panel discussion entitled \"The Art of the Enemy\" (School of Visual Arts in New York City, 2002).    What Makes a Great Leader?: Perspectives from Government, Law, and Business (V50.0275; call # 72328) Instructor: Diane C. Yu Monday, 6:30?9:00 p.m.    Machiavelli wrote in 1532, \"There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.\" This seminar explores some of the ways in which leaders, particularly over the past two centuries, have risen in a number of settings. How do we define greatness in leadership? Have the standards remained static, or have they changed over time? How have leaders overcome the obstacles in their paths? What, if any, traits do they have in common? Do leaders make the times in which they serve, or do the times dictate the leaders who emerge? Are leadership skills innate, or can they be learned and developed? The seminar will stimulate thinking through readings and discussion about notable figures from politics and government, such as the Founding Fathers, Lincoln, Mandela, Gandhi, and Churchill, while looking at contemporary examples drawn from the business and legal world as well. Readings include selections from biography, Confucius, Shakespeare, analysis and commentary, history, and autobiography. The seminar also features sessions with prominent figures from the business, media, and political worlds who will discuss their views and firsthand observations about leadership.    DIANE C. YU is Chief of Staff and Deputy to the President of NYU. She has been a highranking executive at a Fortune 250 company, California judicial officer, general counsel for a California public corporation, and appointed by the President as a White House Fellow. Her B.A. is from Oberlin and her J.D. from the University of California (Berkeley). A national bar leader, she serves on numerous boards, has won awards for her service to the legal profession, and was the first woman of color to chair the American Bar Association?s Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, which accredits American law schools. She currently chairs the ABA?s Commission on Women in the Profession.    The Biology of Infectious Diseases (V50.0276; call # 74292) Instructors: Martin Blaser and Joel Ernst Wednesday, 4:55?7:25    Infectious diseases have shaped human biology, genes, culture, and imagination. After the advent of antibiotics, we thought that we could win the \"war\" on infectious diseases. Antibiotic resistance and AIDS, among other events, have taught us that the war is not winnable. Rather, we must understand our place in the microbial world and learn to adapt strategies that minimize infectious disease impact, and maximize our symbiosis with indigenous organisms. After introductory discussions, the course is conducted as a series of seminars by students on topics that provide greater understanding of the underlying biological issues. Topics that may be discussed include genetic susceptibility to diseases such as malaria, problems involved in antibiotic resistance, the evolution of HIV, good microbes vs. bad, and infectious diseases in the postmodern world.    MARTIN BLASER is the Frederick H. King Professor of Internal Medicine and Chairman of the Department of Medicine , and Professor of Microbiology at the NYU School of Medicine. A practicing physician, and specialist in Infectious Diseases, he has progressively become a biologist. His research interests have spanned clinical medicine, epidemiology, molecular biology and genetics, evolutionary biology, mathematics, and history. The recipient of numerous honors and awards, he is founder and publisher of the Bellevue Literary Review .    JOEL ERNST is the Jeffrey Bergstein Professor of Medicine, Director of Infectious Diseases, and Professor of Microbiology at the NYU School of Medicine. A clinician and specialist in infectious diseases, he directs his immunology research at discovery of mechanisms used by microbial pathogens to evade the immune system. He is a frequently sought speaker at international meetings on infectious diseases and immunology.    The Politics of Knowledge in the United States (V50.0277; call # 74607) Instructor: Thomas Bender Monday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    There are a variety of forms of knowledge (numerical, visual, narrative, analytical) associated with different disciplines, groups, and institutions. How does each obtain cultural significance and authority? What are the assumptions that support their claims as valid knowledge? To what extent are they \"mirrors of nature\"? To what extent do they reflect or reveal the \"position\" or human interests of those who articulate them, whether one thinks of personal qualities, class position, institutional location, or ideological commitment? How does one respond to such uncertainty about the sources and validity of knowledge claims? How do knowledge claims enter politics? How does one politically engage such claims?    THOMAS BENDER is University Professor of the Humanities and Professor of History . On the faculty of NYU since 1974, he has served as chair of the History Department and as Dean for the Humanities. His teaching and research interests cover the history of cities, intellectuals, and intellectual and cultural history more generally. His 14 published books include two directly related to this course, New York Intellect and Intellect and Public Life . His most recent books, both published in 2002, are Rethinking American History in a Global Age and The Unfinished City: New York and the Metropolitan Idea . He also frequently contributes to newspapers and magazines, including the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times .    Ethics, Pointillism, Epidemiology, and Epistemology: EPEE Dueling with Scientific Health Information (V50.0278; call # 74293) Instructor: Ralph V. Katz Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    The common citizen is well challenged?if not overly challenged? trying to deal with the flood of scientific health information as presented in the media. \"Scientific\" health find ings of this week seem to routinely conflict with the \"scientific\" health findings of last week. As the movie theme song asked so poignantly 35 years ago, \"What?s it all about, Alfie?\" This course explores that question as related to scientific health information as used both by individuals to make personal life decisions related to health behaviors and by society to protect its citizens via court decisions and governmental regulations. Concepts from the fields of ethics, art, and science are central to readings and discussions focused on how to make sense of it all. Beginning with the history and foundation concepts of bioethics and epidemiology, the course provides a frame for understanding how to make reasonable sense of this flood of scientific health information, i.e., what are the strengths and limitations (and misuses) of this free flow of scientific health findings in our democratic \"instant, electronic news\" world. Textbooks and videos cover background on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, polar bears, and rubbish. As the major course assignment, each student writes a newspaperstyle \"oped\" article, backed by an annotated bibliography.    RALPH V. KATZ is Professor of Epidemiology and Chair of the Department of Epidemiology &amp; Health Promotion in the NYU College of Dentistry. He is Director of the NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP (Research on Adolescent and Adult Health Promotion) Center and leads a current study investigating whether minorities are less willing to participate in biomedical studies as research subjects and, if so, why. Having served on the National Tuskegee Legacy Committee, he was a Presidential Invitee to the White House for President Clinton?s 1997 apology to the AfricanAmerican community. His epidemiologic research has ranged from oral disease studies to the development of epidemiologic research methods. In addition to his dental degree, he holds a master?s degree in public health and a Ph.D. in epidemiology.    W. E. B. Du Bois: The Making of a Radical Scholar Activist (V50.0279; call # 74351) Instructor: Jeff Goodwin Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    W. E. B. Du Bois (1868?1963) was one of the most remarkable scholars and political activists of the 20th century. The first AfricanAmerican to earn a doctorate at Harvard, Du Bois wrote perhaps the most trenchant analysis of the AfricanAmerican condition, The Souls of Black Folk (1903), the first sociological study of a Black community, The Philadelphia Negro (1899), and one of the most influential works of American history, Black Reconstruction in America (1935). Du Bois also founded the Niagara Movement in 1905, breaking decisively with the \"accommodationist\" politics of Booker T. Washington, and was a major figure in the PanAfricanist movement. This course examines the life, times, and writings of Du Bois, focusing on the years between his birth in 1868 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and 1910, when he left Atlanta University to become editor of The Crisis, the official publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The course tries to understand, among other issues, how such a remarkable and cosmopolitan individual could have emerged from such a humble and seemingly parochial background, a small town in western Massachusetts with a tiny AfricanAmerican community.    JEFF GOODWIN , Professor of Sociology , is author of No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945?1991 and coeditor of Passionate Politics: Emotions and Social Movements and The Social Movements Reader . He has taught courses on social movements and revolutions at NYU since 1991. His interests also include social theory and the AfricanAmerican tradition in sociology, including the works of Du Bois, Charles S. Johnson, E. Franklin Frazier, St. Claire Drake, and Oliver Cromwell Cox.    Rise of the Skyscraper (V50.0281; call # 74294) Instructor: Sarah Bradford Landau Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    New York City, as well as Chicago, contributed significantly to the creation of the skyscraper building type. Although the World Trade Center and plans for its rebuilding are likely to be discussed, the focus of the seminar is New York?s historic skyscrapers. We consider the urban factors that precipitated the desire to build tall; technological innovations?notably the elevator and iron and steel skeleton construction?that made it possible to build tall; the relation of form and style features to site conditions, building code provisions, and architectural aesthetics; and the contributions of individual architects. Introductory lectures on the early development of the skyscraper in New York and Chicago, tours of lower Manhattan?s skyscraper districts, midtown?s Chrysler and Empire State buildings, and class discussions based on assigned readings precede student oral presentations focused on specific case studies accompanied by slides. In preparation for their presentations and final papers, students experience using primary sources such as those in the city?s Municipal Archives in addition to reading the relevant published studies.    SARAH BRADFORD LANDAU , Professor of Fine Arts , has taught at NYU for 27 years and has received a Golden Dozen award for Excellence in Teaching. She is an authority on the New York sky scraper. Her publications related to the subject include Rise of the New York Skyscraper, 1865?1913 (with coauthor Carl W. Condit) and a monograph study of George B. Post, who contributed substantially to the creation of the skyscraper: George B. Post, Architect: Picturesque Designer and Determined Realist . She has also served as commissioner on the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and as commission vice chair.    From the Rise of Christianity to Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on Two Millennia (V50.0282; call # 74355) Instructor: Edward W. Lehman Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The new millennium has dawned with growing disenchantment with traditional leftright cleavages and with the claim that the United States is increasingly a nation of isolated individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is eroding civic virtues and our democratic institutions. Our aim is to assess the trajectory of our culture using the dimensions of autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism. This seminar begins by probing these diagnoses in the broader context of moral and social transformations in the West over the last two thousand years. We examine socialscience analyses of pivotal changes that have occurred in that period. We consider the sociologist Rodney Stark?s highly acclaimed The Rise of Christianity , which focuses on developments during the first four centuries of the first millennium of the common era. Our final reading is the political scientist Robert Putnam?s controversial Bowling Alone, which is currently the most publicized critique of contemporary American civic life.    EDWARD W. LEHMAN is a Professor of Sociology . His research interests include political sociology, cultural sociology, and sociological theory. He is the author of Coordinating Health Care: Explorations in Interorganizational Relations, Political Society: A Macrosociology of Politics , and The Viable Polity . He is coeditor of A Sociological Reader in Complex Organizations . In 2000 he edited and published Autonomy and Order: A Communitarian Anthology , a collection of original essays by 15 authors that explores how the fraying of shared moral understandings and the erosion of communal bonds affect our capacity to balance individual rights and collective responsibilities. He is currently book review editor of The Responsive Community .    Jews and Germans in Postwar Germany (V50.0283; call # 74417) Instructor: Marion Kaplan Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.    This course explores the sometimes painful, often angry, and always fascinating interactions and interlocking histories of Germans and Jews even after the Holocaust. It investigates the immediate postwar situation: the Jewish displaced persons, the U.S., English, French, and Russian occupying forces, and the German refugees from eastern territories. Students analyze how Germans, both East and West, did or did not come to terms with their Nazi pasts. They read perspectives of Jews on their lives in the Germanys, why they stayed, how they experienced their citizenship and their interactions with Germans, and how unification and the influx of Russian Jews affected them. They also analyze German perspectives: How did exNazis or bystanders think about their pasts? Did they cover them up? What did their children and grandchildren know? German and Jewish historical memories are contrasted, including Jewish memories of persecution and annihilation and German memories of suffering during the war. Moreover, students examine the ways Jews and Germans saw the student rebellion of 1968, the American TV series \"Holocaust\" in 1979, the \"Historians? Debate\" of the mid1980s, and the Goldhagen controversy of the 1990s. Finally, the politics of public commemoration in Germany are discussed.    MARION KAPLAN is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History . She has also taught at Queens College, CUNY. She is the author of The Jewish Feminist Movement in Germany: The Campaigns of the J?discher Frauenbund, l904?l938 (1979), The Making of the Jewish Middle Class: Women, Family, and Identity in Imperial Germany (1991), and Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany (1998). The last two won the National Jewish Book Award in their respective years. She has edited books in European women?s history? When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany and The Marriage Bargain: Dowries in European History ?and is currently editing and writing a history of Jewish daily life from the 17th century until 1945.    Bases of Chinese Culture: Philosophy and Literature (V50.0284; call # 73991) Instructor: Moss Roberts Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45    The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the essential themes and issues of traditional Chinese culture through eight representative works of philosophy and literature. The course concentrates on six philosophical texts in English translation? Confucius? Analects, Laozi?s Dao De Jing , the Mozi , the Mencius , the Chuang Tzu , and the Hsun Tzu ?plus two classic novels of the late imperial period, Three Kingdoms and Dream of the Red Chamber , also in English translation.    MOSS ROBERTS is Professor of Chinese and former Director of the East Asian Studies Program . His area of specialization is Chinese language, literature, and philosophy; he has also given courses on Japanese literature and on traditional Vietnamese history and culture. He has translated one of China?s major epics, Three Kingdoms , as well as Chinese Fairy Tales and Fantasies , part of the Pantheon series on folklore. His translation of Laozi?s Dao De Jing was published in 2001.    Waiting for Beckett (V50.0285; call # 74421) Instructor: Tom Bishop Thursday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    From the tramps of Waiting for Godot to the terminal characters of Endgame , to the frenzied narrators of his fictions, Beckett?s major works will be studied as powerful contemporary expressions of the human condition and as a fundamental calling into question of language itself. Beckett?s forceful images will be viewed as metaphors of existence and the tenacity of the Beckettian narrator to continue to speak/write despite all odds points to a positive affirmation. This \"obligation to express\" will be seen as one of the major constants in Beckett?s work?a dialectic of speech and silence, memorably reflected in the final words of The Unnamable : \". . . you must go on, I can?t go on, I?ll go on.\" Beckett will also be studied as one of the 20th century?s key innovators through the narrative strategies of his fiction and the theatrical conventions underlying his dramatic works. The seminar will concentrate on the period of Beckett?s greatest creativity, between 1946 and 1955, and on the late works, from 1970 until his death in 1989. Videotapes of performances and television productions will be used to complement readings, as will as Beckett?s one cinematic venture, Film.    TOM BISHOP is Florence Gould Professor of French Literature, Professor of Comparative Literature , and Chair of the Center for French Civilization and Culture. He chaired the Department of French for 33 years. He has written extensively on contemporary French fiction and drama and especially on the works of Samuel Beckett. Bishop, a past president of the Samuel Beckett Society, organized five major Beckett festivals in New York and in Paris, one of which earned him an OBIE award. He was a friend of Beckett?s for the last quarter century of the writer?s life. Bishop?s most recent book is From the Left Bank: Reflections on the Modern French Theater and Novel .    The Representation of \"the Other\" in the IsraeliPalestinian Cinema (V50.0286; call # 74297) Instructor: Shimon Dotan Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Representation of the Other is a variation of the search for selfidentity. The IsraeliPalestinian conflict, and its political cinema, exhibit a clear pattern in which the parties attribute to the Other qualities and traits that reflect their own distress and aspirations. This pattern is examined in a series of contemporary films (1980 to the present). Each class consists of a screening followed by a discussion concentrating on representation in the context of the political conflict, variations in the use of film language to achieve a subjective portrayal, and modalities of representation and self critique. Two guest speakers, a Palestinian and an Israeli, participate in two (or more) of these discussions. Screenings include Divine Intervention , by Elia Suleiman; Beyond the Walls , by Uri Barabash; Close, Closed, Closure , by Ram Loevi; The Milky Way , by Ali Nasser; and The Smile of the Lamb , by Shimon Dotan.    SHIMON DOTAN , a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an awardwinning filmmaker with ten feature films to his credit. His films were the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ) numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb ) and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). Dotan has taught filmmaking at Tel Aviv University in Israel and Concordia University in Montreal.    Yeats and Joyce (V50.0287; call # 74298) Instructor: Denis Donoghue Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    This course reads Yeats and Joyce in the context of modern Irish society and culture. Yeats and Joyce were very different writers, different in social and religious background, education, and literary affiliation. Each implies a different Ireland. Ideally, Yeats?s Ireland is heroic, pagan, rural, mythic; its modern version is occult, aristocratic, hierarchical. Ideally, Joyce?s Ireland is urban, lowermiddle or middle class, Catholic or (more often) lapsed Catholic. Even when Yeats and Joyce are \"European,\" they are European with different commitments. Yeats?s modern master is Nietzsche, Joyce?s is Ibsen. In aesthetics, Joyce?s precursor is Aquinas; Yeats appeals to the traditions of neoPlatonism and philosophic Ideal ism. A reading of Yeats and Joyce should cast a double light on the strange country they so diversely articulated.    DENIS DONOGHUE is University Professor and Henry James Professor of English and American Letters at NYU. He has also taught at University College, Dublin, and the University of Cambridge (where he was a Fellow of King?s College). His visiting professorships have been at Princeton, UCLA, Harvard, Edinburgh, and other universities. He is the author of about twenty books in literary criticism, theory, and literary biography. The books of particular relevance to this course are Jonathan Swift, Yeats, We Irish, The Ordinary Universe , and The Practice of Reading . He has also published Warrenpoint , a memoir of growing up in a small town in Northern Ireland.    Order, Liberty, and Terrorism: September 11 in Perspective (V50.0288; call # 74354) Instructors: Anthony Amsterdam and Jerome Bruner Thursday, 4:55-6:55 p.m.    The September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon taught the government and the people of the United States how vulnerable we are to massive violence. The president and Congress responded by declaring a \"War on Terrorism.\" One controversial feature of the war on terrorism has been military detention of suspected terrorists without trial and without access to legal counsel. Detention of this sort raises basic questions about how a democratic society should strike the balance between maintaining security and public order on the one hand and preserving individual liberty on the other. This seminar explores the problems of reconciling order and liberty in various settings: in the military detention cases now being argued in the law courts; in earlier cases decided by the courts from the days of Aaron Burr to our own time; in theater and film classics from Sophocles? Antigone to Fred Zinnemann?s A Man for All Seasons and Peter Brooks?s Lord of the Flies . Students write brief papers for each week?s class, analyzing the implications of the court opinions or literary works assigned.    ANTHONY AMSTERDAM and JEROME BRUNER are both University Professors at New York University and are joint authors of Minding the Law , a book that examines the role of narrative thinking and rhetoric in the legal process. Bruner, trained in psychology, which he has taught at Oxford and Harvard, now works on how psychological and cultural influences affect law. Amsterdam has been both law teacher and active litigator for many years, combining academic teaching with court work in constitutional law, criminal law, and civil liberties.    Classical Mythology (V50.0289; call # 74300) Instructor: Matthew S. Santirocco Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    Human beings are distinguished in part by their capacity for telling stories and their delight in hearing them. Some of these narratives become traditional not only for their entertainment value but also because they serve other purposes?to explain natural and human phenomena, for example, to explore crucial questions of human existence, or to support social organization. Often these stories also control behavior: as history shows, the myths we live by are also those for which we are prepared to die or to kill. This seminar takes as a case study the myths of ancient Greece and Rome. Texts are drawn from major classical authors, including Homer, Hesiod, the Greek dramatists, and Vergil. The stories chosen focus on such crucial concepts as cosmology, gender, sexuality, justice, political order, and rationality. Through them we shall also explore the relationship of myth to other types of traditional tale, the functions of myth in ancient societies, the connection of myth to religion and ritual, the comparison of Greek myths with those of other societies, and the persistence of these stories into the present time and our own personal and public lives.    MATTHEW S. SANTIROCCO is Dean of the College of Arts and Science , Professor of Classics , and Angelo J. Ranieri Director of Ancient Studies . His teaching interests include mythology, Greek and Roman literature, comparative literature, and comparative cultural studies. The author of a book on Latin lyric poetry ( Unity and Design in Horace?s Odes ), of several edited volumes, and of many scholarly articles, he is currently working on a book on the poetics of patronage in Augustan Rome. He was editor of the American Philological Association?s two monograph series and is at present editor of the journal Classical World .    Introduction to Literary Theory (V50.0290; call # 74419) Instructor: Ziad Elmarsafy Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    This course presents a structured approach to methods in reading and the theory of literature that prepares students for advanced work in literature. Readings cover a wide selection of texts dealing with the definition and function of Western literature, from Plato to the 21st century. Given the history of the association between \"theory\" writ large and the French intellectual history of the late 20th century, one important point of emphasis is the relationship between those French theorists who have proven most influential in the Englishspeaking world (Barthes, Lacan, Fou cault) and the reception of their ideas on this side of the Atlantic. The course is built around several modules, including the classical heritage; formalism; existentialism and phenomenology; structuralism and semiotics, psychoanalysis; historicism and politically based approaches to literature.    ZIAD ELMARSAFY is Associate Professor of French at NYU with interests in early modernity and the Enlightenment. He has published The Histrionic Sensibility: Theatricality and Identity from Corneille to Rousseau (2001) and Freedom, Slavery and Absolutism: Corneille, Pascal, Racine (forthcoming, 2004) as well as several articles on the literature of the 17th and 18th centuries. He is currently working on a study of the relationship between the understanding of Islam, the translation of the Qur?an, and the European Enlightenment.    Communications and Human Values (V50.0291; call # 74405) Instructor: Richard D. Heffner Tuesday, 6:20?8:50 p.m.    This seminar critically analyzes how much our sense of what it means to be an American at the dawn of the 21st century has been molded by the media, with particular reference to their socializing and valuelegitimating content. To deal with such media power, students are asked first to identify their own respective approaches to the proper relationship between the individual and the state through discussion both of selections from such readings as Walter Lippmann?s Public Opinion , Robert Merton?s Mass Persuasion , J. S. Mill?s On Liberty , Herman Melville?s Billy Budd , Neil Postman?s Amusing Ourselves to Death , and B. F. Skinner?s Beyond Freedom and Dignity , and of screenings of such films as Birth of a Nation, 12 Angry Men, Harvest of Shame, Hearts and Minds , and JFK . Finally, class emphasis is on such contemporary media issues as a Fairness Doctrine (the real or imagined \"chilling effect\" of a requirement for media fairness and balance); cameras in the courts (do televised trials enhance justice, or instead create a \"mobocracy\" with trial by a new jury of public opinion?); media selfregulation (can there in fact be meaningful voluntary selfdiscipline in a free market, free speech, mass media? driven society?).    RICHARD D. HEFFNER is Producer/Moderator of the weekly public television series The Open Mind , which he began nearly a half century ago. Earlier a broadcaster and executive at ABC, NBC, and CBS, in 1962 he became the Founding General Manager of New York?s pioneering Channel 13. Trained as an American historian, he is the author of A Documentary History of the United States (1952) and the editor of Tocqueville?s Democracy in America (1956). His newest book is a collaboration entitled Conversations with Elie Wiesel (2001), and his Conversations about America will appear next year. From 1974 to 1994 he served as Chairman of the film industry's voluntary classification and rating system in Hollywood, commuting from Rutgers, where he has been University Professor of Communications and Public Policy since 1964.    Moral Perfectionism (V50.0292; call # 74301) Instructor: Ulrich Baer Monday and Wednesday, 11:00-12:15p.m.    The tradition of moral perfectionism is part of Western thought and concerns a reflection on the self that places tremendous emphasis on the possibility and necessity of the transforming of oneself and one?s society. In this course we explore the contemporary significance of this emphasis on the possibility of transforming the self?after the much discussed death of the \"subject\"? by reading philosophical, literary, and political texts that combine this unrelenting belief in the possibility of a criticism of society from within with astounding rhetorical force. Readings include selections from Emerson, Melville, Thoreau, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Rilke, Hesse, Freud, Foucault, Cavell, Gilligan, and Arendt.    ULRICH BAER , Associate Professor of German and Comparative Literature , is interested in how historical and personal catastrophes can be adequately communicated to others through literature, photography, and art.

Modern Music in Paris, 1890?1940 (V50.0293; call # 74608) Instructor: Victor Fell Yellin Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00?3:15 p.m.    Beginning with Debussy, Satie, Faur?, Vincent d?Indy, and Ravel, the course traces the evolution of modernism in music as it unfolded in Paris. By choosing new standards of aesthetics from popular and exotic sources rather than by reinventing basic rules of common practice, French composers made music sound modern. Soon gifted musicians from around the world assembled in the city before and after World War I. Some enrolled in established institutions like the Conservatoire or the Schola Cantorum; some studied with charismatic independent teachers such as Nadia Boulanger. They all came to Paris because they were allowed to absorb French taste in art without having to convert to any sectarian aesthetic. In many cases Paris validated pride in their own nationalism. This seminar emphasizes Stravinsky, Milhaud, and Honegger, but it also examines the works of such American composers as Copland, Piston, Antheil, Thomson, and Blitzstein, all of whom studied with Boulanger and then spread the ideas of Modern Parisian musical style to America.    VICTOR FELL YELLIN , Professor of Music , is a composer and musicologist. He studied with Walter Piston at Harvard and with Darius Milhaud in Paris, and was much influenced by works for the musical stage by Marc Blitzstein and by Virgil Thomson, for whose book on American music he wrote the chapter on Thomson?s operas Four Saints in Three Acts and The Mother of Us All . Excerpts from Yellin?s opera Abaylar have been performed by the Metropolitan Opera Studio in New York, and his Variations on \"Bye Bye Blues\" for cello and piano was recently given at Merkin Hall. As a music historian, he has written on many aspects of American music, including the biography Chadwick, Yankee Composer and The Omnibus Idea , a history and analysis of one of the most ubiquitous but neglected harmonic progressions in music since the late 18th century.    Love, and How We Understand It (V50.0294; call # 74416) Instructor: Mitchell Stephens Thursday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    This course studies both what may be the most powerful and mysterious of human behaviors and mental states, romantic love, and how various disciplines and art forms have tried to grapple with it. It considers romantic love in a variety of forms and deals with works from a variety of cultures and historical periods. Read ings are selected from philosophy, psychology, anthropology, science, and journalism, as well as literature; students also examine films, songs, and paintings. They are asked to complete experiments of their own on this topic using some of these kinds of analysis or forms of expression. The course encourages students to think more deeply not only about love itself but about the strengths and weaknesses of different intellectual and artistic methods, and therefore the potential and the limitations of different academic disciplines.    MITCHELL STEPHENS is Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication . He is the author of, among other books, the rise of the image the fall of the word and A History of News . Articles by him on media issues, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and other subjects have appeared in the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, FEED , and other publications. He has recorded radio commentaries for Marketplace and On the Media, and serves as history consultant to the Newseum in Washington, D.C.

He is also director of the Russian-American Journalism Institute in RostovonDon.    Galileo and Hobbes (V50.0295; call # 74609) Instructor: William Klein Friday 9:3012:00 p.m.    In 1636, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes visited the aged and blind Galileo at his house in Florence, but there is no record of what was said. That leaves us free to speculate as we enter into the works of these two great innovators and critics of the Aristotelian worldview. Using selections from both philosophers (and in those days there was often no difference between philosophers and scientists, except in terms of quality?Hobbes was a very good philosopher but not such a good scientist), we will try to decide whether Galileo would have approved of Hobbes?s radical development of his physics and cosmology into a comprehensive philosophy of nature, human nature, and the state.    WILLIAM KLEIN is Visiting Professor of General Studies at NYU. He has worked as a carpenter, an editor, and a writer, among other things, since completing the Ph.D. in history at Johns Hopkins. He has taught at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. His books include The Lure of the Italian Treasure , a youngadult detective novel set in Florence. He has written on English and Italian political thought and served on the editorial review board of the Journal of the History of Philosophy .    The Crusades and Their Legacy (V50.0296; call # 74418) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Tuesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    In the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, the Crusades, which began at the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters, if not the most important chapter. The Crusades began as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. For two hundred years the Crusaders managed to hold on to their possessions, losing more of them with every passing decade, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the East was lost to western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades themselves, but focuses on the relations among the three great religions and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. We study the differences among the religions as well as their many similarities. Most of all, we address some of the problems that are crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a holy war; the issue of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the legacy of the crusading era. Readings include Muslim, Jewish, and Christian writings of the era, in translation, as well as secondary works.    JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the Crusader era extensively. She served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.    Historic Preservation, Entrepreneurial Innovation, and the Rejuvenation of American Cities (V50.0297; call # 74352) Instructors: Tony and Mark Goldman Tuesday, 4:55?7:25 p.m.    Over the years there has been no more effective tool of urban restoration and revitalization than historic preservation. In cities all over the world it has turned once empty and deteriorating buildings, fading blocks, and dying districts into vital and dynamic centers of urban, pedestrian activity. People everywhere have come to realize that cities can have no future unless and until their past is preserved, guarded, and maintained. This course will concentrate on historic preservation, economic development, and the role that individuals play in the rejuvenation of our cities. Taught by two brothers men whose life work integrates the practical and the academic, the handson experiences of the street warrior, the daytoday entrepreneur with the academic, this course is meant to provoke, inspire, enlighten, and empower. By combining readings and field trips to four different neighborhoods in the New York City area, this course will give students the insights and abilities to begin to understand, participate in, and envision the important work of preserving, restoring, and revitalizing the historic urban fabric of cities throughout the world.    Note: Interested students must submit a written statement (no longer than one page), to be reviewed by the instructors, explaining why they wish to take this seminar. The statement can be mailed to 100 Washington Square East, Room 908, New York, NY 10003; faxed to 212-995-4811; or emailed to ccp1@nyu..edu.

Behind Government: How Politics, Media, and Money Shape Policies (V50.0298; call # 74612) Instructor: Mark Green Thursday, 4:55?7:25 p.m.    To read Congressional Records and State of the Union addresses, one might think that all policy emanated from facts, logic, and merit. And when Karl Rove, President Bush?s top strategic adviser, said that the President doesn?t consider politics when determining policy, it was a pleasant fiction no one was expected to believe. This seminar looks at the hidden aspects that drive government by focusing on five recent public leaders?President Bush (43), President Clinton, Mayor Giuliani, Ralph Nader, and former Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. How did their varying styles, values, intellects, and personalities affect their offices or campaigns? Are there particular approaches that can best accomplish great goals? How do media and money affect the success of these powerful people? How much does the public actually know about those who govern them?    MARK GREEN was the Distinguished Visiting Lecturer at NYU Law School in 2002. The author/editor of 18 books (including Who Runs Congress? ), he was the Consumer Affairs Commissioner of New York City (1990?93), the elected Public Advocate of New York City (1994?2001), and the Democratic nominee for Mayor (2001). He appears weekly on NY1?s Wiseguys with Ed Koch and Al D?Amato.    Manufactured Worlds: Utopias, Fables, and Fantasies (V50.0299; call # 74610) Instructor: L. Jay Oliva Wednesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    Historical eras can surely be viewed through a variety of lenses; one such lens is provided by creative individuals throughout history who have utilized fables and fantasies about alternate worlds to reflect their critiques, and aspirations, and fears for their own. Manufactured worlds have won public attention to the real world?s ills and potential through the power of imagination. We will examine this intriguing exercise of the human imagination, beginning with Thomas More?s Utopia and ending with Tolkien?s trilogy The Lord of the Rings .    L. JAY OLIVA is Michel Fribourg Professor of European Studies and President Emeritus of NYU. He is author and editor of works on Russian Imperial history, including Russia in the Era of Peter the Great , and has regularly taught a course in Russian history for juniors and seniors. His recent theater credits include Brigadoon, My Fair Lady, Guys and Dolls, Fiorello! , and Carousel ; and he is lead singer in an Irish group, Doc and the Hods.    Afghanistan and the World (V50.0300; call # 74611) Instructor: Robert D. McChesney Friday, 9:30 a.m.?12:00 noon    Since September 11, Afghanistan has emerged as a country whose interests and future are linked in a major way with those of the United States. The United States is not the first country and probably not the last to find itself enmeshed in the politics and society of this small nation in central Asia. The seminar begins with the subject of Afghanistan?s geophysical environment and the economic consequences that follow from that. Next it reviews the country?s social and cultural features, with an emphasis on tribalism, religion, and the literary and artistic heritage. The geopolitics of Afghanistan are then considered in light of the preceding with emphasis on the country?s relations with the nations that immediately surround it today?Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China. Finally, the subject of Afghanistan in a global framework is discussed: Afghanistan?s jihad against the Soviet Union, the civil war and the Taliban, and Afghanistan?s relations with alQa?ida, the United States, and the United Nations.    ROBERT D. MCCHESNEY is Professor of Middle Eastern Studies , with a special interest in the early modern history of Iran and Central Asia. He is the author of Waqf in Central Asia (1991), Central Asia: Foundations of Change (1996), and Kabul under Siege (1999).    Great Doctors: The History of Scientific Medicine Revealed through Biography (V50.0301; call # 74702) Instructor: Sherwin B. Nuland Friday, 3:306:00 p.m.    If we accept Thomas Carlyle?s proposition that \"history is the essence of innumerable biographies\" (1830), then we should be able to learn about the past by studying the lives of the men and women who made the greatest contributions to it. The aim of this course is to trace the development of medicine from the time of classical antiquity until the dawning of the modern biomedical era just after the middle of the 20th century. Beginning with Hippocrates and concluding with Helen Taussig and the introduction of cardiac surgery, readings and discussions center on 13 distinctive individuals as they functioned in the cultural environment of their times, the state of science and medical literature, the surrounding political circumstances, and the historical ambiance in which their discoveries were made. Emphasis is on the rise of medical education and literature; the relationship of science to contemporary theory about nature; the shifting influence of individual centers of thought and the countries in which new ideas flourished; the gradual loosening of religious influence; the triumph of inductive reasoning and the experimental method; and the ways in which a contributor?s personality, background, and training influenced his or her work.    SHERWIN B. NULAND, M.D. , is Clinical Professor of Surgery at Yale University and a Fellow of its Institution for Social and Policy Studies. He is a member of the executive committee of the university?s Whitney Humanities Center and of the Interdisciplinary Bioethics Forum.

His 1988 book, Doctors: The Biography of Medicine , has been published in eight languages, and he has written biographies of Leonardo da Vinci and Ign?c Semmelweis. Most of his essays and eight published books have been directed toward explaining medicine and medical history for the general reader.    Law and Globalization (V50.0302; call # 74599) Instructor: Richard Stewart Monday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    This seminar examines the role of law and legal institutions in fostering global market integration and economic growth and in addressing the discontents of globalization. The globalization of the economy has brought many benefits, but also many problems and criticisms. These discontents include disparities in power and wealth between rich and poor, which many claim have been exacerbated by globalization; lack of participation and transparency in decisionmaking by the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, and other international organizations; marginalization of developingcountry interests; cultural homogenization and displacement of local political and economic selfdetermination; loosening of social safety nets and regulatory protection; and subordination of environmental, labor, and human rights concerns. These discontents, and the law?s response to them, are critically examined. Topics include the role of contract, trade, and financial law in promoting international markets; the role of international treaties and organizations in managing the global economy, its benefits, and its adverse impacts; international environmental, labor, and human rights laws; how law affects the distribution of the burdens and benefits of globalization in areas such as intellectual property and trade/environment controversies; the role of multinational corporations and the global corporate social responsibility movement; the concerns of indigenous peoples; and the role of nongovernment organizations and the \"democracy deficit\" in global governance.    RICHARD B. STEWART is University Professor and John Edward Sexton Professor of Law. He also directs the Center on Environmental and Land Use Law. His teaching and research focus on domestic and international environmental law, the role of economic incentives in environmental protection, law and globalization, and administrative law and regulation.

Europe in Africa and Africa in Europe: Interaction and Rupture in History (V50.0303; call # 74684) Instructor: David Levering Lewis Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.?1:30 p.m.    This seminar explores pivotal moments of confrontation and exchange in which the course of economic, cultural, and political development in the European and African experiences are reciprocally and significantly altered. The proposition?that what others have made us applies at the most profound levels equally to conqueror and conquered, exploiter and exploited, superordinates and subordinates alike?is to be tested in this seminar through an exploration of five turningpoint interactions: (1) Islam?s first European century (viz., the 8thcentury Muslim conquest of Iberia; (2) capitalism and slavery, 1400s to 1850; (3) African resistance in the scramble for Africa; (4) bohemian Paris and Renaissance Harlem; (5) literatures and politics of rupture (WellsBarnett, Du Bois, and Maran to Fanon, Baldwin, et al.; Ghana and the Congo). Five essays keyed to the five topics and based on seminar discussions, required readings, and independent research are to be presented serially.    DAVID LEVERING LEWIS is joining NYU in fall 2003 as University Professor and Professor of History, having been, most recently, the Martin Luther King Jr. University Professor at Rutgers. President in 2002?03 of the Society of American Historians, he currently holds a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship.

The Genomics Evolution and Revolution: Scientists, Discoveries, and Societal Impact (V50.0304; call # 74685) Instructor: Tamar Schlick Wednesday, 12:30?3:00 p.m.    With advances in science and technology, the biological sciences occupy center stage, linking not only basic to applied research, and applied research to commercial success and economic growth, but also the biological sciences to the chemical, physical, mathematical, and computer sciences. The many concerted initiatives in genomics, in particular, like sequencing various organisms, identifying genes in humans and analogues in other species, determining variations (polymorphisms) in human genes related to disease, and designing drugs for specific gene products, have immense ramifications on every aspect of our lives, from health to technology to law. Though progress appears to have been revolutionary in the past decade, such developments have evolved from foundations laid by many pioneers in the biochemical sciences and allied fields. This course, appropriate for scientists and nonscientists, explores through a series of books, plays, and other materials three aspects of these scientific developments: the science pioneers, from Watson and Crick to Feynman to Elion, their lives, struggles, and triumphs; the scientific discoveries, from reports of the DNA double helix to the polymerase chain reaction; and the societal impact of these discoveries, from human cloning to ageextension miracles. The readings and discussions are designed to expose students to the complex web of scientific discovery, including the personal dimensions that are not often appreciated, and the mixture of serendipitous and systematic progress.    TAMAR SCHLICK is Professor of Chemistry , Mathematics , and Computer Science . Her field of research is the application of computational approaches to the study of structure and function of biological macromolecules, especially regulatory DNA/protein complexes related to transcription initiation and DNA replication and repair.

Sloan Fellowship, NYU Distinguished Recent Alumni, NSF Presidential Young Investigator, Searle and Whitaker Scholarships.    Home of the Brave: Legal Aspects of American Use of Force since World War II (V50.0305; call # 74686) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Wednesday, 12:30?3:00 p.m.    The creation of the United Nations ushered in a new era in the international legal regulation of the use of force by states. Under the UN regime states may use force in wellcircumscribed circumstances, notably in selfdefense against an armed attack or pursuant to a decision of the Security Council of the UN, to bring about a termination of a breach of the peace or a threat to the peace of the international community. The United States both during and after the Cold War has not shied away from the use of its considerable force, often provoking national and international controversy. Some instances, such as the Cuban missile crisis or Vietnam, have had profound effects on the selfunderstanding of the polity. The \"War against Terrorism\" has ushered in yet a new challenge in this area. This seminar first examines the international legal framework and then surveys the principal instances of American use of force from Korea to Iraq. At issue are both the legality of past and present American practices and the adequacy of controlling international law and institutions.    J. H. H. WEILER is University Professor and European Union Jean Monnet Chair at NYU Law School. He serves as Chairman of the NYU Global Law School Program and is also Director of the Jean Monnet Center for International and Regional Economic Law &amp; Justice. He was previously Professor of Law at the Michi gan Law School and then the Manley Hudson Professor of Law and Jean Monnet Chair at Harvard Law School. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as a WTO Panel Member. He is a founding editor of the European Journal of International Law , of the European Law Journal , and of the World Trade Review . His recent publications include The European Court of Justice (2001, with G. de Burca), The EU, the WTO and the NAFTA (2000), The Constitution of Europe (1998), and a novella, Der Fall Steinmann (2000).    Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos? (V50.0306; call # 74717) Instructor: Jorge G. Castaeda Friday, 9:30a.m.-12:00p.m.    This seminar focuses on several aspects of Latin America?s problems in the past and their possible solutions today. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and vigor of civil society today. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present.    JORGE G. CASTAEDA is returning to NYU in fall 2003 as Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies . Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth. A principal strategist in the election campaign of President Vicente Fox in 2000, he served as Mexico?s Foreign Minister from late 2000 until early 2003. He is the author of eight books, including, in English, Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left after the Cold War, Compa?ero: The Life and Death of Che Guerva , and Perpetuating Power . He has also written articles for many newspapers and magazines in Mexico, the United States, and other countries.    How We See (V50.0307; call # 74724) Instructor: Peter Lennie Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The ease with which we comprehend the visual world, and recognize objects and events, makes it easy to take our perceptual capabilities for granted. Only when we try to build machines that can see, or when we encounter people who have lost some specific visual capability?for example, persons who can no longer recognize faces, or for whom the world no longer appears in color?do we realize how extraordinary and intricate is the machinery of sight. This course looks at what we know about how we see. We know quite a lot about it from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing, and provides important pointers to the workings of visual mechanisms; neurology provides further insight by showing us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; computer science helps us understand design principles that are important making machines that can see; neuroscience tells us about the working details at the level of cells an neural systems. In this course we explore what these various disciplines together tell us about how we see.    PETER LENNIE is Professor of Neural Science , as well as Dean for Science in the Faculty of Arts and Science. Before joining NYU, in 1999, he was at the University of Rochester for 16 years. His scientific research has dealt with several fundamental questions about the operation of the human visual system; most recently, it has focused on the organization and specialization of the visual cortex, exploring the degree to which different regions of the cortex are specialized for different functions.    A Real Play of Identities (V50.0308; call # 74839) Instructor: Anna Deavere Smith Monday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    In this course, students will study and play roles from dramatic literature, film, television, real life, and history that they specify as unlike themselves and outside their realm of understanding. This is not a performance course per se, and no previous acting experience is required. Performance is used here as a way of knowing, rather than as a product for the purposes of entertaining. Students will be engaged in an ongoing discussion of what it takes to move from one identity to another, one cultural way of being to another, from one moment in personal history to another, from one moment in global history to another. The relationship of language and gesture to identity will be explored. Note: Interested students must submit a written statement (no longer than one page), to be reviewed by the instructor, explaining what interests them about the subject. The statement can be mailed to 100 Washington Square East, Room 908, New York, NY 10003; faxed to 212-995-4811; or emailed to ccp1@nyu.edu.    ANNA DEAVERE SMITH is a University Professor and Professor of Performance Studies in the Tisch School of the Arts, as well as an Affiliate of the NYU Law School. She is the Founder and Director of the Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue. Her publications include Twilight-Los Angeles, 1992, Talk to Me: Listening between the Lines, and Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and Other Identities. Her acting credits include the films The American President, Dave, and Philadelphia and the television series Presidio Med, The West Wing, and The Practice. A recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship, she has also received two Tony Award nominations and been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.    From the Birth of Tragedy to the Birth of Pleasure (V50.0309; call # 74875) Instructor: Carol Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The birth of tragedy symbolized by the story of Oedipus has long been linked with the birth of Western civilization. In this seminar, we will examine this linkage and also a tradition of resistance that extends from Greek tragedy through 19th-century fugitive slave narratives to the liberation movements of the late 20th century and postcolonial fiction. The Birth of Pleasure picks up this tradition of resistance and shows its psychological roots in studies of infancy, research with adolescent girls and young boys, and the findings of neuroscience. Knowing a tragic story, how do we keep from repeating it? Readings will be drawn from psychology and literature, and students will write short weekly reflection papers as well as a final paper.    CAROL GILLIGAN came to NYU as a University Professor in 2002. For the preceding 34 years she was on the faculty of Harvard University, where her award-winning research on gender and human development led to the creation of Harvard's first professorship in gender studies. Her 1982 book, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development, has been translated into 17 languages. Her most recent book, The Birth of Pleasure, was published last year.    Music and Power in China (V50.0310; call # 74874) Instructor: Mercedes M. Dujunco Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.    In China, music has long been viewed as having the ability to affect cosmological forces and influence people's thinking and behavior. It is therefore not surprising that Chinese rulers throughout the ages have tried to control the kind of music that is publicly performed and listened to by their constituents. They recognized early on that music signifies and that a key to power is regulating and fixing the meanings produced through music. This seminar examines the extent to and the various ways in which power is implicated in music and music-related practices in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Through discussions based on a combination of selected ethnomusicological readings, films/videos, and music recordings related to specific case studies dealing with state politics, identity, gender, and ethnic relations, students gain insights on how music continues to be a highly charged symbol in the Chinese-speaking regions of East Asia today.    MERCEDES M. DUJUNCO is Assistant Professor of Ethnomusicology in the Department of Music. She has written on Chinese and Vietnamese folk music, film music, and popular music and is currently working on a book about music and power in the context of Chaozhou Chinese voluntary associations in Hong Kong, mainland China, and Thailand.

In this course we look for universals in forms and patterns across the disciplines. To understand why such universals appear we must examine function. The key concept is indeed the relation between form and function. Topics explored with the viewpoint of form and function include biology (from cells to ecosystems), psychology, sociology, linguistics, literature, art, architecture, engineering, mythology, politics, and religion. Students learn a powerful methodology for thinking and problem solving. They are encouraged to pursue individual interests while participating in an environment of sharing.    TYLER VOLK , Associate Professor of Biology , specializes in understanding the role of life in Earth?s biogeochemical cycles and has conducted research for NASA. With a passion for the interdisciplinary, he also investigates the generation of pattern in the widest sense, at all levels of culture and nature. Spanning the technical to the popular, his numerous articles have appeared in such magazines as Nature, Bioscience, New Scientist, The Sciences , and Natural History . He has published three books: Metapatterns across Space, Time, and Mind; Gaia?s Body: Toward a Physiology of Earth ; and What Is Death?: A Scientist Looks at the Cycle of Life .    Baseball and American Culture (V50.0206; call # 72301) Instructor: Carl E. Prince Wednesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    Baseball is neither a metaphor for life nor a perfect explanation for the uniqueness of American culture or American character. But sport?and, for some cogent reasons, baseball in particular? does provide a way into an examination of major contemporary historical questions in the areas of race, gender, and class. The Brooklyn Dodgers? pioneering role in American racial integration in the years after World War II, for example, and the Yankees? early failure to follow suit provide useful laboratories for a study of race. The strongly macho character of baseball reveals basic gender aspirations and prejudices more subtly evoked in other areas of American life. To the extent that baseball is indeed a workingclass game, fan involvement reveals much about the nature of urban class values and tensions in the 20th century. A fulllength baseballrelated research paper is required.    CARL E. PRINCE is Professor of History Emeritus and past president of the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic. He has published four books and numerous articles on early American political culture and edited the five-volume Papers of William Livingston . A former baseball player and lifelong fan, he is also the author of Brooklyn?s Dodgers: The Bums, the Borough, and the Best of Baseball (1996), which opened for him a new academic field.    Computer Simulation (V50.0207; call # 72302) Instructor: Charles S. Peskin Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00?3:15 p.m. Prerequisites: AP calculus and physics    Since the starting point for any computer simulation is a mathematical model (i.e., a collection of equations that describe the phenomenon to be simulated), the true prerequisite for this seminar is a love of mathematics, especially calculus. Computer simulation is one way that mathematics gets applied to the real world. In this handson course students learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological processes. Examples include the orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of epidemic and endemic diseases in a population, including the evolution of a population in response to an endemic disease; the production of sound by musical instruments; the flow of traffic on a highway or in a city; and the electrical activity of nerves. The seminar meets alternately in a classroom and in a computer laboratory setting. The techniques needed to perform computer simulations, and to present the results in terms of elementary graphics, animations, and sounds, are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by students working individually or in teams. Topics for student projects may be drawn from those discussed in class as listed above, but students are also free to do other projects that reflect their own interests.    CHARLES S. PESKIN is Professor of Mathematics and Neural Science . His field of research is mathematical modeling and computer simulation applied to biology and medicine. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a former MacArthur Fellow, and a recipient of the Mayor?s Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, as well as the Great Teacher Award of the NYU Alumni Association.    Professional Responsibility: Markets, Ethics, and Law (V50.0208; call # 72303) Instructor: Daniel Diamond Monday, 11:00 a.m.?1:30 p.m.    Every individual, regardless of his or her chosen field of study or occupation, will in time function as a professional or manager in a business, notforprofit, or government organization. This course is designed to enable individuals to think critically about the ethical context and consequences of the decisions they will make in their respective professional and organizational settings. In previous generations understanding and practicing one?s professional responsibilities was a desirable, if not required, behavior. In our society today it is a necessity. We explore the reasons for this change and, by examining the interactions between the marketplace, societal norms, and the law, develop the ethical analytical and reasoning tools necessary to identify and weigh often competing interests. Ideally this enables individuals to make decisions that simultaneously cause no harm to the affected parties?customers, coworkers, community, etc.?further the goals of the organization, and enhance the professional career of the decision maker. The requisite ethical reasoning tools are developed through a series of cases and related readings dealing with a variety of topics, including ethics of the individual business professional, product liability, the social responsibility of the corporation, moral standards across borders, ethical issues in financial markets, termination and downsizing, sexual harassment, and privacy. Since this is a case course, students play an active role in the learning process during class sessions.    DANIEL DIAMOND is Professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business. He served as Dean of the Stern Undergraduate College and as Vice Dean of the Stern School from 1985 to 1995. He also held the position of Dean of the College of Management Science at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell and Director of the Northeast Region Small Business Development Center. He has published extensively in the areas of U.S. economic history, labor force trends, and labor policy. He currently teaches \"The Global Business Environment: International Macroeconomics and Finance\" and \"Professional Responsibility\" in the Stern School?s M.B.A. program.    Great Poems (V50.0209; call # 72304) Instructor: David Lehman Tuesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    The aim of this course is to change your life. We will read a selection of the greatest poems in the English language and consider what makes them great. We will discuss what distinguishes American from British poetry, and we will give some attention to questions of poetic influence and methods of composition. But the primary focus will be on reading, interpreting, and evaluating the poems themselves. The poets under consideration will include Shakespeare, Donne, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Byron, Whitman, Dickinson, Yeats, Eliot, Frost, Stevens, Auden, and Bishop. The course will conclude with some examples of contemporary American poetry.    DAVID LEHMAN is a celebrated poet, distinguished critic, and influential editor. In 1988 he initiated \"The Best American Poetry,\" and he continues as the general editor of this acclaimed anthology series. In 1991 he published a critique of deconstruction entitled Signs of the Times: Deconstruction and the Fall of Paul de Man . His other books include The Evening Sun , his most recent collection of poems, and The Perfect Murder , a study of murder mysteries. The Last AvantGarde: The Making of the New York School of Poets appeared in 1998. He is editor of the forthcoming new edition of The Oxford Book of American Poetry . He has also taught at Columbia University, New School University, Bennington College, and Hamilton College.    Language and Reality in 20th Century Science and Literature (V50.0210; call # 72305) Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00?3:15 p.m.    The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the socalled two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \"postmodern\" literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg?s \"uncertainty principle\" and the \"undecidability\" of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon and from nontechnical texts on quantum and chaos theories.    FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German and Director of Undergraduate Studies in the department. Winner of the College?s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching, the University?s Distinguished Teaching Medal, and its Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master?s Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on 20thcentury German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.    Understanding the Vietnam War (V57.0216; call # 74290) Instructor: Marilyn B. Young Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.?1:30 p.m.    The Vietnam War, which ended over twenty years ago, continues to resonate in American society. It is often described as more \"divisive\" than any other war in American history with the exception of the Civil War. This seminar explores the history of the war and its impact. In addition to reading competing historical analyses, we shall read novels, screen movies, and discuss the war with both participants and participant observers. When possible, the authors of some of the books we read will take part in the class. By the end of the term we may not be able to answer the old question \"Why Vietnam?\" but we shall certainly be closer to understanding how it happened and perhaps even what it meant.    MARILYN B. YOUNG is Professor of History . She teaches Asian history and the history of U.S. relations with Asia and is the author of The Vietnam Wars, 1945?1990 and of numerous essays on the war and the way it has been remembered.    Cinema and Affect: Why the Movies Move Us (V50.0217; call # 74291) Instructor: Charles Affron Thursday, 9:30 a.m.?12:00 noon    Popular cinema most obviously appeals to its viewers by telling stories and representing a semblance of life. But if the movies ultimately move us they do so because they convey story and truetolifeness through style and through the specific properties of the cinematic medium. This seminar focuses on \"conventional\" narrative films of the 1930s and 1940s to examine how (1) the weight of style and (2) the intrinsically emotional elements of the medium elicit the viewer?s affective response. The model of life serves the model of art; viewers respond to the medium when its conditions echo those of life. Film beguiles viewers to enter into its processes, and then uses those processes to capture lifelike representations of emotional situations. How do framing, display, staging, camera movement, sound, theatricality, irony, and duration conspire with narrative to move us to tears? How are viewers impelled to move with moving pictures, to be moved by them?    CHARLES AFFRON is Professor of French and Director of Graduate Studies in that department. In addition to books on the French novel and on the French Romantic theater and poetry, he has published Star Acting: Gish, Garbo, Davis, Divine Garbo (in French) , Cinema and Sentiment , and Sets in Motion (with Mirella Jona Affron), a study of the relationship between set design and narrative in cinema. In 2001 he published the biography Lillian Gish: Her Legend, Her Life .    The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America (V50.0218; call # 72306) Instructor: John E. Sexton Monday, 6:45?8:45 p.m.    Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of Church and State; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a 21st century liberal constitutional democracy.    JOHN E. SEXTON , President of New York University , was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and he has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.    Literature, Film, and the Artistic Environment of Arab Society in the 20th Century (V50.0223; call # 72307) Instructor: Mona N. Mikhail Wednesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    This seminar investigates themes in the Arabic artistic and literary milieu over the course of the 20th century. Through the primary lens of poetry and prose (including essays, novels, and short stories), it examines the crossmedia influences on cultural production and artists? engagement with political events of the 20th century. Students view films and documentaries, especially those produced from the works of the Nobel Prize?winning novelist Naguib Mahfouz ( Midaq Alley, Miramar, etc.), and discuss the influence of major crossover themes from literature (EastWest dialogue, nationalism, antiimperialism, and existentialism) on filmmakers. Attention is also paid to similar themes in plastic arts and architecture, as represented by the artists Moukhtar, Mahmoud Said, and Wissa Wassef and the architect Hassan Fathy.    MONA N. MIKHAIL , Associate Professor of Middle Eastern Studies , is the author of numerous books, notably Studies in the Short Fiction of Naguib Mahfouz and Yusuf Idris , and has written extensively on the cultural, social, and political context of modern Arabic literature, while also translating several important Arabic works into English. She is currently working on the growing body of women?s literature in the Arab world and exploring women?s role in popular culture/literature in oral genres such as proverbs, drama, song, and humor. Seen and Heard will be published in summer 2003. She also recently directed and produced a documentary about the theater in Egypt.    Freedom, Classical Liberal Principles, and 21stCentury Problems (V50.0227; call # 72308) Instructor: Mario J. Rizzo Monday, 4:55?7:25 p.m.    The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the principles of classical liberalism through the discussion of theoretical and empirical issues in economics, law, and ethics. \"Classical liberalism\" is the political, economic, social, and moral philosophy that is severely skeptical of the power of the state and seeks to reduce its power over the citizen. It advances the view that society, under the rule of law, is largely selfregulating, and so government intervention, whether in economic or social affairs, is either unnecessary or simply makes problems worse. Sometimes classical liberalism is called \"19thcentury liberalism,\" but its development has roots in ancient Roman thought, in the 18thcentury Scottish Enlightenment, as well as in many strains of 20thcentury philosophy and economics. Its leading thinkers have included Adam Smith, F. A. Hayek, and Milton Friedman. The course considers philosophical principles and empirical issues in the context of contemporary problems, such as free trade, property rights, income distribution, and socialreligious toleration.    MARIO J. RIZZO is Associate Professor of Economics in the Department of Economics, as well as codirector of the Austrian Economics Program. His fields of research lie at the interface of a number of academic subjects, including the economic analysis of law; ethics and economics; and the methodology and philosophy of economics. He also has a longstanding interest in political philosophy. He is the author (with Gerald O?Driscoll) of The Economics of Time and Ignorance , many articles in law journals, and philosophically oriented articles on economic theory.    Punk to Postmodernism: The Downtown New York Avant-Garde Scene since 1975 (V50.0232; call # 74606) Instructor: Marvin J. Taylor Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.?12:00 noon    Punk, performance art, postmodernism, graffiti art, minimalism, conceptual art?these are just some of the topics examined in this course. Following the Vietnam War, artists, writers, and musicians moved into the abandoned industrial lofts of Soho and the Lower East Side, and an explosion of creative activity produced one of the most important outsider art movements of this century. The first half of the course focuses on the Soho scene, where, outside of the mainstream of the art and literary world of uptown venues, artists began to forge a new way of looking at the creation of works of art that has forever changed American culture. After the gentrification of Soho, the scene shifted to the East Village, where the work became more hardedged and influenced by the ethnic mix of the Lower East Side. The second half of the course focuses on this distinct scene. It centers on some of the major questions that arise from the works of downtown artists and the scene in which they worked: what is inside/outside, high/low, modern/postmodern, art/activism, sex/sexuality, and identity/performance. Works studied include literature, photography, film, and performance art by such artists as Kathy Acker, Dennis Cooper, David Wojnarowicz, Keith Haring, Nan Goldin, Barbara Kruger, Lynne Tillman, Laurie Anderson, Michel Foucault, and JeanFran?ois Lyotard.    MARVIN J. TAYLOR , Director of the Fales Library and Special Collections at NYU , is also the curator of the Downtown New York Collection, the only archive of books, manuscripts, photos, film, and other materials related to the downtown scene. He has published in scholarly and popular magazines, assemblings, and avantgarde anthologies, including The Crimes of the Beats and the Japanese publication American Book Jam . Among his other research interests are Victorian fiction, queer theory, and the epistemology of libraries.    First Amendment Freedom of Expression (V50.0235; call # 72309) Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00?3:15 p.m.    Conflicts over freedom of speech erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A tobacco company sues a major television network for libel. Press disclosures threaten the fairtrial rights of defendants in major criminal trials. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests of society. This course begins by examining the struggle against seditious libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. Students examine freedom of speech through the prism of a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons; political dissent that advocates overthrow of the government; prior restraints against publication; obscenity and pornography; flag burning; free press versus fair trial; and inflictions of emotional distress. Students read and analyze important decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.    STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is Associate Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication and Director of the Program in Business and Economic Reporting. He teaches courses on First Amendment law in which he focuses on the legal rights of the press. His research interests include both law and business, and he writes frequently on both topics for national publications. He is coauthor of Building 6: The Tragedy at Bridesburg , an investigation of cancer deaths at a chemical company, and is currently working on a book about the First Amendment religion case Abington School District v. Schemp.    Performance and Society (V50.0238; call # 73992) Instructor: Richard Schechner Wednesday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    What are the many ways that performance inflects personal and social life? How can a grasp of performance theories inform us about society? What can we learn about the performances of everyday life, the life roles that we each play? How do these relate to sacred and secular rituals, sports and other popular entertainments, trials and the legislative process, the performance of medicine and business, the internet, and the performing arts? In this seminar we explore performance as a broad spectrum of activities by focusing on particular examples drawn from specific genres of performance. These include Trinidad Carnival, the Ramlila Cycle Play of northern India, the trial of those accused of witchcraft in 17thcentury Salem, Massachusetts, and the trial of O. J. Simpson, the modern Olympic Games, the performance of race and gender, and the performance of medicine. In most of these instances we compare how materials are treated socially to how they are treated aesthetically (e.g., the rendering of the Salem witch trials in court records of the time and in Arthur Miller?s play The Crucible ). In addition to readings and discussions, seminar members attend selected performances in New York ranging from theater to sports to trials to surgery.    RICHARD SCHECHNER is a University Professor of Performance Studies who teaches at the Tisch School of the Arts and the NYU Law School. He is also a professional theater director whose most recent work is Yokastas, coauthored with Saviana Stanescu and produced at La Mama in March?April 2003. Schechner is a widely published author and editor of the renowned journal TDR: The Drama Review . His 2002 book, Performance Studies, An Introduction , is the basic text used in the seminar.    In Search of Lost Time (V50.0240; call # 72311) Instructor: Marcelle Clements Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.?1:30 p.m.    We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically? with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel in seven volumes and 4,500 pages, In Search of Lost Time addresses literature?s richest theme: desire?its remembrance, loss, perversion, defeat, triumph, and final resurgence in the form of art. Almost 100 years old, it remains a dazzling portrait of turnofthecentury French beau monde and, even more, of the power and elegance of its narrator?s sensibility. It is still unparalleled in how it combines breadth, virtuosity, and irony, the author?s extraordinary psychological acuity and the glamour of his world, as well as how it merges social history, ennui, and lust. It is also one of the world?s greatest, most pleasurable, and elating reads. Although Marcel Proust (1871?1922) is usually assumed to be France?s greatest novelist, his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move on, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while the texture of In Search of Lost Time (association, evocation, magnification, play of words and memory) may have been its most radical contribution to the art of the novel, this work cannot be understood until it has been read in its entirety. In this seminar, we will keep moving at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, Time Regained.    MARCELLE CLEMENTS is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Her articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations ; a novel, Rock Me ; and a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman: Single Women Reinventing Single Life . Her most recent book is a novel, Midsummer.    Rethinking Who We Are: Interpersonal Approaches to the Person (V50.0247; call # 73677) Instructor: Michael Westerman Monday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    There are unresolved tensions in the field of psychology between individualcentered and interpersonal models of the person. The seminar is based on the belief that in order to make progress on these unresolved issues we need to recognize that they refer to a longstanding fundamental question philosophers began wondering about centuries before the discipline of psychology came into existence?What place do our relationships with other people have in our lives? Moreover, we need to engage in an inquiry that involves a dynamic interplay between psychological and philosophical considerations. Participants in the seminar learn about work in several specific areas where these tensions appear, including models of child development, approaches to psychopathology, and basic questions about psychotherapy. We also consider more \"interpersonal\" versus more individualcentered ways in which psychologists think about interpersonal interaction itself. The final topic concerns the philosophy of the social sciences. We look at recent contributions by psychologists and philosophers suggesting that we replace traditional concepts of the process of psychological research with a social view of that process. Throughout the seminar, we refer to classic philosophical texts and contributions by historians of ideas to explore critically the ways in which contemporary efforts by psychologists reflect concepts of the person from our philosophical tradition.    MICHAEL A. WESTERMAN is Associate Professor of Psychology and a member of the faculty in the clinical psychology doctoral training program. He has conducted research on several topics concerning interpersonal relationships, including studies of motherchild interaction, family systems, and the patienttherapist relationship in psychotherapy. His publications also include articles on issues in philosophical psychology. He is currently involved in a program of research based on an interpersonal reconceptualization of psychological defenses he has developed, which is called the theory of interpersonal defense.    New Media Law and Content Creation (V50.0253; call # 72314) Instructor: Karl P. Kilb Monday, 6:20?8:50 p.m.    This course explores the legal and journalistic issues surrounding the creation and distribution of content in the \"Electronic Information Age.\" Content is a commodity that is packaged in many forms, known as \"media.\" We are all consumers of content, which is tailored by each media organization to target specific audiences. Consumers base their content choices on the type of information, as well as on the method of delivery. The traditional print and broadcast media have found a powerful, relatively inexpensive new means of distribution: the Internet. The rapid packaging of content by means of new technology has forced content creators and distributors to develop new interpretations to fundamental intellectual property issues, including copyright law. The seminar will promote active research and discussions with leaders in the media and legal professions, and explore how legislation and industry practices are responding to new technology.    KARL P. KILB, ESQ. , is the General Counsel of Bloomberg LP, managing a global Legal/Contracts Department. Before becoming an attorney in 1995, he was a broadcast journalist at FNN, CNBC, 1010 WINS Radio, Bloomberg, and various other networks and stations in New York for twelve years, having graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in broadcast journalism from NYU. He frequently lectures at universities and industry organizations about media and intellectual property law.    School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies (V50.0255; call # 74604) Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum Tuesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    The decades of the 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation and of New York University. This course aims to develop an appreciation of information seeking and recording in a research environment. In essence, students will research NYU?s recent history by means of library research methods learned in the course. Through the examination of primary and secondary materials, accompanied by the personal narratives of faculty who were on campus during those times, students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition to doing shared background readings, class members will develop a research paper or a finding aid about their chosen topic.    ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is an Associate Curator in the Bobst Library and an Adjunct Professor in the English Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science. He is currently the librarian for education in the Social Sciences Department. First as a student and then as faculty, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.    Modern Concepts of Matter and the Cosmos (V50.0256; call # 72315) Instructor: Daniel Zwanziger Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.?12:15 p.m. Prerequisite: high school physics    Since the 1970s our understanding of matter has been dominated by a paradigm known as \"the Standard Model\" of elementary particle physics. According to this model, the basic forces of nature are the strong and electroweak forces that are transmitted by \"gauge\" fields, and the gravitational force that is described by general relativity. Elementary particles are either the quanta of the gauge fields themselves, including gluons and photons, or quarks and leptons that interact and are bound by the exchange of these quanta. This seminar reviews the Standard Model and the evidence for it. The geometric character of gauge and gravitational fields is described. Modern theories of the cosmos are presented, in the light of recent observations. Since the nature of modern physical theories is quite mathematical and geometrical, students taking this course should be intrigued by mathematical concepts.    DANIEL ZWANZIGER is Professor of Physics . His special research interest is quantum field theory applied to elementary particles. His most recent publications deal with the theory of quarks and gluons known as quantum chromodynamics.    The Serotonin System: The Master Regulator of the Brain (V50.0258; call # 74603) Instructor: Efrain Azmitia Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.?12:00 noon    The human brain, one of the most fascinating and challenging frontiers in modern science, contains hundreds of individual chemical systems that form interacting networks adapted for the survival of the organism and the species. This course focuses on the cells that release a small aminoacid derivative called serotonin. Serotonin has been implicated in a vast array of functions, ranging from aggression, sexual behavior, sleeping, and learning to regulation of hormone release, eating, and neurotrophic factor secretion. Many mindaltering drugs (LSD, psilocybin, ecstasy, cocaine, alcohol, etc.) act on serotonin neurons. In humans, serotonin dysfunction is associated with such mental disorders as bulimia, depression, autism, Down?s syndrome, and Alzheimer?s disease. The course assumes no prior knowledge of neurosceince. Its interdisciplinary approach crosses traditional fields like biology, chemistry, psychology, anthropology, pharmacology, anatomy, neurology, and psychiatry. Readings and discussions are complemented by laboratory visits, demonstrations, and films.    EFRAIN AZMITIA is head of NYU's Laboratory of Molecular Neuroplasticity in the Department of Biology , member of the Center for Neural Science, Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry at the NYU Medical Center, and a National Institute of Mental Health Career Scientist awardee. He has held appointments in Great Britain, France, Japan, and Israel, as well as in the United States. He has written over 200 articles, edited four books, organized over 20 international meetings, and lectured thoughout the world. He is on the editorial board of Brain Research, Synapse, NeuroscienceNet (www.neuroscience.com), and other professional journals.    The Etruscans (V50.0261; call # 74601) Instructor: Larissa Bonfante Monday and Wednesday, 2:00?3:15 p.m.    This course deals with the arts, history, and language of the wealthy Etruscan cities that flourished in central Italy from 1000 to 100 B.C. Because their language is unrelated to any other in the world and their own literature has disappeared, we must study them through their art?of which a considerable amount has survived. The class reads what the Greeks and Romans, their rivals and neighbors, said about them, compares this to the reality of their religion, society, and customs, and learns about their remarkable technical achievements in divination, jewelry making, metalwork, road building, and other crafts. New excavations and discoveries are constantly bringing forth fresh proof of their importance in the ancient Mediterranean world, in which they traded with the Near East, Carthage, Greece, and Rome, and their influence in Rome and in Europe, to which they brought the culture of cities. Work with the Classics Department?s collection of Etruscan antiquities allows students to see original Etruscan art and inscriptions and to have handson experience with Etruscan archaeological material.    LARISSA BONFANTE is Professor of Classics and the author of books and articles on Etruscan language, society, culture, and influence. Etruscan Life and Afterlife , which she edited, is used as a textbook in universities in the United States and in Europe. She is also a winner of the College?s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.    From Milton to Mingus (V50.0264; call # 72317) Instructor: Perry Meisel Monday and Wednesday, 3:30?4:45 p.m.    This course examines the relation between influence and originality in canonical artists from Milton to Charles Mingus, and how it impacts culture at large. A growing preoccupation with mediocrity defines the history of literature from the Renaissance to modernism, and makes imaginative autonomy the site of ideal artistic success; in jazz, the tension between group and soloist is present from the start. What are the ironies that assail these histories? What are the paradoxes that both install their ideals and deconstruct their possibility? Recognizing the unconscious influences that guide the reader?s or the listener?s responses is the course?s second, and parallel, focus. Readings include Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Keats, Whitman, Pater, Freud, Virgina Woolf, and Ralph Ellison. Musicians include Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis; Lester Young, Charlie Parker, and John Coltrane; and Charles Mingus.    PERRY MEISEL , Professor of English , is the author of numerous books and articles, including The Myth of the Modern and The Cowboy and the Dandy . In addition to writing about literature, psychoanalysis, and critical theory, he has also written extensively about jazz and rock, principally for the Village Voice . He has taught at NYU since 1975.    Terrorism, Nihilism, and Modernity (V50.0267; call # 72320) Instructor: James Gilligan Thursday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    The past century has witnessed violence the character and scale of which are so unique and unprecedented that we have had to create a new vocabulary to describe it (genocide, terrorism) and the ideologies that underlie it (totalitarianism, fundamentalism). To understand modern violence, we will examine the origin of the modern mind in the 17th century, when science, based on universal doubt, ended the Age of Faith, and the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority lost credibility. Nietzsche called this the \"death of God\" (and the Devil); it could also be called the death of Good and Evil, leading to another set of new words (nihilism, agnosticism, anomie, anarchy). We will study the origins and implications of these developments by reading Shakespeare and John Donne, Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, Beckett and Wittgenstein, Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well as modern mass murderers from Hitler to bin Laden. Finally, we will ask whether the modern human sciences can help us understand how to reverse or at least limit this escalation of violence.    JAMES GILLIGAN headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry. He is now an Adjunct Professor at NYU, Director of the Center for the Study of Violence, a member of President Clinton?s National Commission on Youth Violence, and author of Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic and Preventing Violence: An Agenda for the Coming Century .

The Art of the Enemy (V50.0270; call # 72323) Instructor: Hector Feliciano Wednesday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    The destruction of the art of the enemy, or cultural looting, has almost always been one of the staple byproducts of international, civil, or religious strife. From ancient or biblical times to the recent wars in the former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, art plunder and the willful destruction of cultural patrimony?from palaces, museums, libraries, churches, mosques, and synagogues to paintings, statues, icons, and books?have been used by the victors as a supplementary means to conquer, annihilate, and humiliate the enemy. By studying some examples of destruction and looting, we will explore the enemies? fascinating political, aesthetic, or religious justifications for these acts. We will also consider why some enemies destroy, while others simply take along, sell, or abandon; we will describe the positive and negative role of museums in some of these events, and learn how the \"values of collecting\" and the creation of museums may have helped to preserve art destined to be destroyed or looted by others. Above all, we will constantly be redefining what art is and what it means? to us and to our enemies. There will be guest speakers and field trips to museums.    HECTOR FELICIANO is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Formerly cultural writer for the Paris bureaus of the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times , he is the author of The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World?s Greatest Works (1997); first published in French, this work has since been translated into several other languages. He served on the Panel of Experts of the Presidential Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States. He is the organizer of the First International Symposium on Cultural Property and Patrimony (Columbia University, 1999) and of a panel discussion entitled \"The Art of the Enemy\" (School of Visual Arts in New York City, 2002).    What Makes a Great Leader?: Perspectives from Government, Law, and Business (V50.0275; call # 72328) Instructor: Diane C. Yu Monday, 6:30?9:00 p.m.    Machiavelli wrote in 1532, \"There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.\" This seminar explores some of the ways in which leaders, particularly over the past two centuries, have risen in a number of settings. How do we define greatness in leadership? Have the standards remained static, or have they changed over time? How have leaders overcome the obstacles in their paths? What, if any, traits do they have in common? Do leaders make the times in which they serve, or do the times dictate the leaders who emerge? Are leadership skills innate, or can they be learned and developed? The seminar will stimulate thinking through readings and discussion about notable figures from politics and government, such as the Founding Fathers, Lincoln, Mandela, Gandhi, and Churchill, while looking at contemporary examples drawn from the business and legal world as well. Readings include selections from biography, Confucius, Shakespeare, analysis and commentary, history, and autobiography. The seminar also features sessions with prominent figures from the business, media, and political worlds who will discuss their views and firsthand observations about leadership.    DIANE C. YU is Chief of Staff and Deputy to the President of NYU. She has been a highranking executive at a Fortune 250 company, California judicial officer, general counsel for a California public corporation, and appointed by the President as a White House Fellow.

The Biology of Infectious Diseases (V50.0276; call # 74292) Instructors: Martin Blaser and Joel Ernst Wednesday, 4:55?7:25    Infectious diseases have shaped human biology, genes, culture, and imagination. After the advent of antibiotics, we thought that we could win the \"war\" on infectious diseases. Antibiotic resistance and AIDS, among other events, have taught us that the war is not winnable. Rather, we must understand our place in the microbial world and learn to adapt strategies that minimize infectious disease impact, and maximize our symbiosis with indigenous organisms. After introductory discussions, the course is conducted as a series of seminars by students on topics that provide greater understanding of the underlying biological issues. Topics that may be discussed include genetic susceptibility to diseases such as malaria, problems involved in antibiotic resistance, the evolution of HIV, good microbes vs. bad, and infectious diseases in the postmodern world.    MARTIN BLASER is the Frederick H. King Professor of Internal Medicine and Chairman of the Department of Medicine , and Professor of Microbiology at the NYU School of Medicine. A practicing physician, and specialist in Infectious Diseases, he has progressively become a biologist. His research interests have spanned clinical medicine, epidemiology, molecular biology and genetics, evolutionary biology, mathematics, and history. The recipient of numerous honors and awards, he is founder and publisher of the Bellevue Literary Review .    JOEL ERNST is the Jeffrey Bergstein Professor of Medicine, Director of Infectious Diseases, and Professor of Microbiology at the NYU School of Medicine. A clinician and specialist in infectious diseases, he directs his immunology research at discovery of mechanisms used by microbial pathogens to evade the immune system. He is a frequently sought speaker at international meetings on infectious diseases and immunology.    The Politics of Knowledge in the United States (V50.0277; call # 74607) Instructor: Thomas Bender Monday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    There are a variety of forms of knowledge (numerical, visual, narrative, analytical) associated with different disciplines, groups, and institutions. How does each obtain cultural significance and authority? What are the assumptions that support their claims as valid knowledge? To what extent are they \"mirrors of nature\"? To what extent do they reflect or reveal the \"position\" or human interests of those who articulate them, whether one thinks of personal qualities, class position, institutional location, or ideological commitment? How does one respond to such uncertainty about the sources and validity of knowledge claims? How do knowledge claims enter politics? How does one politically engage such claims?    THOMAS BENDER is University Professor of the Humanities and Professor of History . On the faculty of NYU since 1974, he has served as chair of the History Department and as Dean for the Humanities. His teaching and research interests cover the history of cities, intellectuals, and intellectual and cultural history more generally. His 14 published books include two directly related to this course, New York Intellect and Intellect and Public Life . His most recent books, both published in 2002, are Rethinking American History in a Global Age and The Unfinished City: New York and the Metropolitan Idea . He also frequently contributes to newspapers and magazines, including the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times .    Ethics, Pointillism, Epidemiology, and Epistemology: EPEE Dueling with Scientific Health Information (V50.0278; call # 74293) Instructor: Ralph V. Katz Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    The common citizen is well challenged?if not overly challenged? trying to deal with the flood of scientific health information as presented in the media. \"Scientific\" health find ings of this week seem to routinely conflict with the \"scientific\" health findings of last week. As the movie theme song asked so poignantly 35 years ago, \"What?s it all about, Alfie?\" This course explores that question as related to scientific health information as used both by individuals to make personal life decisions related to health behaviors and by society to protect its citizens via court decisions and governmental regulations. Concepts from the fields of ethics, art, and science are central to readings and discussions focused on how to make sense of it all. Beginning with the history and foundation concepts of bioethics and epidemiology, the course provides a frame for understanding how to make reasonable sense of this flood of scientific health information, i.e., what are the strengths and limitations (and misuses) of this free flow of scientific health findings in our democratic \"instant, electronic news\" world. Textbooks and videos cover background on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, polar bears, and rubbish. As the major course assignment, each student writes a newspaperstyle \"oped\" article, backed by an annotated bibliography.    RALPH V. KATZ is Professor of Epidemiology and Chair of the Department of Epidemiology &amp; Health Promotion in the NYU College of Dentistry. He is Director of the NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP (Research on Adolescent and Adult Health Promotion) Center and leads a current study investigating whether minorities are less willing to participate in biomedical studies as research subjects and, if so, why. Having served on the National Tuskegee Legacy Committee, he was a Presidential Invitee to the White House for President Clinton?s 1997 apology to the AfricanAmerican community. His epidemiologic research has ranged from oral disease studies to the development of epidemiologic research methods. In addition to his dental degree, he holds a master?s degree in public health and a Ph.D. in epidemiology.    W. E. B. Du Bois: The Making of a Radical Scholar Activist (V50.0279; call # 74351) Instructor: Jeff Goodwin Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    W. E. B. Du Bois (1868?1963) was one of the most remarkable scholars and political activists of the 20th century. The first AfricanAmerican to earn a doctorate at Harvard, Du Bois wrote perhaps the most trenchant analysis of the AfricanAmerican condition, The Souls of Black Folk (1903), the first sociological study of a Black community, The Philadelphia Negro (1899), and one of the most influential works of American history, Black Reconstruction in America (1935). Du Bois also founded the Niagara Movement in 1905, breaking decisively with the \"accommodationist\" politics of Booker T. Washington, and was a major figure in the PanAfricanist movement. This course examines the life, times, and writings of Du Bois, focusing on the years between his birth in 1868 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and 1910, when he left Atlanta University to become editor of The Crisis, the official publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The course tries to understand, among other issues, how such a remarkable and cosmopolitan individual could have emerged from such a humble and seemingly parochial background, a small town in western Massachusetts with a tiny AfricanAmerican community.    JEFF GOODWIN , Professor of Sociology , is author of No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945?1991 and coeditor of Passionate Politics: Emotions and Social Movements and The Social Movements Reader . He has taught courses on social movements and revolutions at NYU since 1991. His interests also include social theory and the AfricanAmerican tradition in sociology, including the works of Du Bois, Charles S. Johnson, E. Franklin Frazier, St. Claire Drake, and Oliver Cromwell Cox.    Rise of the Skyscraper (V50.0281; call # 74294) Instructor: Sarah Bradford Landau Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    New York City, as well as Chicago, contributed significantly to the creation of the skyscraper building type. Although the World Trade Center and plans for its rebuilding are likely to be discussed, the focus of the seminar is New York?s historic skyscrapers. We consider the urban factors that precipitated the desire to build tall; technological innovations?notably the elevator and iron and steel skeleton construction?that made it possible to build tall; the relation of form and style features to site conditions, building code provisions, and architectural aesthetics; and the contributions of individual architects. Introductory lectures on the early development of the skyscraper in New York and Chicago, tours of lower Manhattan?s skyscraper districts, midtown?s Chrysler and Empire State buildings, and class discussions based on assigned readings precede student oral presentations focused on specific case studies accompanied by slides. In preparation for their presentations and final papers, students experience using primary sources such as those in the city?s Municipal Archives in addition to reading the relevant published studies.    SARAH BRADFORD LANDAU , Professor of Fine Arts , has taught at NYU for 27 years and has received a Golden Dozen award for Excellence in Teaching. She is an authority on the New York sky scraper. Her publications related to the subject include Rise of the New York Skyscraper, 1865?1913 (with coauthor Carl W. Condit) and a monograph study of George B. Post, who contributed substantially to the creation of the skyscraper: George B. Post, Architect: Picturesque Designer and Determined Realist . She has also served as commissioner on the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and as commission vice chair.    From the Rise of Christianity to Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on Two Millennia (V50.0282; call # 74355) Instructor: Edward W. Lehman Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The new millennium has dawned with growing disenchantment with traditional leftright cleavages and with the claim that the United States is increasingly a nation of isolated individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is eroding civic virtues and our democratic institutions. Our aim is to assess the trajectory of our culture using the dimensions of autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism. This seminar begins by probing these diagnoses in the broader context of moral and social transformations in the West over the last two thousand years. We examine socialscience analyses of pivotal changes that have occurred in that period. We consider the sociologist Rodney Stark?s highly acclaimed The Rise of Christianity , which focuses on developments during the first four centuries of the first millennium of the common era. Our final reading is the political scientist Robert Putnam?s controversial Bowling Alone, which is currently the most publicized critique of contemporary American civic life.    EDWARD W. LEHMAN is a Professor of Sociology . His research interests include political sociology, cultural sociology, and sociological theory. He is the author of Coordinating Health Care: Explorations in Interorganizational Relations, Political Society: A Macrosociology of Politics , and The Viable Polity . He is coeditor of A Sociological Reader in Complex Organizations . In 2000 he edited and published Autonomy and Order: A Communitarian Anthology , a collection of original essays by 15 authors that explores how the fraying of shared moral understandings and the erosion of communal bonds affect our capacity to balance individual rights and collective responsibilities. He is currently book review editor of The Responsive Community .    Jews and Germans in Postwar Germany (V50.0283; call # 74417) Instructor: Marion Kaplan Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.    This course explores the sometimes painful, often angry, and always fascinating interactions and interlocking histories of Germans and Jews even after the Holocaust. It investigates the immediate postwar situation: the Jewish displaced persons, the U.S., English, French, and Russian occupying forces, and the German refugees from eastern territories. Students analyze how Germans, both East and West, did or did not come to terms with their Nazi pasts. They read perspectives of Jews on their lives in the Germanys, why they stayed, how they experienced their citizenship and their interactions with Germans, and how unification and the influx of Russian Jews affected them. They also analyze German perspectives: How did exNazis or bystanders think about their pasts? Did they cover them up? What did their children and grandchildren know? German and Jewish historical memories are contrasted, including Jewish memories of persecution and annihilation and German memories of suffering during the war. Moreover, students examine the ways Jews and Germans saw the student rebellion of 1968, the American TV series \"Holocaust\" in 1979, the \"Historians? Debate\" of the mid1980s, and the Goldhagen controversy of the 1990s. Finally, the politics of public commemoration in Germany are discussed.    MARION KAPLAN is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History . She has also taught at Queens College, CUNY. She is the author of The Jewish Feminist Movement in Germany: The Campaigns of the J?discher Frauenbund, l904?l938 (1979), The Making of the Jewish Middle Class: Women, Family, and Identity in Imperial Germany (1991), and Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany (1998). The last two won the National Jewish Book Award in their respective years. She has edited books in European women?s history? When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany and The Marriage Bargain: Dowries in European History ?and is currently editing and writing a history of Jewish daily life from the 17th century until 1945.    Bases of Chinese Culture: Philosophy and Literature (V50.0284; call # 73991) Instructor: Moss Roberts Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45    The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the essential themes and issues of traditional Chinese culture through eight representative works of philosophy and literature. The course concentrates on six philosophical texts in English translation? Confucius? Analects, Laozi?s Dao De Jing , the Mozi , the Mencius , the Chuang Tzu , and the Hsun Tzu ?plus two classic novels of the late imperial period, Three Kingdoms and Dream of the Red Chamber , also in English translation.    MOSS ROBERTS is Professor of Chinese and former Director of the East Asian Studies Program . His area of specialization is Chinese language, literature, and philosophy; he has also given courses on Japanese literature and on traditional Vietnamese history and culture. He has translated one of China?s major epics, Three Kingdoms , as well as Chinese Fairy Tales and Fantasies , part of the Pantheon series on folklore. His translation of Laozi?s Dao De Jing was published in 2001.    Waiting for Beckett (V50.0285; call # 74421) Instructor: Tom Bishop Thursday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    From the tramps of Waiting for Godot to the terminal characters of Endgame , to the frenzied narrators of his fictions, Beckett?s major works will be studied as powerful contemporary expressions of the human condition and as a fundamental calling into question of language itself. Beckett?s forceful images will be viewed as metaphors of existence and the tenacity of the Beckettian narrator to continue to speak/write despite all odds points to a positive affirmation. This \"obligation to express\" will be seen as one of the major constants in Beckett?s work?a dialectic of speech and silence, memorably reflected in the final words of The Unnamable : \". . . you must go on, I can?t go on, I?ll go on.\" Beckett will also be studied as one of the 20th century?s key innovators through the narrative strategies of his fiction and the theatrical conventions underlying his dramatic works. The seminar will concentrate on the period of Beckett?s greatest creativity, between 1946 and 1955, and on the late works, from 1970 until his death in 1989. Videotapes of performances and television productions will be used to complement readings, as will as Beckett?s one cinematic venture, Film.    TOM BISHOP is Florence Gould Professor of French Literature, Professor of Comparative Literature , and Chair of the Center for French Civilization and Culture. He chaired the Department of French for 33 years. He has written extensively on contemporary French fiction and drama and especially on the works of Samuel Beckett. Bishop, a past president of the Samuel Beckett Society, organized five major Beckett festivals in New York and in Paris, one of which earned him an OBIE award. He was a friend of Beckett?s for the last quarter century of the writer?s life. Bishop?s most recent book is From the Left Bank: Reflections on the Modern French Theater and Novel .    The Representation of \"the Other\" in the IsraeliPalestinian Cinema (V50.0286; call # 74297) Instructor: Shimon Dotan Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Representation of the Other is a variation of the search for selfidentity. The IsraeliPalestinian conflict, and its political cinema, exhibit a clear pattern in which the parties attribute to the Other qualities and traits that reflect their own distress and aspirations. This pattern is examined in a series of contemporary films (1980 to the present). Each class consists of a screening followed by a discussion concentrating on representation in the context of the political conflict, variations in the use of film language to achieve a subjective portrayal, and modalities of representation and self critique. Two guest speakers, a Palestinian and an Israeli, participate in two (or more) of these discussions. Screenings include Divine Intervention , by Elia Suleiman; Beyond the Walls , by Uri Barabash; Close, Closed, Closure , by Ram Loevi; The Milky Way , by Ali Nasser; and The Smile of the Lamb , by Shimon Dotan.    SHIMON DOTAN , a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an awardwinning filmmaker with ten feature films to his credit. His films were the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ) numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb ) and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). Dotan has taught filmmaking at Tel Aviv University in Israel and Concordia University in Montreal.    Yeats and Joyce (V50.0287; call # 74298) Instructor: Denis Donoghue Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    This course reads Yeats and Joyce in the context of modern Irish society and culture. Yeats and Joyce were very different writers, different in social and religious background, education, and literary affiliation. Each implies a different Ireland. Ideally, Yeats?s Ireland is heroic, pagan, rural, mythic; its modern version is occult, aristocratic, hierarchical. Ideally, Joyce?s Ireland is urban, lowermiddle or middle class, Catholic or (more often) lapsed Catholic. Even when Yeats and Joyce are \"European,\" they are European with different commitments. Yeats?s modern master is Nietzsche, Joyce?s is Ibsen. In aesthetics, Joyce?s precursor is Aquinas; Yeats appeals to the traditions of neoPlatonism and philosophic Ideal ism. A reading of Yeats and Joyce should cast a double light on the strange country they so diversely articulated.    DENIS DONOGHUE is University Professor and Henry James Professor of English and American Letters at NYU. He has also taught at University College, Dublin, and the University of Cambridge (where he was a Fellow of King?s College). His visiting professorships have been at Princeton, UCLA, Harvard, Edinburgh, and other universities. He is the author of about twenty books in literary criticism, theory, and literary biography. The books of particular relevance to this course are Jonathan Swift, Yeats, We Irish, The Ordinary Universe , and The Practice of Reading . He has also published Warrenpoint , a memoir of growing up in a small town in Northern Ireland.    Order, Liberty, and Terrorism: September 11 in Perspective (V50.0288; call # 74354) Instructors: Anthony Amsterdam and Jerome Bruner Thursday, 4:55-6:55 p.m.    The September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon taught the government and the people of the United States how vulnerable we are to massive violence. The president and Congress responded by declaring a \"War on Terrorism.\" One controversial feature of the war on terrorism has been military detention of suspected terrorists without trial and without access to legal counsel. Detention of this sort raises basic questions about how a democratic society should strike the balance between maintaining security and public order on the one hand and preserving individual liberty on the other. This seminar explores the problems of reconciling order and liberty in various settings: in the military detention cases now being argued in the law courts; in earlier cases decided by the courts from the days of Aaron Burr to our own time; in theater and film classics from Sophocles? Antigone to Fred Zinnemann?s A Man for All Seasons and Peter Brooks?s Lord of the Flies . Students write brief papers for each week?s class, analyzing the implications of the court opinions or literary works assigned.    ANTHONY AMSTERDAM and JEROME BRUNER are both University Professors at New York University and are joint authors of Minding the Law , a book that examines the role of narrative thinking and rhetoric in the legal process. Bruner, trained in psychology, which he has taught at Oxford and Harvard, now works on how psychological and cultural influences affect law. Amsterdam has been both law teacher and active litigator for many years, combining academic teaching with court work in constitutional law, criminal law, and civil liberties.    Classical Mythology (V50.0289; call # 74300) Instructor: Matthew S. Santirocco Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    Human beings are distinguished in part by their capacity for telling stories and their delight in hearing them. Some of these narratives become traditional not only for their entertainment value but also because they serve other purposes?to explain natural and human phenomena, for example, to explore crucial questions of human existence, or to support social organization. Often these stories also control behavior: as history shows, the myths we live by are also those for which we are prepared to die or to kill. This seminar takes as a case study the myths of ancient Greece and Rome. Texts are drawn from major classical authors, including Homer, Hesiod, the Greek dramatists, and Vergil. The stories chosen focus on such crucial concepts as cosmology, gender, sexuality, justice, political order, and rationality. Through them we shall also explore the relationship of myth to other types of traditional tale, the functions of myth in ancient societies, the connection of myth to religion and ritual, the comparison of Greek myths with those of other societies, and the persistence of these stories into the present time and our own personal and public lives.    MATTHEW S. SANTIROCCO is Dean of the College of Arts and Science , Professor of Classics , and Angelo J. Ranieri Director of Ancient Studies . His teaching interests include mythology, Greek and Roman literature, comparative literature, and comparative cultural studies. The author of a book on Latin lyric poetry ( Unity and Design in Horace?s Odes ), of several edited volumes, and of many scholarly articles, he is currently working on a book on the poetics of patronage in Augustan Rome. He was editor of the American Philological Association?s two monograph series and is at present editor of the journal Classical World .    Introduction to Literary Theory (V50.0290; call # 74419) Instructor: Ziad Elmarsafy Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    This course presents a structured approach to methods in reading and the theory of literature that prepares students for advanced work in literature. Readings cover a wide selection of texts dealing with the definition and function of Western literature, from Plato to the 21st century. Given the history of the association between \"theory\" writ large and the French intellectual history of the late 20th century, one important point of emphasis is the relationship between those French theorists who have proven most influential in the Englishspeaking world (Barthes, Lacan, Fou cault) and the reception of their ideas on this side of the Atlantic. The course is built around several modules, including the classical heritage; formalism; existentialism and phenomenology; structuralism and semiotics, psychoanalysis; historicism and politically based approaches to literature.    ZIAD ELMARSAFY is Associate Professor of French at NYU with interests in early modernity and the Enlightenment. He has published The Histrionic Sensibility: Theatricality and Identity from Corneille to Rousseau (2001) and Freedom, Slavery and Absolutism: Corneille, Pascal, Racine (forthcoming, 2004) as well as several articles on the literature of the 17th and 18th centuries. He is currently working on a study of the relationship between the understanding of Islam, the translation of the Qur?an, and the European Enlightenment.    Communications and Human Values (V50.0291; call # 74405) Instructor: Richard D. Heffner Tuesday, 6:20?8:50 p.m.    This seminar critically analyzes how much our sense of what it means to be an American at the dawn of the 21st century has been molded by the media, with particular reference to their socializing and valuelegitimating content. To deal with such media power, students are asked first to identify their own respective approaches to the proper relationship between the individual and the state through discussion both of selections from such readings as Walter Lippmann?s Public Opinion , Robert Merton?s Mass Persuasion , J. S. Mill?s On Liberty , Herman Melville?s Billy Budd , Neil Postman?s Amusing Ourselves to Death , and B. F. Skinner?s Beyond Freedom and Dignity , and of screenings of such films as Birth of a Nation, 12 Angry Men, Harvest of Shame, Hearts and Minds , and JFK . Finally, class emphasis is on such contemporary media issues as a Fairness Doctrine (the real or imagined \"chilling effect\" of a requirement for media fairness and balance); cameras in the courts (do televised trials enhance justice, or instead create a \"mobocracy\" with trial by a new jury of public opinion?); media selfregulation (can there in fact be meaningful voluntary selfdiscipline in a free market, free speech, mass media? driven society?).    RICHARD D. HEFFNER is Producer/Moderator of the weekly public television series The Open Mind , which he began nearly a half century ago. Earlier a broadcaster and executive at ABC, NBC, and CBS, in 1962 he became the Founding General Manager of New York?s pioneering Channel 13. Trained as an American historian, he is the author of A Documentary History of the United States (1952) and the editor of Tocqueville?s Democracy in America (1956). His newest book is a collaboration entitled Conversations with Elie Wiesel (2001), and his Conversations about America will appear next year. From 1974 to 1994 he served as Chairman of the film industry's voluntary classification and rating system in Hollywood, commuting from Rutgers, where he has been University Professor of Communications and Public Policy since 1964.    Moral Perfectionism (V50.0292; call # 74301) Instructor: Ulrich Baer Monday and Wednesday, 11:00-12:15p.m.    The tradition of moral perfectionism is part of Western thought and concerns a reflection on the self that places tremendous emphasis on the possibility and necessity of the transforming of oneself and one?s society. In this course we explore the contemporary significance of this emphasis on the possibility of transforming the self?after the much discussed death of the \"subject\"? by reading philosophical, literary, and political texts that combine this unrelenting belief in the possibility of a criticism of society from within with astounding rhetorical force. Readings include selections from Emerson, Melville, Thoreau, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Rilke, Hesse, Freud, Foucault, Cavell, Gilligan, and Arendt.    ULRICH BAER , Associate Professor of German and Comparative Literature , is interested in how historical and personal catastrophes can be adequately communicated to others through literature, photography, and art. He is the author of Remnants of Song: Trauma and Modernity in Charles Baudelaire and Paul Celan and Spectral Evidence: The Photography of Trauma , as well as the editor of the literary anthology 110 Stories: New York Writes after September 11 . He has received the College?s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.    Modern Music in Paris, 1890?1940 (V50.0293; call # 74608) Instructor: Victor Fell Yellin Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00?3:15 p.m.    Beginning with Debussy, Satie, Faur?, Vincent d?Indy, and Ravel, the course traces the evolution of modernism in music as it unfolded in Paris. By choosing new standards of aesthetics from popular and exotic sources rather than by reinventing basic rules of common practice, French composers made music sound modern. Soon gifted musicians from around the world assembled in the city before and after World War I. Some enrolled in established institutions like the Conservatoire or the Schola Cantorum; some studied with charismatic independent teachers such as Nadia Boulanger. They all came to Paris because they were allowed to absorb French taste in art without having to convert to any sectarian aesthetic. In many cases Paris validated pride in their own nationalism. This seminar emphasizes Stravinsky, Milhaud, and Honegger, but it also examines the works of such American composers as Copland, Piston, Antheil, Thomson, and Blitzstein, all of whom studied with Boulanger and then spread the ideas of Modern Parisian musical style to America.    VICTOR FELL YELLIN , Professor of Music , is a composer and musicologist. He studied with Walter Piston at Harvard and with Darius Milhaud in Paris, and was much influenced by works for the musical stage by Marc Blitzstein and by Virgil Thomson, for whose book on American music he wrote the chapter on Thomson?s operas Four Saints in Three Acts and The Mother of Us All . Excerpts from Yellin?s opera Abaylar have been performed by the Metropolitan Opera Studio in New York, and his Variations on \"Bye Bye Blues\" for cello and piano was recently given at Merkin Hall. As a music historian, he has written on many aspects of American music, including the biography Chadwick, Yankee Composer and The Omnibus Idea , a history and analysis of one of the most ubiquitous but neglected harmonic progressions in music since the late 18th century.    Love, and How We Understand It (V50.0294; call # 74416) Instructor: Mitchell Stephens Thursday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    This course studies both what may be the most powerful and mysterious of human behaviors and mental states, romantic love, and how various disciplines and art forms have tried to grapple with it. It considers romantic love in a variety of forms and deals with works from a variety of cultures and historical periods. Read ings are selected from philosophy, psychology, anthropology, science, and journalism, as well as literature; students also examine films, songs, and paintings. They are asked to complete experiments of their own on this topic using some of these kinds of analysis or forms of expression. The course encourages students to think more deeply not only about love itself but about the strengths and weaknesses of different intellectual and artistic methods, and therefore the potential and the limitations of different academic disciplines.    MITCHELL STEPHENS is Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication . He is the author of, among other books, the rise of the image the fall of the word and A History of News . Articles by him on media issues, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and other subjects have appeared in the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, FEED , and other publications. He has recorded radio commentaries for Marketplace and On the Media, and serves as history consultant to the Newseum in Washington, D.C.

He is also director of the Russian-American Journalism Institute in RostovonDon.    Galileo and Hobbes (V50.0295; call # 74609) Instructor: William Klein Friday 9:3012:00 p.m.    In 1636, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes visited the aged and blind Galileo at his house in Florence, but there is no record of what was said. That leaves us free to speculate as we enter into the works of these two great innovators and critics of the Aristotelian worldview. Using selections from both philosophers (and in those days there was often no difference between philosophers and scientists, except in terms of quality?Hobbes was a very good philosopher but not such a good scientist), we will try to decide whether Galileo would have approved of Hobbes?s radical development of his physics and cosmology into a comprehensive philosophy of nature, human nature, and the state.    WILLIAM KLEIN is Visiting Professor of General Studies at NYU. He has worked as a carpenter, an editor, and a writer, among other things, since completing the Ph.D. in history at Johns Hopkins. He has taught at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. His books include The Lure of the Italian Treasure , a youngadult detective novel set in Florence.

The Crusades and Their Legacy (V50.0296; call # 74418) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Tuesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    In the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, the Crusades, which began at the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters, if not the most important chapter. The Crusades began as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. For two hundred years the Crusaders managed to hold on to their possessions, losing more of them with every passing decade, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the East was lost to western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades themselves, but focuses on the relations among the three great religions and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. We study the differences among the religions as well as their many similarities. Most of all, we address some of the problems that are crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a holy war; the issue of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the legacy of the crusading era. Readings include Muslim, Jewish, and Christian writings of the era, in translation, as well as secondary works.    JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the Crusader era extensively. She served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.    Historic Preservation, Entrepreneurial Innovation, and the Rejuvenation of American Cities (V50.0297; call # 74352) Instructors: Tony and Mark Goldman Tuesday, 4:55?7:25 p.m.    Over the years there has been no more effective tool of urban restoration and revitalization than historic preservation. In cities all over the world it has turned once empty and deteriorating buildings, fading blocks, and dying districts into vital and dynamic centers of urban, pedestrian activity. People everywhere have come to realize that cities can have no future unless and until their past is preserved, guarded, and maintained. This course will concentrate on historic preservation, economic development, and the role that individuals play in the rejuvenation of our cities. Taught by two brothers men whose life work integrates the practical and the academic, the handson experiences of the street warrior, the daytoday entrepreneur with the academic, this course is meant to provoke, inspire, enlighten, and empower. By combining readings and field trips to four different neighborhoods in the New York City area, this course will give students the insights and abilities to begin to understand, participate in, and envision the important work of preserving, restoring, and revitalizing the historic urban fabric of cities throughout the world.    Note: Interested students must submit a written statement (no longer than one page), to be reviewed by the instructors, explaining why they wish to take this seminar. The statement can be mailed to 100 Washington Square East, Room 908, New York, NY 10003; faxed to 212-995-4811; or emailed to ccp1@nyu..edu.

Behind Government: How Politics, Media, and Money Shape Policies (V50.0298; call # 74612) Instructor: Mark Green Thursday, 4:55?7:25 p.m.    To read Congressional Records and State of the Union addresses, one might think that all policy emanated from facts, logic, and merit. And when Karl Rove, President Bush?s top strategic adviser, said that the President doesn?t consider politics when determining policy, it was a pleasant fiction no one was expected to believe. This seminar looks at the hidden aspects that drive government by focusing on five recent public leaders?President Bush (43), President Clinton, Mayor Giuliani, Ralph Nader, and former Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. How did their varying styles, values, intellects, and personalities affect their offices or campaigns? Are there particular approaches that can best accomplish great goals? How do media and money affect the success of these powerful people? How much does the public actually know about those who govern them?    MARK GREEN was the Distinguished Visiting Lecturer at NYU Law School in 2002. The author/editor of 18 books (including Who Runs Congress? ), he was the Consumer Affairs Commissioner of New York City (1990?93), the elected Public Advocate of New York City (1994?2001), and the Democratic nominee for Mayor (2001). He appears weekly on NY1?s Wiseguys with Ed Koch and Al D?Amato.    Manufactured Worlds: Utopias, Fables, and Fantasies (V50.0299; call # 74610) Instructor: L. Jay Oliva Wednesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    Historical eras can surely be viewed through a variety of lenses; one such lens is provided by creative individuals throughout history who have utilized fables and fantasies about alternate worlds to reflect their critiques, and aspirations, and fears for their own. Manufactured worlds have won public attention to the real world?s ills and potential through the power of imagination. We will examine this intriguing exercise of the human imagination, beginning with Thomas More?s Utopia and ending with Tolkien?s trilogy The Lord of the Rings .    L. JAY OLIVA is Michel Fribourg Professor of European Studies and President Emeritus of NYU. He is author and editor of works on Russian Imperial history, including Russia in the Era of Peter the Great , and has regularly taught a course in Russian history for juniors and seniors. His recent theater credits include Brigadoon, My Fair Lady, Guys and Dolls, Fiorello! , and Carousel ; and he is lead singer in an Irish group, Doc and the Hods.    Afghanistan and the World (V50.0300; call # 74611) Instructor: Robert D. McChesney Friday, 9:30 a.m.?12:00 noon    Since September 11, Afghanistan has emerged as a country whose interests and future are linked in a major way with those of the United States. The United States is not the first country and probably not the last to find itself enmeshed in the politics and society of this small nation in central Asia. The seminar begins with the subject of Afghanistan?s geophysical environment and the economic consequences that follow from that. Next it reviews the country?s social and cultural features, with an emphasis on tribalism, religion, and the literary and artistic heritage. The geopolitics of Afghanistan are then considered in light of the preceding with emphasis on the country?s relations with the nations that immediately surround it today?Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China. Finally, the subject of Afghanistan in a global framework is discussed: Afghanistan?s jihad against the Soviet Union, the civil war and the Taliban, and Afghanistan?s relations with alQa?ida, the United States, and the United Nations.    ROBERT D. MCCHESNEY is Professor of Middle Eastern Studies , with a special interest in the early modern history of Iran and Central Asia. He is the author of Waqf in Central Asia (1991), Central Asia: Foundations of Change (1996), and Kabul under Siege (1999).    Great Doctors: The History of Scientific Medicine Revealed through Biography (V50.0301; call # 74702) Instructor: Sherwin B. Nuland Friday, 3:306:00 p.m.    If we accept Thomas Carlyle?s proposition that \"history is the essence of innumerable biographies\" (1830), then we should be able to learn about the past by studying the lives of the men and women who made the greatest contributions to it. The aim of this course is to trace the development of medicine from the time of classical antiquity until the dawning of the modern biomedical era just after the middle of the 20th century. Beginning with Hippocrates and concluding with Helen Taussig and the introduction of cardiac surgery, readings and discussions center on 13 distinctive individuals as they functioned in the cultural environment of their times, the state of science and medical literature, the surrounding political circumstances, and the historical ambiance in which their discoveries were made. Emphasis is on the rise of medical education and literature; the relationship of science to contemporary theory about nature; the shifting influence of individual centers of thought and the countries in which new ideas flourished; the gradual loosening of religious influence; the triumph of inductive reasoning and the experimental method; and the ways in which a contributor?s personality, background, and training influenced his or her work.    SHERWIN B. NULAND, M.D. , is Clinical Professor of Surgery at Yale University and a Fellow of its Institution for Social and Policy Studies. He is a member of the executive committee of the university?s Whitney Humanities Center and of the Interdisciplinary Bioethics Forum.

His 1988 book, Doctors: The Biography of Medicine , has been published in eight languages, and he has written biographies of Leonardo da Vinci and Ign?c Semmelweis. Most of his essays and eight published books have been directed toward explaining medicine and medical history for the general reader.    Law and Globalization (V50.0302; call # 74599) Instructor: Richard Stewart Monday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    This seminar examines the role of law and legal institutions in fostering global market integration and economic growth and in addressing the discontents of globalization. The globalization of the economy has brought many benefits, but also many problems and criticisms. These discontents include disparities in power and wealth between rich and poor, which many claim have been exacerbated by globalization; lack of participation and transparency in decisionmaking by the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, and other international organizations; marginalization of developingcountry interests; cultural homogenization and displacement of local political and economic selfdetermination; loosening of social safety nets and regulatory protection; and subordination of environmental, labor, and human rights concerns. These discontents, and the law?s response to them, are critically examined. Topics include the role of contract, trade, and financial law in promoting international markets; the role of international treaties and organizations in managing the global economy, its benefits, and its adverse impacts; international environmental, labor, and human rights laws; how law affects the distribution of the burdens and benefits of globalization in areas such as intellectual property and trade/environment controversies; the role of multinational corporations and the global corporate social responsibility movement; the concerns of indigenous peoples; and the role of nongovernment organizations and the \"democracy deficit\" in global governance.    RICHARD B. STEWART is University Professor and John Edward Sexton Professor of Law. He also directs the Center on Environmental and Land Use Law. His teaching and research focus on domestic and international environmental law, the role of economic incentives in environmental protection, law and globalization, and administrative law and regulation.

Europe in Africa and Africa in Europe: Interaction and Rupture in History (V50.0303; call # 74684) Instructor: David Levering Lewis Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.?1:30 p.m.    This seminar explores pivotal moments of confrontation and exchange in which the course of economic, cultural, and political development in the European and African experiences are reciprocally and significantly altered. The proposition?that what others have made us applies at the most profound levels equally to conqueror and conquered, exploiter and exploited, superordinates and subordinates alike?is to be tested in this seminar through an exploration of five turningpoint interactions: (1) Islam?s first European century (viz., the 8thcentury Muslim conquest of Iberia; (2) capitalism and slavery, 1400s to 1850; (3) African resistance in the scramble for Africa; (4) bohemian Paris and Renaissance Harlem; (5) literatures and politics of rupture (WellsBarnett, Du Bois, and Maran to Fanon, Baldwin, et al.; Ghana and the Congo). Five essays keyed to the five topics and based on seminar discussions, required readings, and independent research are to be presented serially.    DAVID LEVERING LEWIS is joining NYU in fall 2003 as University Professor and Professor of History, having been, most recently, the Martin Luther King Jr. University Professor at Rutgers. President in 2002?03 of the Society of American Historians, he currently holds a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship.

The Genomics Evolution and Revolution: Scientists, Discoveries, and Societal Impact (V50.0304; call # 74685) Instructor: Tamar Schlick Wednesday, 12:30?3:00 p.m.    With advances in science and technology, the biological sciences occupy center stage, linking not only basic to applied research, and applied research to commercial success and economic growth, but also the biological sciences to the chemical, physical, mathematical, and computer sciences. The many concerted initiatives in genomics, in particular, like sequencing various organisms, identifying genes in humans and analogues in other species, determining variations (polymorphisms) in human genes related to disease, and designing drugs for specific gene products, have immense ramifications on every aspect of our lives, from health to technology to law. Though progress appears to have been revolutionary in the past decade, such developments have evolved from foundations laid by many pioneers in the biochemical sciences and allied fields. This course, appropriate for scientists and nonscientists, explores through a series of books, plays, and other materials three aspects of these scientific developments: the science pioneers, from Watson and Crick to Feynman to Elion, their lives, struggles, and triumphs; the scientific discoveries, from reports of the DNA double helix to the polymerase chain reaction; and the societal impact of these discoveries, from human cloning to ageextension miracles. The readings and discussions are designed to expose students to the complex web of scientific discovery, including the personal dimensions that are not often appreciated, and the mixture of serendipitous and systematic progress.    TAMAR SCHLICK is Professor of Chemistry , Mathematics , and Computer Science . Her field of research is the application of computational approaches to the study of structure and function of biological macromolecules, especially regulatory DNA/protein complexes related to transcription initiation and DNA replication and repair.

Sloan Fellowship, NYU Distinguished Recent Alumni, NSF Presidential Young Investigator, Searle and Whitaker Scholarships.    Home of the Brave: Legal Aspects of American Use of Force since World War II (V50.0305; call # 74686) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Wednesday, 12:30?3:00 p.m.    The creation of the United Nations ushered in a new era in the international legal regulation of the use of force by states. Under the UN regime states may use force in wellcircumscribed circumstances, notably in selfdefense against an armed attack or pursuant to a decision of the Security Council of the UN, to bring about a termination of a breach of the peace or a threat to the peace of the international community. The United States both during and after the Cold War has not shied away from the use of its considerable force, often provoking national and international controversy. Some instances, such as the Cuban missile crisis or Vietnam, have had profound effects on the selfunderstanding of the polity. The \"War against Terrorism\" has ushered in yet a new challenge in this area. This seminar first examines the international legal framework and then surveys the principal instances of American use of force from Korea to Iraq. At issue are both the legality of past and present American practices and the adequacy of controlling international law and institutions.    J. H. H. WEILER is University Professor and European Union Jean Monnet Chair at NYU Law School. He serves as Chairman of the NYU Global Law School Program and is also Director of the Jean Monnet Center for International and Regional Economic Law &amp; Justice. He was previously Professor of Law at the Michi gan Law School and then the Manley Hudson Professor of Law and Jean Monnet Chair at Harvard Law School. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as a WTO Panel Member. He is a founding editor of the European Journal of International Law , of the European Law Journal , and of the World Trade Review . His recent publications include The European Court of Justice (2001, with G. de Burca), The EU, the WTO and the NAFTA (2000), The Constitution of Europe (1998), and a novella, Der Fall Steinmann (2000).    Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos? (V50.0306; call # 74717) Instructor: Jorge G. Castaeda Friday, 9:30a.m.-12:00p.m.    This seminar focuses on several aspects of Latin America?s problems in the past and their possible solutions today. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and vigor of civil society today. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present.    JORGE G. CASTAEDA is returning to NYU in fall 2003 as Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies . Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth. A principal strategist in the election campaign of President Vicente Fox in 2000, he served as Mexico?s Foreign Minister from late 2000 until early 2003.

He has also written articles for many newspapers and magazines in Mexico, the United States, and other countries.    How We See (V50.0307; call # 74724) Instructor: Peter Lennie Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The ease with which we comprehend the visual world, and recognize objects and events, makes it easy to take our perceptual capabilities for granted. Only when we try to build machines that can see, or when we encounter people who have lost some specific visual capability?for example, persons who can no longer recognize faces, or for whom the world no longer appears in color?do we realize how extraordinary and intricate is the machinery of sight. This course looks at what we know about how we see. We know quite a lot about it from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing, and provides important pointers to the workings of visual mechanisms; neurology provides further insight by showing us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; computer science helps us understand design principles that are important making machines that can see; neuroscience tells us about the working details at the level of cells an neural systems. In this course we explore what these various disciplines together tell us about how we see.    PETER LENNIE is Professor of Neural Science , as well as Dean for Science in the Faculty of Arts and Science. Before joining NYU, in 1999, he was at the University of Rochester for 16 years. His scientific research has dealt with several fundamental questions about the operation of the human visual system; most recently, it has focused on the organization and specialization of the visual cortex, exploring the degree to which different regions of the cortex are specialized for different functions.    A Real Play of Identities (V50.0308; call # 74839) Instructor: Anna Deavere Smith Monday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    In this course, students will study and play roles from dramatic literature, film, television, real life, and history that they specify as unlike themselves and outside their realm of understanding. This is not a performance course per se, and no previous acting experience is required. Performance is used here as a way of knowing, rather than as a product for the purposes of entertaining. Students will be engaged in an ongoing discussion of what it takes to move from one identity to another, one cultural way of being to another, from one moment in personal history to another, from one moment in global history to another. The relationship of language and gesture to identity will be explored. Note: Interested students must submit a written statement (no longer than one page), to be reviewed by the instructor, explaining what interests them about the subject. The statement can be mailed to 100 Washington Square East, Room 908, New York, NY 10003; faxed to 212-995-4811; or emailed to ccp1@nyu.edu.    ANNA DEAVERE SMITH is a University Professor and Professor of Performance Studies in the Tisch School of the Arts, as well as an Affiliate of the NYU Law School. She is the Founder and Director of the Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue. Her publications include Twilight-Los Angeles, 1992, Talk to Me: Listening between the Lines, and Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and Other Identities. Her acting credits include the films The American President, Dave, and Philadelphia and the television series Presidio Med, The West Wing, and The Practice. A recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship, she has also received two Tony Award nominations and been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.    From the Birth of Tragedy to the Birth of Pleasure (V50.0309; call # 74875) Instructor: Carol Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The birth of tragedy symbolized by the story of Oedipus has long been linked with the birth of Western civilization. In this seminar, we will examine this linkage and also a tradition of resistance that extends from Greek tragedy through 19th-century fugitive slave narratives to the liberation movements of the late 20th century and postcolonial fiction. The Birth of Pleasure picks up this tradition of resistance and shows its psychological roots in studies of infancy, research with adolescent girls and young boys, and the findings of neuroscience. Knowing a tragic story, how do we keep from repeating it? Readings will be drawn from psychology and literature, and students will write short weekly reflection papers as well as a final paper.    CAROL GILLIGAN came to NYU as a University Professor in 2002. For the preceding 34 years she was on the faculty of Harvard University, where her award-winning research on gender and human development led to the creation of Harvard's first professorship in gender studies. Her 1982 book, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development, has been translated into 17 languages. Her most recent book, The Birth of Pleasure, was published last year.    Music and Power in China (V50.0310; call # 74874) Instructor: Mercedes M. Dujunco Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.    In China, music has long been viewed as having the ability to affect cosmological forces and influence people's thinking and behavior. It is therefore not surprising that Chinese rulers throughout the ages have tried to control the kind of music that is publicly performed and listened to by their constituents. They recognized early on that music signifies and that a key to power is regulating and fixing the meanings produced through music. This seminar examines the extent to and the various ways in which power is implicated in music and music-related practices in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Through discussions based on a combination of selected ethnomusicological readings, films/videos, and music recordings related to specific case studies dealing with state politics, identity, gender, and ethnic relations, students gain insights on how music continues to be a highly charged symbol in the Chinese-speaking regions of East Asia today.    MERCEDES M. DUJUNCO is Assistant Professor of Ethnomusicology in the Department of Music. She has written on Chinese and Vietnamese folk music, film music, and popular music and is currently working on a book about music and power in the context of Chaozhou Chinese voluntary associations in Hong Kong, mainland China, and Thailand.

One way the College has done so is through its Seminar program, which gives students the opportunity to participate in small, intellectually stimulating classes on important topics taught by distinguished professors drawn not only from the College's faculty but also from NYU's professional schools and from among New York's professional, cultural, and governmental leaders.    In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic principles behind the very successful Freshman Honors Seminars, offered since 1992, to upper-level courses. These small classes are taught by faculty from across the University and from the wider New York community. In some instances students may count the classes toward their major or minor, if the departments consider this appropriate; other classes will count simply as electives.    Advanced Honors Seminars have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. In sum, these courses are meant to foster an environment in which learning is an exciting experience for students and faculty alike.    Sophomores and juniors have priority in registering for most of the Advanced Honors Seminars. If seats remain after the end of early registration, seniors may also enroll.    Course Descriptions    Home of the Brave: Legal Aspects of American Use of Force since World War II (V28.0103; call # 72742) Instructor: J. H. H.

Political Cinema and Representation of the Other (V28.0107; call # 75393) Instructor: Shimon Dotan Friday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00noon    Representation of the Other is a variation of the search for self-identity. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its political cinema exhibit a clear pattern in which the parties attribute to the Other qualities and traits that reflect their own distress and aspirations. But how does the concept of representation connect meaning to a sequence of successive images? Which of the following accounts (in a variation on Stuart Hall) will apply to a cinematic work? The reflective \u2014 does film reflect a meaning, which already exists in the real world? The intentional \u2014 does film express only what the filmmaker intends to express? The constructionist \u2014 is meaning constructed in and through the process of filmmaking? Each class consists of a screening followed by a discussion concentrating on representation in the context of the political conflict, variations in use of film language to achieve a subjective portrayal and modalities of representation and self-critique. Screenings include films such as The Battle of Algiers , by Bruno Pontecorvo; Divine Intervention , by Elia Suleiman; Fog of War , by Earl Morris; Final Cup , by Eran Riklis; and The Smile of the Lamb , by Shimon Dotan.    Shimon Dotan , a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with ten feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive ; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. Dotan has taught filmmaking at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal.    Cinema and Society in Europe since 1945 (V28.0112; call # 75329) Instructor: Tony Judt Tuesday, 3:30 - 6:00 p.m., and Thursday, 3:30 - 4:45 p.m.    This seminar addresses aspects of the history of European history since World War II through postwar European cinema. The seminar will pay attention to the films themselves, as art and as entertainment; but we shall also and above all be concerned with their subject matter, their contemporary setting, and their impact (at the time and since). Participants will meet twice weekly: once to see that week's film, once for discussion. In addition to watching the films, students will be required to read assigned works of history dealing with the period. Among the themes to be addressed \u2014 in the films, the readings, the class discussion, and, eventually, the final papers \u2014 are the following: war and civil war as represented and remembered in the postwar decades; the Cold War; decolonization; the European \"economic miracle\" and its attendant social impact; the \"sixties\"; different generations of migration, both into Europe and within and between countries; national identities and the attached stereotypes; the Yugoslav Wars; remembering (and forgetting) Communism; and the Holocaust in postwar European consciousness. A final paper will require students to choose one theme and then, with instructor's assistance, identify a body of related films to see and discuss.    Tony Judt is Erich Maria Remarque Professor of European Studies and Director of the Remarque Institute at NYU. A Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he has written widely on modern French and Central European history, as well as on contemporary affairs in Europe and the United States.

The History of Disbelief (V28.0113; call # 75328) Instructor: Mitchell Stephens Wednesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    This seminar will take up an extended history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of religion). It will begin in Greece and then move on to a brief discussion of anthropological perspectives on belief, before returning to Greece, the Hebrews and Rome, to India and Baghdad, and then back to Europe during the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the Romantic period. Time will be spent in England and America in the 19th century, when disbelief was being tied to radical politics, before moving on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence of God will be considered. However, the main purpose of this course will be to force students to confront and grapple with some of the most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief. Authors whose works will be read may include Cicero, Hume, Holbach, Paine, Shelley, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Woolf, and Freud, among others.    Mitchell Stephens is Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication. He is the author of, among other books, the rise of the image the fall of the word and A History of News .

Pomerantz Wednesday, 4:55 - 7:25 p.m.    The U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court's interpretation and application of the Constitution have adversely affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \"Imperial Judiciary.\" Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them, and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis, the Court's participation in the debate, and the effect that nine people appointed for life (the justices) have on how we live. Topics include abortion, euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights, gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; affirmative action; college speech codes, including \"hate\" speech and symbolic speech; and racial and ethnic profiling. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the political spectrum, and are expected to apply critical thinking to the topics.    Alan J. Pomerantz , Esq., is a practicing lawyer and partner of Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe, a major international law firm. A graduate of the NYU School of Law, he also studied in Chile and received an advanced legal degree from the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands).

The Security Council and Peacekeeping Operations in the 21st Century (V28.0120; call # 72748) Instructor: Elisabeth Lindenmayer Friday, 11:00 a.m. - 1:30 p.m.    This course focuses on the role of the Security Council of the United Nations as a decision-making body in the maintenance of international peace and security. It examines the evolution of the Security Council since the end of the Cold War and reviews how its decisions have deeply affected international relations. It also reviews the evolution of peacekeeping operations through a selective examination of the literature and case studies, some of which will be based on the instructor's experience. The course explores some of the major successes and setbacks of the Security Council and the many lessons learned. It focuses on the varying responses of the international community to humanitarian crises. We will ask the question \"Whose responsibility is it to protect?\" Finally, the course seeks to demonstrate the need for reforms to address the unprecedented challenges of the 21st century, including the reform of the Security Council. Students who have taken V50.0363 may not register for this course.    Elisabeth Lindenmayer has had a long career with the United Nations, where she served as the Deputy Chef de Cabinet and as the Executive Assistant to the current Secretary General, Kofi Annan. In addition, she held substantive responsibilities relating to peacekeeping operations dealing with the crises in Iraq-Kuwait, Somalia, Rwanda, and the Great Lakes region.

Machiavelli's Wake (V28.0121; call # 72749) Instructor: William Klein Wednesday, 12:30 - 3:00 p.m.    Machiavelli's high literary talent, keen historical insight, and deep experience in politics congealed into a body of work \u2014 and one work in particular \u2014 that has become a difficult-to-dismiss touchstone of reflections on politics in the widest sense. His relentless study of the role of ruthlessness in public life has implications for fields as wide apart as Conflict Strategy and Ethics, while his hard-nosed study of republican institutions had great influence in the shaping of republican revolutions. After studying Machiavelli's main works, we will move on to an analysis of his first early modern disciples and detractors, and then on to modern works in, for example, ethics (Nagel), sociobiology (de Waal), and economic theory (Frank).    William Klein teaches social foundations in NYU's General Studies Program. In the College of Arts and Science he has also taught in both the Morse Academic Plan and the Freshman Honors Seminar Program. Before coming to NYU, he was at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he taught the history of Western social thought. He writes on a range of topics, from Renaissance political thought to constitutional history and (under a pen name) modern crime.    The Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan (V28.0124; call # 72750) Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller Tuesday, Thursday, 2:00 - 3:15 p.m.    The operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were composed during a period of intense change in the world of symphonic music and opera in the 19th century. This seminar examines nine of their major works and their historical, cultural, and musical contexts. It also examines the lives of the composer and the librettist and their respective milieux \u2014 Sullivan as one of the few English composers of the century to achieve international recognition, and Gilbert in terms of the various literary movements to which he belonged and which he parodied. In addition, it considers the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and its activities; the singers, scenic designers, choreographers, and costumers who functioned with the company; and the principal sources for the music, a majority of which are housed currently in New York City's J. Pierpont Morgan Library, along with numerous artifacts from the productions.    Rena Charnin Mueller , Clinical Associate Professor of Music, specializes in 19th-century music, in particular, the compositional aesthetic of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner.

Stehlin Tuesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    The course explores the instability of the European state system in the pre-1914 era and the causes and responsibility for the war by examining the contributions of each of the major European states to the outbreak of war. It considers the Bismarckian system of European diplomacy and the balance of power as it existed before the war, the various diplomatic crises before 1914, the interrelation of internal events in the various countries to their foreign policy, and the various interpretations of the causes of the war. Topics include the Moroccan crises, the weaknesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Anglo-German naval and economic rivalries, the Balkan struggles for independence, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo, the personal responsibility of the individual statesmen, the ever-widening conflict, and the attempts to contain it.    Stewart A. Stehlin is Professor Emeritus of History. His areas of teaching have been the development of the modern European state system in the 19th and 20th centuries, the history of modern Germany, and European diplomatic history of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Among his publications are Bismarck and the Guelph Movement, 1866 - 1890 , a translation of Friedrich Ratzel's Sketches of Urban and Cultural Life in North America , and Weimar and the Vatican, German-Vatican Diplomatic Relations between the Wars, 1919 - 1933 . He is currently working on a book, Rome and the Reich: German-Vatican Relations during the Kaiserreich, 1870 - 1919 .    The Being of Character: Making Modern Subjects (V28.0141; call # 75327) Instructor: Elaine Freedgood Thursday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    This seminar examines how concepts of gender, sexuality, and race; mind and soul; true and false selves \u2014 all of these apparently \"natural\" categories and concepts \u2014 have been constructed, arranged, and rearranged in the past two hundred years. We will read, discuss, and write about film, cultural criticism, travel literature, fiction, psychoanalytic theory, and theories of gender performativity and racial passing in order to consider what it means to be, to seem to be, to try to be, to want to be, a given kind of self or character. The course will be based on rigorous analysis of textual material (including two films). Each student will prepare a formal oral presentation and lead 15 minutes of class discussion based on it. Final projects will emerge from early short papers that focus on research \u2014 in primary texts, in theoretical texts, in historical works, in unlikely locations and archives \u2014 and on how to use them effectively to write original, scholarly criticism.    Elaine Freedgood is an associate professor of English at NYU, where she teaches Victorian literature and critical theory. Before coming to NYU, she taught at the University of Pennsylvania. She is the author of two books: Victorian Writing about Risk: Imagining a Safe England in a Dangerous World (2000) and The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel (2006).

Abortion: Examining the Issues (V28.0142; call # 75332) Instructor: Evelyn Birge Vitz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00 - 3:15 p.m.    This multidisciplinary course takes as its purpose a careful and thought-provoking examination of many issues surrounding abortion today. In a seminar setting, we will read about and discuss legal, medical, historical, psychological, political, religious, ethical, and gender questions in a balanced manner, considering both \u2014 indeed, sometimes several \u2014 sides of the issues involved. We will also look at the representation of and attitudes toward abortion in contemporary literature and popular culture. This seminar will provide a forum for civil, informed, and open discussion of this difficult issue.    Evelyn (Timmie) Birge Vitz is Professor of French, and Affiliated Professor of Comparative Literature, Religious Studies, and Medieval and Renaissance Studies. She has published widely on both narrative and performance, as well as on many other aspects of medieval literature and culture.

She has been researching and writing about abortion for several years, and has held workshops of a dramatic script about abortion, entitled \"Voices,\" in New York and Washington, D.C.    My Space: Writing Modern Selves, from the Diary to the Internet (V28.0143; call # 75326) Instructor: Thomas Augst Monday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    Why do people write diaries, and how should we read them? What kind of evidence do journals or blogs offer about the historical and social contexts from which they emerge? What can they tell us about the physical and virtual spaces in which people come to recognize themselves as individuals, and about cultural meanings and forms of individuality in general? This course explores the meaning and practice of diary-writing as it has evolved with technologies of manuscript, print, and digital computing. It has two major objectives. First, we will seek to situate contemporary internet sites of self-presentation such as Facebook, My Space, You Tube, and blogs in historical and literary perspective; we will consider how the diary has been shaped by religious traditions of self-examination, changing concepts of time, and the expansion of literacy, and define its relation to other literary genres such as the chronicle, autobiography, the novel, and the essay. Second, we will seek to develop a set of concepts to guide us in the interpretation and practice of self-representation across various media. Reading both celebrated and obscure examples of the diary, and conducting group research on contemporary digital culture, students will develop cross-cultural perspectives on literary practices of self-creation and the experiences of isolation, sincerity, narcissism, theatricality, privacy, and networking that inform them.    Thomas Augst is Associate Professor of English. He earned his Ph.D. from Harvard University and also taught there and at the University of Minnesota. He is the author of The Clerk's Tale: Young Men and Moral Life in 19th Century America , which explores how young businessmen used their diaries as tools for self-creation. He has also coedited two books on the history of libraries: Institutions of Reading: The Social Life of Librarians in the United States and Libraries as Agencies of Culture . He is currently writing a book about temperance, mass culture, and ethics in modern liberalism.    \"Varieties of Religious Experience\" Revisited (V28.0144; call # 75390) Instructor: James Gilligan Tuesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    This seminar will utilize but also update William James's pioneering approach to interpreting and understanding religion in psychological rather than theological terms. We will examine how the term \"religion\" is more confusing than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different stages of cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the phenomenon of \"political religions\" (nationalism, totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject modernity (the modern scientific mentality), in order to fill the vacuum that Sartre called \"the God-shaped hole in the soul of modern man\" that resulted when the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost their credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the political religions as resulting from psychological regression, and contrast them with the current moment in the evolution of religious consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of religious expression, understanding and experience that are consistent with the modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it. The seminar will conclude by examining whether this is the context in which the next major step in the evolution of both culture and personality will need to occur.    James Gilligan , Collegiate Professor, headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry. He has also served as Director of the Center for the Study of Violence and as a member of President Clinton's National Commission on Youth Violence.

He has been a consultant to the Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention at the World Health Organization, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and numerous other organizations.    Women's Writing in Renaissance Italy (V50.0145; call # 75330) Instructor: Virginia Cox Tuesday, 3:30 - 6:00 p.m.    The 15th, 16th, and early 17th centuries in Italy saw an extraordinary flowering of women's writing, whose extent has only very recently begun to be fully recognized by critics. Some 200 published women writers have been recorded for the 16th century alone, active in genres as diverse as pastoral drama, chivalric romance, and philosophical dialogue, as well as letters, love poetry, and religious verse. This seminar studies the tradition of women's writing in Italy in this period within its social and cultural context. It embraces both celebrated figures such as Vittoria Colonna, Gaspara Stampa, and Veronica Franco, and lesser known or more recently rediscovered writers, some not yet translated into English or available in modern editions. Besides the chance to study a series of compelling and challenging literary texts, the course offers the opportunity to engage with broader historical issues, notably the questions of what contextual factors enabled the emergence of this strong and precocious tradition of women's writing, and what factors led to its eclipse in the 17th century. Attention is also given to women's activity in other creative fields in this same period, notably the visual arts and music. The seminar is open to students without a reading knowledge of Italian, as translations will be supplied for all texts studied.    Virginia Cox, Professor of Italian, came to NYU in 2003 after teaching at the University of Edinburgh, University College London, and the University of Cambridge. Her chief research interests are early modern Italian literary and intellectual history, history of rhetoric, and early modern women's writing. She is the author of The Renaissance Dialogue: Literary Dialogue in Its Social and Political Contexts, Castiglione to Galileo (1993) and of Women's Writing in Italy, 1400 - 1650 (forthcoming 2008), as well as coeditor, with John Ward, of The Rhetoric of Cicero in Its Medieval and Early Modern Commentary Tradition (2006). She has also edited and translated two early modern texts by Italian women: Moderata Fonte's dialogue The Worth of Women (1997) and Maddalena Campiglia's drama Flori (2004, coedited with Lisa Sampson).       Before Democracy: The Politics of Plurality in Ancient Iraq (V28.0146; call # 75549) Instructor: Daniel Fleming Tuesday, 12:30 - 3:00 p.m.    This seminar will explore the alternative political tradition of group decision-making in ancient Iraq and its neighborhood. Democracy was born in Athens, and it came to the modern world through Europe and its American offspring. The Middle East is considered instead the home of empire and autocracy. Saddam Hussein cast himself as the heir of Babylon's rulers. This view has roots in ancient Greece itself, where Athenian democracy was set against Persian imperial power. In fact, the ancient Middle East was home to various forms of collective governance, from elders to assemblies, sometimes on a large scale. The ancestors of Greek democracy shared common ground with these practices from regions just to the east. Based on evidence ranging from 4,000-year-old letters to Homer's epic poetry, we will examine the early politics of plurality in both Mesopotamia and early Greece. By reconsidering the past, we can also rethink the prospects for democracy in modern Iraq and beyond, where traditional political life is often understood only as a barrier to changes encouraged by the United States.    Daniel Fleming is Professor of Assyriology and Hebrew Bible in the Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies. His latest book, Democracy's Ancient Ancestors: Mari and Early Collective Governance (2004), addresses the issues raised in this seminar, and he has also worked recently with Kurt Raaflaub to evaluate the relationship between Greek and Mesopotamian traditions before the democracy of Athens. In general, he specializes in the society and religion of ancient Syria and Israel, as these regions stood at the intersection of contacts across the Middle East, before Greece and Rome.    The 14th Century \u2014 When Europe Was Transformed (V28.0147; call # 75331) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Wednesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    The century covered in this course saw disasters of many kinds, some all too familiar to us in the 20th century. It was a time of the Black Death and the decimation of the population on an enormous scale; a time of recession that changed the pattern of prosperity that had existed in the preceding two centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman Church were faced with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious authority; a time of wars and of rebellions. Yet, in the same era, there was a march forward \u2014 toward new ideas, new political forms, vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense consequence for all of Europe . . . and for our own culture. Through the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian painters who transformed the nature and conception of literature and art and who informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century that many historians have understood as the most creative and the most terrible of all the centuries before the 20th.    Jill N. Claster is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages. She has served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU. She is currently working on a book about the Crusades.    The Making of Iconic Images (V28.0148; call # 75391) Instructor: Deborah Willis Wednesday, 6:20 - 8:50 p.m.    This interdisciplinary seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers, artists, historians, and critical thinkers in addressing the notion of iconic images. Iconic images are pictures that become rooted in our personal memory, pictures that are stored away for future reference through our experiences with them. How do icons emerge from the billions of images that surround us? What makes an image iconic? How are icons viewed cross-culturally and over time? Why do some help end wars, and why are other, very similar images ignored? To what extent can an image-maker aim at creating an icon, or is there no way of approaching the goal? How is it done in advertising, where a Nike swoosh can be made into an icon? Why do we have such extraordinarily powerful responses toward the images and pictures we see in everyday life? Why do we behave as if pictures were alive, possessing the power to influence us, to demand things from us, to persuade us, seduce us, or even lead us astray? In examining the salient features of the iconic image, the class will take comparative approaches to the diverse types of imagery.    Deborah Willis is University Professor and Professor of Photography and Imaging in the Tisch School of the Arts. Her many awards include a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, an Alfonse Fletcher Jr. Fellowship, a MacArthur Fellowship, an Anonymous Was a Woman Foundation Award, and an International Center of Photography Infinity Award for Writing on Photography.

Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (V28.0149; call # 75550) Instructor: Jing Wang Thursday, 4:55 - 7:25 p.m.    The Dream of the Red Chamber is a classic work produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as \"the chaptered novel,\" it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. Originally titled The Story of the Stone , the novel tells the story of a sentient stone thrown into the everyday world in its human reincarnation. With reference to the Goddess Nuwa repairing the sky, the novel raises a series of questions concerning the relationship between heaven, earth, human beings, and things; the origin of what it is to be human; its spiritual nature; the relationship between emotion and talent; and the development, suppression, and waste of talent. At the center of all this is the true meaning of human emotion and affection ( qing ) , and their relationship to the moral order and social-cultural convention ( li ). What constitutes the \"story\" is thus a narrative account of the stone's worldly experiences, tragic fate, and reflections on a heartless world. Its intricate structure, coupled with its dazzling array of characters, makes this one of the most complex and colorful novels of all time. All readings in the seminar are in English.    Jing Wang is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990's (2002).

In addition to literary translations, she also publishes personal essays.    Soundscapes of Contemporary War (V28.0150; call # 75392) Instructor: Suzanne G. Cusick Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m. - 12:15 p.m.      What are the sounds of contemporary war? How have military planners, strategists, and commanders used sound (including music) to expedite battle? How have ordinary soldiers used sound (including music)? How have both kinds of military use interacted with civilian aural culture? This seminar will explore these questions with reference to major wars of the \"American century\" \u2014 World Wars I and II, the \"Cold War,\" the Vietnam conflict \u2014 so as to understand better the acoustical practices of U.S. forces in the current \"global war on terror\" (especially the widespread use of \"loud music\" in detention camps). The course work will include readings, films, listening, discussion, individual research projects, and contribution toward a class website.    Suzanne G. Cusick, Associate Professorof Music , joined the NYU faculty in 2003 after ten years at the University of Virginia, where she was awarded the Alumni Board of Trustees Teaching Prize (for junior faculty) in 1995. She has published widely on music in relation to gender, sexuality, and embodiment; on the musical culture of early 17th-century Italy; and, most recently, on the use of music as a medium of torture in the \"global war on terror.\" Her monograph on the work of the singer, teacher, and composer Francesca Caccini (1587 - c1646) at the Medici court will be published by the University of Chicago Press in 2008. In 2006 - 07, she was a Fellow at the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History at Harvard University, participating in the yearlong workshop \"Cultural Reverberations of Modern War\"; her research during that workshop forms the basis for this seminar.    Hispanic Cities: New York (V28.0151; call # 75471) Instructor: Lourdes Davila Monday, 11:00 a.m. - 1:30 p.m.    What exactly is a city? What makes a city \"Hispanic\"? How does it become visible? What frontiers exist within the city's borders? How does a cosmopolitan city integrate the \"Hispanic Other\" into its fabric? On what terms? How does the presence of the Hispanic population permanently change the face of the city? This course traces the Hispanic cultural presence in New York from the end of the 19th century to the present, including responses by artists and writers to the terrorist attack of 9/11. Divided into modules, the course explores representation of and exchanges with the city in authors from Jose Marti to Pedro Pietri to Ernesto Quinonez, dancers like Jose Limon, Lourdes Lopez or Paloma Herrera, music from Bomba to Hip-Hop, visual art from Diego Rivera to James de la Vega, and film, from West Side Story to Raising Victor Vargas . Students will participate in cultural activities around NYC, and will be able to talk to several artists currently working here. Criticism will include authors like Gaston Bachelard, de Certeau, and Walter Benjamin.    Lourdes Davila , a member of the faculty of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, has been actively involved in arts as a professional dancer in NYC since 1989. Her first book, The Image Arrives on a Verbal Shore , considers the use of visual language in the Argentinean author Julio Cortazar. She is currently working on a book on photography and literature in Latin America. Lourdes has worked as a translator for the Guggenheim Foundation and now has two book translation projects: Corner of the Dead (English to Spanish), a short novel by the award winner Lynn Lurie about the Shining Path in Peru, and Julio Cortazar's Silvalandia (Spanish to English). She has been a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.    Muhammad and the Quran (V28.0152; call # 75836) Instructor: Francis E. Peters Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The Quran is one of the primary texts of world history: the faith of millions of believers is rooted in it and in the conviction that the man who pronounced it in Arabia in the seventh century A.D. spoke with the voice of God. But the Quran-the Quran in the hands of Muslims and non-Muslims alike-is also a document, and its original recitation came forth from a mortal man. Both, then, are the subject of historical inquiry. Muslims made those inquiries from the beginning, but in the West it was not until the 19th century that Muhammad and the Quran became the object of serious historiographical investigation. The objective of this course is to introduce undergraduate students into both \"the Quest for the Historical Muhammad\" and the current state of research on the making of our Quran by inviting them to address the very same questions the current researchers are. The manner will be that of a seminar, in which every student, every week, will be asked to make an active (and generally written) contribution on one of the research issues.    Francis E. Peters is Professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies as well as History and Religious Studies. During his career at NYU he has taught courses ranging from Homer, Aristotle, and Plotinus through the Gospels, Muhammad, and Near Eastern urbanism to Islamic philosophy and theology. He taught a previous Advanced Honors Seminar titled \"Jesus and Muhammad.\" His numerous books include Muhammad and the Origins of Islam and The Voice, the Word, the Books: The Sacred Scriptures of the Jews, Christians, and Muslims , commissioned by the British Library. He is currently finishing a book on the Quran.    Collegiate Honors Seminar Abroad    NYU in London    European Integration and the European Union as a Political System (V28.9502) Instructor: Eiko R. Thielemann Tuesday, 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 noon    The European Union constitutes a uniquely ambitious project of international cooperation and governance beyond the state. This course explores the origins, development, institutions, major policies, policy-making, current problems, and matters of controversy of the European Community/Union. Students are also introduced to the major approaches applied to explain the complex system of EU policy-making. Among other things, we address questions such as why the Commission, Court, and Parliament have gained new powers, why market deregulation has proceeded faster than social and environmental protection, and why European elections do not work. Knowledge about the institutions and policy processes of the EU will help students to critically assess various questions that are facing Europe's citizens and leaders today: How should the single currency work? How can the EU's institutions be made more democratic? How far and how fast should the EU be enlarged? Should Europe develop into a federal (super) state?    Eiko R. Thielemann holds a Senior Lectureship in European Politics and Policy at the London School of Economics. He completed his Ph.D. at Cambridge University. His research interests are in the areas of multilevel policy-making in the European Union; comparative analysis of public policy and institutions; new institutional theories; migration; and state aid.    Departmental Honors Seminar    Open to Qualified Non-Majors    Unearthing the Lost History of Greek Priestesses: Curating an Exhibition (V43.0150, sec 002; call # 75475; V27.0150, sec 002; call # 75557) Instructor: Joan Breton Connelly Tuesday, 9:45 a.m. - 12:15 p.m. Prerequisite: V43.0001 or V43.0100 and instructor's permission    In March 2007, Joan Breton Connelly published the first comprehensive cultural history of Greek priestesses, brought to life through a pioneering examination of literary sources, inscriptions, sculpture, and vase painting. The book will soon be brought to life in a traveling exhibition of objects and images brought together from some of the world's greatest museums. This seminar gives undergraduate students the unique opportunity to participate in the early planning stages of a major art exhibition. Following weeks of lectures on a broad range of topics to be explored in the Greek Priestess Show, students will develop and present their own plans for displays within the exhibition: object lists, installation designs, didactic information, and creative educational materials that include interactive technologies, film and print media, and relevant scientific content. This course will expose students to new subject matter, challenge their creativity, and develop their practical skills in managing a project.    Joan Breton Connelly is Professor of Art History and Classics and Director of the NYU Yeronisos Island Excavations and Field School in Cyprus. Her scholarship focuses on Greek art and archaeology, mythology, and religion. She is the author of Portrait of a Priestess: Women and Ritual in Ancient Greece and Votive Sculpture of Hellenistic Cyprus . A MacArthur Fellow, she has pushed the boundaries of our understanding of the Parthenon with the publication of \"Parthenon and Parthenoi: A Mythological Interpretation of the Parthenon Frieze\" in the American Journal of Archaeology .

In this course we look for universals in forms and patterns across the disciplines. To understand why such universals appear we must examine function. The key concept is indeed the relation between form and function. Topics explored with the viewpoint of form and function include biology (from cells to ecosystems), psychology, sociology, linguistics, literature, art, architecture, engineering, mythology, politics, and religion. Students learn a powerful methodology for thinking and problem solving. They are encouraged to pursue individual interests while participating in an environment of sharing.    TYLER VOLK , Associate Professor of Biology , specializes in understanding the role of life in Earth?s biogeochemical cycles and has conducted research for NASA. With a passion for the interdisciplinary, he also investigates the generation of pattern in the widest sense, at all levels of culture and nature. Spanning the technical to the popular, his numerous articles have appeared in such magazines as Nature, Bioscience, New Scientist, The Sciences , and Natural History . He has published three books: Metapatterns across Space, Time, and Mind; Gaia?s Body: Toward a Physiology of Earth ; and What Is Death?: A Scientist Looks at the Cycle of Life .    Baseball and American Culture (V50.0206; call # 72301) Instructor: Carl E. Prince Wednesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    Baseball is neither a metaphor for life nor a perfect explanation for the uniqueness of American culture or American character. But sport?and, for some cogent reasons, baseball in particular? does provide a way into an examination of major contemporary historical questions in the areas of race, gender, and class. The Brooklyn Dodgers? pioneering role in American racial integration in the years after World War II, for example, and the Yankees? early failure to follow suit provide useful laboratories for a study of race. The strongly macho character of baseball reveals basic gender aspirations and prejudices more subtly evoked in other areas of American life. To the extent that baseball is indeed a workingclass game, fan involvement reveals much about the nature of urban class values and tensions in the 20th century. A fulllength baseballrelated research paper is required.    CARL E. PRINCE is Professor of History Emeritus and past president of the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic. He has published four books and numerous articles on early American political culture and edited the five-volume Papers of William Livingston . A former baseball player and lifelong fan, he is also the author of Brooklyn?s Dodgers: The Bums, the Borough, and the Best of Baseball (1996), which opened for him a new academic field.    Computer Simulation (V50.0207; call # 72302) Instructor: Charles S. Peskin Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00?3:15 p.m. Prerequisites: AP calculus and physics    Since the starting point for any computer simulation is a mathematical model (i.e., a collection of equations that describe the phenomenon to be simulated), the true prerequisite for this seminar is a love of mathematics, especially calculus. Computer simulation is one way that mathematics gets applied to the real world. In this handson course students learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological processes. Examples include the orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of epidemic and endemic diseases in a population, including the evolution of a population in response to an endemic disease; the production of sound by musical instruments; the flow of traffic on a highway or in a city; and the electrical activity of nerves. The seminar meets alternately in a classroom and in a computer laboratory setting. The techniques needed to perform computer simulations, and to present the results in terms of elementary graphics, animations, and sounds, are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by students working individually or in teams. Topics for student projects may be drawn from those discussed in class as listed above, but students are also free to do other projects that reflect their own interests.    CHARLES S. PESKIN is Professor of Mathematics and Neural Science . His field of research is mathematical modeling and computer simulation applied to biology and medicine. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a former MacArthur Fellow, and a recipient of the Mayor?s Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, as well as the Great Teacher Award of the NYU Alumni Association.    Professional Responsibility: Markets, Ethics, and Law (V50.0208; call # 72303) Instructor: Daniel Diamond Monday, 11:00 a.m.?1:30 p.m.    Every individual, regardless of his or her chosen field of study or occupation, will in time function as a professional or manager in a business, notforprofit, or government organization. This course is designed to enable individuals to think critically about the ethical context and consequences of the decisions they will make in their respective professional and organizational settings. In previous generations understanding and practicing one?s professional responsibilities was a desirable, if not required, behavior. In our society today it is a necessity. We explore the reasons for this change and, by examining the interactions between the marketplace, societal norms, and the law, develop the ethical analytical and reasoning tools necessary to identify and weigh often competing interests. Ideally this enables individuals to make decisions that simultaneously cause no harm to the affected parties?customers, coworkers, community, etc.?further the goals of the organization, and enhance the professional career of the decision maker. The requisite ethical reasoning tools are developed through a series of cases and related readings dealing with a variety of topics, including ethics of the individual business professional, product liability, the social responsibility of the corporation, moral standards across borders, ethical issues in financial markets, termination and downsizing, sexual harassment, and privacy. Since this is a case course, students play an active role in the learning process during class sessions.    DANIEL DIAMOND is Professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business. He served as Dean of the Stern Undergraduate College and as Vice Dean of the Stern School from 1985 to 1995. He also held the position of Dean of the College of Management Science at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell and Director of the Northeast Region Small Business Development Center. He has published extensively in the areas of U.S. economic history, labor force trends, and labor policy. He currently teaches \"The Global Business Environment: International Macroeconomics and Finance\" and \"Professional Responsibility\" in the Stern School?s M.B.A. program.    Great Poems (V50.0209; call # 72304) Instructor: David Lehman Tuesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    The aim of this course is to change your life. We will read a selection of the greatest poems in the English language and consider what makes them great. We will discuss what distinguishes American from British poetry, and we will give some attention to questions of poetic influence and methods of composition. But the primary focus will be on reading, interpreting, and evaluating the poems themselves. The poets under consideration will include Shakespeare, Donne, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Byron, Whitman, Dickinson, Yeats, Eliot, Frost, Stevens, Auden, and Bishop. The course will conclude with some examples of contemporary American poetry.    DAVID LEHMAN is a celebrated poet, distinguished critic, and influential editor. In 1988 he initiated \"The Best American Poetry,\" and he continues as the general editor of this acclaimed anthology series. In 1991 he published a critique of deconstruction entitled Signs of the Times: Deconstruction and the Fall of Paul de Man . His other books include The Evening Sun , his most recent collection of poems, and The Perfect Murder , a study of murder mysteries. The Last AvantGarde: The Making of the New York School of Poets appeared in 1998. He is editor of the forthcoming new edition of The Oxford Book of American Poetry . He has also taught at Columbia University, New School University, Bennington College, and Hamilton College.    Language and Reality in 20th Century Science and Literature (V50.0210; call # 72305) Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00?3:15 p.m.    The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the socalled two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \"postmodern\" literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg?s \"uncertainty principle\" and the \"undecidability\" of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon and from nontechnical texts on quantum and chaos theories.    FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German and Director of Undergraduate Studies in the department. Winner of the College?s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching, the University?s Distinguished Teaching Medal, and its Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master?s Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on 20thcentury German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.    Understanding the Vietnam War (V57.0216; call # 74290) Instructor: Marilyn B. Young Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.?1:30 p.m.    The Vietnam War, which ended over twenty years ago, continues to resonate in American society. It is often described as more \"divisive\" than any other war in American history with the exception of the Civil War. This seminar explores the history of the war and its impact. In addition to reading competing historical analyses, we shall read novels, screen movies, and discuss the war with both participants and participant observers. When possible, the authors of some of the books we read will take part in the class. By the end of the term we may not be able to answer the old question \"Why Vietnam?\" but we shall certainly be closer to understanding how it happened and perhaps even what it meant.    MARILYN B. YOUNG is Professor of History . She teaches Asian history and the history of U.S. relations with Asia and is the author of The Vietnam Wars, 1945?1990 and of numerous essays on the war and the way it has been remembered.    Cinema and Affect: Why the Movies Move Us (V50.0217; call # 74291) Instructor: Charles Affron Thursday, 9:30 a.m.?12:00 noon    Popular cinema most obviously appeals to its viewers by telling stories and representing a semblance of life. But if the movies ultimately move us they do so because they convey story and truetolifeness through style and through the specific properties of the cinematic medium. This seminar focuses on \"conventional\" narrative films of the 1930s and 1940s to examine how (1) the weight of style and (2) the intrinsically emotional elements of the medium elicit the viewer?s affective response. The model of life serves the model of art; viewers respond to the medium when its conditions echo those of life. Film beguiles viewers to enter into its processes, and then uses those processes to capture lifelike representations of emotional situations. How do framing, display, staging, camera movement, sound, theatricality, irony, and duration conspire with narrative to move us to tears? How are viewers impelled to move with moving pictures, to be moved by them?    CHARLES AFFRON is Professor of French and Director of Graduate Studies in that department. In addition to books on the French novel and on the French Romantic theater and poetry, he has published Star Acting: Gish, Garbo, Davis, Divine Garbo (in French) , Cinema and Sentiment , and Sets in Motion (with Mirella Jona Affron), a study of the relationship between set design and narrative in cinema. In 2001 he published the biography Lillian Gish: Her Legend, Her Life .    The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America (V50.0218; call # 72306) Instructor: John E. Sexton Monday, 6:45?8:45 p.m.    Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of Church and State; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a 21st century liberal constitutional democracy.    JOHN E. SEXTON , President of New York University , was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and he has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.    Literature, Film, and the Artistic Environment of Arab Society in the 20th Century (V50.0223; call # 72307) Instructor: Mona N. Mikhail Wednesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    This seminar investigates themes in the Arabic artistic and literary milieu over the course of the 20th century. Through the primary lens of poetry and prose (including essays, novels, and short stories), it examines the crossmedia influences on cultural production and artists? engagement with political events of the 20th century. Students view films and documentaries, especially those produced from the works of the Nobel Prize?winning novelist Naguib Mahfouz ( Midaq Alley, Miramar, etc.), and discuss the influence of major crossover themes from literature (EastWest dialogue, nationalism, antiimperialism, and existentialism) on filmmakers. Attention is also paid to similar themes in plastic arts and architecture, as represented by the artists Moukhtar, Mahmoud Said, and Wissa Wassef and the architect Hassan Fathy.    MONA N. MIKHAIL , Associate Professor of Middle Eastern Studies , is the author of numerous books, notably Studies in the Short Fiction of Naguib Mahfouz and Yusuf Idris , and has written extensively on the cultural, social, and political context of modern Arabic literature, while also translating several important Arabic works into English. She is currently working on the growing body of women?s literature in the Arab world and exploring women?s role in popular culture/literature in oral genres such as proverbs, drama, song, and humor. Seen and Heard will be published in summer 2003. She also recently directed and produced a documentary about the theater in Egypt.    Freedom, Classical Liberal Principles, and 21stCentury Problems (V50.0227; call # 72308) Instructor: Mario J. Rizzo Monday, 4:55?7:25 p.m.    The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the principles of classical liberalism through the discussion of theoretical and empirical issues in economics, law, and ethics. \"Classical liberalism\" is the political, economic, social, and moral philosophy that is severely skeptical of the power of the state and seeks to reduce its power over the citizen. It advances the view that society, under the rule of law, is largely selfregulating, and so government intervention, whether in economic or social affairs, is either unnecessary or simply makes problems worse. Sometimes classical liberalism is called \"19thcentury liberalism,\" but its development has roots in ancient Roman thought, in the 18thcentury Scottish Enlightenment, as well as in many strains of 20thcentury philosophy and economics. Its leading thinkers have included Adam Smith, F. A. Hayek, and Milton Friedman. The course considers philosophical principles and empirical issues in the context of contemporary problems, such as free trade, property rights, income distribution, and socialreligious toleration.    MARIO J. RIZZO is Associate Professor of Economics in the Department of Economics, as well as codirector of the Austrian Economics Program. His fields of research lie at the interface of a number of academic subjects, including the economic analysis of law; ethics and economics; and the methodology and philosophy of economics. He also has a longstanding interest in political philosophy. He is the author (with Gerald O?Driscoll) of The Economics of Time and Ignorance , many articles in law journals, and philosophically oriented articles on economic theory.    Punk to Postmodernism: The Downtown New York Avant-Garde Scene since 1975 (V50.0232; call # 74606) Instructor: Marvin J. Taylor Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.?12:00 noon    Punk, performance art, postmodernism, graffiti art, minimalism, conceptual art?these are just some of the topics examined in this course. Following the Vietnam War, artists, writers, and musicians moved into the abandoned industrial lofts of Soho and the Lower East Side, and an explosion of creative activity produced one of the most important outsider art movements of this century. The first half of the course focuses on the Soho scene, where, outside of the mainstream of the art and literary world of uptown venues, artists began to forge a new way of looking at the creation of works of art that has forever changed American culture. After the gentrification of Soho, the scene shifted to the East Village, where the work became more hardedged and influenced by the ethnic mix of the Lower East Side. The second half of the course focuses on this distinct scene. It centers on some of the major questions that arise from the works of downtown artists and the scene in which they worked: what is inside/outside, high/low, modern/postmodern, art/activism, sex/sexuality, and identity/performance. Works studied include literature, photography, film, and performance art by such artists as Kathy Acker, Dennis Cooper, David Wojnarowicz, Keith Haring, Nan Goldin, Barbara Kruger, Lynne Tillman, Laurie Anderson, Michel Foucault, and JeanFran?ois Lyotard.    MARVIN J. TAYLOR , Director of the Fales Library and Special Collections at NYU , is also the curator of the Downtown New York Collection, the only archive of books, manuscripts, photos, film, and other materials related to the downtown scene. He has published in scholarly and popular magazines, assemblings, and avantgarde anthologies, including The Crimes of the Beats and the Japanese publication American Book Jam . Among his other research interests are Victorian fiction, queer theory, and the epistemology of libraries.    First Amendment Freedom of Expression (V50.0235; call # 72309) Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00?3:15 p.m.    Conflicts over freedom of speech erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A tobacco company sues a major television network for libel. Press disclosures threaten the fairtrial rights of defendants in major criminal trials. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests of society. This course begins by examining the struggle against seditious libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. Students examine freedom of speech through the prism of a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons; political dissent that advocates overthrow of the government; prior restraints against publication; obscenity and pornography; flag burning; free press versus fair trial; and inflictions of emotional distress. Students read and analyze important decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.    STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is Associate Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication and Director of the Program in Business and Economic Reporting. He teaches courses on First Amendment law in which he focuses on the legal rights of the press. His research interests include both law and business, and he writes frequently on both topics for national publications. He is coauthor of Building 6: The Tragedy at Bridesburg , an investigation of cancer deaths at a chemical company, and is currently working on a book about the First Amendment religion case Abington School District v. Schemp.    Performance and Society (V50.0238; call # 73992) Instructor: Richard Schechner Wednesday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    What are the many ways that performance inflects personal and social life? How can a grasp of performance theories inform us about society? What can we learn about the performances of everyday life, the life roles that we each play? How do these relate to sacred and secular rituals, sports and other popular entertainments, trials and the legislative process, the performance of medicine and business, the internet, and the performing arts? In this seminar we explore performance as a broad spectrum of activities by focusing on particular examples drawn from specific genres of performance. These include Trinidad Carnival, the Ramlila Cycle Play of northern India, the trial of those accused of witchcraft in 17thcentury Salem, Massachusetts, and the trial of O. J. Simpson, the modern Olympic Games, the performance of race and gender, and the performance of medicine. In most of these instances we compare how materials are treated socially to how they are treated aesthetically (e.g., the rendering of the Salem witch trials in court records of the time and in Arthur Miller?s play The Crucible ). In addition to readings and discussions, seminar members attend selected performances in New York ranging from theater to sports to trials to surgery.    RICHARD SCHECHNER is a University Professor of Performance Studies who teaches at the Tisch School of the Arts and the NYU Law School. He is also a professional theater director whose most recent work is Yokastas, coauthored with Saviana Stanescu and produced at La Mama in March?April 2003. Schechner is a widely published author and editor of the renowned journal TDR: The Drama Review . His 2002 book, Performance Studies, An Introduction , is the basic text used in the seminar.    In Search of Lost Time (V50.0240; call # 72311) Instructor: Marcelle Clements Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.?1:30 p.m.    We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically? with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel in seven volumes and 4,500 pages, In Search of Lost Time addresses literature?s richest theme: desire?its remembrance, loss, perversion, defeat, triumph, and final resurgence in the form of art. Almost 100 years old, it remains a dazzling portrait of turnofthecentury French beau monde and, even more, of the power and elegance of its narrator?s sensibility. It is still unparalleled in how it combines breadth, virtuosity, and irony, the author?s extraordinary psychological acuity and the glamour of his world, as well as how it merges social history, ennui, and lust. It is also one of the world?s greatest, most pleasurable, and elating reads. Although Marcel Proust (1871?1922) is usually assumed to be France?s greatest novelist, his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move on, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while the texture of In Search of Lost Time (association, evocation, magnification, play of words and memory) may have been its most radical contribution to the art of the novel, this work cannot be understood until it has been read in its entirety. In this seminar, we will keep moving at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, Time Regained.    MARCELLE CLEMENTS is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Her articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations ; a novel, Rock Me ; and a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman: Single Women Reinventing Single Life . Her most recent book is a novel, Midsummer.    Rethinking Who We Are: Interpersonal Approaches to the Person (V50.0247; call # 73677) Instructor: Michael Westerman Monday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    There are unresolved tensions in the field of psychology between individualcentered and interpersonal models of the person. The seminar is based on the belief that in order to make progress on these unresolved issues we need to recognize that they refer to a longstanding fundamental question philosophers began wondering about centuries before the discipline of psychology came into existence?What place do our relationships with other people have in our lives? Moreover, we need to engage in an inquiry that involves a dynamic interplay between psychological and philosophical considerations. Participants in the seminar learn about work in several specific areas where these tensions appear, including models of child development, approaches to psychopathology, and basic questions about psychotherapy. We also consider more \"interpersonal\" versus more individualcentered ways in which psychologists think about interpersonal interaction itself. The final topic concerns the philosophy of the social sciences. We look at recent contributions by psychologists and philosophers suggesting that we replace traditional concepts of the process of psychological research with a social view of that process. Throughout the seminar, we refer to classic philosophical texts and contributions by historians of ideas to explore critically the ways in which contemporary efforts by psychologists reflect concepts of the person from our philosophical tradition.    MICHAEL A. WESTERMAN is Associate Professor of Psychology and a member of the faculty in the clinical psychology doctoral training program. He has conducted research on several topics concerning interpersonal relationships, including studies of motherchild interaction, family systems, and the patienttherapist relationship in psychotherapy. His publications also include articles on issues in philosophical psychology. He is currently involved in a program of research based on an interpersonal reconceptualization of psychological defenses he has developed, which is called the theory of interpersonal defense.    New Media Law and Content Creation (V50.0253; call # 72314) Instructor: Karl P. Kilb Monday, 6:20?8:50 p.m.    This course explores the legal and journalistic issues surrounding the creation and distribution of content in the \"Electronic Information Age.\" Content is a commodity that is packaged in many forms, known as \"media.\" We are all consumers of content, which is tailored by each media organization to target specific audiences. Consumers base their content choices on the type of information, as well as on the method of delivery. The traditional print and broadcast media have found a powerful, relatively inexpensive new means of distribution: the Internet. The rapid packaging of content by means of new technology has forced content creators and distributors to develop new interpretations to fundamental intellectual property issues, including copyright law. The seminar will promote active research and discussions with leaders in the media and legal professions, and explore how legislation and industry practices are responding to new technology.    KARL P. KILB, ESQ. , is the General Counsel of Bloomberg LP, managing a global Legal/Contracts Department. Before becoming an attorney in 1995, he was a broadcast journalist at FNN, CNBC, 1010 WINS Radio, Bloomberg, and various other networks and stations in New York for twelve years, having graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in broadcast journalism from NYU. He frequently lectures at universities and industry organizations about media and intellectual property law.    School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies (V50.0255; call # 74604) Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum Tuesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    The decades of the 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation and of New York University. This course aims to develop an appreciation of information seeking and recording in a research environment. In essence, students will research NYU?s recent history by means of library research methods learned in the course. Through the examination of primary and secondary materials, accompanied by the personal narratives of faculty who were on campus during those times, students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition to doing shared background readings, class members will develop a research paper or a finding aid about their chosen topic.    ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is an Associate Curator in the Bobst Library and an Adjunct Professor in the English Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science. He is currently the librarian for education in the Social Sciences Department. First as a student and then as faculty, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.    Modern Concepts of Matter and the Cosmos (V50.0256; call # 72315) Instructor: Daniel Zwanziger Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.?12:15 p.m. Prerequisite: high school physics    Since the 1970s our understanding of matter has been dominated by a paradigm known as \"the Standard Model\" of elementary particle physics. According to this model, the basic forces of nature are the strong and electroweak forces that are transmitted by \"gauge\" fields, and the gravitational force that is described by general relativity. Elementary particles are either the quanta of the gauge fields themselves, including gluons and photons, or quarks and leptons that interact and are bound by the exchange of these quanta. This seminar reviews the Standard Model and the evidence for it. The geometric character of gauge and gravitational fields is described. Modern theories of the cosmos are presented, in the light of recent observations. Since the nature of modern physical theories is quite mathematical and geometrical, students taking this course should be intrigued by mathematical concepts.    DANIEL ZWANZIGER is Professor of Physics . His special research interest is quantum field theory applied to elementary particles. His most recent publications deal with the theory of quarks and gluons known as quantum chromodynamics.    The Serotonin System: The Master Regulator of the Brain (V50.0258; call # 74603) Instructor: Efrain Azmitia Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.?12:00 noon    The human brain, one of the most fascinating and challenging frontiers in modern science, contains hundreds of individual chemical systems that form interacting networks adapted for the survival of the organism and the species. This course focuses on the cells that release a small aminoacid derivative called serotonin. Serotonin has been implicated in a vast array of functions, ranging from aggression, sexual behavior, sleeping, and learning to regulation of hormone release, eating, and neurotrophic factor secretion. Many mindaltering drugs (LSD, psilocybin, ecstasy, cocaine, alcohol, etc.) act on serotonin neurons. In humans, serotonin dysfunction is associated with such mental disorders as bulimia, depression, autism, Down?s syndrome, and Alzheimer?s disease. The course assumes no prior knowledge of neurosceince. Its interdisciplinary approach crosses traditional fields like biology, chemistry, psychology, anthropology, pharmacology, anatomy, neurology, and psychiatry. Readings and discussions are complemented by laboratory visits, demonstrations, and films.    EFRAIN AZMITIA is head of NYU's Laboratory of Molecular Neuroplasticity in the Department of Biology , member of the Center for Neural Science, Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry at the NYU Medical Center, and a National Institute of Mental Health Career Scientist awardee. He has held appointments in Great Britain, France, Japan, and Israel, as well as in the United States. He has written over 200 articles, edited four books, organized over 20 international meetings, and lectured thoughout the world. He is on the editorial board of Brain Research, Synapse, NeuroscienceNet (www.neuroscience.com), and other professional journals.    The Etruscans (V50.0261; call # 74601) Instructor: Larissa Bonfante Monday and Wednesday, 2:00?3:15 p.m.    This course deals with the arts, history, and language of the wealthy Etruscan cities that flourished in central Italy from 1000 to 100 B.C. Because their language is unrelated to any other in the world and their own literature has disappeared, we must study them through their art?of which a considerable amount has survived. The class reads what the Greeks and Romans, their rivals and neighbors, said about them, compares this to the reality of their religion, society, and customs, and learns about their remarkable technical achievements in divination, jewelry making, metalwork, road building, and other crafts. New excavations and discoveries are constantly bringing forth fresh proof of their importance in the ancient Mediterranean world, in which they traded with the Near East, Carthage, Greece, and Rome, and their influence in Rome and in Europe, to which they brought the culture of cities. Work with the Classics Department?s collection of Etruscan antiquities allows students to see original Etruscan art and inscriptions and to have handson experience with Etruscan archaeological material.    LARISSA BONFANTE is Professor of Classics and the author of books and articles on Etruscan language, society, culture, and influence. Etruscan Life and Afterlife , which she edited, is used as a textbook in universities in the United States and in Europe. She is also a winner of the College?s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.    From Milton to Mingus (V50.0264; call # 72317) Instructor: Perry Meisel Monday and Wednesday, 3:30?4:45 p.m.    This course examines the relation between influence and originality in canonical artists from Milton to Charles Mingus, and how it impacts culture at large. A growing preoccupation with mediocrity defines the history of literature from the Renaissance to modernism, and makes imaginative autonomy the site of ideal artistic success; in jazz, the tension between group and soloist is present from the start. What are the ironies that assail these histories? What are the paradoxes that both install their ideals and deconstruct their possibility? Recognizing the unconscious influences that guide the reader?s or the listener?s responses is the course?s second, and parallel, focus. Readings include Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Keats, Whitman, Pater, Freud, Virgina Woolf, and Ralph Ellison. Musicians include Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis; Lester Young, Charlie Parker, and John Coltrane; and Charles Mingus.    PERRY MEISEL , Professor of English , is the author of numerous books and articles, including The Myth of the Modern and The Cowboy and the Dandy . In addition to writing about literature, psychoanalysis, and critical theory, he has also written extensively about jazz and rock, principally for the Village Voice . He has taught at NYU since 1975.    Terrorism, Nihilism, and Modernity (V50.0267; call # 72320) Instructor: James Gilligan Thursday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    The past century has witnessed violence the character and scale of which are so unique and unprecedented that we have had to create a new vocabulary to describe it (genocide, terrorism) and the ideologies that underlie it (totalitarianism, fundamentalism). To understand modern violence, we will examine the origin of the modern mind in the 17th century, when science, based on universal doubt, ended the Age of Faith, and the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority lost credibility. Nietzsche called this the \"death of God\" (and the Devil); it could also be called the death of Good and Evil, leading to another set of new words (nihilism, agnosticism, anomie, anarchy). We will study the origins and implications of these developments by reading Shakespeare and John Donne, Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, Beckett and Wittgenstein, Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well as modern mass murderers from Hitler to bin Laden. Finally, we will ask whether the modern human sciences can help us understand how to reverse or at least limit this escalation of violence.    JAMES GILLIGAN headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry. He is now an Adjunct Professor at NYU, Director of the Center for the Study of Violence, a member of President Clinton?s National Commission on Youth Violence, and author of Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic and Preventing Violence: An Agenda for the Coming Century . He has been a consultant to the Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention at the World Health Organization, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and numerous other organizations.    The Art of the Enemy (V50.0270; call # 72323) Instructor: Hector Feliciano Wednesday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    The destruction of the art of the enemy, or cultural looting, has almost always been one of the staple byproducts of international, civil, or religious strife. From ancient or biblical times to the recent wars in the former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, art plunder and the willful destruction of cultural patrimony?from palaces, museums, libraries, churches, mosques, and synagogues to paintings, statues, icons, and books?have been used by the victors as a supplementary means to conquer, annihilate, and humiliate the enemy. By studying some examples of destruction and looting, we will explore the enemies? fascinating political, aesthetic, or religious justifications for these acts. We will also consider why some enemies destroy, while others simply take along, sell, or abandon; we will describe the positive and negative role of museums in some of these events, and learn how the \"values of collecting\" and the creation of museums may have helped to preserve art destined to be destroyed or looted by others. Above all, we will constantly be redefining what art is and what it means? to us and to our enemies. There will be guest speakers and field trips to museums.    HECTOR FELICIANO is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Formerly cultural writer for the Paris bureaus of the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times , he is the author of The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World?s Greatest Works (1997); first published in French, this work has since been translated into several other languages. He served on the Panel of Experts of the Presidential Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States. He is the organizer of the First International Symposium on Cultural Property and Patrimony (Columbia University, 1999) and of a panel discussion entitled \"The Art of the Enemy\" (School of Visual Arts in New York City, 2002).    What Makes a Great Leader?: Perspectives from Government, Law, and Business (V50.0275; call # 72328) Instructor: Diane C. Yu Monday, 6:30?9:00 p.m.    Machiavelli wrote in 1532, \"There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.\" This seminar explores some of the ways in which leaders, particularly over the past two centuries, have risen in a number of settings. How do we define greatness in leadership? Have the standards remained static, or have they changed over time? How have leaders overcome the obstacles in their paths? What, if any, traits do they have in common? Do leaders make the times in which they serve, or do the times dictate the leaders who emerge? Are leadership skills innate, or can they be learned and developed? The seminar will stimulate thinking through readings and discussion about notable figures from politics and government, such as the Founding Fathers, Lincoln, Mandela, Gandhi, and Churchill, while looking at contemporary examples drawn from the business and legal world as well. Readings include selections from biography, Confucius, Shakespeare, analysis and commentary, history, and autobiography. The seminar also features sessions with prominent figures from the business, media, and political worlds who will discuss their views and firsthand observations about leadership.    DIANE C. YU is Chief of Staff and Deputy to the President of NYU. She has been a highranking executive at a Fortune 250 company, California judicial officer, general counsel for a California public corporation, and appointed by the President as a White House Fellow. Her B.A. is from Oberlin and her J.D. from the University of California (Berkeley). A national bar leader, she serves on numerous boards, has won awards for her service to the legal profession, and was the first woman of color to chair the American Bar Association?s Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, which accredits American law schools. She currently chairs the ABA?s Commission on Women in the Profession.    The Biology of Infectious Diseases (V50.0276; call # 74292) Instructors: Martin Blaser and Joel Ernst Wednesday, 4:55?7:25    Infectious diseases have shaped human biology, genes, culture, and imagination. After the advent of antibiotics, we thought that we could win the \"war\" on infectious diseases. Antibiotic resistance and AIDS, among other events, have taught us that the war is not winnable. Rather, we must understand our place in the microbial world and learn to adapt strategies that minimize infectious disease impact, and maximize our symbiosis with indigenous organisms. After introductory discussions, the course is conducted as a series of seminars by students on topics that provide greater understanding of the underlying biological issues. Topics that may be discussed include genetic susceptibility to diseases such as malaria, problems involved in antibiotic resistance, the evolution of HIV, good microbes vs. bad, and infectious diseases in the postmodern world.    MARTIN BLASER is the Frederick H. King Professor of Internal Medicine and Chairman of the Department of Medicine , and Professor of Microbiology at the NYU School of Medicine. A practicing physician, and specialist in Infectious Diseases, he has progressively become a biologist. His research interests have spanned clinical medicine, epidemiology, molecular biology and genetics, evolutionary biology, mathematics, and history. The recipient of numerous honors and awards, he is founder and publisher of the Bellevue Literary Review .    JOEL ERNST is the Jeffrey Bergstein Professor of Medicine, Director of Infectious Diseases, and Professor of Microbiology at the NYU School of Medicine. A clinician and specialist in infectious diseases, he directs his immunology research at discovery of mechanisms used by microbial pathogens to evade the immune system. He is a frequently sought speaker at international meetings on infectious diseases and immunology.    The Politics of Knowledge in the United States (V50.0277; call # 74607) Instructor: Thomas Bender Monday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    There are a variety of forms of knowledge (numerical, visual, narrative, analytical) associated with different disciplines, groups, and institutions. How does each obtain cultural significance and authority? What are the assumptions that support their claims as valid knowledge? To what extent are they \"mirrors of nature\"? To what extent do they reflect or reveal the \"position\" or human interests of those who articulate them, whether one thinks of personal qualities, class position, institutional location, or ideological commitment? How does one respond to such uncertainty about the sources and validity of knowledge claims? How do knowledge claims enter politics? How does one politically engage such claims?    THOMAS BENDER is University Professor of the Humanities and Professor of History . On the faculty of NYU since 1974, he has served as chair of the History Department and as Dean for the Humanities. His teaching and research interests cover the history of cities, intellectuals, and intellectual and cultural history more generally. His 14 published books include two directly related to this course, New York Intellect and Intellect and Public Life . His most recent books, both published in 2002, are Rethinking American History in a Global Age and The Unfinished City: New York and the Metropolitan Idea . He also frequently contributes to newspapers and magazines, including the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times .    Ethics, Pointillism, Epidemiology, and Epistemology: EPEE Dueling with Scientific Health Information (V50.0278; call # 74293) Instructor: Ralph V. Katz Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    The common citizen is well challenged?if not overly challenged? trying to deal with the flood of scientific health information as presented in the media. \"Scientific\" health find ings of this week seem to routinely conflict with the \"scientific\" health findings of last week. As the movie theme song asked so poignantly 35 years ago, \"What?s it all about, Alfie?\" This course explores that question as related to scientific health information as used both by individuals to make personal life decisions related to health behaviors and by society to protect its citizens via court decisions and governmental regulations. Concepts from the fields of ethics, art, and science are central to readings and discussions focused on how to make sense of it all. Beginning with the history and foundation concepts of bioethics and epidemiology, the course provides a frame for understanding how to make reasonable sense of this flood of scientific health information, i.e., what are the strengths and limitations (and misuses) of this free flow of scientific health findings in our democratic \"instant, electronic news\" world. Textbooks and videos cover background on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, polar bears, and rubbish. As the major course assignment, each student writes a newspaperstyle \"oped\" article, backed by an annotated bibliography.    RALPH V. KATZ is Professor of Epidemiology and Chair of the Department of Epidemiology &amp; Health Promotion in the NYU College of Dentistry. He is Director of the NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP (Research on Adolescent and Adult Health Promotion) Center and leads a current study investigating whether minorities are less willing to participate in biomedical studies as research subjects and, if so, why. Having served on the National Tuskegee Legacy Committee, he was a Presidential Invitee to the White House for President Clinton?s 1997 apology to the AfricanAmerican community. His epidemiologic research has ranged from oral disease studies to the development of epidemiologic research methods. In addition to his dental degree, he holds a master?s degree in public health and a Ph.D. in epidemiology.    W. E. B. Du Bois: The Making of a Radical Scholar Activist (V50.0279; call # 74351) Instructor: Jeff Goodwin Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    W. E. B. Du Bois (1868?1963) was one of the most remarkable scholars and political activists of the 20th century. The first AfricanAmerican to earn a doctorate at Harvard, Du Bois wrote perhaps the most trenchant analysis of the AfricanAmerican condition, The Souls of Black Folk (1903), the first sociological study of a Black community, The Philadelphia Negro (1899), and one of the most influential works of American history, Black Reconstruction in America (1935). Du Bois also founded the Niagara Movement in 1905, breaking decisively with the \"accommodationist\" politics of Booker T. Washington, and was a major figure in the PanAfricanist movement. This course examines the life, times, and writings of Du Bois, focusing on the years between his birth in 1868 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and 1910, when he left Atlanta University to become editor of The Crisis, the official publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The course tries to understand, among other issues, how such a remarkable and cosmopolitan individual could have emerged from such a humble and seemingly parochial background, a small town in western Massachusetts with a tiny AfricanAmerican community.    JEFF GOODWIN , Professor of Sociology , is author of No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945?1991 and coeditor of Passionate Politics: Emotions and Social Movements and The Social Movements Reader . He has taught courses on social movements and revolutions at NYU since 1991. His interests also include social theory and the AfricanAmerican tradition in sociology, including the works of Du Bois, Charles S. Johnson, E. Franklin Frazier, St. Claire Drake, and Oliver Cromwell Cox.    Rise of the Skyscraper (V50.0281; call # 74294) Instructor: Sarah Bradford Landau Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    New York City, as well as Chicago, contributed significantly to the creation of the skyscraper building type. Although the World Trade Center and plans for its rebuilding are likely to be discussed, the focus of the seminar is New York?s historic skyscrapers. We consider the urban factors that precipitated the desire to build tall; technological innovations?notably the elevator and iron and steel skeleton construction?that made it possible to build tall; the relation of form and style features to site conditions, building code provisions, and architectural aesthetics; and the contributions of individual architects. Introductory lectures on the early development of the skyscraper in New York and Chicago, tours of lower Manhattan?s skyscraper districts, midtown?s Chrysler and Empire State buildings, and class discussions based on assigned readings precede student oral presentations focused on specific case studies accompanied by slides. In preparation for their presentations and final papers, students experience using primary sources such as those in the city?s Municipal Archives in addition to reading the relevant published studies.    SARAH BRADFORD LANDAU , Professor of Fine Arts , has taught at NYU for 27 years and has received a Golden Dozen award for Excellence in Teaching. She is an authority on the New York sky scraper. Her publications related to the subject include Rise of the New York Skyscraper, 1865?1913 (with coauthor Carl W. Condit) and a monograph study of George B. Post, who contributed substantially to the creation of the skyscraper: George B. Post, Architect: Picturesque Designer and Determined Realist . She has also served as commissioner on the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and as commission vice chair.    From the Rise of Christianity to Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on Two Millennia (V50.0282; call # 74355) Instructor: Edward W. Lehman Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The new millennium has dawned with growing disenchantment with traditional leftright cleavages and with the claim that the United States is increasingly a nation of isolated individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is eroding civic virtues and our democratic institutions. Our aim is to assess the trajectory of our culture using the dimensions of autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism. This seminar begins by probing these diagnoses in the broader context of moral and social transformations in the West over the last two thousand years. We examine socialscience analyses of pivotal changes that have occurred in that period. We consider the sociologist Rodney Stark?s highly acclaimed The Rise of Christianity , which focuses on developments during the first four centuries of the first millennium of the common era. Our final reading is the political scientist Robert Putnam?s controversial Bowling Alone, which is currently the most publicized critique of contemporary American civic life.    EDWARD W. LEHMAN is a Professor of Sociology . His research interests include political sociology, cultural sociology, and sociological theory. He is the author of Coordinating Health Care: Explorations in Interorganizational Relations, Political Society: A Macrosociology of Politics , and The Viable Polity . He is coeditor of A Sociological Reader in Complex Organizations . In 2000 he edited and published Autonomy and Order: A Communitarian Anthology , a collection of original essays by 15 authors that explores how the fraying of shared moral understandings and the erosion of communal bonds affect our capacity to balance individual rights and collective responsibilities. He is currently book review editor of The Responsive Community .    Jews and Germans in Postwar Germany (V50.0283; call # 74417) Instructor: Marion Kaplan Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.    This course explores the sometimes painful, often angry, and always fascinating interactions and interlocking histories of Germans and Jews even after the Holocaust. It investigates the immediate postwar situation: the Jewish displaced persons, the U.S., English, French, and Russian occupying forces, and the German refugees from eastern territories. Students analyze how Germans, both East and West, did or did not come to terms with their Nazi pasts. They read perspectives of Jews on their lives in the Germanys, why they stayed, how they experienced their citizenship and their interactions with Germans, and how unification and the influx of Russian Jews affected them. They also analyze German perspectives: How did exNazis or bystanders think about their pasts? Did they cover them up? What did their children and grandchildren know? German and Jewish historical memories are contrasted, including Jewish memories of persecution and annihilation and German memories of suffering during the war. Moreover, students examine the ways Jews and Germans saw the student rebellion of 1968, the American TV series \"Holocaust\" in 1979, the \"Historians? Debate\" of the mid1980s, and the Goldhagen controversy of the 1990s. Finally, the politics of public commemoration in Germany are discussed.    MARION KAPLAN is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History . She has also taught at Queens College, CUNY. She is the author of The Jewish Feminist Movement in Germany: The Campaigns of the J?discher Frauenbund, l904?l938 (1979), The Making of the Jewish Middle Class: Women, Family, and Identity in Imperial Germany (1991), and Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany (1998). The last two won the National Jewish Book Award in their respective years. She has edited books in European women?s history? When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany and The Marriage Bargain: Dowries in European History ?and is currently editing and writing a history of Jewish daily life from the 17th century until 1945.    Bases of Chinese Culture: Philosophy and Literature (V50.0284; call # 73991) Instructor: Moss Roberts Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45    The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the essential themes and issues of traditional Chinese culture through eight representative works of philosophy and literature. The course concentrates on six philosophical texts in English translation? Confucius? Analects, Laozi?s Dao De Jing , the Mozi , the Mencius , the Chuang Tzu , and the Hsun Tzu ?plus two classic novels of the late imperial period, Three Kingdoms and Dream of the Red Chamber , also in English translation.    MOSS ROBERTS is Professor of Chinese and former Director of the East Asian Studies Program . His area of specialization is Chinese language, literature, and philosophy; he has also given courses on Japanese literature and on traditional Vietnamese history and culture. He has translated one of China?s major epics, Three Kingdoms , as well as Chinese Fairy Tales and Fantasies , part of the Pantheon series on folklore. His translation of Laozi?s Dao De Jing was published in 2001.    Waiting for Beckett (V50.0285; call # 74421) Instructor: Tom Bishop Thursday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    From the tramps of Waiting for Godot to the terminal characters of Endgame , to the frenzied narrators of his fictions, Beckett?s major works will be studied as powerful contemporary expressions of the human condition and as a fundamental calling into question of language itself. Beckett?s forceful images will be viewed as metaphors of existence and the tenacity of the Beckettian narrator to continue to speak/write despite all odds points to a positive affirmation. This \"obligation to express\" will be seen as one of the major constants in Beckett?s work?a dialectic of speech and silence, memorably reflected in the final words of The Unnamable : \". . . you must go on, I can?t go on, I?ll go on.\" Beckett will also be studied as one of the 20th century?s key innovators through the narrative strategies of his fiction and the theatrical conventions underlying his dramatic works. The seminar will concentrate on the period of Beckett?s greatest creativity, between 1946 and 1955, and on the late works, from 1970 until his death in 1989. Videotapes of performances and television productions will be used to complement readings, as will as Beckett?s one cinematic venture, Film.    TOM BISHOP is Florence Gould Professor of French Literature, Professor of Comparative Literature , and Chair of the Center for French Civilization and Culture. He chaired the Department of French for 33 years. He has written extensively on contemporary French fiction and drama and especially on the works of Samuel Beckett. Bishop, a past president of the Samuel Beckett Society, organized five major Beckett festivals in New York and in Paris, one of which earned him an OBIE award. He was a friend of Beckett?s for the last quarter century of the writer?s life. Bishop?s most recent book is From the Left Bank: Reflections on the Modern French Theater and Novel .    The Representation of \"the Other\" in the IsraeliPalestinian Cinema (V50.0286; call # 74297) Instructor: Shimon Dotan Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Representation of the Other is a variation of the search for selfidentity. The IsraeliPalestinian conflict, and its political cinema, exhibit a clear pattern in which the parties attribute to the Other qualities and traits that reflect their own distress and aspirations. This pattern is examined in a series of contemporary films (1980 to the present). Each class consists of a screening followed by a discussion concentrating on representation in the context of the political conflict, variations in the use of film language to achieve a subjective portrayal, and modalities of representation and self critique. Two guest speakers, a Palestinian and an Israeli, participate in two (or more) of these discussions. Screenings include Divine Intervention , by Elia Suleiman; Beyond the Walls , by Uri Barabash; Close, Closed, Closure , by Ram Loevi; The Milky Way , by Ali Nasser; and The Smile of the Lamb , by Shimon Dotan.    SHIMON DOTAN , a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an awardwinning filmmaker with ten feature films to his credit. His films were the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ) numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb ) and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). Dotan has taught filmmaking at Tel Aviv University in Israel and Concordia University in Montreal.    Yeats and Joyce (V50.0287; call # 74298) Instructor: Denis Donoghue Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    This course reads Yeats and Joyce in the context of modern Irish society and culture. Yeats and Joyce were very different writers, different in social and religious background, education, and literary affiliation. Each implies a different Ireland. Ideally, Yeats?s Ireland is heroic, pagan, rural, mythic; its modern version is occult, aristocratic, hierarchical. Ideally, Joyce?s Ireland is urban, lowermiddle or middle class, Catholic or (more often) lapsed Catholic. Even when Yeats and Joyce are \"European,\" they are European with different commitments. Yeats?s modern master is Nietzsche, Joyce?s is Ibsen. In aesthetics, Joyce?s precursor is Aquinas; Yeats appeals to the traditions of neoPlatonism and philosophic Ideal ism. A reading of Yeats and Joyce should cast a double light on the strange country they so diversely articulated.    DENIS DONOGHUE is University Professor and Henry James Professor of English and American Letters at NYU. He has also taught at University College, Dublin, and the University of Cambridge (where he was a Fellow of King?s College). His visiting professorships have been at Princeton, UCLA, Harvard, Edinburgh, and other universities. He is the author of about twenty books in literary criticism, theory, and literary biography. The books of particular relevance to this course are Jonathan Swift, Yeats, We Irish, The Ordinary Universe , and The Practice of Reading . He has also published Warrenpoint , a memoir of growing up in a small town in Northern Ireland.    Order, Liberty, and Terrorism: September 11 in Perspective (V50.0288; call # 74354) Instructors: Anthony Amsterdam and Jerome Bruner Thursday, 4:55-6:55 p.m.    The September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon taught the government and the people of the United States how vulnerable we are to massive violence. The president and Congress responded by declaring a \"War on Terrorism.\" One controversial feature of the war on terrorism has been military detention of suspected terrorists without trial and without access to legal counsel. Detention of this sort raises basic questions about how a democratic society should strike the balance between maintaining security and public order on the one hand and preserving individual liberty on the other. This seminar explores the problems of reconciling order and liberty in various settings: in the military detention cases now being argued in the law courts; in earlier cases decided by the courts from the days of Aaron Burr to our own time; in theater and film classics from Sophocles? Antigone to Fred Zinnemann?s A Man for All Seasons and Peter Brooks?s Lord of the Flies . Students write brief papers for each week?s class, analyzing the implications of the court opinions or literary works assigned.    ANTHONY AMSTERDAM and JEROME BRUNER are both University Professors at New York University and are joint authors of Minding the Law , a book that examines the role of narrative thinking and rhetoric in the legal process. Bruner, trained in psychology, which he has taught at Oxford and Harvard, now works on how psychological and cultural influences affect law. Amsterdam has been both law teacher and active litigator for many years, combining academic teaching with court work in constitutional law, criminal law, and civil liberties.    Classical Mythology (V50.0289; call # 74300) Instructor: Matthew S. Santirocco Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    Human beings are distinguished in part by their capacity for telling stories and their delight in hearing them. Some of these narratives become traditional not only for their entertainment value but also because they serve other purposes?to explain natural and human phenomena, for example, to explore crucial questions of human existence, or to support social organization. Often these stories also control behavior: as history shows, the myths we live by are also those for which we are prepared to die or to kill. This seminar takes as a case study the myths of ancient Greece and Rome. Texts are drawn from major classical authors, including Homer, Hesiod, the Greek dramatists, and Vergil. The stories chosen focus on such crucial concepts as cosmology, gender, sexuality, justice, political order, and rationality. Through them we shall also explore the relationship of myth to other types of traditional tale, the functions of myth in ancient societies, the connection of myth to religion and ritual, the comparison of Greek myths with those of other societies, and the persistence of these stories into the present time and our own personal and public lives.    MATTHEW S. SANTIROCCO is Dean of the College of Arts and Science , Professor of Classics , and Angelo J. Ranieri Director of Ancient Studies . His teaching interests include mythology, Greek and Roman literature, comparative literature, and comparative cultural studies. The author of a book on Latin lyric poetry ( Unity and Design in Horace?s Odes ), of several edited volumes, and of many scholarly articles, he is currently working on a book on the poetics of patronage in Augustan Rome. He was editor of the American Philological Association?s two monograph series and is at present editor of the journal Classical World .    Introduction to Literary Theory (V50.0290; call # 74419) Instructor: Ziad Elmarsafy Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    This course presents a structured approach to methods in reading and the theory of literature that prepares students for advanced work in literature. Readings cover a wide selection of texts dealing with the definition and function of Western literature, from Plato to the 21st century. Given the history of the association between \"theory\" writ large and the French intellectual history of the late 20th century, one important point of emphasis is the relationship between those French theorists who have proven most influential in the Englishspeaking world (Barthes, Lacan, Fou cault) and the reception of their ideas on this side of the Atlantic. The course is built around several modules, including the classical heritage; formalism; existentialism and phenomenology; structuralism and semiotics, psychoanalysis; historicism and politically based approaches to literature.    ZIAD ELMARSAFY is Associate Professor of French at NYU with interests in early modernity and the Enlightenment. He has published The Histrionic Sensibility: Theatricality and Identity from Corneille to Rousseau (2001) and Freedom, Slavery and Absolutism: Corneille, Pascal, Racine (forthcoming, 2004) as well as several articles on the literature of the 17th and 18th centuries. He is currently working on a study of the relationship between the understanding of Islam, the translation of the Qur?an, and the European Enlightenment.    Communications and Human Values (V50.0291; call # 74405) Instructor: Richard D. Heffner Tuesday, 6:20?8:50 p.m.    This seminar critically analyzes how much our sense of what it means to be an American at the dawn of the 21st century has been molded by the media, with particular reference to their socializing and valuelegitimating content. To deal with such media power, students are asked first to identify their own respective approaches to the proper relationship between the individual and the state through discussion both of selections from such readings as Walter Lippmann?s Public Opinion , Robert Merton?s Mass Persuasion , J. S. Mill?s On Liberty , Herman Melville?s Billy Budd , Neil Postman?s Amusing Ourselves to Death , and B. F. Skinner?s Beyond Freedom and Dignity , and of screenings of such films as Birth of a Nation, 12 Angry Men, Harvest of Shame, Hearts and Minds , and JFK . Finally, class emphasis is on such contemporary media issues as a Fairness Doctrine (the real or imagined \"chilling effect\" of a requirement for media fairness and balance); cameras in the courts (do televised trials enhance justice, or instead create a \"mobocracy\" with trial by a new jury of public opinion?); media selfregulation (can there in fact be meaningful voluntary selfdiscipline in a free market, free speech, mass media? driven society?).    RICHARD D. HEFFNER is Producer/Moderator of the weekly public television series The Open Mind , which he began nearly a half century ago. Earlier a broadcaster and executive at ABC, NBC, and CBS, in 1962 he became the Founding General Manager of New York?s pioneering Channel 13. Trained as an American historian, he is the author of A Documentary History of the United States (1952) and the editor of Tocqueville?s Democracy in America (1956). His newest book is a collaboration entitled Conversations with Elie Wiesel (2001), and his Conversations about America will appear next year. From 1974 to 1994 he served as Chairman of the film industry's voluntary classification and rating system in Hollywood, commuting from Rutgers, where he has been University Professor of Communications and Public Policy since 1964.    Moral Perfectionism (V50.0292; call # 74301) Instructor: Ulrich Baer Monday and Wednesday, 11:00-12:15p.m.    The tradition of moral perfectionism is part of Western thought and concerns a reflection on the self that places tremendous emphasis on the possibility and necessity of the transforming of oneself and one?s society. In this course we explore the contemporary significance of this emphasis on the possibility of transforming the self?after the much discussed death of the \"subject\"? by reading philosophical, literary, and political texts that combine this unrelenting belief in the possibility of a criticism of society from within with astounding rhetorical force. Readings include selections from Emerson, Melville, Thoreau, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Rilke, Hesse, Freud, Foucault, Cavell, Gilligan, and Arendt.    ULRICH BAER , Associate Professor of German and Comparative Literature , is interested in how historical and personal catastrophes can be adequately communicated to others through literature, photography, and art. He is the author of Remnants of Song: Trauma and Modernity in Charles Baudelaire and Paul Celan and Spectral Evidence: The Photography of Trauma , as well as the editor of the literary anthology 110 Stories: New York Writes after September 11 . He has received the College?s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.    Modern Music in Paris, 1890?1940 (V50.0293; call # 74608) Instructor: Victor Fell Yellin Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00?3:15 p.m.    Beginning with Debussy, Satie, Faur?, Vincent d?Indy, and Ravel, the course traces the evolution of modernism in music as it unfolded in Paris. By choosing new standards of aesthetics from popular and exotic sources rather than by reinventing basic rules of common practice, French composers made music sound modern. Soon gifted musicians from around the world assembled in the city before and after World War I. Some enrolled in established institutions like the Conservatoire or the Schola Cantorum; some studied with charismatic independent teachers such as Nadia Boulanger. They all came to Paris because they were allowed to absorb French taste in art without having to convert to any sectarian aesthetic. In many cases Paris validated pride in their own nationalism. This seminar emphasizes Stravinsky, Milhaud, and Honegger, but it also examines the works of such American composers as Copland, Piston, Antheil, Thomson, and Blitzstein, all of whom studied with Boulanger and then spread the ideas of Modern Parisian musical style to America.    VICTOR FELL YELLIN , Professor of Music , is a composer and musicologist. He studied with Walter Piston at Harvard and with Darius Milhaud in Paris, and was much influenced by works for the musical stage by Marc Blitzstein and by Virgil Thomson, for whose book on American music he wrote the chapter on Thomson?s operas Four Saints in Three Acts and The Mother of Us All . Excerpts from Yellin?s opera Abaylar have been performed by the Metropolitan Opera Studio in New York, and his Variations on \"Bye Bye Blues\" for cello and piano was recently given at Merkin Hall. As a music historian, he has written on many aspects of American music, including the biography Chadwick, Yankee Composer and The Omnibus Idea , a history and analysis of one of the most ubiquitous but neglected harmonic progressions in music since the late 18th century.    Love, and How We Understand It (V50.0294; call # 74416) Instructor: Mitchell Stephens Thursday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    This course studies both what may be the most powerful and mysterious of human behaviors and mental states, romantic love, and how various disciplines and art forms have tried to grapple with it. It considers romantic love in a variety of forms and deals with works from a variety of cultures and historical periods. Read ings are selected from philosophy, psychology, anthropology, science, and journalism, as well as literature; students also examine films, songs, and paintings. They are asked to complete experiments of their own on this topic using some of these kinds of analysis or forms of expression. The course encourages students to think more deeply not only about love itself but about the strengths and weaknesses of different intellectual and artistic methods, and therefore the potential and the limitations of different academic disciplines.    MITCHELL STEPHENS is Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication . He is the author of, among other books, the rise of the image the fall of the word and A History of News . Articles by him on media issues, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and other subjects have appeared in the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, FEED , and other publications. He has recorded radio commentaries for Marketplace and On the Media, and serves as history consultant to the Newseum in Washington, D.C. In 2001 he completed a trip around the world, during which he reported for public radio and a number of websites on cultural homogenization. He is also director of the Russian-American Journalism Institute in RostovonDon.    Galileo and Hobbes (V50.0295; call # 74609) Instructor: William Klein Friday 9:3012:00 p.m.    In 1636, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes visited the aged and blind Galileo at his house in Florence, but there is no record of what was said. That leaves us free to speculate as we enter into the works of these two great innovators and critics of the Aristotelian worldview. Using selections from both philosophers (and in those days there was often no difference between philosophers and scientists, except in terms of quality?Hobbes was a very good philosopher but not such a good scientist), we will try to decide whether Galileo would have approved of Hobbes?s radical development of his physics and cosmology into a comprehensive philosophy of nature, human nature, and the state.    WILLIAM KLEIN is Visiting Professor of General Studies at NYU. He has worked as a carpenter, an editor, and a writer, among other things, since completing the Ph.D. in history at Johns Hopkins. He has taught at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. His books include The Lure of the Italian Treasure , a youngadult detective novel set in Florence. He has written on English and Italian political thought and served on the editorial review board of the Journal of the History of Philosophy .    The Crusades and Their Legacy (V50.0296; call # 74418) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Tuesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    In the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, the Crusades, which began at the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters, if not the most important chapter. The Crusades began as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. For two hundred years the Crusaders managed to hold on to their possessions, losing more of them with every passing decade, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the East was lost to western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades themselves, but focuses on the relations among the three great religions and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. We study the differences among the religions as well as their many similarities. Most of all, we address some of the problems that are crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a holy war; the issue of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the legacy of the crusading era. Readings include Muslim, Jewish, and Christian writings of the era, in translation, as well as secondary works.    JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the Crusader era extensively. She served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.    Historic Preservation, Entrepreneurial Innovation, and the Rejuvenation of American Cities (V50.0297; call # 74352) Instructors: Tony and Mark Goldman Tuesday, 4:55?7:25 p.m.    Over the years there has been no more effective tool of urban restoration and revitalization than historic preservation. In cities all over the world it has turned once empty and deteriorating buildings, fading blocks, and dying districts into vital and dynamic centers of urban, pedestrian activity. People everywhere have come to realize that cities can have no future unless and until their past is preserved, guarded, and maintained. This course will concentrate on historic preservation, economic development, and the role that individuals play in the rejuvenation of our cities. Taught by two brothers men whose life work integrates the practical and the academic, the handson experiences of the street warrior, the daytoday entrepreneur with the academic, this course is meant to provoke, inspire, enlighten, and empower. By combining readings and field trips to four different neighborhoods in the New York City area, this course will give students the insights and abilities to begin to understand, participate in, and envision the important work of preserving, restoring, and revitalizing the historic urban fabric of cities throughout the world.    Note: Interested students must submit a written statement (no longer than one page), to be reviewed by the instructors, explaining why they wish to take this seminar. The statement can be mailed to 100 Washington Square East, Room 908, New York, NY 10003; faxed to 212-995-4811; or emailed to ccp1@nyu..edu.

He is the author or coauthor of three books, including, most recently, City on the Lake: An American City and the Challenge of Change . He has done academic as well as entrepreneurial work in the field of historic preservation and community revitalization in Buffalo.    Behind Government: How Politics, Media, and Money Shape Policies (V50.0298; call # 74612) Instructor: Mark Green Thursday, 4:55?7:25 p.m.    To read Congressional Records and State of the Union addresses, one might think that all policy emanated from facts, logic, and merit. And when Karl Rove, President Bush?s top strategic adviser, said that the President doesn?t consider politics when determining policy, it was a pleasant fiction no one was expected to believe. This seminar looks at the hidden aspects that drive government by focusing on five recent public leaders?President Bush (43), President Clinton, Mayor Giuliani, Ralph Nader, and former Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. How did their varying styles, values, intellects, and personalities affect their offices or campaigns? Are there particular approaches that can best accomplish great goals? How do media and money affect the success of these powerful people? How much does the public actually know about those who govern them?    MARK GREEN was the Distinguished Visiting Lecturer at NYU Law School in 2002. The author/editor of 18 books (including Who Runs Congress? ), he was the Consumer Affairs Commissioner of New York City (1990?93), the elected Public Advocate of New York City (1994?2001), and the Democratic nominee for Mayor (2001). He appears weekly on NY1?s Wiseguys with Ed Koch and Al D?Amato.    Manufactured Worlds: Utopias, Fables, and Fantasies (V50.0299; call # 74610) Instructor: L. Jay Oliva Wednesday, 2:00?4:30 p.m.    Historical eras can surely be viewed through a variety of lenses; one such lens is provided by creative individuals throughout history who have utilized fables and fantasies about alternate worlds to reflect their critiques, and aspirations, and fears for their own. Manufactured worlds have won public attention to the real world?s ills and potential through the power of imagination. We will examine this intriguing exercise of the human imagination, beginning with Thomas More?s Utopia and ending with Tolkien?s trilogy The Lord of the Rings .    L. JAY OLIVA is Michel Fribourg Professor of European Studies and President Emeritus of NYU. He is author and editor of works on Russian Imperial history, including Russia in the Era of Peter the Great , and has regularly taught a course in Russian history for juniors and seniors. His recent theater credits include Brigadoon, My Fair Lady, Guys and Dolls, Fiorello! , and Carousel ; and he is lead singer in an Irish group, Doc and the Hods.    Afghanistan and the World (V50.0300; call # 74611) Instructor: Robert D. McChesney Friday, 9:30 a.m.?12:00 noon    Since September 11, Afghanistan has emerged as a country whose interests and future are linked in a major way with those of the United States. The United States is not the first country and probably not the last to find itself enmeshed in the politics and society of this small nation in central Asia. The seminar begins with the subject of Afghanistan?s geophysical environment and the economic consequences that follow from that. Next it reviews the country?s social and cultural features, with an emphasis on tribalism, religion, and the literary and artistic heritage. The geopolitics of Afghanistan are then considered in light of the preceding with emphasis on the country?s relations with the nations that immediately surround it today?Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China. Finally, the subject of Afghanistan in a global framework is discussed: Afghanistan?s jihad against the Soviet Union, the civil war and the Taliban, and Afghanistan?s relations with alQa?ida, the United States, and the United Nations.    ROBERT D. MCCHESNEY is Professor of Middle Eastern Studies , with a special interest in the early modern history of Iran and Central Asia. He is the author of Waqf in Central Asia (1991), Central Asia: Foundations of Change (1996), and Kabul under Siege (1999).    Great Doctors: The History of Scientific Medicine Revealed through Biography (V50.0301; call # 74702) Instructor: Sherwin B. Nuland Friday, 3:306:00 p.m.    If we accept Thomas Carlyle?s proposition that \"history is the essence of innumerable biographies\" (1830), then we should be able to learn about the past by studying the lives of the men and women who made the greatest contributions to it. The aim of this course is to trace the development of medicine from the time of classical antiquity until the dawning of the modern biomedical era just after the middle of the 20th century. Beginning with Hippocrates and concluding with Helen Taussig and the introduction of cardiac surgery, readings and discussions center on 13 distinctive individuals as they functioned in the cultural environment of their times, the state of science and medical literature, the surrounding political circumstances, and the historical ambiance in which their discoveries were made. Emphasis is on the rise of medical education and literature; the relationship of science to contemporary theory about nature; the shifting influence of individual centers of thought and the countries in which new ideas flourished; the gradual loosening of religious influence; the triumph of inductive reasoning and the experimental method; and the ways in which a contributor?s personality, background, and training influenced his or her work.    SHERWIN B. NULAND, M.D. , is Clinical Professor of Surgery at Yale University and a Fellow of its Institution for Social and Policy Studies. He is a member of the executive committee of the university?s Whitney Humanities Center and of the Interdisciplinary Bioethics Forum.

His 1988 book, Doctors: The Biography of Medicine , has been published in eight languages, and he has written biographies of Leonardo da Vinci and Ign?c Semmelweis. Most of his essays and eight published books have been directed toward explaining medicine and medical history for the general reader.    Law and Globalization (V50.0302; call # 74599) Instructor: Richard Stewart Monday, 3:30?6:00 p.m.    This seminar examines the role of law and legal institutions in fostering global market integration and economic growth and in addressing the discontents of globalization. The globalization of the economy has brought many benefits, but also many problems and criticisms. These discontents include disparities in power and wealth between rich and poor, which many claim have been exacerbated by globalization; lack of participation and transparency in decisionmaking by the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, and other international organizations; marginalization of developingcountry interests; cultural homogenization and displacement of local political and economic selfdetermination; loosening of social safety nets and regulatory protection; and subordination of environmental, labor, and human rights concerns. These discontents, and the law?s response to them, are critically examined. Topics include the role of contract, trade, and financial law in promoting international markets; the role of international treaties and organizations in managing the global economy, its benefits, and its adverse impacts; international environmental, labor, and human rights laws; how law affects the distribution of the burdens and benefits of globalization in areas such as intellectual property and trade/environment controversies; the role of multinational corporations and the global corporate social responsibility movement; the concerns of indigenous peoples; and the role of nongovernment organizations and the \"democracy deficit\" in global governance.    RICHARD B. STEWART is University Professor and John Edward Sexton Professor of Law. He also directs the Center on Environmental and Land Use Law. His teaching and research focus on domestic and international environmental law, the role of economic incentives in environmental protection, law and globalization, and administrative law and regulation.

He previously served as Assistant Attorney General for Environment and Natural Resources of the U.S. Department of Justice and as a faculty member at Harvard Law School and Harvard?s Kennedy School of Government.    Europe in Africa and Africa in Europe: Interaction and Rupture in History (V50.0303; call # 74684) Instructor: David Levering Lewis Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.?1:30 p.m.    This seminar explores pivotal moments of confrontation and exchange in which the course of economic, cultural, and political development in the European and African experiences are reciprocally and significantly altered. The proposition?that what others have made us applies at the most profound levels equally to conqueror and conquered, exploiter and exploited, superordinates and subordinates alike?is to be tested in this seminar through an exploration of five turningpoint interactions: (1) Islam?s first European century (viz., the 8thcentury Muslim conquest of Iberia; (2) capitalism and slavery, 1400s to 1850; (3) African resistance in the scramble for Africa; (4) bohemian Paris and Renaissance Harlem; (5) literatures and politics of rupture (WellsBarnett, Du Bois, and Maran to Fanon, Baldwin, et al.; Ghana and the Congo). Five essays keyed to the five topics and based on seminar discussions, required readings, and independent research are to be presented serially.    DAVID LEVERING LEWIS is joining NYU in fall 2003 as University Professor and Professor of History, having been, most recently, the Martin Luther King Jr. University Professor at Rutgers. President in 2002?03 of the Society of American Historians, he currently holds a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship.

The Genomics Evolution and Revolution: Scientists, Discoveries, and Societal Impact (V50.0304; call # 74685) Instructor: Tamar Schlick Wednesday, 12:30?3:00 p.m.    With advances in science and technology, the biological sciences occupy center stage, linking not only basic to applied research, and applied research to commercial success and economic growth, but also the biological sciences to the chemical, physical, mathematical, and computer sciences. The many concerted initiatives in genomics, in particular, like sequencing various organisms, identifying genes in humans and analogues in other species, determining variations (polymorphisms) in human genes related to disease, and designing drugs for specific gene products, have immense ramifications on every aspect of our lives, from health to technology to law. Though progress appears to have been revolutionary in the past decade, such developments have evolved from foundations laid by many pioneers in the biochemical sciences and allied fields. This course, appropriate for scientists and nonscientists, explores through a series of books, plays, and other materials three aspects of these scientific developments: the science pioneers, from Watson and Crick to Feynman to Elion, their lives, struggles, and triumphs; the scientific discoveries, from reports of the DNA double helix to the polymerase chain reaction; and the societal impact of these discoveries, from human cloning to ageextension miracles. The readings and discussions are designed to expose students to the complex web of scientific discovery, including the personal dimensions that are not often appreciated, and the mixture of serendipitous and systematic progress.    TAMAR SCHLICK is Professor of Chemistry , Mathematics , and Computer Science . Her field of research is the application of computational approaches to the study of structure and function of biological macromolecules, especially regulatory DNA/protein complexes related to transcription initiation and DNA replication and repair.

Sloan Fellowship, NYU Distinguished Recent Alumni, NSF Presidential Young Investigator, Searle and Whitaker Scholarships.    Home of the Brave: Legal Aspects of American Use of Force since World War II (V50.0305; call # 74686) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Wednesday, 12:30?3:00 p.m.    The creation of the United Nations ushered in a new era in the international legal regulation of the use of force by states. Under the UN regime states may use force in wellcircumscribed circumstances, notably in selfdefense against an armed attack or pursuant to a decision of the Security Council of the UN, to bring about a termination of a breach of the peace or a threat to the peace of the international community. The United States both during and after the Cold War has not shied away from the use of its considerable force, often provoking national and international controversy. Some instances, such as the Cuban missile crisis or Vietnam, have had profound effects on the selfunderstanding of the polity. The \"War against Terrorism\" has ushered in yet a new challenge in this area. This seminar first examines the international legal framework and then surveys the principal instances of American use of force from Korea to Iraq. At issue are both the legality of past and present American practices and the adequacy of controlling international law and institutions.    J. H. H. WEILER is University Professor and European Union Jean Monnet Chair at NYU Law School. He serves as Chairman of the NYU Global Law School Program and is also Director of the Jean Monnet Center for International and Regional Economic Law &amp; Justice.

He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as a WTO Panel Member. He is a founding editor of the European Journal of International Law , of the European Law Journal , and of the World Trade Review . His recent publications include The European Court of Justice (2001, with G. de Burca), The EU, the WTO and the NAFTA (2000), The Constitution of Europe (1998), and a novella, Der Fall Steinmann (2000).    Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos? (V50.0306; call # 74717) Instructor: Jorge G. Castaeda Friday, 9:30a.m.-12:00p.m.    This seminar focuses on several aspects of Latin America?s problems in the past and their possible solutions today. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and vigor of civil society today. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present.    JORGE G. CASTAEDA is returning to NYU in fall 2003 as Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies . Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth. A principal strategist in the election campaign of President Vicente Fox in 2000, he served as Mexico?s Foreign Minister from late 2000 until early 2003.

He has also written articles for many newspapers and magazines in Mexico, the United States, and other countries.    How We See (V50.0307; call # 74724) Instructor: Peter Lennie Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The ease with which we comprehend the visual world, and recognize objects and events, makes it easy to take our perceptual capabilities for granted. Only when we try to build machines that can see, or when we encounter people who have lost some specific visual capability?for example, persons who can no longer recognize faces, or for whom the world no longer appears in color?do we realize how extraordinary and intricate is the machinery of sight. This course looks at what we know about how we see. We know quite a lot about it from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing, and provides important pointers to the workings of visual mechanisms; neurology provides further insight by showing us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; computer science helps us understand design principles that are important making machines that can see; neuroscience tells us about the working details at the level of cells an neural systems. In this course we explore what these various disciplines together tell us about how we see.    PETER LENNIE is Professor of Neural Science , as well as Dean for Science in the Faculty of Arts and Science. Before joining NYU, in 1999, he was at the University of Rochester for 16 years. His scientific research has dealt with several fundamental questions about the operation of the human visual system; most recently, it has focused on the organization and specialization of the visual cortex, exploring the degree to which different regions of the cortex are specialized for different functions.    A Real Play of Identities (V50.0308; call # 74839) Instructor: Anna Deavere Smith Monday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    In this course, students will study and play roles from dramatic literature, film, television, real life, and history that they specify as unlike themselves and outside their realm of understanding. This is not a performance course per se, and no previous acting experience is required. Performance is used here as a way of knowing, rather than as a product for the purposes of entertaining. Students will be engaged in an ongoing discussion of what it takes to move from one identity to another, one cultural way of being to another, from one moment in personal history to another, from one moment in global history to another. The relationship of language and gesture to identity will be explored. Note: Interested students must submit a written statement (no longer than one page), to be reviewed by the instructor, explaining what interests them about the subject. The statement can be mailed to 100 Washington Square East, Room 908, New York, NY 10003; faxed to 212-995-4811; or emailed to ccp1@nyu.edu.

From the Birth of Tragedy to the Birth of Pleasure (V50.0309; call # 74875) Instructor: Carol Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The birth of tragedy symbolized by the story of Oedipus has long been linked with the birth of Western civilization. In this seminar, we will examine this linkage and also a tradition of resistance that extends from Greek tragedy through 19th-century fugitive slave narratives to the liberation movements of the late 20th century and postcolonial fiction. The Birth of Pleasure picks up this tradition of resistance and shows its psychological roots in studies of infancy, research with adolescent girls and young boys, and the findings of neuroscience. Knowing a tragic story, how do we keep from repeating it? Readings will be drawn from psychology and literature, and students will write short weekly reflection papers as well as a final paper.    CAROL GILLIGAN came to NYU as a University Professor in 2002. For the preceding 34 years she was on the faculty of Harvard University, where her award-winning research on gender and human development led to the creation of Harvard's first professorship in gender studies. Her 1982 book, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development, has been translated into 17 languages. Her most recent book, The Birth of Pleasure, was published last year.    Music and Power in China (V50.0310; call # 74874) Instructor: Mercedes M. Dujunco Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.    In China, music has long been viewed as having the ability to affect cosmological forces and influence people's thinking and behavior. It is therefore not surprising that Chinese rulers throughout the ages have tried to control the kind of music that is publicly performed and listened to by their constituents. They recognized early on that music signifies and that a key to power is regulating and fixing the meanings produced through music. This seminar examines the extent to and the various ways in which power is implicated in music and music-related practices in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Through discussions based on a combination of selected ethnomusicological readings, films/videos, and music recordings related to specific case studies dealing with state politics, identity, gender, and ethnic relations, students gain insights on how music continues to be a highly charged symbol in the Chinese-speaking regions of East Asia today.    MERCEDES M. DUJUNCO is Assistant Professor of Ethnomusicology in the Department of Music. She has written on Chinese and Vietnamese folk music, film music, and popular music and is currently working on a book about music and power in the context of Chaozhou Chinese voluntary associations in Hong Kong, mainland China, and Thailand.

One way the College has done so is through its Seminar program, which gives students the opportunity to participate in small, intellectually stimulating classes on important topics taught by distinguished professors drawn not only from the College's faculty but also from NYU's professional schools and from among New York's professional, cultural, and governmental leaders.    In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic principles behind the very successful Freshman Honors Seminars, offered since 1992, to upper-level courses. These small classes are taught by faculty from across the University and from the wider New York community. In some instances students may count the classes toward their major or minor, if the departments consider this appropriate; other classes will count simply as electives.    Advanced Honors Seminars have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. In sum, these courses are meant to foster an environment in which learning is an exciting experience for students and faculty alike.    Sophomores and juniors have priority in registering for most of the Advanced Honors Seminars. If seats remain after the end of early registration, seniors may also enroll.    Course Descriptions    Home of the Brave: Legal Aspects of American Use of Force since World War II (V28.0103; call # 72742) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Friday, 8:00 - 10:30 a.m.    The creation of the United Nations ushered in a new era in the international legal regulation of the use of force by states. Under the UN regime, states may use force in well-circumscribed circumstances, notably in self-defense against an armed attack or pursuant to a decision of the UN Security Council, to bring about a termination of a breach of the peace or a threat to the peace of the international community. The United States, both during and after the Cold War, has not shied away from the use of its considerable force, often provoking national and international controversy. Some instances, such as the Cuban missile crisis or the Vietnam War, have had profound effects on the self-understanding of the polity. The \"War on Terrorism\" has ushered in yet a new challenge in this area. This seminar first examines the international legal framework and then surveys the principal instances of American use of force, from Korea to Iraq. At issue are both the legality of past and present American practices and the adequacy of controlling international law and institutions. The seminar is taught at the Law School to law school standards \u2014 rigorous but academically and intellectually rewarding. Junior and senior prelaw students will have priority in registering for this seminar.       J. H. H. Weiler is University Professor and European Union Jean Monnet Chair at NYU Law School. He serves as Director of the Jean Monnet Center for International and Regional Economic Law and Justice. He was previously Professor of Law at the Michigan Law School and then the Manley Hudson Professor of Law and Jean Monnet Chair at the Harvard Law School. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as a World Trade Organization Panel Member. He is a founding editor of the European Journal of International Law , of the European Law Journal , and of the World Trade Review . His recent publications include The European Court of Justice (with G. de Burca), The EU, the WTO and the NAFTA , The Constitution of Europe , and a novella, Der Fall Steinmann .    Political Cinema and Representation of the Other (V28.0107; call # 75393) Instructor: Shimon Dotan Friday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00noon    Representation of the Other is a variation of the search for self-identity. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its political cinema exhibit a clear pattern in which the parties attribute to the Other qualities and traits that reflect their own distress and aspirations. But how does the concept of representation connect meaning to a sequence of successive images? Which of the following accounts (in a variation on Stuart Hall) will apply to a cinematic work? The reflective \u2014 does film reflect a meaning, which already exists in the real world? The intentional \u2014 does film express only what the filmmaker intends to express? The constructionist \u2014 is meaning constructed in and through the process of filmmaking? Each class consists of a screening followed by a discussion concentrating on representation in the context of the political conflict, variations in use of film language to achieve a subjective portrayal and modalities of representation and self-critique. Screenings include films such as The Battle of Algiers , by Bruno Pontecorvo; Divine Intervention , by Elia Suleiman; Fog of War , by Earl Morris; Final Cup , by Eran Riklis; and The Smile of the Lamb , by Shimon Dotan.    Shimon Dotan , a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with ten feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive ; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. Dotan has taught filmmaking at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal.    Cinema and Society in Europe since 1945 (V28.0112; call # 75329) Instructor: Tony Judt Tuesday, 3:30 - 6:00 p.m., and Thursday, 3:30 - 4:45 p.m.    This seminar addresses aspects of the history of European history since World War II through postwar European cinema. The seminar will pay attention to the films themselves, as art and as entertainment; but we shall also and above all be concerned with their subject matter, their contemporary setting, and their impact (at the time and since). Participants will meet twice weekly: once to see that week's film, once for discussion. In addition to watching the films, students will be required to read assigned works of history dealing with the period. Among the themes to be addressed \u2014 in the films, the readings, the class discussion, and, eventually, the final papers \u2014 are the following: war and civil war as represented and remembered in the postwar decades; the Cold War; decolonization; the European \"economic miracle\" and its attendant social impact; the \"sixties\"; different generations of migration, both into Europe and within and between countries; national identities and the attached stereotypes; the Yugoslav Wars; remembering (and forgetting) Communism; and the Holocaust in postwar European consciousness. A final paper will require students to choose one theme and then, with instructor's assistance, identify a body of related films to see and discuss.    Tony Judt is Erich Maria Remarque Professor of European Studies and Director of the Remarque Institute at NYU. A Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he has written widely on modern French and Central European history, as well as on contemporary affairs in Europe and the United States. He is a regular contributor to the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, the Times Literary Supplement, and the NewRepublic . He directed a long-term international collaborative research project called \"Rethinking World War II and Its Aftermath in Europe.\" His book Postwar: A History of Europe since 1945 was published in 2005.    The History of Disbelief (V28.0113; call # 75328) Instructor: Mitchell Stephens Wednesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    This seminar will take up an extended history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of religion). It will begin in Greece and then move on to a brief discussion of anthropological perspectives on belief, before returning to Greece, the Hebrews and Rome, to India and Baghdad, and then back to Europe during the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the Romantic period. Time will be spent in England and America in the 19th century, when disbelief was being tied to radical politics, before moving on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence of God will be considered. However, the main purpose of this course will be to force students to confront and grapple with some of the most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief. Authors whose works will be read may include Cicero, Hume, Holbach, Paine, Shelley, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Woolf, and Freud, among others.    Mitchell Stephens is Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication. He is the author of, among other books, the rise of the image the fall of the word and A History of News . Articles by him on media issues, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and other subjects have appeared in the New York Times , Washington Post , Los Angeles Times , FEED, and other publications. He has recorded radio commentaries for Marketplace and On the Media , and serves as history consultant to the Newseum in Washington, D.C. In 2001 he completed a trip around the world, during which he reported for public radio and a number of websites on cultural homogenization. He is also director of the Russian-American Journalism Institute in Rostov-on-Don.    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V28.0116; call # 72746) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Wednesday, 4:55 - 7:25 p.m.    The U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court's interpretation and application of the Constitution have adversely affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \"Imperial Judiciary.\" Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them, and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis, the Court's participation in the debate, and the effect that nine people appointed for life (the justices) have on how we live. Topics include abortion, euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights, gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; affirmative action; college speech codes, including \"hate\" speech and symbolic speech; and racial and ethnic profiling. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the political spectrum, and are expected to apply critical thinking to the topics.    Alan J. Pomerantz , Esq., is a practicing lawyer and partner of Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe, a major international law firm. A graduate of the NYU School of Law, he also studied in Chile and received an advanced legal degree from the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands). He has lectured and taught widely, including at the NYU School of Law, the University of Amsterdam, Columbia Graduate School, the University of Concepcion (Chile), the School of Visual Arts, and Hunter College High School. He has published numerous articles and contributed to several treatises on legal topics and is recognized in the International Who's Who-Lawyers . Mr. Pomerantz has participated in important and controversial matters affecting individual rights, including death penalty appeals, rights of public artistic expression, right of privacy for acts of consenting adults, and numerous free speech cases.       The Security Council and Peacekeeping Operations in the 21st Century (V28.0120; call # 72748) Instructor: Elisabeth Lindenmayer Friday, 11:00 a.m. - 1:30 p.m.    This course focuses on the role of the Security Council of the United Nations as a decision-making body in the maintenance of international peace and security. It examines the evolution of the Security Council since the end of the Cold War and reviews how its decisions have deeply affected international relations. It also reviews the evolution of peacekeeping operations through a selective examination of the literature and case studies, some of which will be based on the instructor's experience. The course explores some of the major successes and setbacks of the Security Council and the many lessons learned. It focuses on the varying responses of the international community to humanitarian crises. We will ask the question \"Whose responsibility is it to protect?\" Finally, the course seeks to demonstrate the need for reforms to address the unprecedented challenges of the 21st century, including the reform of the Security Council. Students who have taken V50.0363 may not register for this course.    Elisabeth Lindenmayer has had a long career with the United Nations, where she served as the Deputy Chef de Cabinet and as the Executive Assistant to the current Secretary General, Kofi Annan. In addition, she held substantive responsibilities relating to peacekeeping operations dealing with the crises in Iraq-Kuwait, Somalia, Rwanda, and the Great Lakes region. Born in West Africa, she has lived and worked in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, (then) French Indochina, Cote d'Ivoire, and Senegal. She has also taught at Columbia University, where she is currently Acting Director of the United Nations Studies Program. In 2006 she was awarded the Legion d'Honneur by the President of France.    Machiavelli's Wake (V28.0121; call # 72749) Instructor: William Klein Wednesday, 12:30 - 3:00 p.m.    Machiavelli's high literary talent, keen historical insight, and deep experience in politics congealed into a body of work \u2014 and one work in particular \u2014 that has become a difficult-to-dismiss touchstone of reflections on politics in the widest sense. His relentless study of the role of ruthlessness in public life has implications for fields as wide apart as Conflict Strategy and Ethics, while his hard-nosed study of republican institutions had great influence in the shaping of republican revolutions. After studying Machiavelli's main works, we will move on to an analysis of his first early modern disciples and detractors, and then on to modern works in, for example, ethics (Nagel), sociobiology (de Waal), and economic theory (Frank).    William Klein teaches social foundations in NYU's General Studies Program. In the College of Arts and Science he has also taught in both the Morse Academic Plan and the Freshman Honors Seminar Program. Before coming to NYU, he was at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he taught the history of Western social thought. He writes on a range of topics, from Renaissance political thought to constitutional history and (under a pen name) modern crime.    The Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan (V28.0124; call # 72750) Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller Tuesday, Thursday, 2:00 - 3:15 p.m.    The operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were composed during a period of intense change in the world of symphonic music and opera in the 19th century. This seminar examines nine of their major works and their historical, cultural, and musical contexts. It also examines the lives of the composer and the librettist and their respective milieux \u2014 Sullivan as one of the few English composers of the century to achieve international recognition, and Gilbert in terms of the various literary movements to which he belonged and which he parodied. In addition, it considers the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and its activities; the singers, scenic designers, choreographers, and costumers who functioned with the company; and the principal sources for the music, a majority of which are housed currently in New York City's J. Pierpont Morgan Library, along with numerous artifacts from the productions.    Rena Charnin Mueller , Clinical Associate Professor of Music, specializes in 19th-century music, in particular, the compositional aesthetic of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. Her most recent publications include an essay for the volume Liszt and His World , in conjunction with the 2006 Bard Festival, and an article on performances of Liszt and Wagner in New York between 1840 and 1890.

Stehlin Tuesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    The course explores the instability of the European state system in the pre-1914 era and the causes and responsibility for the war by examining the contributions of each of the major European states to the outbreak of war. It considers the Bismarckian system of European diplomacy and the balance of power as it existed before the war, the various diplomatic crises before 1914, the interrelation of internal events in the various countries to their foreign policy, and the various interpretations of the causes of the war. Topics include the Moroccan crises, the weaknesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Anglo-German naval and economic rivalries, the Balkan struggles for independence, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo, the personal responsibility of the individual statesmen, the ever-widening conflict, and the attempts to contain it.    Stewart A. Stehlin is Professor Emeritus of History. His areas of teaching have been the development of the modern European state system in the 19th and 20th centuries, the history of modern Germany, and European diplomatic history of the 19th and 20th centuries. His research has centered on European cultural history, diplomatic history, and German history, especially German-Vatican affairs. Among his publications are Bismarck and the Guelph Movement, 1866 - 1890 , a translation of Friedrich Ratzel's Sketches of Urban and Cultural Life in North America , and Weimar and the Vatican, German-Vatican Diplomatic Relations between the Wars, 1919 - 1933 . He is currently working on a book, Rome and the Reich: German-Vatican Relations during the Kaiserreich, 1870 - 1919 .    The Being of Character: Making Modern Subjects (V28.0141; call # 75327) Instructor: Elaine Freedgood Thursday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    This seminar examines how concepts of gender, sexuality, and race; mind and soul; true and false selves \u2014 all of these apparently \"natural\" categories and concepts \u2014 have been constructed, arranged, and rearranged in the past two hundred years. We will read, discuss, and write about film, cultural criticism, travel literature, fiction, psychoanalytic theory, and theories of gender performativity and racial passing in order to consider what it means to be, to seem to be, to try to be, to want to be, a given kind of self or character. The course will be based on rigorous analysis of textual material (including two films). Each student will prepare a formal oral presentation and lead 15 minutes of class discussion based on it. Final projects will emerge from early short papers that focus on research \u2014 in primary texts, in theoretical texts, in historical works, in unlikely locations and archives \u2014 and on how to use them effectively to write original, scholarly criticism.    Elaine Freedgood is an associate professor of English at NYU, where she teaches Victorian literature and critical theory. Before coming to NYU, she taught at the University of Pennsylvania. She is the author of two books: Victorian Writing about Risk: Imagining a Safe England in a Dangerous World (2000) and The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel (2006). She is interested in texts of all kinds: found, filmed, forgotten, forged, farfetched, and so on with other letters of the alphabet.    Abortion: Examining the Issues (V28.0142; call # 75332) Instructor: Evelyn Birge Vitz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00 - 3:15 p.m.    This multidisciplinary course takes as its purpose a careful and thought-provoking examination of many issues surrounding abortion today. In a seminar setting, we will read about and discuss legal, medical, historical, psychological, political, religious, ethical, and gender questions in a balanced manner, considering both \u2014 indeed, sometimes several \u2014 sides of the issues involved. We will also look at the representation of and attitudes toward abortion in contemporary literature and popular culture. This seminar will provide a forum for civil, informed, and open discussion of this difficult issue.    Evelyn (Timmie) Birge Vitz is Professor of French, and Affiliated Professor of Comparative Literature, Religious Studies, and Medieval and Renaissance Studies. She has published widely on both narrative and performance, as well as on many other aspects of medieval literature and culture. Recent books are Orality and Performance in Early French Romance (1999) and Performing Medieval Narrative , coedited with two NYU colleagues, Nancy Regalado and Marilyn Lawrence (2005). She has been researching and writing about abortion for several years, and has held workshops of a dramatic script about abortion, entitled \"Voices,\" in New York and Washington, D.C.    My Space: Writing Modern Selves, from the Diary to the Internet (V28.0143; call # 75326) Instructor: Thomas Augst Monday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    Why do people write diaries, and how should we read them? What kind of evidence do journals or blogs offer about the historical and social contexts from which they emerge? What can they tell us about the physical and virtual spaces in which people come to recognize themselves as individuals, and about cultural meanings and forms of individuality in general? This course explores the meaning and practice of diary-writing as it has evolved with technologies of manuscript, print, and digital computing. It has two major objectives. First, we will seek to situate contemporary internet sites of self-presentation such as Facebook, My Space, You Tube, and blogs in historical and literary perspective; we will consider how the diary has been shaped by religious traditions of self-examination, changing concepts of time, and the expansion of literacy, and define its relation to other literary genres such as the chronicle, autobiography, the novel, and the essay. Second, we will seek to develop a set of concepts to guide us in the interpretation and practice of self-representation across various media. Reading both celebrated and obscure examples of the diary, and conducting group research on contemporary digital culture, students will develop cross-cultural perspectives on literary practices of self-creation and the experiences of isolation, sincerity, narcissism, theatricality, privacy, and networking that inform them.    Thomas Augst is Associate Professor of English. He earned his Ph.D. from Harvard University and also taught there and at the University of Minnesota. He is the author of The Clerk's Tale: Young Men and Moral Life in 19th Century America , which explores how young businessmen used their diaries as tools for self-creation. He has also coedited two books on the history of libraries: Institutions of Reading: The Social Life of Librarians in the United States and Libraries as Agencies of Culture . He is currently writing a book about temperance, mass culture, and ethics in modern liberalism.    \"Varieties of Religious Experience\" Revisited (V28.0144; call # 75390) Instructor: James Gilligan Tuesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    This seminar will utilize but also update William James's pioneering approach to interpreting and understanding religion in psychological rather than theological terms. We will examine how the term \"religion\" is more confusing than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different stages of cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the phenomenon of \"political religions\" (nationalism, totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject modernity (the modern scientific mentality), in order to fill the vacuum that Sartre called \"the God-shaped hole in the soul of modern man\" that resulted when the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost their credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the political religions as resulting from psychological regression, and contrast them with the current moment in the evolution of religious consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of religious expression, understanding and experience that are consistent with the modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it. The seminar will conclude by examining whether this is the context in which the next major step in the evolution of both culture and personality will need to occur.    James Gilligan , Collegiate Professor, headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry. He has also served as Director of the Center for the Study of Violence and as a member of President Clinton's National Commission on Youth Violence.

He has been a consultant to the Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention at the World Health Organization, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and numerous other organizations.    Women's Writing in Renaissance Italy (V50.0145; call # 75330) Instructor: Virginia Cox Tuesday, 3:30 - 6:00 p.m.    The 15th, 16th, and early 17th centuries in Italy saw an extraordinary flowering of women's writing, whose extent has only very recently begun to be fully recognized by critics. Some 200 published women writers have been recorded for the 16th century alone, active in genres as diverse as pastoral drama, chivalric romance, and philosophical dialogue, as well as letters, love poetry, and religious verse. This seminar studies the tradition of women's writing in Italy in this period within its social and cultural context. It embraces both celebrated figures such as Vittoria Colonna, Gaspara Stampa, and Veronica Franco, and lesser known or more recently rediscovered writers, some not yet translated into English or available in modern editions. Besides the chance to study a series of compelling and challenging literary texts, the course offers the opportunity to engage with broader historical issues, notably the questions of what contextual factors enabled the emergence of this strong and precocious tradition of women's writing, and what factors led to its eclipse in the 17th century. Attention is also given to women's activity in other creative fields in this same period, notably the visual arts and music. The seminar is open to students without a reading knowledge of Italian, as translations will be supplied for all texts studied.    Virginia Cox, Professor of Italian, came to NYU in 2003 after teaching at the University of Edinburgh, University College London, and the University of Cambridge. Her chief research interests are early modern Italian literary and intellectual history, history of rhetoric, and early modern women's writing. She is the author of The Renaissance Dialogue: Literary Dialogue in Its Social and Political Contexts, Castiglione to Galileo (1993) and of Women's Writing in Italy, 1400 - 1650 (forthcoming 2008), as well as coeditor, with John Ward, of The Rhetoric of Cicero in Its Medieval and Early Modern Commentary Tradition (2006). She has also edited and translated two early modern texts by Italian women: Moderata Fonte's dialogue The Worth of Women (1997) and Maddalena Campiglia's drama Flori (2004, coedited with Lisa Sampson).       Before Democracy: The Politics of Plurality in Ancient Iraq (V28.0146; call # 75549) Instructor: Daniel Fleming Tuesday, 12:30 - 3:00 p.m.    This seminar will explore the alternative political tradition of group decision-making in ancient Iraq and its neighborhood. Democracy was born in Athens, and it came to the modern world through Europe and its American offspring. The Middle East is considered instead the home of empire and autocracy. Saddam Hussein cast himself as the heir of Babylon's rulers. This view has roots in ancient Greece itself, where Athenian democracy was set against Persian imperial power. In fact, the ancient Middle East was home to various forms of collective governance, from elders to assemblies, sometimes on a large scale. The ancestors of Greek democracy shared common ground with these practices from regions just to the east. Based on evidence ranging from 4,000-year-old letters to Homer's epic poetry, we will examine the early politics of plurality in both Mesopotamia and early Greece. By reconsidering the past, we can also rethink the prospects for democracy in modern Iraq and beyond, where traditional political life is often understood only as a barrier to changes encouraged by the United States.    Daniel Fleming is Professor of Assyriology and Hebrew Bible in the Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies. His latest book, Democracy's Ancient Ancestors: Mari and Early Collective Governance (2004), addresses the issues raised in this seminar, and he has also worked recently with Kurt Raaflaub to evaluate the relationship between Greek and Mesopotamian traditions before the democracy of Athens. In general, he specializes in the society and religion of ancient Syria and Israel, as these regions stood at the intersection of contacts across the Middle East, before Greece and Rome.    The 14th Century \u2014 When Europe Was Transformed (V28.0147; call # 75331) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Wednesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    The century covered in this course saw disasters of many kinds, some all too familiar to us in the 20th century. It was a time of the Black Death and the decimation of the population on an enormous scale; a time of recession that changed the pattern of prosperity that had existed in the preceding two centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman Church were faced with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious authority; a time of wars and of rebellions. Yet, in the same era, there was a march forward \u2014 toward new ideas, new political forms, vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense consequence for all of Europe . . . and for our own culture. Through the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian painters who transformed the nature and conception of literature and art and who informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century that many historians have understood as the most creative and the most terrible of all the centuries before the 20th.    Jill N. Claster is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages. She has served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU. She is currently working on a book about the Crusades.    The Making of Iconic Images (V28.0148; call # 75391) Instructor: Deborah Willis Wednesday, 6:20 - 8:50 p.m.    This interdisciplinary seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers, artists, historians, and critical thinkers in addressing the notion of iconic images. Iconic images are pictures that become rooted in our personal memory, pictures that are stored away for future reference through our experiences with them. How do icons emerge from the billions of images that surround us? What makes an image iconic? How are icons viewed cross-culturally and over time? Why do some help end wars, and why are other, very similar images ignored? To what extent can an image-maker aim at creating an icon, or is there no way of approaching the goal? How is it done in advertising, where a Nike swoosh can be made into an icon? Why do we have such extraordinarily powerful responses toward the images and pictures we see in everyday life? Why do we behave as if pictures were alive, possessing the power to influence us, to demand things from us, to persuade us, seduce us, or even lead us astray? In examining the salient features of the iconic image, the class will take comparative approaches to the diverse types of imagery.    Deborah Willis is University Professor and Professor of Photography and Imaging in the Tisch School of the Arts. Her many awards include a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, an Alfonse Fletcher Jr. Fellowship, a MacArthur Fellowship, an Anonymous Was a Woman Foundation Award, and an International Center of Photography Infinity Award for Writing on Photography. As a former curator of exhibitions at the Smithsonian Institution's Center for African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and as the curator of photography and prints at the New York Public Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, she has organized exhibitions and lectured extensively on African American photography. She is the author of Picturing Us: African American Identity in Photography, Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers, 1840 to the Present, The Black Female Body: A Photographic History (with Carla Williams), Black: A Celebration of Culture, and, most recently, Family History Memory: Recording African American Life.    Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (V28.0149; call # 75550) Instructor: Jing Wang Thursday, 4:55 - 7:25 p.m.    The Dream of the Red Chamber is a classic work produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as \"the chaptered novel,\" it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. Originally titled The Story of the Stone , the novel tells the story of a sentient stone thrown into the everyday world in its human reincarnation. With reference to the Goddess Nuwa repairing the sky, the novel raises a series of questions concerning the relationship between heaven, earth, human beings, and things; the origin of what it is to be human; its spiritual nature; the relationship between emotion and talent; and the development, suppression, and waste of talent. At the center of all this is the true meaning of human emotion and affection ( qing ) , and their relationship to the moral order and social-cultural convention ( li ). What constitutes the \"story\" is thus a narrative account of the stone's worldly experiences, tragic fate, and reflections on a heartless world. Its intricate structure, coupled with its dazzling array of characters, makes this one of the most complex and colorful novels of all time. All readings in the seminar are in English.    Jing Wang is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990's (2002). In 2000, she was the featured columnist/translator on foreign literature for the literary magazine Shanghai Literature . Her teaching and research interests include women writers in China and the West, literary translation, modern Chinese social thought, and comparative studies of cities and urban culture. In addition to literary translations, she also publishes personal essays.    Soundscapes of Contemporary War (V28.0150; call # 75392) Instructor: Suzanne G. Cusick Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m. - 12:15 p.m.      What are the sounds of contemporary war? How have military planners, strategists, and commanders used sound (including music) to expedite battle? How have ordinary soldiers used sound (including music)? How have both kinds of military use interacted with civilian aural culture? This seminar will explore these questions with reference to major wars of the \"American century\" \u2014 World Wars I and II, the \"Cold War,\" the Vietnam conflict \u2014 so as to understand better the acoustical practices of U.S. forces in the current \"global war on terror\" (especially the widespread use of \"loud music\" in detention camps). The course work will include readings, films, listening, discussion, individual research projects, and contribution toward a class website.    Suzanne G. Cusick, Associate Professorof Music , joined the NYU faculty in 2003 after ten years at the University of Virginia, where she was awarded the Alumni Board of Trustees Teaching Prize (for junior faculty) in 1995. She has published widely on music in relation to gender, sexuality, and embodiment; on the musical culture of early 17th-century Italy; and, most recently, on the use of music as a medium of torture in the \"global war on terror.\" Her monograph on the work of the singer, teacher, and composer Francesca Caccini (1587 - c1646) at the Medici court will be published by the University of Chicago Press in 2008. In 2006 - 07, she was a Fellow at the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History at Harvard University, participating in the yearlong workshop \"Cultural Reverberations of Modern War\"; her research during that workshop forms the basis for this seminar.    Hispanic Cities: New York (V28.0151; call # 75471) Instructor: Lourdes Davila Monday, 11:00 a.m. - 1:30 p.m.    What exactly is a city? What makes a city \"Hispanic\"? How does it become visible? What frontiers exist within the city's borders? How does a cosmopolitan city integrate the \"Hispanic Other\" into its fabric? On what terms? How does the presence of the Hispanic population permanently change the face of the city? This course traces the Hispanic cultural presence in New York from the end of the 19th century to the present, including responses by artists and writers to the terrorist attack of 9/11. Divided into modules, the course explores representation of and exchanges with the city in authors from Jose Marti to Pedro Pietri to Ernesto Quinonez, dancers like Jose Limon, Lourdes Lopez or Paloma Herrera, music from Bomba to Hip-Hop, visual art from Diego Rivera to James de la Vega, and film, from West Side Story to Raising Victor Vargas . Students will participate in cultural activities around NYC, and will be able to talk to several artists currently working here. Criticism will include authors like Gaston Bachelard, de Certeau, and Walter Benjamin.    Lourdes Davila , a member of the faculty of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, has been actively involved in arts as a professional dancer in NYC since 1989. Her first book, The Image Arrives on a Verbal Shore , considers the use of visual language in the Argentinean author Julio Cortazar. She is currently working on a book on photography and literature in Latin America. Lourdes has worked as a translator for the Guggenheim Foundation and now has two book translation projects: Corner of the Dead (English to Spanish), a short novel by the award winner Lynn Lurie about the Shining Path in Peru, and Julio Cortazar's Silvalandia (Spanish to English). She has been a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.    Muhammad and the Quran (V28.0152; call # 75836) Instructor: Francis E. Peters Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The Quran is one of the primary texts of world history: the faith of millions of believers is rooted in it and in the conviction that the man who pronounced it in Arabia in the seventh century A.D. spoke with the voice of God. But the Quran-the Quran in the hands of Muslims and non-Muslims alike-is also a document, and its original recitation came forth from a mortal man. Both, then, are the subject of historical inquiry. Muslims made those inquiries from the beginning, but in the West it was not until the 19th century that Muhammad and the Quran became the object of serious historiographical investigation. The objective of this course is to introduce undergraduate students into both \"the Quest for the Historical Muhammad\" and the current state of research on the making of our Quran by inviting them to address the very same questions the current researchers are. The manner will be that of a seminar, in which every student, every week, will be asked to make an active (and generally written) contribution on one of the research issues.    Francis E. Peters is Professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies as well as History and Religious Studies. During his career at NYU he has taught courses ranging from Homer, Aristotle, and Plotinus through the Gospels, Muhammad, and Near Eastern urbanism to Islamic philosophy and theology. He taught a previous Advanced Honors Seminar titled \"Jesus and Muhammad.\" His numerous books include Muhammad and the Origins of Islam and The Voice, the Word, the Books: The Sacred Scriptures of the Jews, Christians, and Muslims , commissioned by the British Library. He is currently finishing a book on the Quran.    Collegiate Honors Seminar Abroad    NYU in London    European Integration and the European Union as a Political System (V28.9502) Instructor: Eiko R. Thielemann Tuesday, 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 noon    The European Union constitutes a uniquely ambitious project of international cooperation and governance beyond the state. This course explores the origins, development, institutions, major policies, policy-making, current problems, and matters of controversy of the European Community/Union. Students are also introduced to the major approaches applied to explain the complex system of EU policy-making. Among other things, we address questions such as why the Commission, Court, and Parliament have gained new powers, why market deregulation has proceeded faster than social and environmental protection, and why European elections do not work. Knowledge about the institutions and policy processes of the EU will help students to critically assess various questions that are facing Europe's citizens and leaders today: How should the single currency work? How can the EU's institutions be made more democratic? How far and how fast should the EU be enlarged? Should Europe develop into a federal (super) state?    Eiko R. Thielemann holds a Senior Lectureship in European Politics and Policy at the London School of Economics. He completed his Ph.D. at Cambridge University. His research interests are in the areas of multilevel policy-making in the European Union; comparative analysis of public policy and institutions; new institutional theories; migration; and state aid.    Departmental Honors Seminar    Open to Qualified Non-Majors    Unearthing the Lost History of Greek Priestesses: Curating an Exhibition (V43.0150, sec 002; call # 75475; V27.0150, sec 002; call # 75557) Instructor: Joan Breton Connelly Tuesday, 9:45 a.m. - 12:15 p.m. Prerequisite: V43.0001 or V43.0100 and instructor's permission    In March 2007, Joan Breton Connelly published the first comprehensive cultural history of Greek priestesses, brought to life through a pioneering examination of literary sources, inscriptions, sculpture, and vase painting. The book will soon be brought to life in a traveling exhibition of objects and images brought together from some of the world's greatest museums. This seminar gives undergraduate students the unique opportunity to participate in the early planning stages of a major art exhibition. Following weeks of lectures on a broad range of topics to be explored in the Greek Priestess Show, students will develop and present their own plans for displays within the exhibition: object lists, installation designs, didactic information, and creative educational materials that include interactive technologies, film and print media, and relevant scientific content. This course will expose students to new subject matter, challenge their creativity, and develop their practical skills in managing a project.    Joan Breton Connelly is Professor of Art History and Classics and Director of the NYU Yeronisos Island Excavations and Field School in Cyprus. Her scholarship focuses on Greek art and archaeology, mythology, and religion. She is the author of Portrait of a Priestess: Women and Ritual in Ancient Greece and Votive Sculpture of Hellenistic Cyprus . A MacArthur Fellow, she has pushed the boundaries of our understanding of the Parthenon with the publication of \"Parthenon and Parthenoi: A Mythological Interpretation of the Parthenon Frieze\" in the American Journal of Archaeology . From 2002 to 2004 she held the Lillian Vernon Chair for Teaching Excellence at NYU, having earlier won the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.

These small classes are taught by faculty from across the University and from the wider New York community. In some instances students may count the classes toward their major or minor, if the departments consider this appropriate; other classes will count simply as electives.    Collegiate Honors Seminars have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. In sum, these courses are meant to foster an environment in which learning is an exciting experience for students and faculty alike.    Sophomores and juniors have priority in registering for most of the Collegiate Honors Seminars. If seats remain after the end of early registration, seniors may also enroll.    Course Descriptions    Home of the Brave: Legal Aspects of American Use of Force since World War II (V28.0103; call # 75346) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Wednesday, 8:00-10:30 a.m.    The creation of the United Nations ushered in a new era in the international legal regulation of the use of force by states. Under the UN regime, states may use force in well-circumscribed circumstances, notably in self-defense against an armed attack or pursuant to a decision of the UN Security Council, to bring about a termination of a breach of the peace or a threat to the peace of the international community. The United States, both during and after the Cold War, has not shied away from the use of its considerable force, often provoking national and international controversy. Some instances, such as the Cuban missile crisis or the Vietnam War, have had profound effects on the self-understanding of the polity. The \"War on Terrorism\" has ushered in yet a new challenge in this area. This seminar first examines the international legal framework and then surveys the principal instances of American use of force, from Korea to Iraq. At issue are both the legality of past and present American practices and the adequacy of controlling international law and institutions. Junior and senior prelaw students will have priority in registering for this seminar.       J. H. H. Weiler is University Professor and European Union Jean Monnet Chair at NYU Law School. He serves as Chairman of the NYU Global Law School Program and is also Director of the Jean Monnet Center for International and Regional Economic Law and Justice. He was previously Professor of Law at the Michigan Law School and then the Manley Hudson Professor of Law and Jean Monnet Chair at the Harvard Law School. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as a World Trade Organization Panel Member. He is a founding editor of the European Journal of International Law , of the European Law Journal , and of the World Trade Review . His recent publications include The European Court of Justice (with G. de Burca), The EU, the WTO and the NAFTA , The Constitution of Europe , and a novella, Der Fall Steinmann .    Collective Urban Violence in America (V28.0105; call # 72296) Instructor: Daniel J. Walkowitz Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar examines the urban origins, character, and changing patterns of violence in American cities. It focuses on collective violence rather than on individual acts of violence, regardless of how many victims an individual may have claimed. One part of the course considers the extent to which American culture and political institutions encourage, sanctify, or militate against aggressive behavior and create a climate for or against violence. In that context, some of our concerns must be comparative, cross-cultural, and transnational. In addition, we address broad interdisciplinary conceptual questions that anthropologists, psychologists, and sociologists, in particular, ask about human nature, gender conditioning in Western cultures, and \"deviant\" subcultures. In creating a typology for the analysis of violence in American cities over time, we distinguish between forms of violence, the direction of changes sought, and the social and material characteristics of the antagonists -- is the conflict generated, for example, by a privileged elite seeking to protect authority it feels jeopardized by aspiring newcomers, or is it rooted in efforts by the dispossessed struggling to gain some notion of a fair share?    Daniel J. Walkowitz is Professor of History and Director of College Honors. A specialist in labor and working-class history, he has written numerous articles and co-edited or authored five books, including Working with Class: Social Workers and the Politics of Middle-Class Identity and Memory and the Impact of Political Transformation in Public Space . In addition, as co-founder and co-director of NYU's Graduate Program in Public History, he has pioneered efforts to bring America's past to broad general audiences through film and video. The subjects of his documentary projects have ranged from iron and cotton worker protests in Troy, New York, to a miners' strike in Donetsk, Ukraine.    20th-Century Europe in Literature and Memory (V28.0109; call # 75345) Instructor: Tony Judt Monday, 3:30-6:15 p.m.    This seminar addresses aspects of the history of Europe in the years 1914-1989 through the medium of literature: novels, essays, memoirs. The seminar will pay close attention to the books themselves. But we shall also be concerned with the world of their authors, with their subject matter, with their contemporary setting, and with their cultural impact (then and since). Among the themes to be addressed -- in the readings, the class discussion, and, eventually, the final papers -- are the following: the impact of the First World War, at the front and at home; the consequences of post-World War I imperial collapse and the lost culture of Central Europe; Italian society under Fascism; the Spanish Civil War; the show trials and the Stalinist terror; the Holocaust in literature and memory; life in post-Stalinist Eastern Europe; the origins of the Yugoslav catastrophe; literature, memory, and memoirs as historical sources for extreme experience. For their final paper, students will select a theme or topic from the period covered by this course and then, with the instructor's assistance, identify additional works of European fiction or memoir literature for discussion and analysis.    Tony Judt is Erich Maria Remarque Professor of European Studies and Director of the Remarque Institute at NYU. A Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he has written widely on modern French and Central European history, as well as on contemporary affairs in Europe and the United States. He is a regular contributor to the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, the Times Literary Supplement, and the New Republic . He directed a long-term international collaborative research project called \"Rethinking World War II and Its Aftermath in Europe.\" His book Postwar: A History of Europe since 1945 was published in 2005.    Geology and Antiquity in the Mediterranean (V28.0114; call # 75524) Instructor: Steven Soter Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Over timescales of centuries and millennia, geological forces have worked profound changes on the landscape of the Mediterranean. Gradual processes of silting, erosion, and local sea level change, as well as infrequent but catastrophic natural disasters -- earthquakes and tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and major floods -- have all left their marks. Many ancient sites are now deeply buried, while others lie exposed to the elements. Great ancient seaports now lie stranded miles inland from the nearest shore, while thepalace of Cleopatra is submerged. The oracle of Delphi, the legendary Atlantis, and the one-eyed giants of the Odyssey have origins in geological phenomena. This course explores the impact of geological forces on the natural and human environments of the ancient Mediterranean world. Special attention is given to the site of Helike -- a Greek city destroyed and submerged in the Early Bronze Age and again in Classical times -- which the instructor has been exploring.    Steven Soter is a Scientist-in-Residence at NYU's Center for Ancient Studies and a Research Associate in the Department of Astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History. He co-directs an interdisciplinary scientific team excavating the Early Bronze Age, Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman settlements at Helike, a coastal site on the Gulf of Corinth in Greece. He was co-author with Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan of the Cosmos television series and co-author of the two Hayden Planetarium space shows.    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V28.0116; call # 75332) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court's interpretation and application of the Constitution, and the Court's new, self-defined role, have adversely affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \"Imperial Judiciary.\" Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them, and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis, the Court's participation in the debate, and the effect that nine people appointed for life (the justices) have on how we live. Topics include abortion, euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights, gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; affirmative action; college speech codes, including \"hate\" speech, verbal sexual harassment, group liable and symbolic speech; prayer in school and students' right of privacy; and racial and ethnic profiling, government's right to detain accused terrorists, and the USA PATRIOT Act. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the political spectrum.    Alan J. Pomerantz, Esq. , is a practicing lawyer and partner of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, LLP, a major international law firm. A graduate of the NYU School of Law, he also studied in Chile and received an advanced legal degree from the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands). He has lectured and taught widely, including at the NYU School of Law, the University of Amsterdam, Columbia Graduate School, the University of Concepcion (Chile), the School of Visual Arts, and Hunter College High School. He has published numerous articles and contributed to several treatises on legal topics and is recognized in the International Who's Who -- Lawyers . Mr. Pomerantz and Weil, Gotshal have participated in important and controversial matters affecting individual rights, including death penalty appeals, rights of public artistic expression, political asylum applications, voting rights, right of privacy for acts of consenting adults, equal access laws for disabled persons, and numerous free speech cases.    The Port of New York (V28.0117; call # 72304) Instructor: Bryan Waterman Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This course offers an interdisciplinary approach to the study of New York City cultures through the prism of its waterfront and harbor, a source not only of the city's economic development but also of its multicultural and polyglot character. From a \"home base\" meeting location at NYU's Broome Street residence hall, the seminar seeks to make the city itself the classroom: at least half of the seminar is conducted out of doors or in cultural institutions downtown and elsewhere, including the South Street Seaport Museum, the Museum of Chinese in the Americas, Ellis Island Immigration Museum, the New-York Historical Society, and others. Incorporating discussions from the disciplines of architectural history, archaeology, literary studies, and history, the seminar foregrounds problems of discipline and method in the study of the city's cultures and therefore seeks participation from the range of disciplines and departments that make up CAS. Topics include the founding of New Amsterdam, slavery in British Manhattan and the early American Republic, immigration's perpetual reshaping of city cultures, the emergence of popular forms such as blackface minstrelsy, the \"destruction\" of lower Manhattan in the 20th century, the decline of the port and its marketplaces, the development of the World Trade Center, and the ongoing effects of the 9/11 attacks.    Bryan Waterman , Assistant Professor of English, received his Ph.D. from Boston University in American Studies; since 2001 he has been a member of NYU's English department, where he teaches courses in early American literature and \"Writing New York\" (with Professor Cyrus Patell). He is the author of articles on late 18th-century New York City's literary and intellectual cultures, as well as Republic of Intellect: The Friendly Club of New York City and the Enlightenment Origins of American Literature (forthcoming). He is a Faculty Fellow in Residence at Broome Street and is currently at work on a book about seduction narratives in the era of the American and French Revolutions.    The Security Council and Peacekeeping Operations in the 21st Century (V28.0120; call # 72308) Instructor: Elisabeth Lindenmayer Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    This course focuses on the role of the Security Council of the United Nations as a decision-making body in the maintenance of international peace and security. It examines the evolution of the Security Council since the end of the Cold War and reviews how its decisions have deeply affected international relations. It also reviews the evolution of peacekeeping operations through a selective examination of the literature and case studies, some of which will be based on the instructor's experience. The course explores some of the major successes and setbacks of the Security Council and the many lessons learned. It focuses on the varying responses of the international community to humanitarian crises. We will ask the question \"Whose responsibility is it to protect?\" Finally, the course seeks to demonstrate the need for reforms to address the unprecedented challenges of the 21st century, including the reform of the Security Council. Students who have taken V50.0363 may not register for this course.    Elisabeth Lindenmayer has had a long career with the United Nations, where she served as the Deputy Chef de Cabinet and as the Executive Assistant to the current Secretary General, Kofi Annan. In addition, she carried substantive responsibilities relating to peacekeeping operations dealing with the crises in Iraq-Kuwait,Somalia,Rwanda, and the Great Lakes region. She has also taught at Columbia University.    Machiavelli's Wake (V28.0121; call # 72309) Instructor: William Klein Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    How influential can a writer be? Do people hear what they aren't prepared by history to hear? Can readers in one set of circumstances do anything but distort or misunderstand or ironically overturn what was written in another set of circumstances? It is one thing to ask these sorts of questions about the influence of an original literary mind on others, but perhaps another when the writer experiments not only with literary forms but with social, moral, religious, political, or military ones as well. Machiavelli was a writer whose wake caused disturbances in all of these areas -- so much so that to study it, in all of its complexity and ambiguity, is to study the emergence of modernity itself. In our readings, we will look for areas in which the early modern world seemed to be ready for Machiavelli's recovery of the ancient Greek awareness of the agony of political life. We will also look for those areas in which the readiness may not have been anticipated by Machiavelli himself (such as in moral attitudes toward the growth of capitalism). We will look for areas where people professed not to be ready, and at those where apparent readiness competed with deep unease (as may have been the case with Shakespeare). These historical explorations would be of limited interest if they did not push us to ask what our own era (of multinational corporations and unmanned war machines and feminism and pornography...) can make of Machiavelli. Have we outgrown him, or are we still engaged? If the latter, would that be a good thing?    William Klein teaches the history of political discourse in NYU's General Studies Program. In the College of Arts and Science he has also taught in both the Morse Academic Plan and the Freshman Honors Seminar Program. He writes on a range of topics, from Renaissance political thought to constitutional history and to modern crime.    The Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan (V28.0124; call # 75344) Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller Tuesday, Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    The operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were composed during a period of intense change in the world of symphonic music and opera in the 19th century. This seminar examines nine of the major works and their historical, cultural, and musical contexts. It also examines the lives of the composer and the librettist and their respective milieux -- Sullivan as one of the few English composers of the century to achieve international recognition, and Gilbert in terms of the various literary movements to which he belonged and which he parodied. In addition, it considers the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and its activities; the singers, scenic designers, choreographers, and costumers who functioned with the company; and the principal sources for the music, a majority of which are housed currently in New York City's J. Pierpont Morgan Library, along with numerous artifacts from the productions.    Rena Charnin Mueller, Clinical Associate Professor of Music, specializes in 19th-century music, in particular, the compositional aesthetic of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. Her most recent publications include an essay for the volume Liszt and His World , in conjunction with the 2006 Bard Festival, and an article on performances of Liszt and Wagner in New York between 1840 and 1890. Her work on the Liszt Lieder appears in the Cambridge Companion to the Lied (2004). She has published new editions of Les Preludes (1997), the Trois Etudes de Concert (1996), and the two Ballades (1996).

In 2003, she was a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.    Introduction to Cognitive Science (V28.0125; call # 75343) Instructor: Bob Rehder Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Cognitive science is the study of cognition or intelligent behavior -- of its nature, characteristics, and processes. It is a multidisciplinary approach to the study of cognition and intelligent systems that incorporates elements of psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, and computer science. It claims to provide answers to controversies such as the nature of mind, the role of the brain in cognitive processes, the possibility of artificial intelligence, and the relation of the mind/brain to culture and the outside world. Because cognitive science is intimately tied to issues in philosophy of mind and science, the course also discusses cognitive science's philosophical aspects and its historical development. The class addresses some of the traditional challenges to cognitive science (e.g., the problems of intentionality and consciousness), as well as a number of more recent challenges (e.g., connectionism, neuroscience, and situated action and culture). No prior knowledge of cognitive science is required.    Bob Rehder received a B.S. in computer science and B.A. in physics from Washington University at St. Louis, an M.S. in artificial intelligence from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He has been a member of NYU's Psychology Department since 2001. His work has been published in a number of scholarly journals, including the Journal of Experimental Psychology and the Journal of Educational Psychology.    Beauty Matters (V28.0127; call # 75342) Instructor: Deborah Willis Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    This seminar explores the problematics of beauty -- a subject that is contested in art, in the media, and in everyday culture. It looks at the ways in which our contemporary understanding of aesthetic pleasure is informed by and constructed from visual culture in museums, photography, advertising, film, and music. From the moment that photography was invented in 1839, people began to have their portraits made. These images offered a framework in which to imagine the history behind the photographic surface and to explore the notion of transformation. Class discussions will focus on how beauty has been imagined and realized. Using a series of case studies, we will consider the political image, race, class, and gender. The aim is to enable students to think critically about the notion of aesthetic pleasure and to consider the consequences of their views. The emphasis will be on reading, interpreting, and evaluating racialized, sexualized, and objectified images of men and women. We will look at the works of a broad range of photographic artists -- in fashion, narrative films, exhibitions, family images, and zine culture -- to examine viewers' responses. Open to TSOA students (priority to Photography students) and CAS students. TSOA students should contact Irene Cho in the Photography department to register.    Deborah Willis is University Professor and Professor of Photography and Imaging in the Tisch School of the Arts. Her many awards include a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, an Alfonse Fletcher, Jr. Fellowship, a Mac Arthur Fellowship, an Anonymous Was a Woman Foundation Award, and an International Center of Photography Infinity Award for Writing on Photography. As a former curator of exhibitions at the Smithsonian Institution's Center for African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and as the curator of photography and prints at the New York Public Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, she has organized exhibitions and lectured extensively on African American photography. She is the author of Picturing Us: African American Identity in Photography, Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers, 1840 to the Present, The Black Female Body: A Photographic History (with Carla Williams), Black: A Celebration of Culture, and, most recently, Family History Memory: Recording African American Life.    Origins of World War I (V28.0128; call # 75341) Instructor: Stewart A. Stehlin Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The course explores the instability of the European state system in the pre-1914 era and the causes and responsibility for the war by examining the contributions of each of the major European states to the outbreak of war. It considers the Bismarckian system of European diplomacy and the balance of power as it existed before the war, the various diplomatic crises before 1914, the interrelation of internal events in the various countries to their foreign policy, and the various interpretations of the causes of the war. Topics include the Moroccan crises, the weaknesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Anglo-German naval and economic rivalries, the Balkan struggles for independence, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo, the personal responsibility of the individual statesmen, the ever-widening conflict, and the attempts to contain it.    Stewart A. Stehlin is Professor Emeritus of History. His areas of teaching have been the development of the modern European state system in the 19th and 20th centuries, the history of modern Germany, and European diplomatic history of the 19th and 20th centuries. His research has centered on European cultural history, diplomatic history, and German history, especially German-Vatican affairs. Among his publications are Bismarck and the Guelph Movement, 1866-1890 , a translation of Friedrich Ratzel's Sketches of Urban and Cultural Life in North America , and Weimar and the Vatican , German-Vatican Diplomatic Relations between the Wars, 1919-1933 . He is currently working on a book, Rome and the Reich: German-Vatican Relations during the Kaiserreich, 1870-1919 .    Rethinking Who We Are: Interpersonal Approaches to the Person (V28.0129; call # 75340) Instructor: Michael Westerman Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    There are unresolved tensions in the field of psychology between individual-centered models of the person and interpersonal ones. The seminar is based on the belief that in order to make progress on these unresolved issues we need to recognize that they refer to a long-standing fundamental question philosophers began wondering about centuries before the discipline of psychology came into existence -- What place do our relationships with other people have in our lives? Moreover, we need to engage in an inquiry that involves a dynamic interplay between psychological considerations and philosophical ones. Participants in the seminar learn about work in several specific areas where these tensions appear, including models of child development, approaches to psychopathology, and basic questions about psychotherapy. We also consider more \"interpersonal\" versus more individual-centered ways in which psychologists think about interpersonal interaction itself. The final topic concerns the philosophy of the social sciences. We look at recent contributions by psychologists and philosophers suggesting that we replace traditional concepts of the process of psychological research with a social view of that process. Throughout the seminar, we refer to classic philosophical texts and contributions by historians of ideas to explore critically the ways in which contemporary efforts by psychologists reflect concepts of the person from our philosophical tradition. Students who have taken V50.0247 may not register for this seminar.    Michael A. Westerman is Associate Professor of Psychology. His area is clinical psychology. He has conducted research on several topics concerning interpersonal relationships, including studies of mother-child interaction, family systems, and the patient-therapist relationship in psychotherapy. His publications also include articles on issues in philosophical psychology. He is currently involved in a program of research based on an interpersonal reconceptualization of psychological defenses he has developed that is called the theory of interpersonal defense.    Representing Animals: The Discourse of Species in Contemporary Art and Media (V28.0130; call # 75339) Instructor: Una Chaudhuri Friday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 noon    Claude Levi-Strauss said that animals feature so prominently in myth and ritual \"not because they are 'good to eat' but because they are ' good to think .'\" The history of art and literature suggests that they are also good to paint, sculpt, photograph, film, and write about. A new interdisciplinary field of study has begun to move the animal out of its niche in science and insert it into fields that have, perhaps, constituted themselves in (unconscious) opposition to it: the \"humanities.\" Animal studies explores the meaning of cultural animal practices, ranging from literary genres like fables and fairy-tales to animal acts in circuses and fairs, to social practices like pet-keeping, cock-fighting, dog shows, equestrian displays, rodeos, bullfighting, hunting, fur-wearing, and meat-eating. These and other animal practices constitute an ever-changing and vastly complicated \"discourse of species,\" which in turn informs our accounts of the human, the \"Other\" (including the racial and ethnic Other), and the world. We will study a range of contemporary representations of animals -- in fiction, poetry, film, television, fashion, and popular culture -- with a view to understanding the current state of the discourse of species. How does the imagery of mass culture shape our attitudes to animals? How do artists, activists, and ordinary people disrupt those attitudes? How are we feeling about, imagining, living with, and \"thinking\" animals today?Readings will also include works of philosophy (Nietzsche, Derrida, Deleuze and Guattari, Singer) and recent animal studies books such as Steven Baker's The Postmodern Animal , Akira Lippit's The Electric Animal , Donna Haraway's A Companion Species Manifesto , and the Animal Studies Group's Killing Animals.    Una Chaudhuri is Professor of English and Drama. She is the author of No Man's Stage: A Semiotic Study of Jean Genet's Plays and Staging Place: The Geography of Modern Drama , editor of Rachel's Brain and Other Storms: The Performance Scripts of Rachel Rosenthal , and co-editor, with Elinor Fuchs, of the recently published critical anthology Land/Scape/Theater . She is currently working on a project that explores the intersections of theater and performance with the emerging field of animal studies.    Jews and Germans: Old Memories and New Beginnings in Postwar Germany (V28.0131; call # 75337) Instructor: Marion Kaplan Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    This course explores the interactions of Jews and Germans after World War II, noting their interlocking histories and memories even after the Holocaust. Students learn about the immediate postwar turmoil, the displaced persons, Allied occupation, and \"denazification.\" They analyze how Germans -- East and West -- did or did not come to terms with the Nazi past. They read Jewish perspectives on their lives in West and East Germany, why they remained, how they experienced their citizenship, how they interacted with Germans, and how re-unification (in 1990) affected them.Readings analyze conflicting German and Jewish historical memories, including the silence about the Holocaust of the early postwar years, the student rebellion of 1968, the viewing of the American TV series Holocaust , the Historians' Debate of the 1980s and 1990s, and the building of museums and monuments about Jewish history and the Holocaust. The seminar entails advanced work in research and conceptual skills. Thus, students not only learn about the history of postwar Germany but also discuss debates surrounding this history.    Marion Kaplan is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History. She is the author of The Jewish Feminist Movement in Germany : The Campaigns of the Judischer Frauenbund, l904-l938 (1979), The Making of the Jewish Middle Class: Women, Family, and Identity in Imperial Germany (1991), and Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany (1998). The last two won the National Jewish Book Award in their respective years. She has edited books on European women's history: When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany and The Marriage Bargain: Dowries in European History . Her most recent books are Jewish Daily Life in Germany , 1618-1945 and Judische Welten: Juden in Deutschland vom 18. Jahrhundert bis in die Gegenwart (a co-edited volume).    Readings in Modern Chinese Social Thought (V28.0132; call # 75335) Prerequisite: Completion of intermediate Chinese or equivalent Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, Wednesday 4:55-6:10 p.m.    This seminar introduces students with post-intermediate knowledge of Chinese to the major texts by leading writers and intellectuals of modern China. The goal is threefold: (1) to help students interested in modern China develop linguistic competence through intensive readings in cultural and intellectual discourses; (2) to prepare those who already have advanced language skills for a more in-depth encounter with the canon in modern Chinese culture; and (3) to familiarize students with the central arguments and stylistic mannerisms of the leading figures in modern Chinese culture and society through systematic interpretative-translational practice.Readings consist of foundational texts by canonic authors over the country's tumultuous modern period. Texts are selected either in full or in abridged form, with grammatical points and content-based annotations arranged in a way that allows close reading and interpretation. Under the broad rubric of social change and its intellectual reflections, specific topics include the Chinese Enlightenment, vernacular cultural revolution, women's rights and women's liberation, socialism and mass democracy, the attraction and problems of Westernization, the economic reform and new social liberty, the autonomy or \"subjectivity\" of Chinese culture, and the national debate on university reform. Authors include such modern classical writers as Liang Qichao, Hu Shi, Lu Xun, and Mao Zedong, as well as influential contemporary writers and intellectuals like Li Zehou, Gan Yang, Liu Xiaofeng, and Wang Anyi.    Jing Wang is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990's (2002). In 2000, she was the featured columnist/translator on foreign literature for the literary magazine Shanghai Literature . Her teaching and research interests include women writers in China and the West, literary translation, modern Chinese social thought, and comparative studies of cities and urban culture. In addition to literary translations, she also publishes personal essays.    Literature and Science: Pathways and Intersections (V28.0133; call # 75738) Instructors: Daniel Malamud and Martha Rust Tuesday, 5:00-7:30 p.m.    In 1959 C. P. Snow lectured on \"the two cultures,\" arguing that the life of the mind in Western culture was suffering from an increasing rift between two opposing factions: \"literary intellectuals at one pole -- at the other scientists . . . between the two a gulf of mutual incomprehension.\" This seminar analyzes the relationship between literature and science, asking if these are indeed two cultures or if, instead, they are two distinct yet related disciplines that interact synergistically -- as if they were on opposite sides of a semi-permeable membrane. The beauty of a semi-permeable membrane resides in the sheer elegance of a design that assures a regulated, bidirectional transfer of materials, which, in turn, supports the metabolism of living things. Something similar could be said of a metaphor, which transfers the meaning of a word from one conceptual realm to another, enabling \"fluid\" reasoning and bold \"leaps\" of imagination. This course explores another vital interface: the mutually informative matrix of connections between literature and science. It focuses on a series of topics that highlight the polarity between scientists and \"literary intellectuals\" : aesthetics, sex and gender, nature and nurture, life and death, health and disease, to name a few. In examining the diverse approaches that literature and science adopt in studying these topics and in disseminating their findings, we also seek to bring into view the productive interface the two disciplines share. In turn, we will discover some of the ways that Snow's \"two cultures\" might be influenced by and learn from the other.Readings are wide ranging: from Camus' The Plague to poetry by William Carlos Williams and Sharon Olds, to works by Sigmund Freud and Susan Sontag, to articles in scientific journals such as Nature and Science .    Daniel Malamud , Professor of Basic Sciences at the NYU College of Dentistry, is a biochemist working on pathogenesis and novel diagnostics for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. Prior to joining the NYU faculty in 2005, he taught courses in Literature and Science and the Literature of AIDS at the University of Pennsylvania.    Martha Rust , Assistant Professor of English, brings a background in health sciences to her career as a medievalist and teaches courses on both medieval English literature and medicine in literature in NYU's English department. Her first book, Imaginary Worlds in Medieval Books: Exploring the Manuscript Matrix , is forthcoming spring 2007, and she is at work on a second, entitled Item: Lists and the Poetics of Reckoning in Late-Medieval England .    Past and Present in Irish Archaeology (V28.0134; call # 75523) Instructor: Pam Crabtree Tuesday, Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.    Ireland has a rich archaeological heritage that includes hunter-gatherers of the Mesolithic Period, Megalithic tombs at Knowth and Newgrange, the Hill of Tara, early Christian monasteries such as Clonmacnoise, and the Viking settlements in Dublin itself. This course will consider how the Irish past has been constructed and what role that this construction of the Irish past has played in the modern world. We will review the archaeology of Ireland from its initial settlement in the Mesolithic through the British colonization of Northern Ireland in the early Modern Era. The course will also examine the impact of rapid economic development on Ireland's archaeological resources, including the current debate surrounding the site of Tara.    Pam Crabtree , Associate Professor of Anthropology, is a zooarchaeologist whose research interests center broadly on the uses of faunal remains to study past animal husbandry patterns, hunting practices, and diet. She is also interested in the use of archaeologically recovered animal remains to study trade, social status, ethnicity, and prehistoric ritual. Her primary area of interest is later prehistoric and early medieval Europe, but she has also worked on Natufian settlement and subsistence in the Southern Levant and 18th- and 19th-century sites in eastern North America. Crabtree is currently a member of an archaeological team that is surveying the Irish royal site of Dun Ailinne in Ireland. Her work has been published in a number of edited volumes and journals, including the Journal of Field Archaeology and World Archaeology . She and her co-author Bradley Adams recently completed a forthcoming book entitled Comparative Skeletal Morphology .    The Birth of the Mind: Genes, Evolution, and Human Nature (V28.0135; call # 75522) Instructor: Gary Marcus Tuesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.    This course explores the origins of the human mind from two perspectives: the origins of our species (a question about evolution) and the development of individuals, from conception to birth to educated adult. Questions that we will address include: What is the relation between nature and nurture? Has evolution played an important role in shaping the mind? Are we merely \"drifts in the currents\" of our genes? Are human beings optimal thinkers \"noble in reason,\" or is the mind better thought of as a jury-rigged Swiss-army knife of haphazard cognitive tools? Our approach will be interdisciplinary, drawing on fields ranging from genetics and developmental biology to psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience.Readings will include articles from the primary literature and four books written for the educated lay reader -- Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct (1994) and How the Mind Works (1997), and the instructor's own The Birth of the Mind (2004) and Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind (forthcoming).    Gary Marcus is Professor of Psychology and Director of the NYU Infant Language Learning Center. He is the author of two books about the origins and nature of the mind and editor of a third. His research on developmental cognitive neuroscience has been published in over 40 articles in leading journals such as Science , Nature , Cognition , Cognitive Psychology , and the Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development. In 1996 he won the Robert L. Fantz award for new investigators in cognitive development, and in 2002-03 he was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in Social and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford.    Pharmaceutical Drugs, Ethics, and Culture (V28.0136; call # 75521) Instructors: David A. Scicchitano and Andrea McKenzie Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar is designed to introduce students to contemporary issues in the realm of pharmaceuticals, focusing on drug design, safety, and distribution. Early in the seminar, students are introduced to the basic concepts of drug research and testing, with an emphasis on the Food and Drug Administration rules for bringing a drug to the clinic and eventually to the marketplace. This leads to the complex issues related to drug distribution inside and outside the United States, the societal implications associated with new therapeutic regimens, and the economic factors and laws that come into play. The seminar also develops students' writing, critical thinking, and presentation skills, with emphasis placed on researching, evaluating, and presenting evidence. Students who have taken V23.0005 may not register for this seminar.    David A. Scicchitano is Professor of Biology and also the CAS Director of Undergraduate Science Initiatives. His research interests include the way environmental agents, particularly chemicals, interact with and damage DNA, interfering with fundamental cellular process, and triggering pathology. His work is funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health.    Andrea McKenzie is the Director of Writing in the Disciplines with the Expository Writing Program. She collaborates with professors from a wide range of disciplines to incorporate writing and public speaking as active learning strategies in subject-specific courses. She has performed curriculum design work and taught graduate and undergraduate courses in writing and public speaking at NYU, MIT, and the University of Waterloo (Canada).    American Mythology and Its Biblical Sources (V28.0137; call # 75520) Instructor: Christopher Collins Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Especially in times of crisis, Americans tend to rally around leaders who reassure them that God has blessed theirs above all other nations -- given her a mission to feed, clothe, and enlighten the less fortunate, to liberate the world from tyranny and crime, and eventually to inaugurate an era of universal peace. This seminar will examine the biblical sources of this political mythology and the historical instances of its cynical use, for example, in representing North America as a Promised Land reserved for a new Chosen People, in identifying Indians and Africans as cursed races, and in regarding American foreign policy as divinely ordained and therefore exempt from international law. The Machiavellian exploitation of American religion is important to expose, but it is, of course, an old story. While this course will tell that story, in doing so it will keep as its major focus the credulity of the many, rather than the mendacity of the few. Unlike other contemporary critiques, this text-centered historical survey of American \"truthiness\" will raise that one, crucial, but seldom asked question: why is it that so many of us believe the lies we are told?    Christopher Collins is Professor of English and author of a number of books on the psychology and rhetoric of literature, including Reading the Written Image: Verbal Play, Interpretation, and the Roots of Iconophobia ; The Poetics of the Mind's Eye: Literature and the Psychology of Imagination ; and Authority Figures: Metaphors of Mastery from the Iliad to the Apocalypse . His latest book, Homeland Mythology: Biblical Narratives in American Culture, will be published in 2007.    Socrates and His Critics (V28.0138; call # 75739) Instructor: Vincent Renzi Tuesday, Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    Despite writing nothing himself, Socrates is, perhaps, the most influential philosopher in the Western tradition. With him, philosophy first moves from natural history to an explicit concern for human affairs. So great is this change that we continue to term those earlier thinkers \"pre-Socratic philosophers.\" So too, his name is given to a distinctive form of philosophical literature, the Socratic dialogue, and to an approach to philosophical inquiry and instruction, the Socratic method. In antiquity, his thought inspired Plato, Xenophon, the Stoics, the Skeptics, and the Cynics, beyond them to influence in Rome and Judea . . . and four centuries before Jesus, he already suffered martyrdom for his idiosyncratic political, philosophical, and religious views. In modernity, he both fascinates and repels Kierkegaard and Nietzsche; already in his own time, he endured criticisms of his way of life, notably from the comedian Aristophanes. Given the evidence, we can look only to the history of the reception of his thought to recover any sense of the \"historical Socrates.\" We must likewise ask whether he does not exert a greater influence as a result of his reputation than for his actual intellectual contributions. In short, had Socrates not existed, wouldn't the tradition essentially have had to create him, in its move from its origins to ethics and political philosophy? Even given that he did actually live, is what we have of him really just such a necessary fiction?    Vincent Renzi is Associate Director of the Morse Academic Plan for the Foundations of Contemporary Culture, where he regularly offers Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the 19th Century, in both regular and writing-intensive versions. He taught previously at Columbia University. In addition to his specialization in ancient Greek philosophy, he maintains interests in 19th- and 20th-century Continental philosophy, ancient studies, history of philosophy, and aesthetics.    Theater of War: Ancient Warfare in Ancient Drama (V28.0139; call # 75758) Instructor: Peter Meineck Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This seminar will examine ancient attitudes to war and its effects on society in ancient Greece as conveyed primarily in drama but also in art and literature. Why do we fight? Why is war still the most pervasive political force on the planet? What are the origins of attitudes to warfare in Western culture? The class will study ancient texts in translation and discuss vase painting, architecture, and sculpture to understand the cultural forces that created the Greek way of war and how military innovations and organization had a profound influence on the development of political and social institutions. We will read selections from Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Aris\u00adtophanes, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Plato, and Demosthenes. We will also examine pre-classical military structures, such as those in the ancient Near East, and look at the impact of Greek warfare on the Hellenistic period, on Rome, and on some of the military philosophies that prevail today.    Peter Meineck is Artistic Director of the Aquila Theatre Company, which has performed the Iliad at Lincoln Center and regularly produces classical plays in New York and on national tours. He is also Clinical Assistant Professor both in Classics and in Drama at NYU and Artist in Residence at NYU's Center for Ancient Studies. He has published several translations of Greek plays.    Writing in the Information Age (V28.0140; call # 75861) Instructor: Natalie Jeremijenko Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. ; lab, Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    Take a moment to ask yourself if there is any product you use, live with, or can see about which you could say how, by whom, or where it was made. Given that the manufacturing sector is the most poisonous of all sectors of all global human activities, is our collective ignorance defensible in an information society? The opportunity for change that new information technologies present could conceivably be an opportunity to promote innovation, sustainable manufacturing, transparent labor conditions, and environmental accountability. Likewise, it could promote a closed information context of trade secrets, nondisclosures, IP portfolios, labeling strategies, and closed doors. In this course we will lift the veil between production and consumption, each student taking on a case study to ask how and if open information context can promote innovation, and what structure of accountability will best facilitate this. Writing a visual essay for a wiki-based visual encyclopedia [howstuffismade.org], students will themselves learn standards of evidence and accountability involved in the production of information for the information commons, exploring their own responsibility and capacity for developing and proposing some of these changes.    Natalie Jeremijenko is a Global Distinguished Professor at NYU. An artist/experimenter and information engineer, she is one of the founders of the field of tangible media (also known as physical computing). Her work centers on structures of participation in the information age and the political and social possibilities (and limitations) of information technologies -- mostly through large-scale public experiments. In this vein, her work spans a range of media from statistical indices (such as the Despondency Index, which linked the Dow Jones to the suicide rate at San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge) to biological substrates (such as the installations of cloned trees in pairs in various urban micro-climates) to robotics (such as the development of feral robotic dog packs to investigate environmental hazards). Her graduate work at Stanford and the University of Queensland was in the fields of design engineering and information science. Previous faculty positions have included appointments in Yale University's Department of Mechanical Engineering, in the Department of Visual Art at the University of California at San Diego, and as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at Michigan State University.    Collegiate Honors Seminars Abroad    NYU in London    Builders of Britain (V28.9501; call # 75529) Instructor: Timothy Brittain-Catlin Monday,2:00-5:00 p.m.    This seminar presents the physical landscape of modern Britain, and particularly of London, through its buildings and through the working lives of the people who influenced it: the engineers, the builders, the visionaries. Students learn the basic tools of architectural and urban criticism by studying key structures, events, and personalities, and have the opportunity to demonstrate those tools through a series of different types of written and research assignments. By taking a number of central figures and presenting them and their biographies, students can not only build up historical knowledge of the major monuments of the city but also develop a useful contextual knowledge of the personalities and the period concerned. The course thus uses the architectural, urban, and engineering history of the capital as a way of introducing students to the cultural landscape of the country. Some of the characters featured in the course are architects; others are engineers, planners, or politicians. By presenting their life's work not only in the form of the built evidence but also in a biographical way, the course seeks to create a link between the many different sources of information and history, including literature and other artistic processes.    Timothy Brittain-Catlin is Intermediate General Studies Tutor at the Architectural Association in London, an architect, and a regular contributor to the Architectural Review. After working for ten years in urban design, he completed his doctorate at Cambridge University on AWN Pugin's houses. He is writing a book about English parsonages.    European Integration and the European Union as a Political System (V28.9502; call # 75709) Instructor: Eiko R. Thielemann Tuesday,9:00 a.m.-12:00noon    The European Union constitutes a uniquely ambitious project of international cooperation and governance beyond the state. This course explores the origins, development, institutions, major policies, policy-making, current problems, and matters of controversy of the European Community/Union. Students are also introduced to the major approaches applied to explain the complex system of EU policy-making. Among other things, we address questions such as why the Commission, Court, and Parliament have gained new powers, why market deregulation has proceeded faster than social and environmental protection, and why European elections do not work. Knowledge about the institutions and policy processes of the EU will help students to critically assess various questions that are facing Europe's citizens and leaders today: How should the single currency work? How can the EU's institutions be made more democratic? How far and how fast should the EU be enlarged? Should Europe develop into a federal (super) state?    Eiko R. Thielemann holds a Lectureship in European Politics and Policy at the London School of Economics. He completed the Ph.D. at Cambridge University. His research interests are in the areas of multilevel policy-making in the European Union; comparative analysis of public policy and institutions; new institutional theories; migrations; and state aid.
