Description       Advice manuals popular in the mid-nineteenth-century illustrate a long held anxiety about the urban landscape. The assumption was that the city was rife with \u201cconfidence men\u201d and \u201cpainted women\u201d who sought not only to swindle newcomers but also to recruit them into their nefarious fold. The city was thus imagined as a mercurial landscape of shifting forms and deceptive appearances unfit for wholesome living. This course explores the history and changing shape of ideas about dwelling in the American city. From the mid-nineteenth century guidebooks to the design section of\u00a0 New York Magazine \u00a0, from Walt Whitman\u2019s poetry to hashtags and twitter feeds\u2014we will examine how Americans have made themselves physically and imaginatively at home in the city. Writers we will consider include Edith Wharton, Joan Didion, Marshall Berman, Martin Heidegger and Walter Benjamin. We will look at the design work of Frederick Law Olmstead and Robert Moses, and photography of the urban landscape. Music by Radiohead, the Rolling Stones and from the Harlem Renaissance as well as the films of Charlie Kaufman will help us think about the ways different mediums capture, reflect and shape the urban experience and what kinds of obstacles\u2014psychological, social and class-based\u2014the city poses for the activity of dwelling. Students will contribute to a course blog, write three short papers and collaborate using social bookmarking to research their final papers.

First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays. Plan to take a First-Year Writing Seminar in the fall semester; you will take a First-Year Research Seminar next spring.

Description       Advice manuals popular in the mid-nineteenth-century illustrate a long held anxiety about the urban landscape. The assumption was that the city was rife with \u201cconfidence men\u201d and \u201cpainted women\u201d who sought not only to swindle newcomers but also to recruit them into their nefarious fold. The city was thus imagined as a mercurial landscape of shifting forms and deceptive appearances unfit for wholesome living. This course explores the history and changing shape of ideas about dwelling in the American city. From the mid-nineteenth century guidebooks to the design section of\u00a0 New York Magazine \u00a0, from Walt Whitman\u2019s poetry to hashtags and twitter feeds\u2014we will examine how Americans have made themselves physically and imaginatively at home in the city. Writers we will consider include Edith Wharton, Joan Didion, Marshall Berman, Martin Heidegger and Walter Benjamin. We will look at the design work of Frederick Law Olmstead and Robert Moses, and photography of the urban landscape. Music by Radiohead, the Rolling Stones and from the Harlem Renaissance as well as the films of Charlie Kaufman will help us think about the ways different mediums capture, reflect and shape the urban experience and what kinds of obstacles\u2014psychological, social and class-based\u2014the city poses for the activity of dwelling. Students will contribute to a course blog, write three short papers and collaborate using social bookmarking to research their final papers.

First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays. Plan to take a First-Year Writing Seminar in the fall semester; you will take a First-Year Research Seminar next spring.
