The series is coordinated by Professors Jonathan Brown, Robert Lubar, and Edward Sullivan.    The Colloquium is now over 15 years old and it continues to enhance the considerable strength of the IFA in the areas of Latin American and Spanish art. We have tried this year to have a strong across-the-board presence of scholars from a variety of fields in the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking Americas. In addition, with the first lecture on art and society in Victorian Jamaica by Professor Timothy Barringer of Yale, we are including other aspects of the hemisphere--something which is only appropriate given the current interest in the Caribbean. Several of our scholar-speakers are graduates of the IFA: Michele Greet and Adele Nelson did their PhD degrees in modern Latin American art and Ronda Kasl studied early modern Spain. Richard Kagan of Johns Hopkins has developed a strong sub-speciality in the history of reception of Spanish art in the US and Professor Robert Davidson from Toronto will examine questions of social and artistic interest related to the Cuban revolution. This group of stellar art and social historians will certainly add immensely to our deeper understanding of the broadly-described field of Hispanic Studies.   We gratefully acknowledge the continuing support of Roberta and Richard Huber for making the 2013-2014 Colloquium possible.    2015       Thursday, April 30, 2015, 6:00 PM     Irene Small ,\u00a0 Assistant Professor , Princeton University     Poor Image and Meta-Medium: H\u00e9rcules Florence and the Invention of Photography in Brazil     Please note this lecture has been cancelled.

We have tried this year to have a strong across-the-board presence of scholars from a variety of fields in the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking Americas. In addition, with the first lecture on art and society in Victorian Jamaica by Professor Timothy Barringer of Yale, we are including other aspects of the hemisphere--something which is only appropriate given the current interest in the Caribbean. Several of our scholar-speakers are graduates of the IFA: Michele Greet and Adele Nelson did their PhD degrees in modern Latin American art and Ronda Kasl studied early modern Spain. Richard Kagan of Johns Hopkins has developed a strong sub-speciality in the history of reception of Spanish art in the US and Professor Robert Davidson from Toronto will examine questions of social and artistic interest related to the Cuban revolution. This group of stellar art and social historians will certainly add immensely to our deeper understanding of the broadly-described field of Hispanic Studies.   We gratefully acknowledge the continuing support of Roberta and Richard Huber for making the 2013-2014 Colloquium possible.    2015       Thursday, April 30, 2015, 6:00 PM     Irene Small ,\u00a0 Assistant Professor , Princeton University     Poor Image and Meta-Medium: H\u00e9rcules Florence and the Invention of Photography in Brazil     Please note this lecture has been cancelled.
