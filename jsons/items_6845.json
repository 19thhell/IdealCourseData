They are major essays on the nature and possibilities of research universities in the twenty-first century and of NYU in particular, on subjects from global education to civil discourse to the impact of universities on cities. Many of the reflections include extensive input from faculty and from the broader NYU community. Your comments on the reflections are welcome and deeply appreciated.
