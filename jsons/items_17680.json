Japan, on the other hand, already   boasts the world's lowest infant mortality rate and longest life   expectancy, while achieving more success than America at containing   medical costs: in 1991, spending on health care accounted for a mere   6.6 percent of Japan's total gross domestic product versus 13.4 percent   of America's. How does Japan do it? What aspects of the Japanese model   might be applicable to the United States?     To explore these questions, on Friday,   April 30, 1993, the Japan Society organized a one-day conference entitled   Making Universal Health Care Affordable: How Japan Does It. Three   distinguished panels of Japanese and American health care specialists   discussed the management of Japan's universal health care coverage, ways   to balance quality care and cost containment, and how the United States   might profit from Japan's experience. Professor Victor Rodwin was one of   the conference participants (see Appendix 3) and agreed to draw on the   conference discussions as a starting point for this more extensive   monograph.     The Japan Society is grateful to KPMG Peat Marwick; New York Pharma   Forum; the International Leadership Center on Longevity and Society (U.S.)   of The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, an affiliate of The City   University of New York; the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare; and   the New York Academy of Medicine for their generous support of the   conference and this publication.     We offer special thanks to the conference   participants for their valuable presentations. We also thank John   Campbell and Michael Reich for their close reading and comments on this   manuscript; Toshihiko Takeda and Masaru Hiraiwa (JETRO-Ministry of Health   and Welfare) for providing details on the Japanese health system and for   reviewing key parts of the document; and Frank Schwartz for his diligent   editorial assistance.

William H. Gleysteen, Jr.   President, Japan Society                FOREWORD  by Marianne C. Fahs, Ph.D.   Associate Professor and Director  Division of Health Economics  International Leadership Center on Longevity and Society (U.S.)  Mount Sinai Medical Center        International study is gaining recognition as a useful method of   inquiry into questions of how best to allocate national resources to   improve health. Yet policy analysis of the Japanese system of health care   remains underdeveloped.. Indeed, serious debates regarding health care   reform strategies for the United States often exclude references to   Japanese health care delivery and financing. This exclusion is   unfortunate and obscures some outstanding successes of health policy in   Japan. For instance, in only 20 years and starting from a level similar   to the United States, Japan has achieved the lowest infant mortality rate   in the world. The United States remains 19th among developed nations.   Japan became the world's leader through a well-thought-out plan for   prevention, coupled with government investment. Now, Japanese policy   leaders are turning their attention to the elderly.     The United States and Japan face similar   problems. Both countries face a demographic revolution in the decades   ahead as the population ages. Medical expenditures, as a proportion of   GNP, are increasing at similar rates. Both governments face fiercely   competing demands for resource allocation among prevention, treatment and   basic science interest groups. Both medical care systems face a diverse   mix of patients with increasing rates of functional disability. Both   systems are financed by a large number of employer-based private insurance   plans in addition to public insurance for the poor and the elderly.     In this information era, we face a world   hungry to know what works in health care and what it costs. One of   medicine's great challenges is to inform policy-makers and the public of   long-term produc tive benefits and costs to our society of preventing and   postponing disability. Many initiatives in the United States will require   fundamental change. The most cost effective will be those targeted with   sensitivity and respect for cultural tradition to reach the myriad of   groups in our pluralistic society. Enlarging our understanding of   socio-cultural patterns of health behavior, disease and economic   productivity and costs calls for increasing international communication   and research partnerships.     Professor Rodwin and his associates provide an   excellent overview of the health care system in Japan. This comprehensive   and well-documented monograph will serve as an essential reference for   policy leaders and researchers alike who are interested in pursuing   comparative policy analysis. The Japan Society is to be commended for   organizing this timely conference. Professor Rodwin, a leading expert in   the comparative analysis of health systems, has taken the conference   presentations and discussions and used them as a springboard for his own   further investigation of political and economic aspects of Japan's health   care system. In this monograph, he presents a clear and well-organized   perspective on what the United States can learn from Japan. Let us hope   that the challenges Professor Rodwin raises will be met in the years   ahead as we pursue health care reform to achieve the goals of   effectiveness, efficiency and equity.           INTRODUCTION         Japan's health care system is characterized by   universal coverage, free choice of health care providers by patients, a   multi-payer, employment-based system of financing, and a predominant role   for private hospitals and fee-for-service practice. Virtually all   residents of Japan are covered without regard to any medical problems   they may have (so-called predisposing conditions) or to their actuarial   risk of succumbing to illness. Premiums are based on income and ability   to pay. Although there is strong government regulation of health care   financing and the operation of health insurance, control of the delivery   of care is left largely to medical professionals and there appears to be   no public concern about health care rationing.     Like the Australian, Canadian and many European health care systems,   Japan's national health insurance program is compulsory. But Japan   surpasses all 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic   Cooperation and Development (OECD) in life expectancy at birth and also   has the lowest infant mortality rate (Appendix 1, Table 1). 1   It achieves these successes at a cost of only 6.6 percent of gross   domestic product, $1,267 per capita - half that of the United States   (Table 1)  .     Japanese-style national health insurance raises a fascinating   question: how has Japan reduced financial barriers of access to medical   care and achieved a No. 1 ranking on health status at a cost that is   among the lowest of wealthy industrialized nations? 2 In   addressing this question, we begin with a comparative analysis of health   care resources and the use of medical care in Japan, the United States   and other OECD countries. Next, we review the financing and organization   of medical care in Japan, evaluate some strengths and weaknesses of the   health care system, and explore possible lessons for health care reform   in the United States.      In adopting this comparative approach to   health care reform in the United States, we have relied on an extensive   review of the English-language literature on Japan's health care system   and on information presented at the Japan Society's April 30 conference,   \"Making Universal Health Care Affordable: How Japan Does It.\" 3   We do not presume to have analyzed Japan's health care system in depth.   For example, we remain intrigued by Japan's exemplary health status and   by such societal values and traditions as egalitarianism and consensus-  building upon which the health system is built. We have aimed, in earnest,   to raise more questions than we are able to answer. We hope that these   questions may lend a sense of perspective to the on-going public debate   on health care reform in the United States.    NOTES:    1 For comparisons between Japan and the other OECD countries,   see the Tables in Appendix 1.    2 This is a reference to Vogel's (1979) classic book, Japan as   Number One: Lessons for America. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press).    3 We also refer the reader to a previous monograph on health   and medicine in Japan and America based on a conference organized by the   Japan Society in 1978 (Reich and Kao, 1978).                  HEALTH CARE RESOURCES AND  UTILIZATION        Japan has 15.8 inpatient hospital beds per   1,000 persons, the highest number among OECD countries and more than   three times the American ratio (Table 1) . By contrast, with 1.6 physicians   per 1,000 population, Japan has the fifth lowest physician-per-person   ratio, 43 percent less than the American rate of 2.3 per 1,000 (Table 1) .   Japan also has one-half to one-third the American number of intensive care   beds per capita (Table 1) . And Japan is tied with Austria for the lowest   hospital staffing ratio (that is, the number of employees per bed) among   OECD countries (Appendix 1, Table 3).     As for the use of these resources, at 8.3   percent, Japan admits a smaller proportion of its population to hospitals   every year than any other OECD country except Turkey, a rate barely over   one-half that of the United States (Table 1) . On the other hand, of all   OECD countries, at 50.5 days, Japan has the longest average length of   stay for inpatient hospital services, more than five times that of the   United States (Table 1) .     Although Japan has one of the lowest   physician-to-population ratios among OECD countries (Appendix 1, Table 3),   at 12.9, Japanese doctors have the highest number of physician contacts   per capita, more than twice the American rate . It must be noted, (Table 1)  however, that the average length of a physician visit in Japan is only 6.9   minutes, compared to over 20 minutes in the United States. 1     To the extent that OECD data are available on hospital admission   rates for selected procedures, with the exception of appendectomies,   Japan's rates are lower than those in the United States (Table 2). 2   Comparative survey data indicate that surgeons in Japan perform fewer   than one-fourth the number of operations per capita that their colleagues   in the United States do (Table 1) . 3 This pattern is supported by findings   on cesarean section rates, which are half as frequent in Japan as in the   United States. 4 The United States is known abroad for its unusually high   cesarean section rate.     It would be wrong to conclude from these data   that Japan rations high-tech medical care. On the contrary, among OECD   countries, Japan has the highest number of computerized axial tomography   (CT) scanners per capita, the highest number of extra-corporal shock wave   lithotriptors per capita, and the highest number of patients per million   treated for end-stage renal disease failure. 5   In addition, Japanese spend more than any other nation on drugs as a   percent of total health expenditures, more than twice the American   rate. 6     Japanese doctors' clear preference for non-invasive procedures is   demonstrated by the kinds of medical technologies imported and exported.   Equipment requiring invasive operations (e.g., pacemakers and artfficial   heart valves) is almost all imported, whereas diagnostic equipment   (e.g., CT scanners) is produced in Japan and exported in large   quantities. 7     In contrast to the United States, Japan's low   rate of hospital admissions (Table 1) reflects its tendency to emphasize   ambulatory over inpatient hospital care. 8 But once hospitalization   occurs, as we have seen, Japan holds the OECD record for long lengths of   stay and low hospital staffing ratios (Appendix 1, Tables 3 and 4). This   is encouraged by a reimbursement system that pays hospitals on a per   diem basis and a style of medical practice that emphasizes bed rest and   complete recovery while a patient is still in the hospital.     Beyond these more measurable differences in   resource availability and use of medical care in Japan and United States,   there are a host of political-institutional and cultural factors that   reinforce each health care system's distinctiveness. The United States is   a federal system whose 50 states have significant autonomy on matters of   health insurance and public health policies. Although the federal   government exercises a dominant role over the Medicare program and   regulatory aspects of health policy, Americans are multiethnic,   suspicious of excessive governmental authority and inclined to solve   social problems at the local level. Japan is a centralized, unitary   state with a highly homogeneous population and a tradition of powerful   state intervention in the economy, including its many health insurance   plans.

In Japan in  1991, there were 945 patients per million treated for end stage renal  disease failure in contrast to 784 in the United States (OECD Health  data file, 1993).    6 lglehart (1988) reports that in 1981  reimbursement for drugs by Japanese health insurance was equal to 38.7  percent of all health expenditures and that in 1987 this figure dropped  to 28 percent. More recent data from OECD Health Systems: Facts and  Trends (Paris: OECD, 1992) indicate that this figure has dropped to 18.4  percent, in contrast to the U.S. figure of 8.3 percent. However, these  data exclude pharmaceutical expenditures for inpatients, which are  substantial. Ikegami (1990) reports that \"about 30 percent of Japan's  personal health expenditures are for drugs,\" which we assume include  inpatient drugs, and supports the contention that the Japanese are among  the highest spenders on drugs.   In terms of pharmaceutical expenditures per  capita, in U.S. dollar pharmaceutical purchasing power parities,  Japanese spent $332 per capita, Americans $182. However, if these  expenditure data are adjusted by GDP purchasing power parities, the  difference narrows: $179 for Japan, $182 for the United States.    7 Ikegami (1989).    8 Ikegami (1992a).

HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE    The evolution of national health insurance    National health insurance emerged in Japan as   the result of a gradual process that can be traced back to 1905, when the   Kamegafuchi Textile Company provided limited benefits for its employees. 1   In the decades that followed, more and more corporations began offering   benefits through mutual aid societies. A health insurance law enacted in   1922 was inspired by the German system established by Chancellor Bismarck   in 1883. As in Germany, this first law extended health insurance coverage   to industrial workers and miners but excluded the self-employed and   employees in companies with fewer than five workers. 2 This law,   implemented in 1927, established the practice of mandating coverage by   enterprises and created an important government role in the provision of   health insurance to those individuals not covered by employers. In 1938,   health insurance was extended to farmers, fishermen, foresters and other   groups not covered by the 1922 law.     After World War II, the effort to rebuild Japan   gave new impetus to the achievement of universal coverage. In 1958, the   1938 law was revised to include the remaining 30 percent of the   population not previously covered. This revision broke the precedent of   extending health insurance to occupational groups by calling for   universal coverage on the basis of residence. Every government   jurisdiction, whether city, town or village, was required to provide   health insurance to every uncovered resident by 1961. Since 1961,   virtually all Japanese have been covered by either employers or the   government.     Health care financing     Health insurance expenditures in Japan are   financed by payroll taxes paid by employers and employees and by   income-based premiums paid by the self-employed. In contrast to the   United States, where the federal, state and local governments finance   roughly 42.9 percent of all health care expenditures and out-of-pocket   payments contribute another 22 percent, in Japan, only 31.7 percent of   national health care expenditures derive from national and local public   funds and 12.2 percent from out-of-pocket payments. The largest share of   health care financing in Japan is raised by means of compulsory premiums   levied on individual subscribers (34.6 percent) and employers (21.7   percent). 3 This employment-based share of health care financing in Japan   (56.4 percent) raised by means of voluntary employer, employee and   individual subscriber premiums in the United States (Figure 1) .     The structure of the national health insurance system    At first glance, understanding the system   seems to be an impossible task. Japan's national health insurance program   is made up of some 2,000 private insurers and more than 3,000 units of   government. The system can be simplified, however, by distinguishing   between two broad groups of beneficiaries (Appendix 2, Figure 1) :1)   employees and their dependents, including some elderly dependents   (65 percent of the population); and 2) the self-employed, unemployed,   elderly and their dependents (35 percent of the population). 4     Ignoring some administrative complexities and   small beneficiary groups, health insurance plans for employees may be   categorized into four groups:       Government-managed plans - These plans provide coverage for the almost 30 percent of the population comprised of employees (and their dependents) of small enterprises with more than five but fewer than 300 employees. These plans are managed by the government's Social Insurance Agency through a network of some 300 local offices. Premium contributions are set by law at a fixed rate (8.2 percent of monthly income before taxes) and evenly split between employees and employers.   Society-managed plans - Known as health insurance societies, more than 1,800 company plans provide coverage for 26 percent of the population. These health insurance societies are managed jointly by representatives of labor and management in enterprises with more than 300 employees. Society-managed plans can be also established by several enterprises employing 3,000 or more employees. Payroll taxes for such plans range from 5.8 to 9.5 percent of gross monthly income. 5 Employers are required to pay at least half of these contributions, and some pay as much as 80 percent.   Mutual aid association (MAA) insurers - Covering almost 10 percent of the population, these include 27 plans for government employees in the national public service, 54 plans for local government employees, and one plan for quasi-public employees like teachers and other school employees. The average payroll contribution of these plans in 8.5 percent of the employee's wage.   Plans for day laborers (for those who work less than two months during the year) and seaman - These independent plans cover only 0.1 and 0.4 percent of the population, respectively.     In addition to the employee groups noted above,   employees in enterprises with fewer than five workers, the self-employed   and retirees are covered either by municipal governments or by national   health insurance societies. Roughly 3,000 municipal governments cover   over 90 percent of such self-employed individuals as farmers,   shopkeepers, their dependents, and a large number of elderly people on   pensions. There are also 166 national health insurance societies that   directly manage plans for certain trade and occupational groups such as   physicians, lawyers, dentists, food retailers, carpenters, and barbers.   Contributions to these national health insurance societies are based on   reported income and assets as well as on the number of individuals per   household.     In contrast to health insurance for employees,   municipal governments and national health insurance societies receive no   direct contributions from employers. Moreover, the self-employed and   retirees earn less on average than employees in large enterprises, so the   government ends up paying slightly less than 50 percent of their health   insurance expenditures - four-twelfths by the national government and one-  twelfth each by prefectures and municipalities. 6 Once the elderly reach   the age of 70 (or 65 if bedridden), since they use the lion's share of   health care resources but do not pay premiums, under the Health Services   System for the Elderly the other half of their expenses are financed by   taxes on premium payments to all insurers of employees and the self-  employed.     Most of Japan's health insurance plans are   private organizations in terms of administrative law; in practice, they   have a quasi-public status insofar as they are largely bound to provide   uniform benefits and to cover all eligible beneficiaries. All employers   with at least five employees are mandated by law to insure them (along   with their dependents). Employers have little freedom to alter premium   levels, which range from 5.8 to 9.5 percent of the wage base. 7 The self-  employed are required to contribute premiums to health insurance plans   that are administered by local governments or trade associations. And all   of these premiums are taxed to finance the national fund which, along   with government subsidies, finances national health insurance for the   elderly.     The extent and regulation of health insurance benefits     Health insurance benefits are designed to   provide basic medical care to the maximum number of individuals. Although   there are exceptions, mandated benefits are similar across the four   groups of employee plans and for the self-employed and retirees. They   include ambulatory and hospital care, extended care, most dental care   and prescription drugs. Not covered are such items as abortion, cosmetic   surgery, most traditional medicine (including acupuncture), certain   hospital amenities, some high-tech procedures, and childbirth. 8   Expenses that fall outside the normal boundaries of medical care are   either not covered, dealt with on a case-by-case basis, or covered by the   welfare system.     Differences between plans include the level of   copayments, the amount of cash benefits, and the extent of cross-  subsidization and government subsidies (Appendix 2, Figures 2 and 3) .   With regard to copayments, all plans for employees have a 10 percent rate   for plan members and their dependents, a 20 percent rate for inpatient   care, and a 30 percent rate for outpatient care. For the self-employed   and their dependents, the copayment rate is 30 percent for both inpatient   and outpatient care. For the retired, the copayment rate is 20 percent,   and for their dependents, the rate is 20 percent for inpatient care and   30 percent for outpatient care. But under Japan's system of catastrophic   health insurance, there is a monthly ceiling for each beneficiary on all   copayments for all health insurance plans. 9 This has limited private   insurance to coverage of copayments. There is, however, a small market   for supplemental benefits that pay for amenities like private rooms.     Health insurance plans for employees provide   cash benefits for extended sickness and injury and for maternity leave   and delivery expenses. National health insurance plans for the self-  employed and retirees provide cash benefits for midwifery and general   expenses. Cash benefits can be substantial. Nearly $2,400 is provided to   cover child delivery expenses under most employee plans, for example. 10   If the mother is the primary beneficiary, the cash benefit may be 50   percent of her monthly salary. Maternity leave amounts to 100 days and is   compensated at 50 percent of a mother's salary in the case of working   women. In the event of prolonged sickness or disability, an individual   collects 60 percent of monthly remuneration for 18 months.     Society-managed plans provide more extensive   benefits in kind. In addition to providing the cash benefits noted above,   74 percent of these plans also have a \"patient cost-sharing restoration\"   program which picks up a portion of the mandatory 10 percent copayment. 11   Society-managed plans are also actively involved in health screening and   promotion. Enterprises own and operate more than 3,500 sanitoriums, 1,000   gymnasiums and 300 health centers, for example. 12     There is thus a widely held perception that   employees of large corporations covered under society-managed plans are   getting a \"better deal.\" There is no evidence that these beneficiaries   enjoy better health status, however. As John Campbell noted at the Japan   Society conference, among all plans, individuals enrolled in society-  managed plans receive the least value back for what they pay. For every   dollar paid in premium contributions, only 62 cents is received in health   insurance benefits. The beneficiaries of government-managed plans receive   84 cents in benefits for every dollar of premiums paid, the self-employed   receive $1.66, and retirees receive $4 to $5. 13     Government subsidies and cross-subsidization between plans   Age and income disparities among health insurance   plans result in an unequal distribution of health risks. Plans that   insure beneficiaries who are older or in higher risk occupational groups   will incur higher costs and therefore often generate deficits. Given the   Japanese commitment to equity, these inequalities are reduced through   government subsidies and cross-subsidization between plans.     With the exception of mutual aid associations   for government employees, all insurance plans receive some form of   government subsidy. Even society-managed plans, for example, receive   government funds (Y4.85 billion in 1992) to defray their administrative   costs. Likewise, government subsidies financed 50 percent of the benefit   payments to self-employed individuals covered by national health insurance    (Appendix 2, Figure 3) .     Cross-subsidization supports the poorer plans.   As noted above, the most generous example is the national pool created as   part of the Health and Medical Service Law for the Aged of 1983.   Government (national and local) provides 30 percent of this special fund,   and local governments another 20 percent. The remaining 70 percent comes   from other insurance plans based upon the total enrollment of retirees in   each fund. 14 As a percentage of their total expenditures, government-  managed plans, society-managed plans and national health insurance plans   contribute 15.4, 20.4 and 24.2 percent, respectively. 15      Provider reimbursement    Under Japanese national health insurance, all   insurance plans pay health care providers low fees by American standards    (Table 3) . The fees must conform to a uniform national fee schedule known   as the point-fee system. For any particular service, the same fee is paid   by all insurers to all providers. As in Canada or Germany, there is no   \"extra-billing\": neither physicians nor hospitals may bill their patients   more than the authorized fee; but illegal side-payments are common and   condoned. All covered medical procedures are ranked by complexity, and   neither geographic location, the institutional setting (e.g., type of   hospital or ambulatory care), the qualification of the provider, nor the   actual cost of the service are considered in this rating system. 16     Medical procedures are assigned a number of   points, each of which is worth 10 yen. 17 Only the basic charges for   hospital room and board services are covered; the costs for additional   hotel amenities are not covered. 18 The fee covers all supplies,   materials, capital depreciation and personnel costs. There is no   flexibility in this system of price controls for insurers or for   providers. Hospitals can bill patients extra only for room and board and   a restricted number of specialized services, for example. 19 As John   Campbell noted at the conference, \"cheap stuff is profitable and   expensive stuff is unprofitable. A doctor who sees a few extra patients   and prescribes drugs for them makes money; coronary bypass surgery at an   urban hospital loses money.\"     &nbspThe Ministry of Health and Welfare sets   the fee schedule. Its Central Social Medical Care Council has 20 members   who represent a cross section of health care interests: eight providers   (five physicians, two dentists, and one pharmacist), eight payers (four   insurers, including government representatives, two employers and two   labor representatives), and four public interest representatives (three   economists and one lawyer). 20 Every other year, this council renegotiates   the fee schedule with the medical profession, but these negotiations are   constrained by a rate cap set by the Ministry to limit the overall   increase in costs. This rate cap results in an effective, if implicit,   global budget for all health care expenditures. 21     NOTES:     1 Kemporen (1990). 2 Steslicke (1989).     3 From a table distributed at the Japan Society conference by Toshiro Murase, president of the Japanese Medical Association.    4 J.

These charges apply to physicians who  do not accept the Medicare rate as payment in full.                   THE ORGANIZATION OF MEDICAL CARE    Hospitals    Despite Japan's relatively high hospital   bed-to-population ratio (Appendix 1, Table 3), the number of hospital   beds is not decreasing Between 1970 and 1988, in fact, it increased by   25.8 percent. 1 This reflects at least five characteristics of Japan's   broader health system First, until the late 1980s, few barriers were   placed on entry into the hospital market in Japan's rapidly growing   postwar economy. Second the organization of medical care in Japan is   heavily centered around hospitals. Third, 81 percent of hospitals are   privately owned, and the) have had few restrictions on their capital   investments. Fourth because hospitals have competed fiercely with one   another, expansion has served as a key strategy to gain a competitive   edge. Finally, al least until the mid 1980s, the Ministry of Health and  Welfare has not played an active role in containing the total number of   hospital beds.     Close to 90 percent of hospital facilities   with 20 or more beds are classified as \"general hospitals.\" The remainder   are mental health facilities or tuberculosis and leprosy centers. General   hospitals are dominated by small, privately owned and operated   \"nonprofit\" facilities. The average number of beds in a Japanese hospital   is 163 -slightly fewer than the 190 in an average American hospital - and   half have fewer than 100 beds. 2 Although the last few years have   witnessed a proliferation of national hospital chains, the majority of   small hospitals continue to be privately owned and managed by physicians   As in public hospitals, physicians in private hospitals are salaried.     With 283 beds, the average public hospital is   larger than its private counterpart. Although 19 percent of hospitals are   public, they account for 33 percent of all beds. About 75 percent of   public hospitals are under the jurisdiction of municipal and prefectural   governments the remainder are national institutions. About 1 percent of   hospitals are owned and operated by quasi-public agencies and   organizations such as the Red Cross, social insurance agencies and   employment related groups.     Despite these distinctions, all hospitals in   Japan tend to be viewed as recuperative centers rather than as merely   therapeutic institutions, Even large teaching hospitals do not limit   themselves to providing acute-care services. Hospitals have traditionally   functioned, in part, as long-term care facilities. Of the nearly 400   hospitals that have more than 500 beds, only about 60 percent have adult   intensive care units, and only 30 percent of them have neonatal intensive   care units, the majority of which have only five to seven beds.     As a result of this orientation, patients in   Japanese hospitals have the longest average length of stay in the world. 3   Even accounting for the lengthy stays of psychiatric patients, the   average patient's stay in a Japanese hospital far exceeds that of most   other OECD countries both in the aggregate and by specific disease   categories (Appendix 1, Table 5). In addition to the nursing home   functions played by hospitals, other factors accounting for the lengthy   stays are probably the large number of beds, the low admission rates, the   per diem form of hospital reimbursement, and the emphasis on recuperation   over invasive medical and surgical interventions.     As is the case with intensive care units,   there are far fewer emergency rooms in Japan than in the United States.   But while Japan has roughly half the population of the United States, it   has only 7 percent of the murders, 2 percent of the reported rapes, and   0.3 percent of the armed robberies, so there would seem to be less of a   need for extensive trauma facilities. 4 In addition, unimpeded access to   health care through the clinic system has the effect of steering   non-urgent care away from emergency rooms. An integrated system of   primary, secondary and tertiary-level emergency facilities appears to   meet the need for emergency and trauma care. 5     As in the United States, university hospitals   in Japan are centers for research, teaching and the delivery of   tertiary-level \"cutting edge\" medical care. In contrast to America's   129 academic medical centers with an average size of 664 beds, Japan   has 131 university hospitals (half of them public) with an average size   of 735 beds. 6 Despite their larger average size, Japanese teaching   hospitals have far fewer inpatient admissions, less than 30 percent of   the American rate. And the 36.2 day average length of stay in these   hospitals far exceeds the 7.9 days in American teaching hospitals. 7     Although Japanese university hospitals   generally incur higher costs, they also have shorter lengths of stay and   higher staffing ratios than other Japanese hospitals. Increasingly, the   public perceives these facilities as preferred sites for receiving   medical care.     A recent innovation for the delivery of   high-tech medical care has been the establishment of officially   designated centers for such procedures as open-heart surgery. This   \"Highly Advanced Medical Technology System\" provides a mechanism by which   new medical devices can receive broader use and evaluation despite their   ineligibility for reimbursement under the normal benefits plan of Japan's   health insurance program. Most often, highly advanced medical procedures   are performed at teaching facilities. 8 For third-party reimbursement to   be awarded, these procedures must now be performed at these centers,   which are required to have appropriate equipment and personnel.     Clinics and Ambulatory Care    Japanese physicians have traditionally   operated on a small scale, working out of their homes to provide health   care services to their community. Although these clinics have typically   provided a low-level intensity of care, many have recently acquired a   wide range of sophisticated medical equipment including ultrasonic   testing and gastrointestinal fiberscopes. 9     Small, privately owned clinics provided most   outpatient services until the 1970s. In addition, roughly 25,000   physicians' offices, equipped with up to 19 beds and also referred to as   \"clinics,\" function as small hospitals. They add 276,000 beds to Japan's   already high number (15.8 per 1,000 persons), thus increasing the total   number of hospital beds by 17 percent. 10     Since the 1970s, clinic physicians have become   concerned about losing their share of primary-care services to hospitals.   Although the number of clinics has increased from about 50,000 in 1955 to   more than 80,800 in 1990, the number of clinics with beds decreased by   almost 20 percent during the 1970s and 1980s. 11 Likewise, although the   number of physicians has increased by 113 percent since 1960, the   proportion of physicians running clinics has dropped from 44.8 percent in   1960 to only 27.5 percent in 1990. 12 This decrease in the number of   clinics with beds and the proportion of physicians running clinics is due   largely to direct competition with larger hospitals in outpatient   services and high land prices that prohibit the establishment of new   clinic facilities. Larger hospitals are attracting both young doctors and   outpatients with their sophisticated technology and services. 13     Despite the competition between clinics and   hospitals, two structural aspects of Japan's health care system appear to   constrain the trend toward specialization and high-tech care and to   promote primary-care services. First, clinic physicians do not have   admitting privileges to hospitals. Second, once referred to the hospital,   many patients do not return to a clinic but continue to be treated by the   hospital's outpatient department. These barriers give clinic physicians   an incentive to put off hospitalization. 14     Beyond the barriers to referring patients to hospitals, two financial   incentives also appear to support primary-care services. First, clinic   physicians are remunerated under the fee schedule each time they write a   prescription for a dispensing pharmacist. Second, they make an average   profit of 26 percent of the reimbursement rate every time they   prescribe - and sell - a drug to their patients. 15 Because pharmaceutical   manufacturers and wholesalers routinely sell drugs to physicians at   prices well below the fee schedule's reimbursement rates, drug sales have   become an important source of profits for clinics. 16     The average net monthly income for clinic   physicians was $22,900 in 1990, while specialists based in private   hospitals earned only $6,300. 17 A 1985 study indicated that revenues and   net profits of clinic physicians vary with the quantity of drugs   prescribed and sold by physicians, the age of the physicians and the size   of the clinic. This finding supports the contention that clinic   physicians maximize their income by prescribing and selling more drugs. 18     Despite clinic physicians' practice of selling   the drugs they prescribe, which strikes most Americans as a blatant   financial conflict of interest, the doctor-patient relationship   presumably is based on trust. Patients are typically told little about   their diagnoses, and doctors explain away problems in \"soothing terms   without necessarily providing precise information about what exactly the   problem is.\" 19 Pills frequently go unlabeled, and patients are not always  told when they are part of an experiment. Such practices were recently   supported by a court decision that doctors need not share the full   details of a diagnosis with a cancer patient. 20     The clinic physician, however, does not provide the kind of primary   health care so often extolled by family physicians in the United States.   Most clinic physicians operate in solo practices without hospital   privileges, thus making it difficult to collaborate with specialists as   well as with peers. Standards of practice, professional competence and   patient care are neither monitored nor evaluated in any formal way.   In addition, as in the United States, Japanese physicians do not   typically subscribe to the idea of \"comprehensive primary health care and   often fail to respect the person as a whole person operating in a complex   social and economic environment.\" 21    Services for the elderly     Since the early 1970s, the elderly enjoyed a   privileged status in the Japanese welfare state. With the economic growth   of the 1960s came demands for the expansion of social benefits that could   not be ignored. In 1973, the government responded to social pressures by   creating an almost free medical care system for the elderly, the national   insurance plan administered by local governments. In 1982, in response to   rising health care costs, the Health and Medical Service Law for the Aged   established the national pooi to subsidize medical care. 22 The government   sought to increase equity in financing by taxing all health insurance   plans based on a formula related to each plan's number of beneficiaries   and past medical expenditures on the elderly. 23     Despite universal coverage under national   health insurance, the range of services designed to meet the needs of the   elderly is limited. In general wards, no distinction is made between   acute and long-term care facilities. 24 A significant fraction of hospital   beds are routinely occupied by elderly people requiring long-term care.   Seventy-five percent of the institutionalized elderly are in hospitals   and clinics, for example, and survey data indicate that 45 percent of   elderly inpatients are hospitalized for more than six months. 25 Due to   the shortage of rehabilitation services, roughly 4.6 percent of the   elderly population is bedridden. 26 In 1987, 34 percent of patients in   Japan's long-term care facilities were bedridden, a striking contrast to   America's 6.5 percent. 27     There are now a growing number of hospitals   specializing in treating and caring for the elderly. There are also three   other types of facilities that serve the elderly in Japan: a small number   of nursing homes (10 beds per 1,000 elderly persons in 1988, in contrast   to 46.2 in the United States in 1985), welfare institutions for those who   need constant care, and facilities providing rehabilitation services. 28   But the relatively limited number of home health aides leads to an   absence of reliable support services. 29 Compared to the United States,   Japan has a far more severe shortage of long-term care services. There   are long waiting lists for admission to nursing homes-applicants commonly   wait for more than a year. 30    In addition to the lack of appropriate institutions   and support services, at least three other factors contribute to Japan's   high rate of \"social admissions\" to hospitals. First, medical practice   generally tends to emphasize passive care and bed rest. Second, a lack of   space at home to accommodate elderly relatives pushes more of the frail   elderly into hospitals and clinics. Finally, women, the traditional care   givers for the elderly, are entering the work force in increasing   numbers. Thus, although some 62 percent of the elderly live with their   children or other relatives, in contrast to less than 33 percent in the   United States, Japan's institutionalization rate (6.2 percent) is   comparable to America's. 31 Where Japan diverges from the United States   and other OECD countries is in its rapidly graying population. In 2020,   26 percent of Japanese will be over 65, compared to 17.3 percent of   Americans. 32 Because there are already about 700,000 Japanese aged 65 and   over (4.6 percent of the elderly population) who are so severely disabled   that they are bedridden or require constant supervision, these   projections impelled government policy-makers to publish the \"Golden Plan\"   and make a commitment to solve this anticipated crisis.     The Golden Plan is a 10-year national   health care and welfare plan for the elderly agreed upon by the   Ministries of Health and Welfare, Finance and Home Affairs in 1989. 33   At the Japan Society conference, Ministry of Health and Welfare   Director-General Nobuharu Okamitsu described it as an attempt to   integrate welfare services, medical care and insurance in a comprehensive   manner. The plan outlines an ambitious set of goals at a projected cost   of $40 billion during the 1990s. This is in contrast to the $11.3 billion   spent in the 1980s.     The plan relies on four principal strategies   to build the infrastructure necessary to accommodate the growing needs of the elderly:       Expansion of existing services by increasing the number of home helpers from 40,900 in 1991 to 100,000 in 1999 and the number of nursing home beds from just over 144,600 to 240,000; 34    Creation of a more diverse range of services by defining the respective roles of corporations and of the national, prefectural and municipal governments;   Decentralization through an increased role for municipalities in the design of programs;   Reduction of fragmentation by developing government entities to provide services, support research, disseminate information and coordinate the regional administration of model projects.      In addition to expanding infrastructure for the elderly, the Golden   Plan seeks to rationalize services. It aims to reduce the geriatric   population of hospitals and to increase capacity in skilled nursing homes   and particularly in new institutions known as geriatric rehabilitation   centers. In addition, it calls for a three-fold increase in   government-employed visiting homemakers, a 10-fold growth in adult day    centers, and a 12-fold increase in respite care centers. If the plan is   implemented, the bedridden elderly will be shifted over the next decade   away from hospitals toward home care support services, informal support  services and nursing homes.     The government has recently adjusted the fee   schedule's reimbursement rates to encourage those general hospitals that   provide mostly long-term care for the elderly to become approved   geriatric hospitals. The fee schedule's per diem rates for long-term care   in general hospitals have been reduced to provide an incentive for many   private, medium-sized hospitals to become chronic and geriatric care   facilities that would be reimbursed on the basis of a more favorable   geriatric fee schedule. 35    Another major change in the reimbursement of medical care for the   elderly was the reinstatement of copayments. When the elderly were first   covered under national health insurance in 1961, their copayments were   set at 50 percent of the allowed fees. Free medical care for the elderly   was established in 1973 and lasted until 1983. When reinstated, the   copayment was kept at a low level, far lower than the pre-1970 levels of   patient contribution. 36 But cost-sharing for care of the elderly has   continued to rise. Moreover, the government is now emphasizing programs   that draw on family resources. In contrast to inpatient services, local   governments now ask the children of residents in nursing homes and   geriatric hospitals to contribute toward the cost of care. 37    NOTES:     1 Statistics Bureau, ( Iryo-Shisetsu Chosa ).

Japan, on the other hand, already   boasts the world's lowest infant mortality rate and longest life   expectancy, while achieving more success than America at containing   medical costs: in 1991, spending on health care accounted for a mere   6.6 percent of Japan's total gross domestic product versus 13.4 percent   of America's. How does Japan do it? What aspects of the Japanese model   might be applicable to the United States?     To explore these questions, on Friday,   April 30, 1993, the Japan Society organized a one-day conference entitled   Making Universal Health Care Affordable: How Japan Does It. Three   distinguished panels of Japanese and American health care specialists   discussed the management of Japan's universal health care coverage, ways   to balance quality care and cost containment, and how the United States   might profit from Japan's experience. Professor Victor Rodwin was one of   the conference participants (see Appendix 3) and agreed to draw on the   conference discussions as a starting point for this more extensive   monograph.     The Japan Society is grateful to KPMG Peat Marwick; New York Pharma   Forum; the International Leadership Center on Longevity and Society (U.S.)   of The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, an affiliate of The City   University of New York; the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare; and   the New York Academy of Medicine for their generous support of the   conference and this publication.     We offer special thanks to the conference   participants for their valuable presentations. We also thank John   Campbell and Michael Reich for their close reading and comments on this   manuscript; Toshihiko Takeda and Masaru Hiraiwa (JETRO-Ministry of Health   and Welfare) for providing details on the Japanese health system and for   reviewing key parts of the document; and Frank Schwartz for his diligent   editorial assistance.

William H. Gleysteen, Jr.   President, Japan Society                FOREWORD  by Marianne C. Fahs, Ph.D.   Associate Professor and Director  Division of Health Economics  International Leadership Center on Longevity and Society (U.S.)  Mount Sinai Medical Center        International study is gaining recognition as a useful method of   inquiry into questions of how best to allocate national resources to   improve health. Yet policy analysis of the Japanese system of health care   remains underdeveloped.. Indeed, serious debates regarding health care   reform strategies for the United States often exclude references to   Japanese health care delivery and financing. This exclusion is   unfortunate and obscures some outstanding successes of health policy in   Japan. For instance, in only 20 years and starting from a level similar   to the United States, Japan has achieved the lowest infant mortality rate   in the world. The United States remains 19th among developed nations.   Japan became the world's leader through a well-thought-out plan for   prevention, coupled with government investment. Now, Japanese policy   leaders are turning their attention to the elderly.     The United States and Japan face similar   problems. Both countries face a demographic revolution in the decades   ahead as the population ages. Medical expenditures, as a proportion of   GNP, are increasing at similar rates. Both governments face fiercely   competing demands for resource allocation among prevention, treatment and   basic science interest groups. Both medical care systems face a diverse   mix of patients with increasing rates of functional disability. Both   systems are financed by a large number of employer-based private insurance   plans in addition to public insurance for the poor and the elderly.     In this information era, we face a world   hungry to know what works in health care and what it costs. One of   medicine's great challenges is to inform policy-makers and the public of   long-term produc tive benefits and costs to our society of preventing and   postponing disability. Many initiatives in the United States will require   fundamental change. The most cost effective will be those targeted with   sensitivity and respect for cultural tradition to reach the myriad of   groups in our pluralistic society. Enlarging our understanding of   socio-cultural patterns of health behavior, disease and economic   productivity and costs calls for increasing international communication   and research partnerships.     Professor Rodwin and his associates provide an   excellent overview of the health care system in Japan. This comprehensive   and well-documented monograph will serve as an essential reference for   policy leaders and researchers alike who are interested in pursuing   comparative policy analysis. The Japan Society is to be commended for   organizing this timely conference. Professor Rodwin, a leading expert in   the comparative analysis of health systems, has taken the conference   presentations and discussions and used them as a springboard for his own   further investigation of political and economic aspects of Japan's health   care system. In this monograph, he presents a clear and well-organized   perspective on what the United States can learn from Japan. Let us hope   that the challenges Professor Rodwin raises will be met in the years   ahead as we pursue health care reform to achieve the goals of   effectiveness, efficiency and equity.           INTRODUCTION         Japan's health care system is characterized by   universal coverage, free choice of health care providers by patients, a   multi-payer, employment-based system of financing, and a predominant role   for private hospitals and fee-for-service practice. Virtually all   residents of Japan are covered without regard to any medical problems   they may have (so-called predisposing conditions) or to their actuarial   risk of succumbing to illness. Premiums are based on income and ability   to pay. Although there is strong government regulation of health care   financing and the operation of health insurance, control of the delivery   of care is left largely to medical professionals and there appears to be   no public concern about health care rationing.     Like the Australian, Canadian and many European health care systems,   Japan's national health insurance program is compulsory. But Japan   surpasses all 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic   Cooperation and Development (OECD) in life expectancy at birth and also   has the lowest infant mortality rate (Appendix 1, Table 1). 1   It achieves these successes at a cost of only 6.6 percent of gross   domestic product, $1,267 per capita - half that of the United States   (Table 1)  .     Japanese-style national health insurance raises a fascinating   question: how has Japan reduced financial barriers of access to medical   care and achieved a No. 1 ranking on health status at a cost that is   among the lowest of wealthy industrialized nations? 2 In   addressing this question, we begin with a comparative analysis of health   care resources and the use of medical care in Japan, the United States   and other OECD countries. Next, we review the financing and organization   of medical care in Japan, evaluate some strengths and weaknesses of the   health care system, and explore possible lessons for health care reform   in the United States.      In adopting this comparative approach to   health care reform in the United States, we have relied on an extensive   review of the English-language literature on Japan's health care system   and on information presented at the Japan Society's April 30 conference,   \"Making Universal Health Care Affordable: How Japan Does It.\" 3   We do not presume to have analyzed Japan's health care system in depth.   For example, we remain intrigued by Japan's exemplary health status and   by such societal values and traditions as egalitarianism and consensus-  building upon which the health system is built. We have aimed, in earnest,   to raise more questions than we are able to answer. We hope that these   questions may lend a sense of perspective to the on-going public debate   on health care reform in the United States.    NOTES:    1 For comparisons between Japan and the other OECD countries,   see the Tables in Appendix 1.    2 This is a reference to Vogel's (1979) classic book, Japan as   Number One: Lessons for America. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press).    3 We also refer the reader to a previous monograph on health   and medicine in Japan and America based on a conference organized by the   Japan Society in 1978 (Reich and Kao, 1978).                  HEALTH CARE RESOURCES AND  UTILIZATION        Japan has 15.8 inpatient hospital beds per   1,000 persons, the highest number among OECD countries and more than   three times the American ratio (Table 1) . By contrast, with 1.6 physicians   per 1,000 population, Japan has the fifth lowest physician-per-person   ratio, 43 percent less than the American rate of 2.3 per 1,000 (Table 1) .   Japan also has one-half to one-third the American number of intensive care   beds per capita (Table 1) . And Japan is tied with Austria for the lowest   hospital staffing ratio (that is, the number of employees per bed) among   OECD countries (Appendix 1, Table 3).     As for the use of these resources, at 8.3   percent, Japan admits a smaller proportion of its population to hospitals   every year than any other OECD country except Turkey, a rate barely over   one-half that of the United States (Table 1) . On the other hand, of all   OECD countries, at 50.5 days, Japan has the longest average length of   stay for inpatient hospital services, more than five times that of the   United States (Table 1) .     Although Japan has one of the lowest   physician-to-population ratios among OECD countries (Appendix 1, Table 3),   at 12.9, Japanese doctors have the highest number of physician contacts   per capita, more than twice the American rate . It must be noted, (Table 1)  however, that the average length of a physician visit in Japan is only 6.9   minutes, compared to over 20 minutes in the United States. 1     To the extent that OECD data are available on hospital admission   rates for selected procedures, with the exception of appendectomies,   Japan's rates are lower than those in the United States (Table 2). 2   Comparative survey data indicate that surgeons in Japan perform fewer   than one-fourth the number of operations per capita that their colleagues   in the United States do (Table 1) . 3 This pattern is supported by findings   on cesarean section rates, which are half as frequent in Japan as in the   United States. 4 The United States is known abroad for its unusually high   cesarean section rate.     It would be wrong to conclude from these data   that Japan rations high-tech medical care. On the contrary, among OECD   countries, Japan has the highest number of computerized axial tomography   (CT) scanners per capita, the highest number of extra-corporal shock wave   lithotriptors per capita, and the highest number of patients per million   treated for end-stage renal disease failure. 5   In addition, Japanese spend more than any other nation on drugs as a   percent of total health expenditures, more than twice the American   rate. 6     Japanese doctors' clear preference for non-invasive procedures is   demonstrated by the kinds of medical technologies imported and exported.   Equipment requiring invasive operations (e.g., pacemakers and artfficial   heart valves) is almost all imported, whereas diagnostic equipment   (e.g., CT scanners) is produced in Japan and exported in large   quantities. 7     In contrast to the United States, Japan's low   rate of hospital admissions (Table 1) reflects its tendency to emphasize   ambulatory over inpatient hospital care. 8 But once hospitalization   occurs, as we have seen, Japan holds the OECD record for long lengths of   stay and low hospital staffing ratios (Appendix 1, Tables 3 and 4). This   is encouraged by a reimbursement system that pays hospitals on a per   diem basis and a style of medical practice that emphasizes bed rest and   complete recovery while a patient is still in the hospital.     Beyond these more measurable differences in   resource availability and use of medical care in Japan and United States,   there are a host of political-institutional and cultural factors that   reinforce each health care system's distinctiveness. The United States is   a federal system whose 50 states have significant autonomy on matters of   health insurance and public health policies. Although the federal   government exercises a dominant role over the Medicare program and   regulatory aspects of health policy, Americans are multiethnic,   suspicious of excessive governmental authority and inclined to solve   social problems at the local level. Japan is a centralized, unitary   state with a highly homogeneous population and a tradition of powerful   state intervention in the economy, including its many health insurance   plans.

In Japan in  1991, there were 945 patients per million treated for end stage renal  disease failure in contrast to 784 in the United States (OECD Health  data file, 1993).    6 lglehart (1988) reports that in 1981  reimbursement for drugs by Japanese health insurance was equal to 38.7  percent of all health expenditures and that in 1987 this figure dropped  to 28 percent. More recent data from OECD Health Systems: Facts and  Trends (Paris: OECD, 1992) indicate that this figure has dropped to 18.4  percent, in contrast to the U.S. figure of 8.3 percent. However, these  data exclude pharmaceutical expenditures for inpatients, which are  substantial. Ikegami (1990) reports that \"about 30 percent of Japan's  personal health expenditures are for drugs,\" which we assume include  inpatient drugs, and supports the contention that the Japanese are among  the highest spenders on drugs.   In terms of pharmaceutical expenditures per  capita, in U.S. dollar pharmaceutical purchasing power parities,  Japanese spent $332 per capita, Americans $182. However, if these  expenditure data are adjusted by GDP purchasing power parities, the  difference narrows: $179 for Japan, $182 for the United States.    7 Ikegami (1989).    8 Ikegami (1992a).

HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE    The evolution of national health insurance    National health insurance emerged in Japan as   the result of a gradual process that can be traced back to 1905, when the   Kamegafuchi Textile Company provided limited benefits for its employees. 1   In the decades that followed, more and more corporations began offering   benefits through mutual aid societies. A health insurance law enacted in   1922 was inspired by the German system established by Chancellor Bismarck   in 1883. As in Germany, this first law extended health insurance coverage   to industrial workers and miners but excluded the self-employed and   employees in companies with fewer than five workers. 2 This law,   implemented in 1927, established the practice of mandating coverage by   enterprises and created an important government role in the provision of   health insurance to those individuals not covered by employers. In 1938,   health insurance was extended to farmers, fishermen, foresters and other   groups not covered by the 1922 law.     After World War II, the effort to rebuild Japan   gave new impetus to the achievement of universal coverage. In 1958, the   1938 law was revised to include the remaining 30 percent of the   population not previously covered. This revision broke the precedent of   extending health insurance to occupational groups by calling for   universal coverage on the basis of residence. Every government   jurisdiction, whether city, town or village, was required to provide   health insurance to every uncovered resident by 1961. Since 1961,   virtually all Japanese have been covered by either employers or the   government.     Health care financing     Health insurance expenditures in Japan are   financed by payroll taxes paid by employers and employees and by   income-based premiums paid by the self-employed. In contrast to the   United States, where the federal, state and local governments finance   roughly 42.9 percent of all health care expenditures and out-of-pocket   payments contribute another 22 percent, in Japan, only 31.7 percent of   national health care expenditures derive from national and local public   funds and 12.2 percent from out-of-pocket payments. The largest share of   health care financing in Japan is raised by means of compulsory premiums   levied on individual subscribers (34.6 percent) and employers (21.7   percent). 3 This employment-based share of health care financing in Japan   (56.4 percent) raised by means of voluntary employer, employee and   individual subscriber premiums in the United States (Figure 1) .     The structure of the national health insurance system    At first glance, understanding the system   seems to be an impossible task. Japan's national health insurance program   is made up of some 2,000 private insurers and more than 3,000 units of   government. The system can be simplified, however, by distinguishing   between two broad groups of beneficiaries (Appendix 2, Figure 1) :1)   employees and their dependents, including some elderly dependents   (65 percent of the population); and 2) the self-employed, unemployed,   elderly and their dependents (35 percent of the population). 4     Ignoring some administrative complexities and   small beneficiary groups, health insurance plans for employees may be   categorized into four groups:       Government-managed plans - These plans provide coverage for the almost 30 percent of the population comprised of employees (and their dependents) of small enterprises with more than five but fewer than 300 employees. These plans are managed by the government's Social Insurance Agency through a network of some 300 local offices. Premium contributions are set by law at a fixed rate (8.2 percent of monthly income before taxes) and evenly split between employees and employers.   Society-managed plans - Known as health insurance societies, more than 1,800 company plans provide coverage for 26 percent of the population. These health insurance societies are managed jointly by representatives of labor and management in enterprises with more than 300 employees. Society-managed plans can be also established by several enterprises employing 3,000 or more employees. Payroll taxes for such plans range from 5.8 to 9.5 percent of gross monthly income. 5 Employers are required to pay at least half of these contributions, and some pay as much as 80 percent.   Mutual aid association (MAA) insurers - Covering almost 10 percent of the population, these include 27 plans for government employees in the national public service, 54 plans for local government employees, and one plan for quasi-public employees like teachers and other school employees. The average payroll contribution of these plans in 8.5 percent of the employee's wage.   Plans for day laborers (for those who work less than two months during the year) and seaman - These independent plans cover only 0.1 and 0.4 percent of the population, respectively.     In addition to the employee groups noted above,   employees in enterprises with fewer than five workers, the self-employed   and retirees are covered either by municipal governments or by national   health insurance societies. Roughly 3,000 municipal governments cover   over 90 percent of such self-employed individuals as farmers,   shopkeepers, their dependents, and a large number of elderly people on   pensions. There are also 166 national health insurance societies that   directly manage plans for certain trade and occupational groups such as   physicians, lawyers, dentists, food retailers, carpenters, and barbers.   Contributions to these national health insurance societies are based on   reported income and assets as well as on the number of individuals per   household.     In contrast to health insurance for employees,   municipal governments and national health insurance societies receive no   direct contributions from employers. Moreover, the self-employed and   retirees earn less on average than employees in large enterprises, so the   government ends up paying slightly less than 50 percent of their health   insurance expenditures - four-twelfths by the national government and one-  twelfth each by prefectures and municipalities. 6 Once the elderly reach   the age of 70 (or 65 if bedridden), since they use the lion's share of   health care resources but do not pay premiums, under the Health Services   System for the Elderly the other half of their expenses are financed by   taxes on premium payments to all insurers of employees and the self-  employed.     Most of Japan's health insurance plans are   private organizations in terms of administrative law; in practice, they   have a quasi-public status insofar as they are largely bound to provide   uniform benefits and to cover all eligible beneficiaries. All employers   with at least five employees are mandated by law to insure them (along   with their dependents). Employers have little freedom to alter premium   levels, which range from 5.8 to 9.5 percent of the wage base. 7 The self-  employed are required to contribute premiums to health insurance plans   that are administered by local governments or trade associations. And all   of these premiums are taxed to finance the national fund which, along   with government subsidies, finances national health insurance for the   elderly.     The extent and regulation of health insurance benefits     Health insurance benefits are designed to   provide basic medical care to the maximum number of individuals. Although   there are exceptions, mandated benefits are similar across the four   groups of employee plans and for the self-employed and retirees. They   include ambulatory and hospital care, extended care, most dental care   and prescription drugs. Not covered are such items as abortion, cosmetic   surgery, most traditional medicine (including acupuncture), certain   hospital amenities, some high-tech procedures, and childbirth. 8   Expenses that fall outside the normal boundaries of medical care are   either not covered, dealt with on a case-by-case basis, or covered by the   welfare system.     Differences between plans include the level of   copayments, the amount of cash benefits, and the extent of cross-  subsidization and government subsidies (Appendix 2, Figures 2 and 3) .   With regard to copayments, all plans for employees have a 10 percent rate   for plan members and their dependents, a 20 percent rate for inpatient   care, and a 30 percent rate for outpatient care. For the self-employed   and their dependents, the copayment rate is 30 percent for both inpatient   and outpatient care. For the retired, the copayment rate is 20 percent,   and for their dependents, the rate is 20 percent for inpatient care and   30 percent for outpatient care. But under Japan's system of catastrophic   health insurance, there is a monthly ceiling for each beneficiary on all   copayments for all health insurance plans. 9 This has limited private   insurance to coverage of copayments. There is, however, a small market   for supplemental benefits that pay for amenities like private rooms.     Health insurance plans for employees provide   cash benefits for extended sickness and injury and for maternity leave   and delivery expenses. National health insurance plans for the self-  employed and retirees provide cash benefits for midwifery and general   expenses. Cash benefits can be substantial. Nearly $2,400 is provided to   cover child delivery expenses under most employee plans, for example. 10   If the mother is the primary beneficiary, the cash benefit may be 50   percent of her monthly salary. Maternity leave amounts to 100 days and is   compensated at 50 percent of a mother's salary in the case of working   women. In the event of prolonged sickness or disability, an individual   collects 60 percent of monthly remuneration for 18 months.     Society-managed plans provide more extensive   benefits in kind. In addition to providing the cash benefits noted above,   74 percent of these plans also have a \"patient cost-sharing restoration\"   program which picks up a portion of the mandatory 10 percent copayment. 11   Society-managed plans are also actively involved in health screening and   promotion. Enterprises own and operate more than 3,500 sanitoriums, 1,000   gymnasiums and 300 health centers, for example. 12     There is thus a widely held perception that   employees of large corporations covered under society-managed plans are   getting a \"better deal.\" There is no evidence that these beneficiaries   enjoy better health status, however. As John Campbell noted at the Japan   Society conference, among all plans, individuals enrolled in society-  managed plans receive the least value back for what they pay. For every   dollar paid in premium contributions, only 62 cents is received in health   insurance benefits. The beneficiaries of government-managed plans receive   84 cents in benefits for every dollar of premiums paid, the self-employed   receive $1.66, and retirees receive $4 to $5. 13     Government subsidies and cross-subsidization between plans   Age and income disparities among health insurance   plans result in an unequal distribution of health risks. Plans that   insure beneficiaries who are older or in higher risk occupational groups   will incur higher costs and therefore often generate deficits. Given the   Japanese commitment to equity, these inequalities are reduced through   government subsidies and cross-subsidization between plans.     With the exception of mutual aid associations   for government employees, all insurance plans receive some form of   government subsidy. Even society-managed plans, for example, receive   government funds (Y4.85 billion in 1992) to defray their administrative   costs. Likewise, government subsidies financed 50 percent of the benefit   payments to self-employed individuals covered by national health insurance    (Appendix 2, Figure 3) .     Cross-subsidization supports the poorer plans.   As noted above, the most generous example is the national pool created as   part of the Health and Medical Service Law for the Aged of 1983.   Government (national and local) provides 30 percent of this special fund,   and local governments another 20 percent. The remaining 70 percent comes   from other insurance plans based upon the total enrollment of retirees in   each fund. 14 As a percentage of their total expenditures, government-  managed plans, society-managed plans and national health insurance plans   contribute 15.4, 20.4 and 24.2 percent, respectively. 15      Provider reimbursement    Under Japanese national health insurance, all   insurance plans pay health care providers low fees by American standards    (Table 3) . The fees must conform to a uniform national fee schedule known   as the point-fee system. For any particular service, the same fee is paid   by all insurers to all providers. As in Canada or Germany, there is no   \"extra-billing\": neither physicians nor hospitals may bill their patients   more than the authorized fee; but illegal side-payments are common and   condoned. All covered medical procedures are ranked by complexity, and   neither geographic location, the institutional setting (e.g., type of   hospital or ambulatory care), the qualification of the provider, nor the   actual cost of the service are considered in this rating system. 16     Medical procedures are assigned a number of   points, each of which is worth 10 yen. 17 Only the basic charges for   hospital room and board services are covered; the costs for additional   hotel amenities are not covered. 18 The fee covers all supplies,   materials, capital depreciation and personnel costs. There is no   flexibility in this system of price controls for insurers or for   providers. Hospitals can bill patients extra only for room and board and   a restricted number of specialized services, for example. 19 As John   Campbell noted at the conference, \"cheap stuff is profitable and   expensive stuff is unprofitable. A doctor who sees a few extra patients   and prescribes drugs for them makes money; coronary bypass surgery at an   urban hospital loses money.\"     &nbspThe Ministry of Health and Welfare sets   the fee schedule. Its Central Social Medical Care Council has 20 members   who represent a cross section of health care interests: eight providers   (five physicians, two dentists, and one pharmacist), eight payers (four   insurers, including government representatives, two employers and two   labor representatives), and four public interest representatives (three   economists and one lawyer). 20 Every other year, this council renegotiates   the fee schedule with the medical profession, but these negotiations are   constrained by a rate cap set by the Ministry to limit the overall   increase in costs. This rate cap results in an effective, if implicit,   global budget for all health care expenditures. 21     NOTES:     1 Kemporen (1990). 2 Steslicke (1989).     3 From a table distributed at the Japan Society conference by Toshiro Murase, president of the Japanese Medical Association.    4 J.

These charges apply to physicians who  do not accept the Medicare rate as payment in full.                   THE ORGANIZATION OF MEDICAL CARE    Hospitals    Despite Japan's relatively high hospital   bed-to-population ratio (Appendix 1, Table 3), the number of hospital   beds is not decreasing Between 1970 and 1988, in fact, it increased by   25.8 percent. 1 This reflects at least five characteristics of Japan's   broader health system First, until the late 1980s, few barriers were   placed on entry into the hospital market in Japan's rapidly growing   postwar economy. Second the organization of medical care in Japan is   heavily centered around hospitals. Third, 81 percent of hospitals are   privately owned, and the) have had few restrictions on their capital   investments. Fourth because hospitals have competed fiercely with one   another, expansion has served as a key strategy to gain a competitive   edge. Finally, al least until the mid 1980s, the Ministry of Health and  Welfare has not played an active role in containing the total number of   hospital beds.     Close to 90 percent of hospital facilities   with 20 or more beds are classified as \"general hospitals.\" The remainder   are mental health facilities or tuberculosis and leprosy centers. General   hospitals are dominated by small, privately owned and operated   \"nonprofit\" facilities. The average number of beds in a Japanese hospital   is 163 -slightly fewer than the 190 in an average American hospital - and   half have fewer than 100 beds. 2 Although the last few years have   witnessed a proliferation of national hospital chains, the majority of   small hospitals continue to be privately owned and managed by physicians   As in public hospitals, physicians in private hospitals are salaried.     With 283 beds, the average public hospital is   larger than its private counterpart. Although 19 percent of hospitals are   public, they account for 33 percent of all beds. About 75 percent of   public hospitals are under the jurisdiction of municipal and prefectural   governments the remainder are national institutions. About 1 percent of   hospitals are owned and operated by quasi-public agencies and   organizations such as the Red Cross, social insurance agencies and   employment related groups.     Despite these distinctions, all hospitals in   Japan tend to be viewed as recuperative centers rather than as merely   therapeutic institutions, Even large teaching hospitals do not limit   themselves to providing acute-care services. Hospitals have traditionally   functioned, in part, as long-term care facilities. Of the nearly 400   hospitals that have more than 500 beds, only about 60 percent have adult   intensive care units, and only 30 percent of them have neonatal intensive   care units, the majority of which have only five to seven beds.     As a result of this orientation, patients in   Japanese hospitals have the longest average length of stay in the world. 3   Even accounting for the lengthy stays of psychiatric patients, the   average patient's stay in a Japanese hospital far exceeds that of most   other OECD countries both in the aggregate and by specific disease   categories (Appendix 1, Table 5). In addition to the nursing home   functions played by hospitals, other factors accounting for the lengthy   stays are probably the large number of beds, the low admission rates, the   per diem form of hospital reimbursement, and the emphasis on recuperation   over invasive medical and surgical interventions.     As is the case with intensive care units,   there are far fewer emergency rooms in Japan than in the United States.   But while Japan has roughly half the population of the United States, it   has only 7 percent of the murders, 2 percent of the reported rapes, and   0.3 percent of the armed robberies, so there would seem to be less of a   need for extensive trauma facilities. 4 In addition, unimpeded access to   health care through the clinic system has the effect of steering   non-urgent care away from emergency rooms. An integrated system of   primary, secondary and tertiary-level emergency facilities appears to   meet the need for emergency and trauma care. 5     As in the United States, university hospitals   in Japan are centers for research, teaching and the delivery of   tertiary-level \"cutting edge\" medical care. In contrast to America's   129 academic medical centers with an average size of 664 beds, Japan   has 131 university hospitals (half of them public) with an average size   of 735 beds. 6 Despite their larger average size, Japanese teaching   hospitals have far fewer inpatient admissions, less than 30 percent of   the American rate. And the 36.2 day average length of stay in these   hospitals far exceeds the 7.9 days in American teaching hospitals. 7     Although Japanese university hospitals   generally incur higher costs, they also have shorter lengths of stay and   higher staffing ratios than other Japanese hospitals. Increasingly, the   public perceives these facilities as preferred sites for receiving   medical care.     A recent innovation for the delivery of   high-tech medical care has been the establishment of officially   designated centers for such procedures as open-heart surgery. This   \"Highly Advanced Medical Technology System\" provides a mechanism by which   new medical devices can receive broader use and evaluation despite their   ineligibility for reimbursement under the normal benefits plan of Japan's   health insurance program. Most often, highly advanced medical procedures   are performed at teaching facilities. 8 For third-party reimbursement to   be awarded, these procedures must now be performed at these centers,   which are required to have appropriate equipment and personnel.     Clinics and Ambulatory Care    Japanese physicians have traditionally   operated on a small scale, working out of their homes to provide health   care services to their community. Although these clinics have typically   provided a low-level intensity of care, many have recently acquired a   wide range of sophisticated medical equipment including ultrasonic   testing and gastrointestinal fiberscopes. 9     Small, privately owned clinics provided most   outpatient services until the 1970s. In addition, roughly 25,000   physicians' offices, equipped with up to 19 beds and also referred to as   \"clinics,\" function as small hospitals. They add 276,000 beds to Japan's   already high number (15.8 per 1,000 persons), thus increasing the total   number of hospital beds by 17 percent. 10     Since the 1970s, clinic physicians have become   concerned about losing their share of primary-care services to hospitals.   Although the number of clinics has increased from about 50,000 in 1955 to   more than 80,800 in 1990, the number of clinics with beds decreased by   almost 20 percent during the 1970s and 1980s. 11 Likewise, although the   number of physicians has increased by 113 percent since 1960, the   proportion of physicians running clinics has dropped from 44.8 percent in   1960 to only 27.5 percent in 1990. 12 This decrease in the number of   clinics with beds and the proportion of physicians running clinics is due   largely to direct competition with larger hospitals in outpatient   services and high land prices that prohibit the establishment of new   clinic facilities. Larger hospitals are attracting both young doctors and   outpatients with their sophisticated technology and services. 13     Despite the competition between clinics and   hospitals, two structural aspects of Japan's health care system appear to   constrain the trend toward specialization and high-tech care and to   promote primary-care services. First, clinic physicians do not have   admitting privileges to hospitals. Second, once referred to the hospital,   many patients do not return to a clinic but continue to be treated by the   hospital's outpatient department. These barriers give clinic physicians   an incentive to put off hospitalization. 14     Beyond the barriers to referring patients to hospitals, two financial   incentives also appear to support primary-care services. First, clinic   physicians are remunerated under the fee schedule each time they write a   prescription for a dispensing pharmacist. Second, they make an average   profit of 26 percent of the reimbursement rate every time they   prescribe - and sell - a drug to their patients. 15 Because pharmaceutical   manufacturers and wholesalers routinely sell drugs to physicians at   prices well below the fee schedule's reimbursement rates, drug sales have   become an important source of profits for clinics. 16     The average net monthly income for clinic   physicians was $22,900 in 1990, while specialists based in private   hospitals earned only $6,300. 17 A 1985 study indicated that revenues and   net profits of clinic physicians vary with the quantity of drugs   prescribed and sold by physicians, the age of the physicians and the size   of the clinic. This finding supports the contention that clinic   physicians maximize their income by prescribing and selling more drugs. 18     Despite clinic physicians' practice of selling   the drugs they prescribe, which strikes most Americans as a blatant   financial conflict of interest, the doctor-patient relationship   presumably is based on trust. Patients are typically told little about   their diagnoses, and doctors explain away problems in \"soothing terms   without necessarily providing precise information about what exactly the   problem is.\" 19 Pills frequently go unlabeled, and patients are not always  told when they are part of an experiment. Such practices were recently   supported by a court decision that doctors need not share the full   details of a diagnosis with a cancer patient. 20     The clinic physician, however, does not provide the kind of primary   health care so often extolled by family physicians in the United States.   Most clinic physicians operate in solo practices without hospital   privileges, thus making it difficult to collaborate with specialists as   well as with peers. Standards of practice, professional competence and   patient care are neither monitored nor evaluated in any formal way.   In addition, as in the United States, Japanese physicians do not   typically subscribe to the idea of \"comprehensive primary health care and   often fail to respect the person as a whole person operating in a complex   social and economic environment.\" 21    Services for the elderly     Since the early 1970s, the elderly enjoyed a   privileged status in the Japanese welfare state. With the economic growth   of the 1960s came demands for the expansion of social benefits that could   not be ignored. In 1973, the government responded to social pressures by   creating an almost free medical care system for the elderly, the national   insurance plan administered by local governments. In 1982, in response to   rising health care costs, the Health and Medical Service Law for the Aged   established the national pooi to subsidize medical care. 22 The government   sought to increase equity in financing by taxing all health insurance   plans based on a formula related to each plan's number of beneficiaries   and past medical expenditures on the elderly. 23     Despite universal coverage under national   health insurance, the range of services designed to meet the needs of the   elderly is limited. In general wards, no distinction is made between   acute and long-term care facilities. 24 A significant fraction of hospital   beds are routinely occupied by elderly people requiring long-term care.   Seventy-five percent of the institutionalized elderly are in hospitals   and clinics, for example, and survey data indicate that 45 percent of   elderly inpatients are hospitalized for more than six months. 25 Due to   the shortage of rehabilitation services, roughly 4.6 percent of the   elderly population is bedridden. 26 In 1987, 34 percent of patients in   Japan's long-term care facilities were bedridden, a striking contrast to   America's 6.5 percent. 27     There are now a growing number of hospitals   specializing in treating and caring for the elderly. There are also three   other types of facilities that serve the elderly in Japan: a small number   of nursing homes (10 beds per 1,000 elderly persons in 1988, in contrast   to 46.2 in the United States in 1985), welfare institutions for those who   need constant care, and facilities providing rehabilitation services. 28   But the relatively limited number of home health aides leads to an   absence of reliable support services. 29 Compared to the United States,   Japan has a far more severe shortage of long-term care services. There   are long waiting lists for admission to nursing homes-applicants commonly   wait for more than a year. 30    In addition to the lack of appropriate institutions   and support services, at least three other factors contribute to Japan's   high rate of \"social admissions\" to hospitals. First, medical practice   generally tends to emphasize passive care and bed rest. Second, a lack of   space at home to accommodate elderly relatives pushes more of the frail   elderly into hospitals and clinics. Finally, women, the traditional care   givers for the elderly, are entering the work force in increasing   numbers. Thus, although some 62 percent of the elderly live with their   children or other relatives, in contrast to less than 33 percent in the   United States, Japan's institutionalization rate (6.2 percent) is   comparable to America's. 31 Where Japan diverges from the United States   and other OECD countries is in its rapidly graying population. In 2020,   26 percent of Japanese will be over 65, compared to 17.3 percent of   Americans. 32 Because there are already about 700,000 Japanese aged 65 and   over (4.6 percent of the elderly population) who are so severely disabled   that they are bedridden or require constant supervision, these   projections impelled government policy-makers to publish the \"Golden Plan\"   and make a commitment to solve this anticipated crisis.     The Golden Plan is a 10-year national   health care and welfare plan for the elderly agreed upon by the   Ministries of Health and Welfare, Finance and Home Affairs in 1989. 33   At the Japan Society conference, Ministry of Health and Welfare   Director-General Nobuharu Okamitsu described it as an attempt to   integrate welfare services, medical care and insurance in a comprehensive   manner. The plan outlines an ambitious set of goals at a projected cost   of $40 billion during the 1990s. This is in contrast to the $11.3 billion   spent in the 1980s.     The plan relies on four principal strategies   to build the infrastructure necessary to accommodate the growing needs of the elderly:       Expansion of existing services by increasing the number of home helpers from 40,900 in 1991 to 100,000 in 1999 and the number of nursing home beds from just over 144,600 to 240,000; 34    Creation of a more diverse range of services by defining the respective roles of corporations and of the national, prefectural and municipal governments;   Decentralization through an increased role for municipalities in the design of programs;   Reduction of fragmentation by developing government entities to provide services, support research, disseminate information and coordinate the regional administration of model projects.      In addition to expanding infrastructure for the elderly, the Golden   Plan seeks to rationalize services. It aims to reduce the geriatric   population of hospitals and to increase capacity in skilled nursing homes   and particularly in new institutions known as geriatric rehabilitation   centers. In addition, it calls for a three-fold increase in   government-employed visiting homemakers, a 10-fold growth in adult day    centers, and a 12-fold increase in respite care centers. If the plan is   implemented, the bedridden elderly will be shifted over the next decade   away from hospitals toward home care support services, informal support  services and nursing homes.     The government has recently adjusted the fee   schedule's reimbursement rates to encourage those general hospitals that   provide mostly long-term care for the elderly to become approved   geriatric hospitals. The fee schedule's per diem rates for long-term care   in general hospitals have been reduced to provide an incentive for many   private, medium-sized hospitals to become chronic and geriatric care   facilities that would be reimbursed on the basis of a more favorable   geriatric fee schedule. 35    Another major change in the reimbursement of medical care for the   elderly was the reinstatement of copayments. When the elderly were first   covered under national health insurance in 1961, their copayments were   set at 50 percent of the allowed fees. Free medical care for the elderly   was established in 1973 and lasted until 1983. When reinstated, the   copayment was kept at a low level, far lower than the pre-1970 levels of   patient contribution. 36 But cost-sharing for care of the elderly has   continued to rise. Moreover, the government is now emphasizing programs   that draw on family resources. In contrast to inpatient services, local   governments now ask the children of residents in nursing homes and   geriatric hospitals to contribute toward the cost of care. 37    NOTES:     1 Statistics Bureau, ( Iryo-Shisetsu Chosa ).

The following is a listing of the 2009 research projects.    Study: How stress reactions from traumatic hand injuries influence the patient's response to and participation in hand care occupational therapy.    Faculty Mentors: Sally Poole and Jane Bear-Lehman    This descriptive study used the Impact of Event Scale to determine stress reactions and how they could influence a person's ability to participate in therapy. It sought to study whether intrusive thinking and/or periods of avoidance (normal responses to stress) could impact occupational therapy treatment. The study asked a small group of individuals who had hand injuries about the events and circumstances surrounding their injury and their reactions to it. The interviews took place in local hand clinics.    Study: Ongoing program evaluation and development- NYU Entry-Level OT Program-Perceptions of Older Adults.    Faculty Mentors: Karen Buckley and Sally Poole    Students assessed the entering professional OT class regarding their perceptions of older adults in this continuing study. Utilizing an established AOTA survey and the electronic survey tool, Survey Monkey, research students selected questions regarding existing beliefs about working adults, and attitudes towards working with them. The surveys were administered and data collected from the occupational therapy entering and on-going classes. Analyses were performed for the initial phase of this ongoing program evaluation project.    Study: Ongoing program evaluation and development-NYU Entry-Level OT Program-Perception of the occupational therapy curriculum effectiveness.    Faculty Mentor: Karen Buckley    As part of NYU's ongoing program evaluation, an electronic survey was administered to students in Level II Fieldwork to provide feedback about how the experiences of Level I influenced them. The research students selected questions that were pertinent to topics required for the Department's accreditation. Surveys were administered and data was also collected from NYU OT graduates. Data analysis was then performed for the initial phase of this ongoing program evaluation project.    Study: What is an effective way to measure thumb opposition?    Faculty Mentor: Jane Bear-Lehman Clinical Doctoral Student: Pamela Lawton    The traditional method of measuring the completion of thumb opposition is with a ruler. Therapists rely on this primary method to document and to chart progress for those who have impaired thumb movement at the CMC joint. A new tool, designed by Hareau has been designed and is being marketed to measure thumb opposition. This inquiry looked at the utility of this new tool on a sample of normal adult women, and on a sample of women who had expressed injuries affecting their CMC joints and were undergoing treatment in NYC.    Study: An Efficacy Study of Handwriting Interventions for School-Aged Children, Grades 1-2.    Clinical Mentor: Karen Roston    Handwriting is the main reason for referral to occupational therapists in school-based settings. Students took part in a research project designed to assess the efficacy of two treatment approaches. In order to compare two interventions, two Handwriting Clubs were established to improve a child's legibility. One focused on practice and the other focused on visually directed activities. The Clubs met 2 times a week for 6-8 weeks for 30-45 minutes, over a range of 12-18 sessions. The NYU students ran the group for visually directed activities and developed a protocol for them, with the help of Karen Roston.    Study: Ongoing program evaluation and development-NYU Entry-Level OT Program-Multi-Cultural Awareness as part of the new curriculum.    Faculty Mentors: Karen Buckley and Sally Poole    This is a follow up study in which students assessed the professional OT classes regarding their multi-cultural awareness and sensitivity. As part of NYU's OT program mission statement, a goal of the program is to educate students to prepare them to work with clients from a variety of racial, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds often differing from their own. Utilizing an electronic survey tool, Survey Monkey, research students selected questions that were pertinent to the topic of multi-cultural awareness and sensitivity. Surveys were administered and data collected from first year OT students. Analyses were performed for the initial phase of this ongoing program evaluation project.    Study: Behavioral-Based Feeding Questionnaire: Baseline Study of Full Term Infants from Ages 0 to 2.    Faculty Mentors: Tsu-Hsin Howe    There is a high incidence rate of feeding problems in infants with prematurity. However, there is no instrument available at the present time to help therapists learn infants' feeding history systematically from their primary care takers, in order to understand feeding problems in context. The first step to creating such an instrument is to develop a questionnaire and to establish its reliability for clinical use. In this project, students were responsible for completing a survey with 20 primary care takers, who had babies under the age of 2 with no premature history. Students had each participant complete two questionnaires: a behavioral-based feeding questionnaire and a parental stress index. Students then analyzed the results of these two questionnaires to examine: 1. the distribution of feeding problems in full term infants from 0 to 2 years old, 2. the results obtained from the parental stress index, and 3. the relationship between feeding problems and parental distress.    Study: Survey of Preferred Interests in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders.    Faculty Mentor: Kristie Koenig    Students sent out a survey utilizing a web-based program that sought to identify how preferred or circumscribed interests (often labeled obsessions or perseverations) are used in school/work, social, leisure, and everyday activities by adults who are diagnosed with ASD. Students also analyzed the data.    Study: Comparison of Children's Participation and Enjoyment of Activities between children with ASD and typically developing children.    Faculty Mentor: Kristie Koenig    Students interviewed an age and gender matched sample of typically developing children (grades K-2), administered the CAPE/PAC questionnaire, and compared the results to those of children with ASD. Students then performed data analysis to assess differences between the two groups. Students also observed interviews of children with ASD conducted by the practicing therapists.    Study: Environmental Affordances and Attachment to Community among Wheelchair Users.    Faculty Mentor: Anita Perr    This project sought to describe the community features that people with disabilities consider important. Using literature concerning place attachment and community attachment, students developed research questions that enabled them to select and explore one aspect of this larger project. Students conducted interviews of participants using a script provided by Anita Perr. They investigated the transcribed transcripts for themes and details related to their research questions. The aim of this project is to eventually identify how people with disabilities view attachment- is it accessibility, is it services, is it community activism, is it cultural resources, etc. The long term plan for this project is then to identify how an occupational therapist might be able to foster community integration by people with disabilities.    Study: Serial Effect and the Generation Effect in Multiple Sclerosis and Healthy Controls.    Mentors: Hali Wood and Yael Goverover    This study examined the interaction between the Serial Position Effect and the Generation Effect in people suffering from Multiple Sclerosis. The Serial Position Effect is the tendency to remember the beginning and ending portions of a list, but to forget the middle section. There have been studies to map the cognitive profile of the Serial Position Effect in people with Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, but as of yet it has not been evaluated in the MS population. It has been hypothesized that people with cognitive impairments resulting from MS would benefit from learning with the Generation Effect. The Generation Effect is the phenomenon that information is remembered better in comparison to information that is provided or given. It was of particular interest to this research to see if the Generation Effect would play a role in amelioration of the Serial Position Effect in people with MS. This study sought to map the cognitive profile of the Serial Position Effect in people with various levels of cognitive impairments (participants with MS and healthy controls). In this study students recruited 10 healthy participants between the ages of 18-60 and were involved in the administering of cognitive tests.    Study: An Examination of the Benefits of Combining Two Learning Strategies on Memory of Functional Information in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis and Healthy Controls.    Mentor: Yael Goverover    The Spacing Effect is a phenomenon in which one's memory and learning is improved when learning trials are distributed over time (spaced presentation) compared to consecutive learning trials (massed presentation). Self-generation is another learning strategy where individuals are asked to produce their own words or concepts to improve their learning and memory. Students sought to examine the effect of the combination of generated and spaced conditions on learning and memory in comparison to massed and spaced conditions alone. They hypothesized that the combination of those two learning strategies would yield significant results in terms of learning and memory. For this project, students recruited five participants between the ages of 45-60. Students were also involved in the administration of cognitive tests and functional info ration related to the topic of the study.    Study: An Investigation of Different Problem Solving Skills and the Effects of Physical Symptoms on Cognitive Performance.    Mentor: Gerald Voelbel    The purpose of this project was to examine the relationship of planning and problem solving skills to a task of hypothesis testing and common physical symptom complaints that are associated with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). The Tower of Hanoi and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test are both considered measures of executive function. The Tower of Hanoi is a cognitive task that requires planning to solve the puzzle. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test is a measure of hypothesis testing. The Tower of Hanoi does not require immediate feedback for each step; however, after each step during the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test the participant is given immediate feedback. It is unclear if physical complaints commonly associated with TBI moderate this relationship. This study investigated the relationship between two common clinically useful executive function tasks and how that relationship can be affected by physical complaints. This study collected data from 20 healthy adults above the age of 18.    Study: Development of a Self-Report Questionnaire of Activities of Daily Living.    Mentor: Gerald Voelbel    This project developed a questionnaire that assessed cognitive impairments that can lead to a lack of participation of activities of daily living (ADL). A recent study by Gerald Voelbel and colleagues demonstrated that in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis, poorer cognitive planning skill was related to the level of assistance needed to complete ADL, such as cooking, managing bills, and taking medications. However, the amount of effort required to assess the level of assistance needed during ADL may be decreased with the development of a questionnaire that allowed participants to self-report assistance levels. This project included performing a literature search of relevant research articles and developing a questionnaire that could assess participation and level of assistance needed during ADL.    Study: The Effectiveness of Life Review and Listening-Responding in Decreasing Depressive Symptoms in the Older Adult.    PhD Candidate mentor: Tracy Chippendale    The research question for this study was, \"What are the effect(s) of life review and listening responding on depressive symptoms in the older adult?\". Students were required to write a theoretical base for the study with a focus on Erik Erikson's last stage of social development. A literature review followed that examined research supporting the effectiveness of life review on decreasing depressive symptoms in older adults. The second part of the project entailed conversations with older adults to determine their interest level in a workshop on life review, as well as information on barriers to participation and incentives for participation. The data gathered will help the primary investigator recruit participants for the study.    Study: Study of Hand Size and Joint Hypermobility in Healthy Young Adults.    Faculty Mentor: Jane Bear-Lehman PhD Candidate: Siaw Chui Chai    This study sought to explore the differences in hand size measurement and the incidence of joint hypermobility, primarily the elbow, hand and fingers in healthy young adults.

Study: The Role of the Occupational Therapists in Inclusive Classrooms of New York City    PhD Candidate mentor: Chiao-Ju Fang    This project focused on the roles and responsibilities of school-based occupational therapists (OTs) working in New York City public school institutions. The questions in this study were: 1) What is considered best practice in occupational therapy for inclusion in New York City? and 2) What steps do we, as staff members, need to take to get there? This project utilized interview data obtained from occupational therapists who work in inclusive classrooms in New York City, to obtain a context-rich picture of current experiences.       Fall 2008    Jane Bear-Lehman , Associate Professor and Department Chair, taught the two-semester course sequence, E40.2724 Occupational Therapy Research: Project Design (summer 2008) and E40.2725 Occupational Therapy Research (fall 2008). This sequence was comprised of guided research projects for students in addition to lectures and laboratory sessions. Below is a sampling of the group projects presented during the summer and fall of 2008 by Professional Program students.    Study: To what extent do individuals who have had total knee or total hip replacements use the adaptive equipment provided to them during their rehabilitation at The Burke Rehabilitation Hospital?    Faculty Mentors: Sally Poole Clinical Mentor: Serena Berger (Burke) Students: Friedman, Daniella; Miller, Melissa Jennifer; Rabinovich, Asya    Patients at Burke Rehabilitation Hospital, White Plains, New York are given a package of adaptive equipment to facilitate their adherence to safety precautions during the post-operative period following knee or hip joint replacement surgery. This study sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of providing adaptive equipment to hip arthroplasty patients. The therapists at Burke have collected data about both the kind of equipment issued and also about how this equipment is used by patients at home. Thus, students at NYU performed data analysis using SPSS in order to learn which pieces of equipment were used more often than others, and whether factors such as age, gender or body traits were relevant to the use of the equipment.    Study: Ongoing Program Evaluation and Development: NYU Entry-Level OT Program - Perceptions of Older Adults.    Faculty Mentors: Karen Buckley and Sally Poole Students: Fried, Elisheva; Klein, Sarit; Moskowitz, Elisheva; Muller, Erica    Students assessed how the entering professional OT class perceived older adults. A survey was developed by selecting questions (from an established AOTA survey) pertaining to attitudes towards working with older adults and beliefs about older adults. The survey was administered using the electronic survey tool Zoomergang, data was collected, and analyses were performed as part of this initial phase of the ongoing program evaluation project.    Study: To what extent are hand strength outcome scores influenced by knowing what the score is while engaged in voluntary isometric contraction against the instrument?    Faculty Mentors: Jane Bear-Lehman PhD Candidate: Gwen Weinstock Students: Elbogen, Risa; Reisman-Rothberger, Cheryl; Weinstein, Chana; Schoenfeld, Rachelle    This study explored the impact of visual feedback on grip strength scores. The hand-held Jamar dynamometer is commonly used to assess hand strength. This hand-held tool is designed such that the outcome score cannot be visually seen while the test is underway. Alternatively, the Jamar hand-held pinch meter allows for the host to see how the gauge advances during the voluntary squeezing effort. The study sought to investigate to what extent scores are higher when the host can monitor the gauge compared to when the gauge cannot be monitored. Two testing scenarios were set up: one that allowed for feedback during the test administration, and one that did not allow feedback during testing.    Study: What is an effective way to measure thumb opposition?    Faculty Mentor: Jane Bear-Lehman Clinical Doctoral Student: Pamela Lawton Students: Braham, Susan; Carbo, Janelle    The traditional method of using a ruler to measure the completion of thumb opposition is the primary method that therapists rely on to document and chart the progress of those who have impaired movement at the CMC joint. A new tool has been designed and marketed for the measurement of thumb opposition. This study looked at the utility of this new tool in a sample of normal adult women and a sample of women who have experienced injuries affecting their CMC joints and are undergoing treatment in NYC.

Japan, on the other hand, already   boasts the world's lowest infant mortality rate and longest life   expectancy, while achieving more success than America at containing   medical costs: in 1991, spending on health care accounted for a mere   6.6 percent of Japan's total gross domestic product versus 13.4 percent   of America's. How does Japan do it? What aspects of the Japanese model   might be applicable to the United States?     To explore these questions, on Friday,   April 30, 1993, the Japan Society organized a one-day conference entitled   Making Universal Health Care Affordable: How Japan Does It. Three   distinguished panels of Japanese and American health care specialists   discussed the management of Japan's universal health care coverage, ways   to balance quality care and cost containment, and how the United States   might profit from Japan's experience. Professor Victor Rodwin was one of   the conference participants (see Appendix 3) and agreed to draw on the   conference discussions as a starting point for this more extensive   monograph.     The Japan Society is grateful to KPMG Peat Marwick; New York Pharma   Forum; the International Leadership Center on Longevity and Society (U.S.)   of The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, an affiliate of The City   University of New York; the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare; and   the New York Academy of Medicine for their generous support of the   conference and this publication.

William H. Gleysteen, Jr.   President, Japan Society                FOREWORD  by Marianne C. Fahs, Ph.D.   Associate Professor and Director  Division of Health Economics  International Leadership Center on Longevity and Society (U.S.)  Mount Sinai Medical Center        International study is gaining recognition as a useful method of   inquiry into questions of how best to allocate national resources to   improve health. Yet policy analysis of the Japanese system of health care   remains underdeveloped.. Indeed, serious debates regarding health care   reform strategies for the United States often exclude references to   Japanese health care delivery and financing. This exclusion is   unfortunate and obscures some outstanding successes of health policy in   Japan. For instance, in only 20 years and starting from a level similar   to the United States, Japan has achieved the lowest infant mortality rate   in the world. The United States remains 19th among developed nations.   Japan became the world's leader through a well-thought-out plan for   prevention, coupled with government investment. Now, Japanese policy   leaders are turning their attention to the elderly.     The United States and Japan face similar   problems. Both countries face a demographic revolution in the decades   ahead as the population ages. Medical expenditures, as a proportion of   GNP, are increasing at similar rates. Both governments face fiercely   competing demands for resource allocation among prevention, treatment and   basic science interest groups. Both medical care systems face a diverse   mix of patients with increasing rates of functional disability. Both   systems are financed by a large number of employer-based private insurance   plans in addition to public insurance for the poor and the elderly.     In this information era, we face a world   hungry to know what works in health care and what it costs. One of   medicine's great challenges is to inform policy-makers and the public of   long-term produc tive benefits and costs to our society of preventing and   postponing disability. Many initiatives in the United States will require   fundamental change. The most cost effective will be those targeted with   sensitivity and respect for cultural tradition to reach the myriad of   groups in our pluralistic society. Enlarging our understanding of   socio-cultural patterns of health behavior, disease and economic   productivity and costs calls for increasing international communication   and research partnerships.     Professor Rodwin and his associates provide an   excellent overview of the health care system in Japan. This comprehensive   and well-documented monograph will serve as an essential reference for   policy leaders and researchers alike who are interested in pursuing   comparative policy analysis. The Japan Society is to be commended for   organizing this timely conference. Professor Rodwin, a leading expert in   the comparative analysis of health systems, has taken the conference   presentations and discussions and used them as a springboard for his own   further investigation of political and economic aspects of Japan's health   care system. In this monograph, he presents a clear and well-organized   perspective on what the United States can learn from Japan. Let us hope   that the challenges Professor Rodwin raises will be met in the years   ahead as we pursue health care reform to achieve the goals of   effectiveness, efficiency and equity.           INTRODUCTION         Japan's health care system is characterized by   universal coverage, free choice of health care providers by patients, a   multi-payer, employment-based system of financing, and a predominant role   for private hospitals and fee-for-service practice. Virtually all   residents of Japan are covered without regard to any medical problems   they may have (so-called predisposing conditions) or to their actuarial   risk of succumbing to illness. Premiums are based on income and ability   to pay. Although there is strong government regulation of health care   financing and the operation of health insurance, control of the delivery   of care is left largely to medical professionals and there appears to be   no public concern about health care rationing.     Like the Australian, Canadian and many European health care systems,   Japan's national health insurance program is compulsory. But Japan   surpasses all 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic   Cooperation and Development (OECD) in life expectancy at birth and also   has the lowest infant mortality rate (Appendix 1, Table 1). 1   It achieves these successes at a cost of only 6.6 percent of gross   domestic product, $1,267 per capita - half that of the United States   (Table 1)  .     Japanese-style national health insurance raises a fascinating   question: how has Japan reduced financial barriers of access to medical   care and achieved a No. 1 ranking on health status at a cost that is   among the lowest of wealthy industrialized nations? 2 In   addressing this question, we begin with a comparative analysis of health   care resources and the use of medical care in Japan, the United States   and other OECD countries. Next, we review the financing and organization   of medical care in Japan, evaluate some strengths and weaknesses of the   health care system, and explore possible lessons for health care reform   in the United States.      In adopting this comparative approach to   health care reform in the United States, we have relied on an extensive   review of the English-language literature on Japan's health care system   and on information presented at the Japan Society's April 30 conference,   \"Making Universal Health Care Affordable: How Japan Does It.\" 3   We do not presume to have analyzed Japan's health care system in depth.   For example, we remain intrigued by Japan's exemplary health status and   by such societal values and traditions as egalitarianism and consensus-  building upon which the health system is built. We have aimed, in earnest,   to raise more questions than we are able to answer. We hope that these   questions may lend a sense of perspective to the on-going public debate   on health care reform in the United States.    NOTES:    1 For comparisons between Japan and the other OECD countries,   see the Tables in Appendix 1.    2 This is a reference to Vogel's (1979) classic book, Japan as   Number One: Lessons for America. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press).    3 We also refer the reader to a previous monograph on health   and medicine in Japan and America based on a conference organized by the   Japan Society in 1978 (Reich and Kao, 1978).                  HEALTH CARE RESOURCES AND  UTILIZATION        Japan has 15.8 inpatient hospital beds per   1,000 persons, the highest number among OECD countries and more than   three times the American ratio (Table 1) . By contrast, with 1.6 physicians   per 1,000 population, Japan has the fifth lowest physician-per-person   ratio, 43 percent less than the American rate of 2.3 per 1,000 (Table 1) .   Japan also has one-half to one-third the American number of intensive care   beds per capita (Table 1) . And Japan is tied with Austria for the lowest   hospital staffing ratio (that is, the number of employees per bed) among   OECD countries (Appendix 1, Table 3).     As for the use of these resources, at 8.3   percent, Japan admits a smaller proportion of its population to hospitals   every year than any other OECD country except Turkey, a rate barely over   one-half that of the United States (Table 1) . On the other hand, of all   OECD countries, at 50.5 days, Japan has the longest average length of   stay for inpatient hospital services, more than five times that of the   United States (Table 1) .     Although Japan has one of the lowest   physician-to-population ratios among OECD countries (Appendix 1, Table 3),   at 12.9, Japanese doctors have the highest number of physician contacts   per capita, more than twice the American rate . It must be noted, (Table 1)  however, that the average length of a physician visit in Japan is only 6.9   minutes, compared to over 20 minutes in the United States. 1     To the extent that OECD data are available on hospital admission   rates for selected procedures, with the exception of appendectomies,   Japan's rates are lower than those in the United States (Table 2). 2   Comparative survey data indicate that surgeons in Japan perform fewer   than one-fourth the number of operations per capita that their colleagues   in the United States do (Table 1) . 3 This pattern is supported by findings   on cesarean section rates, which are half as frequent in Japan as in the   United States. 4 The United States is known abroad for its unusually high   cesarean section rate.     It would be wrong to conclude from these data   that Japan rations high-tech medical care. On the contrary, among OECD   countries, Japan has the highest number of computerized axial tomography   (CT) scanners per capita, the highest number of extra-corporal shock wave   lithotriptors per capita, and the highest number of patients per million   treated for end-stage renal disease failure. 5   In addition, Japanese spend more than any other nation on drugs as a   percent of total health expenditures, more than twice the American   rate. 6     Japanese doctors' clear preference for non-invasive procedures is   demonstrated by the kinds of medical technologies imported and exported.   Equipment requiring invasive operations (e.g., pacemakers and artfficial   heart valves) is almost all imported, whereas diagnostic equipment   (e.g., CT scanners) is produced in Japan and exported in large   quantities. 7     In contrast to the United States, Japan's low   rate of hospital admissions (Table 1) reflects its tendency to emphasize   ambulatory over inpatient hospital care. 8 But once hospitalization   occurs, as we have seen, Japan holds the OECD record for long lengths of   stay and low hospital staffing ratios (Appendix 1, Tables 3 and 4). This   is encouraged by a reimbursement system that pays hospitals on a per   diem basis and a style of medical practice that emphasizes bed rest and   complete recovery while a patient is still in the hospital.     Beyond these more measurable differences in   resource availability and use of medical care in Japan and United States,   there are a host of political-institutional and cultural factors that   reinforce each health care system's distinctiveness. The United States is   a federal system whose 50 states have significant autonomy on matters of   health insurance and public health policies. Although the federal   government exercises a dominant role over the Medicare program and   regulatory aspects of health policy, Americans are multiethnic,   suspicious of excessive governmental authority and inclined to solve   social problems at the local level. Japan is a centralized, unitary   state with a highly homogeneous population and a tradition of powerful   state intervention in the economy, including its many health insurance   plans.

In Japan in  1991, there were 945 patients per million treated for end stage renal  disease failure in contrast to 784 in the United States (OECD Health  data file, 1993).    6 lglehart (1988) reports that in 1981  reimbursement for drugs by Japanese health insurance was equal to 38.7  percent of all health expenditures and that in 1987 this figure dropped  to 28 percent. More recent data from OECD Health Systems: Facts and  Trends (Paris: OECD, 1992) indicate that this figure has dropped to 18.4  percent, in contrast to the U.S. figure of 8.3 percent. However, these  data exclude pharmaceutical expenditures for inpatients, which are  substantial. Ikegami (1990) reports that \"about 30 percent of Japan's  personal health expenditures are for drugs,\" which we assume include  inpatient drugs, and supports the contention that the Japanese are among  the highest spenders on drugs.   In terms of pharmaceutical expenditures per  capita, in U.S. dollar pharmaceutical purchasing power parities,  Japanese spent $332 per capita, Americans $182. However, if these  expenditure data are adjusted by GDP purchasing power parities, the  difference narrows: $179 for Japan, $182 for the United States.    7 Ikegami (1989).    8 Ikegami (1992a).

HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE    The evolution of national health insurance    National health insurance emerged in Japan as   the result of a gradual process that can be traced back to 1905, when the   Kamegafuchi Textile Company provided limited benefits for its employees. 1   In the decades that followed, more and more corporations began offering   benefits through mutual aid societies. A health insurance law enacted in   1922 was inspired by the German system established by Chancellor Bismarck   in 1883. As in Germany, this first law extended health insurance coverage   to industrial workers and miners but excluded the self-employed and   employees in companies with fewer than five workers. 2 This law,   implemented in 1927, established the practice of mandating coverage by   enterprises and created an important government role in the provision of   health insurance to those individuals not covered by employers. In 1938,   health insurance was extended to farmers, fishermen, foresters and other   groups not covered by the 1922 law.     After World War II, the effort to rebuild Japan   gave new impetus to the achievement of universal coverage. In 1958, the   1938 law was revised to include the remaining 30 percent of the   population not previously covered. This revision broke the precedent of   extending health insurance to occupational groups by calling for   universal coverage on the basis of residence. Every government   jurisdiction, whether city, town or village, was required to provide   health insurance to every uncovered resident by 1961. Since 1961,   virtually all Japanese have been covered by either employers or the   government.     Health care financing     Health insurance expenditures in Japan are   financed by payroll taxes paid by employers and employees and by   income-based premiums paid by the self-employed. In contrast to the   United States, where the federal, state and local governments finance   roughly 42.9 percent of all health care expenditures and out-of-pocket   payments contribute another 22 percent, in Japan, only 31.7 percent of   national health care expenditures derive from national and local public   funds and 12.2 percent from out-of-pocket payments. The largest share of   health care financing in Japan is raised by means of compulsory premiums   levied on individual subscribers (34.6 percent) and employers (21.7   percent). 3 This employment-based share of health care financing in Japan   (56.4 percent) raised by means of voluntary employer, employee and   individual subscriber premiums in the United States (Figure 1) .     The structure of the national health insurance system    At first glance, understanding the system   seems to be an impossible task. Japan's national health insurance program   is made up of some 2,000 private insurers and more than 3,000 units of   government. The system can be simplified, however, by distinguishing   between two broad groups of beneficiaries (Appendix 2, Figure 1) :1)   employees and their dependents, including some elderly dependents   (65 percent of the population); and 2) the self-employed, unemployed,   elderly and their dependents (35 percent of the population). 4     Ignoring some administrative complexities and   small beneficiary groups, health insurance plans for employees may be   categorized into four groups:       Government-managed plans - These plans provide coverage for the almost 30 percent of the population comprised of employees (and their dependents) of small enterprises with more than five but fewer than 300 employees. These plans are managed by the government's Social Insurance Agency through a network of some 300 local offices. Premium contributions are set by law at a fixed rate (8.2 percent of monthly income before taxes) and evenly split between employees and employers.   Society-managed plans - Known as health insurance societies, more than 1,800 company plans provide coverage for 26 percent of the population. These health insurance societies are managed jointly by representatives of labor and management in enterprises with more than 300 employees. Society-managed plans can be also established by several enterprises employing 3,000 or more employees. Payroll taxes for such plans range from 5.8 to 9.5 percent of gross monthly income. 5 Employers are required to pay at least half of these contributions, and some pay as much as 80 percent.   Mutual aid association (MAA) insurers - Covering almost 10 percent of the population, these include 27 plans for government employees in the national public service, 54 plans for local government employees, and one plan for quasi-public employees like teachers and other school employees. The average payroll contribution of these plans in 8.5 percent of the employee's wage.   Plans for day laborers (for those who work less than two months during the year) and seaman - These independent plans cover only 0.1 and 0.4 percent of the population, respectively.     In addition to the employee groups noted above,   employees in enterprises with fewer than five workers, the self-employed   and retirees are covered either by municipal governments or by national   health insurance societies. Roughly 3,000 municipal governments cover   over 90 percent of such self-employed individuals as farmers,   shopkeepers, their dependents, and a large number of elderly people on   pensions. There are also 166 national health insurance societies that   directly manage plans for certain trade and occupational groups such as   physicians, lawyers, dentists, food retailers, carpenters, and barbers.   Contributions to these national health insurance societies are based on   reported income and assets as well as on the number of individuals per   household.     In contrast to health insurance for employees,   municipal governments and national health insurance societies receive no   direct contributions from employers. Moreover, the self-employed and   retirees earn less on average than employees in large enterprises, so the   government ends up paying slightly less than 50 percent of their health   insurance expenditures - four-twelfths by the national government and one-  twelfth each by prefectures and municipalities. 6 Once the elderly reach   the age of 70 (or 65 if bedridden), since they use the lion's share of   health care resources but do not pay premiums, under the Health Services   System for the Elderly the other half of their expenses are financed by   taxes on premium payments to all insurers of employees and the self-  employed.     Most of Japan's health insurance plans are   private organizations in terms of administrative law; in practice, they   have a quasi-public status insofar as they are largely bound to provide   uniform benefits and to cover all eligible beneficiaries. All employers   with at least five employees are mandated by law to insure them (along   with their dependents). Employers have little freedom to alter premium   levels, which range from 5.8 to 9.5 percent of the wage base. 7 The self-  employed are required to contribute premiums to health insurance plans   that are administered by local governments or trade associations. And all   of these premiums are taxed to finance the national fund which, along   with government subsidies, finances national health insurance for the   elderly.     The extent and regulation of health insurance benefits     Health insurance benefits are designed to   provide basic medical care to the maximum number of individuals. Although   there are exceptions, mandated benefits are similar across the four   groups of employee plans and for the self-employed and retirees. They   include ambulatory and hospital care, extended care, most dental care   and prescription drugs. Not covered are such items as abortion, cosmetic   surgery, most traditional medicine (including acupuncture), certain   hospital amenities, some high-tech procedures, and childbirth. 8   Expenses that fall outside the normal boundaries of medical care are   either not covered, dealt with on a case-by-case basis, or covered by the   welfare system.     Differences between plans include the level of   copayments, the amount of cash benefits, and the extent of cross-  subsidization and government subsidies (Appendix 2, Figures 2 and 3) .   With regard to copayments, all plans for employees have a 10 percent rate   for plan members and their dependents, a 20 percent rate for inpatient   care, and a 30 percent rate for outpatient care. For the self-employed   and their dependents, the copayment rate is 30 percent for both inpatient   and outpatient care. For the retired, the copayment rate is 20 percent,   and for their dependents, the rate is 20 percent for inpatient care and   30 percent for outpatient care. But under Japan's system of catastrophic   health insurance, there is a monthly ceiling for each beneficiary on all   copayments for all health insurance plans. 9 This has limited private   insurance to coverage of copayments. There is, however, a small market   for supplemental benefits that pay for amenities like private rooms.     Health insurance plans for employees provide   cash benefits for extended sickness and injury and for maternity leave   and delivery expenses. National health insurance plans for the self-  employed and retirees provide cash benefits for midwifery and general   expenses. Cash benefits can be substantial. Nearly $2,400 is provided to   cover child delivery expenses under most employee plans, for example. 10   If the mother is the primary beneficiary, the cash benefit may be 50   percent of her monthly salary. Maternity leave amounts to 100 days and is   compensated at 50 percent of a mother's salary in the case of working   women. In the event of prolonged sickness or disability, an individual   collects 60 percent of monthly remuneration for 18 months.     Society-managed plans provide more extensive   benefits in kind. In addition to providing the cash benefits noted above,   74 percent of these plans also have a \"patient cost-sharing restoration\"   program which picks up a portion of the mandatory 10 percent copayment. 11   Society-managed plans are also actively involved in health screening and   promotion. Enterprises own and operate more than 3,500 sanitoriums, 1,000   gymnasiums and 300 health centers, for example. 12     There is thus a widely held perception that   employees of large corporations covered under society-managed plans are   getting a \"better deal.\" There is no evidence that these beneficiaries   enjoy better health status, however. As John Campbell noted at the Japan   Society conference, among all plans, individuals enrolled in society-  managed plans receive the least value back for what they pay. For every   dollar paid in premium contributions, only 62 cents is received in health   insurance benefits. The beneficiaries of government-managed plans receive   84 cents in benefits for every dollar of premiums paid, the self-employed   receive $1.66, and retirees receive $4 to $5. 13     Government subsidies and cross-subsidization between plans   Age and income disparities among health insurance   plans result in an unequal distribution of health risks. Plans that   insure beneficiaries who are older or in higher risk occupational groups   will incur higher costs and therefore often generate deficits. Given the   Japanese commitment to equity, these inequalities are reduced through   government subsidies and cross-subsidization between plans.     With the exception of mutual aid associations   for government employees, all insurance plans receive some form of   government subsidy. Even society-managed plans, for example, receive   government funds (Y4.85 billion in 1992) to defray their administrative   costs. Likewise, government subsidies financed 50 percent of the benefit   payments to self-employed individuals covered by national health insurance    (Appendix 2, Figure 3) .     Cross-subsidization supports the poorer plans.   As noted above, the most generous example is the national pool created as   part of the Health and Medical Service Law for the Aged of 1983.   Government (national and local) provides 30 percent of this special fund,   and local governments another 20 percent. The remaining 70 percent comes   from other insurance plans based upon the total enrollment of retirees in   each fund. 14 As a percentage of their total expenditures, government-  managed plans, society-managed plans and national health insurance plans   contribute 15.4, 20.4 and 24.2 percent, respectively. 15      Provider reimbursement    Under Japanese national health insurance, all   insurance plans pay health care providers low fees by American standards    (Table 3) . The fees must conform to a uniform national fee schedule known   as the point-fee system. For any particular service, the same fee is paid   by all insurers to all providers. As in Canada or Germany, there is no   \"extra-billing\": neither physicians nor hospitals may bill their patients   more than the authorized fee; but illegal side-payments are common and   condoned. All covered medical procedures are ranked by complexity, and   neither geographic location, the institutional setting (e.g., type of   hospital or ambulatory care), the qualification of the provider, nor the   actual cost of the service are considered in this rating system. 16     Medical procedures are assigned a number of   points, each of which is worth 10 yen. 17 Only the basic charges for   hospital room and board services are covered; the costs for additional   hotel amenities are not covered. 18 The fee covers all supplies,   materials, capital depreciation and personnel costs. There is no   flexibility in this system of price controls for insurers or for   providers. Hospitals can bill patients extra only for room and board and   a restricted number of specialized services, for example. 19 As John   Campbell noted at the conference, \"cheap stuff is profitable and   expensive stuff is unprofitable. A doctor who sees a few extra patients   and prescribes drugs for them makes money; coronary bypass surgery at an   urban hospital loses money.\"     &nbspThe Ministry of Health and Welfare sets   the fee schedule. Its Central Social Medical Care Council has 20 members   who represent a cross section of health care interests: eight providers   (five physicians, two dentists, and one pharmacist), eight payers (four   insurers, including government representatives, two employers and two   labor representatives), and four public interest representatives (three   economists and one lawyer). 20 Every other year, this council renegotiates   the fee schedule with the medical profession, but these negotiations are   constrained by a rate cap set by the Ministry to limit the overall   increase in costs. This rate cap results in an effective, if implicit,   global budget for all health care expenditures. 21     NOTES:     1 Kemporen (1990). 2 Steslicke (1989).     3 From a table distributed at the Japan Society conference by Toshiro Murase, president of the Japanese Medical Association.    4 J.

THE ORGANIZATION OF MEDICAL CARE    Hospitals    Despite Japan's relatively high hospital   bed-to-population ratio (Appendix 1, Table 3), the number of hospital   beds is not decreasing Between 1970 and 1988, in fact, it increased by   25.8 percent. 1 This reflects at least five characteristics of Japan's   broader health system First, until the late 1980s, few barriers were   placed on entry into the hospital market in Japan's rapidly growing   postwar economy. Second the organization of medical care in Japan is   heavily centered around hospitals. Third, 81 percent of hospitals are   privately owned, and the) have had few restrictions on their capital   investments. Fourth because hospitals have competed fiercely with one   another, expansion has served as a key strategy to gain a competitive   edge. Finally, al least until the mid 1980s, the Ministry of Health and  Welfare has not played an active role in containing the total number of   hospital beds.     Close to 90 percent of hospital facilities   with 20 or more beds are classified as \"general hospitals.\" The remainder   are mental health facilities or tuberculosis and leprosy centers. General   hospitals are dominated by small, privately owned and operated   \"nonprofit\" facilities. The average number of beds in a Japanese hospital   is 163 -slightly fewer than the 190 in an average American hospital - and   half have fewer than 100 beds. 2 Although the last few years have   witnessed a proliferation of national hospital chains, the majority of   small hospitals continue to be privately owned and managed by physicians   As in public hospitals, physicians in private hospitals are salaried.     With 283 beds, the average public hospital is   larger than its private counterpart. Although 19 percent of hospitals are   public, they account for 33 percent of all beds. About 75 percent of   public hospitals are under the jurisdiction of municipal and prefectural   governments the remainder are national institutions. About 1 percent of   hospitals are owned and operated by quasi-public agencies and   organizations such as the Red Cross, social insurance agencies and   employment related groups.     Despite these distinctions, all hospitals in   Japan tend to be viewed as recuperative centers rather than as merely   therapeutic institutions, Even large teaching hospitals do not limit   themselves to providing acute-care services. Hospitals have traditionally   functioned, in part, as long-term care facilities. Of the nearly 400   hospitals that have more than 500 beds, only about 60 percent have adult   intensive care units, and only 30 percent of them have neonatal intensive   care units, the majority of which have only five to seven beds.     As a result of this orientation, patients in   Japanese hospitals have the longest average length of stay in the world. 3   Even accounting for the lengthy stays of psychiatric patients, the   average patient's stay in a Japanese hospital far exceeds that of most   other OECD countries both in the aggregate and by specific disease   categories (Appendix 1, Table 5). In addition to the nursing home   functions played by hospitals, other factors accounting for the lengthy   stays are probably the large number of beds, the low admission rates, the   per diem form of hospital reimbursement, and the emphasis on recuperation   over invasive medical and surgical interventions.     As is the case with intensive care units,   there are far fewer emergency rooms in Japan than in the United States.   But while Japan has roughly half the population of the United States, it   has only 7 percent of the murders, 2 percent of the reported rapes, and   0.3 percent of the armed robberies, so there would seem to be less of a   need for extensive trauma facilities. 4 In addition, unimpeded access to   health care through the clinic system has the effect of steering   non-urgent care away from emergency rooms. An integrated system of   primary, secondary and tertiary-level emergency facilities appears to   meet the need for emergency and trauma care. 5     As in the United States, university hospitals   in Japan are centers for research, teaching and the delivery of   tertiary-level \"cutting edge\" medical care. In contrast to America's   129 academic medical centers with an average size of 664 beds, Japan   has 131 university hospitals (half of them public) with an average size   of 735 beds. 6 Despite their larger average size, Japanese teaching   hospitals have far fewer inpatient admissions, less than 30 percent of   the American rate. And the 36.2 day average length of stay in these   hospitals far exceeds the 7.9 days in American teaching hospitals. 7     Although Japanese university hospitals   generally incur higher costs, they also have shorter lengths of stay and   higher staffing ratios than other Japanese hospitals. Increasingly, the   public perceives these facilities as preferred sites for receiving   medical care.     A recent innovation for the delivery of   high-tech medical care has been the establishment of officially   designated centers for such procedures as open-heart surgery. This   \"Highly Advanced Medical Technology System\" provides a mechanism by which   new medical devices can receive broader use and evaluation despite their   ineligibility for reimbursement under the normal benefits plan of Japan's   health insurance program. Most often, highly advanced medical procedures   are performed at teaching facilities. 8 For third-party reimbursement to   be awarded, these procedures must now be performed at these centers,   which are required to have appropriate equipment and personnel.     Clinics and Ambulatory Care    Japanese physicians have traditionally   operated on a small scale, working out of their homes to provide health   care services to their community. Although these clinics have typically   provided a low-level intensity of care, many have recently acquired a   wide range of sophisticated medical equipment including ultrasonic   testing and gastrointestinal fiberscopes. 9     Small, privately owned clinics provided most   outpatient services until the 1970s. In addition, roughly 25,000   physicians' offices, equipped with up to 19 beds and also referred to as   \"clinics,\" function as small hospitals. They add 276,000 beds to Japan's   already high number (15.8 per 1,000 persons), thus increasing the total   number of hospital beds by 17 percent. 10     Since the 1970s, clinic physicians have become   concerned about losing their share of primary-care services to hospitals.   Although the number of clinics has increased from about 50,000 in 1955 to   more than 80,800 in 1990, the number of clinics with beds decreased by   almost 20 percent during the 1970s and 1980s. 11 Likewise, although the   number of physicians has increased by 113 percent since 1960, the   proportion of physicians running clinics has dropped from 44.8 percent in   1960 to only 27.5 percent in 1990. 12 This decrease in the number of   clinics with beds and the proportion of physicians running clinics is due   largely to direct competition with larger hospitals in outpatient   services and high land prices that prohibit the establishment of new   clinic facilities. Larger hospitals are attracting both young doctors and   outpatients with their sophisticated technology and services. 13     Despite the competition between clinics and   hospitals, two structural aspects of Japan's health care system appear to   constrain the trend toward specialization and high-tech care and to   promote primary-care services. First, clinic physicians do not have   admitting privileges to hospitals. Second, once referred to the hospital,   many patients do not return to a clinic but continue to be treated by the   hospital's outpatient department. These barriers give clinic physicians   an incentive to put off hospitalization. 14     Beyond the barriers to referring patients to hospitals, two financial   incentives also appear to support primary-care services. First, clinic   physicians are remunerated under the fee schedule each time they write a   prescription for a dispensing pharmacist. Second, they make an average   profit of 26 percent of the reimbursement rate every time they   prescribe - and sell - a drug to their patients. 15 Because pharmaceutical   manufacturers and wholesalers routinely sell drugs to physicians at   prices well below the fee schedule's reimbursement rates, drug sales have   become an important source of profits for clinics. 16     The average net monthly income for clinic   physicians was $22,900 in 1990, while specialists based in private   hospitals earned only $6,300. 17 A 1985 study indicated that revenues and   net profits of clinic physicians vary with the quantity of drugs   prescribed and sold by physicians, the age of the physicians and the size   of the clinic. This finding supports the contention that clinic   physicians maximize their income by prescribing and selling more drugs. 18     Despite clinic physicians' practice of selling   the drugs they prescribe, which strikes most Americans as a blatant   financial conflict of interest, the doctor-patient relationship   presumably is based on trust. Patients are typically told little about   their diagnoses, and doctors explain away problems in \"soothing terms   without necessarily providing precise information about what exactly the   problem is.\" 19 Pills frequently go unlabeled, and patients are not always  told when they are part of an experiment. Such practices were recently   supported by a court decision that doctors need not share the full   details of a diagnosis with a cancer patient. 20     The clinic physician, however, does not provide the kind of primary   health care so often extolled by family physicians in the United States.   Most clinic physicians operate in solo practices without hospital   privileges, thus making it difficult to collaborate with specialists as   well as with peers. Standards of practice, professional competence and   patient care are neither monitored nor evaluated in any formal way.   In addition, as in the United States, Japanese physicians do not   typically subscribe to the idea of \"comprehensive primary health care and   often fail to respect the person as a whole person operating in a complex   social and economic environment.\" 21    Services for the elderly     Since the early 1970s, the elderly enjoyed a   privileged status in the Japanese welfare state. With the economic growth   of the 1960s came demands for the expansion of social benefits that could   not be ignored. In 1973, the government responded to social pressures by   creating an almost free medical care system for the elderly, the national   insurance plan administered by local governments. In 1982, in response to   rising health care costs, the Health and Medical Service Law for the Aged   established the national pooi to subsidize medical care. 22 The government   sought to increase equity in financing by taxing all health insurance   plans based on a formula related to each plan's number of beneficiaries   and past medical expenditures on the elderly. 23     Despite universal coverage under national   health insurance, the range of services designed to meet the needs of the   elderly is limited. In general wards, no distinction is made between   acute and long-term care facilities. 24 A significant fraction of hospital   beds are routinely occupied by elderly people requiring long-term care.   Seventy-five percent of the institutionalized elderly are in hospitals   and clinics, for example, and survey data indicate that 45 percent of   elderly inpatients are hospitalized for more than six months. 25 Due to   the shortage of rehabilitation services, roughly 4.6 percent of the   elderly population is bedridden. 26 In 1987, 34 percent of patients in   Japan's long-term care facilities were bedridden, a striking contrast to   America's 6.5 percent. 27     There are now a growing number of hospitals   specializing in treating and caring for the elderly. There are also three   other types of facilities that serve the elderly in Japan: a small number   of nursing homes (10 beds per 1,000 elderly persons in 1988, in contrast   to 46.2 in the United States in 1985), welfare institutions for those who   need constant care, and facilities providing rehabilitation services. 28   But the relatively limited number of home health aides leads to an   absence of reliable support services. 29 Compared to the United States,   Japan has a far more severe shortage of long-term care services. There   are long waiting lists for admission to nursing homes-applicants commonly   wait for more than a year. 30    In addition to the lack of appropriate institutions   and support services, at least three other factors contribute to Japan's   high rate of \"social admissions\" to hospitals. First, medical practice   generally tends to emphasize passive care and bed rest. Second, a lack of   space at home to accommodate elderly relatives pushes more of the frail   elderly into hospitals and clinics. Finally, women, the traditional care   givers for the elderly, are entering the work force in increasing   numbers. Thus, although some 62 percent of the elderly live with their   children or other relatives, in contrast to less than 33 percent in the   United States, Japan's institutionalization rate (6.2 percent) is   comparable to America's. 31 Where Japan diverges from the United States   and other OECD countries is in its rapidly graying population. In 2020,   26 percent of Japanese will be over 65, compared to 17.3 percent of   Americans. 32 Because there are already about 700,000 Japanese aged 65 and   over (4.6 percent of the elderly population) who are so severely disabled   that they are bedridden or require constant supervision, these   projections impelled government policy-makers to publish the \"Golden Plan\"   and make a commitment to solve this anticipated crisis.     The Golden Plan is a 10-year national   health care and welfare plan for the elderly agreed upon by the   Ministries of Health and Welfare, Finance and Home Affairs in 1989. 33   At the Japan Society conference, Ministry of Health and Welfare   Director-General Nobuharu Okamitsu described it as an attempt to   integrate welfare services, medical care and insurance in a comprehensive   manner. The plan outlines an ambitious set of goals at a projected cost   of $40 billion during the 1990s. This is in contrast to the $11.3 billion   spent in the 1980s.     The plan relies on four principal strategies   to build the infrastructure necessary to accommodate the growing needs of the elderly:       Expansion of existing services by increasing the number of home helpers from 40,900 in 1991 to 100,000 in 1999 and the number of nursing home beds from just over 144,600 to 240,000; 34    Creation of a more diverse range of services by defining the respective roles of corporations and of the national, prefectural and municipal governments;   Decentralization through an increased role for municipalities in the design of programs;   Reduction of fragmentation by developing government entities to provide services, support research, disseminate information and coordinate the regional administration of model projects.      In addition to expanding infrastructure for the elderly, the Golden   Plan seeks to rationalize services. It aims to reduce the geriatric   population of hospitals and to increase capacity in skilled nursing homes   and particularly in new institutions known as geriatric rehabilitation   centers. In addition, it calls for a three-fold increase in   government-employed visiting homemakers, a 10-fold growth in adult day    centers, and a 12-fold increase in respite care centers. If the plan is   implemented, the bedridden elderly will be shifted over the next decade   away from hospitals toward home care support services, informal support  services and nursing homes.     The government has recently adjusted the fee   schedule's reimbursement rates to encourage those general hospitals that   provide mostly long-term care for the elderly to become approved   geriatric hospitals. The fee schedule's per diem rates for long-term care   in general hospitals have been reduced to provide an incentive for many   private, medium-sized hospitals to become chronic and geriatric care   facilities that would be reimbursed on the basis of a more favorable   geriatric fee schedule. 35    Another major change in the reimbursement of medical care for the   elderly was the reinstatement of copayments. When the elderly were first   covered under national health insurance in 1961, their copayments were   set at 50 percent of the allowed fees. Free medical care for the elderly   was established in 1973 and lasted until 1983. When reinstated, the   copayment was kept at a low level, far lower than the pre-1970 levels of   patient contribution. 36 But cost-sharing for care of the elderly has   continued to rise. Moreover, the government is now emphasizing programs   that draw on family resources. In contrast to inpatient services, local   governments now ask the children of residents in nursing homes and   geriatric hospitals to contribute toward the cost of care. 37    NOTES:     1 Statistics Bureau, ( Iryo-Shisetsu Chosa ).

Study: How stress reactions from traumatic hand injuries influence the patient's response to and participation in hand care occupational therapy.    Faculty Mentors: Sally Poole and Jane Bear-Lehman    This descriptive study used the Impact of Event Scale to determine stress reactions and how they could influence a person's ability to participate in therapy. It sought to study whether intrusive thinking and/or periods of avoidance (normal responses to stress) could impact occupational therapy treatment. The study asked a small group of individuals who had hand injuries about the events and circumstances surrounding their injury and their reactions to it. The interviews took place in local hand clinics.    Study: Ongoing program evaluation and development- NYU Entry-Level OT Program-Perceptions of Older Adults.    Faculty Mentors: Karen Buckley and Sally Poole    Students assessed the entering professional OT class regarding their perceptions of older adults in this continuing study. Utilizing an established AOTA survey and the electronic survey tool, Survey Monkey, research students selected questions regarding existing beliefs about working adults, and attitudes towards working with them. The surveys were administered and data collected from the occupational therapy entering and on-going classes. Analyses were performed for the initial phase of this ongoing program evaluation project.

Faculty Mentor: Karen Buckley    As part of NYU's ongoing program evaluation, an electronic survey was administered to students in Level II Fieldwork to provide feedback about how the experiences of Level I influenced them. The research students selected questions that were pertinent to topics required for the Department's accreditation. Surveys were administered and data was also collected from NYU OT graduates. Data analysis was then performed for the initial phase of this ongoing program evaluation project.    Study: What is an effective way to measure thumb opposition?    Faculty Mentor: Jane Bear-Lehman Clinical Doctoral Student: Pamela Lawton    The traditional method of measuring the completion of thumb opposition is with a ruler. Therapists rely on this primary method to document and to chart progress for those who have impaired thumb movement at the CMC joint. A new tool, designed by Hareau has been designed and is being marketed to measure thumb opposition. This inquiry looked at the utility of this new tool on a sample of normal adult women, and on a sample of women who had expressed injuries affecting their CMC joints and were undergoing treatment in NYC.    Study: An Efficacy Study of Handwriting Interventions for School-Aged Children, Grades 1-2.    Clinical Mentor: Karen Roston    Handwriting is the main reason for referral to occupational therapists in school-based settings. Students took part in a research project designed to assess the efficacy of two treatment approaches. In order to compare two interventions, two Handwriting Clubs were established to improve a child's legibility. One focused on practice and the other focused on visually directed activities. The Clubs met 2 times a week for 6-8 weeks for 30-45 minutes, over a range of 12-18 sessions. The NYU students ran the group for visually directed activities and developed a protocol for them, with the help of Karen Roston.    Study: Ongoing program evaluation and development-NYU Entry-Level OT Program-Multi-Cultural Awareness as part of the new curriculum.    Faculty Mentors: Karen Buckley and Sally Poole    This is a follow up study in which students assessed the professional OT classes regarding their multi-cultural awareness and sensitivity. As part of NYU's OT program mission statement, a goal of the program is to educate students to prepare them to work with clients from a variety of racial, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds often differing from their own. Utilizing an electronic survey tool, Survey Monkey, research students selected questions that were pertinent to the topic of multi-cultural awareness and sensitivity. Surveys were administered and data collected from first year OT students. Analyses were performed for the initial phase of this ongoing program evaluation project.    Study: Behavioral-Based Feeding Questionnaire: Baseline Study of Full Term Infants from Ages 0 to 2.    Faculty Mentors: Tsu-Hsin Howe    There is a high incidence rate of feeding problems in infants with prematurity. However, there is no instrument available at the present time to help therapists learn infants' feeding history systematically from their primary care takers, in order to understand feeding problems in context. The first step to creating such an instrument is to develop a questionnaire and to establish its reliability for clinical use. In this project, students were responsible for completing a survey with 20 primary care takers, who had babies under the age of 2 with no premature history. Students had each participant complete two questionnaires: a behavioral-based feeding questionnaire and a parental stress index. Students then analyzed the results of these two questionnaires to examine: 1. the distribution of feeding problems in full term infants from 0 to 2 years old, 2. the results obtained from the parental stress index, and 3. the relationship between feeding problems and parental distress.    Study: Survey of Preferred Interests in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders.    Faculty Mentor: Kristie Koenig    Students sent out a survey utilizing a web-based program that sought to identify how preferred or circumscribed interests (often labeled obsessions or perseverations) are used in school/work, social, leisure, and everyday activities by adults who are diagnosed with ASD. Students also analyzed the data.    Study: Comparison of Children's Participation and Enjoyment of Activities between children with ASD and typically developing children.    Faculty Mentor: Kristie Koenig    Students interviewed an age and gender matched sample of typically developing children (grades K-2), administered the CAPE/PAC questionnaire, and compared the results to those of children with ASD. Students then performed data analysis to assess differences between the two groups. Students also observed interviews of children with ASD conducted by the practicing therapists.    Study: Environmental Affordances and Attachment to Community among Wheelchair Users.    Faculty Mentor: Anita Perr    This project sought to describe the community features that people with disabilities consider important. Using literature concerning place attachment and community attachment, students developed research questions that enabled them to select and explore one aspect of this larger project. Students conducted interviews of participants using a script provided by Anita Perr. They investigated the transcribed transcripts for themes and details related to their research questions. The aim of this project is to eventually identify how people with disabilities view attachment- is it accessibility, is it services, is it community activism, is it cultural resources, etc. The long term plan for this project is then to identify how an occupational therapist might be able to foster community integration by people with disabilities.    Study: Serial Effect and the Generation Effect in Multiple Sclerosis and Healthy Controls.    Mentors: Hali Wood and Yael Goverover    This study examined the interaction between the Serial Position Effect and the Generation Effect in people suffering from Multiple Sclerosis. The Serial Position Effect is the tendency to remember the beginning and ending portions of a list, but to forget the middle section. There have been studies to map the cognitive profile of the Serial Position Effect in people with Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, but as of yet it has not been evaluated in the MS population. It has been hypothesized that people with cognitive impairments resulting from MS would benefit from learning with the Generation Effect. The Generation Effect is the phenomenon that information is remembered better in comparison to information that is provided or given. It was of particular interest to this research to see if the Generation Effect would play a role in amelioration of the Serial Position Effect in people with MS. This study sought to map the cognitive profile of the Serial Position Effect in people with various levels of cognitive impairments (participants with MS and healthy controls). In this study students recruited 10 healthy participants between the ages of 18-60 and were involved in the administering of cognitive tests.    Study: An Examination of the Benefits of Combining Two Learning Strategies on Memory of Functional Information in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis and Healthy Controls.    Mentor: Yael Goverover    The Spacing Effect is a phenomenon in which one's memory and learning is improved when learning trials are distributed over time (spaced presentation) compared to consecutive learning trials (massed presentation). Self-generation is another learning strategy where individuals are asked to produce their own words or concepts to improve their learning and memory. Students sought to examine the effect of the combination of generated and spaced conditions on learning and memory in comparison to massed and spaced conditions alone. They hypothesized that the combination of those two learning strategies would yield significant results in terms of learning and memory. For this project, students recruited five participants between the ages of 45-60. Students were also involved in the administration of cognitive tests and functional info ration related to the topic of the study.    Study: An Investigation of Different Problem Solving Skills and the Effects of Physical Symptoms on Cognitive Performance.    Mentor: Gerald Voelbel    The purpose of this project was to examine the relationship of planning and problem solving skills to a task of hypothesis testing and common physical symptom complaints that are associated with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). The Tower of Hanoi and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test are both considered measures of executive function. The Tower of Hanoi is a cognitive task that requires planning to solve the puzzle. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test is a measure of hypothesis testing. The Tower of Hanoi does not require immediate feedback for each step; however, after each step during the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test the participant is given immediate feedback. It is unclear if physical complaints commonly associated with TBI moderate this relationship. This study investigated the relationship between two common clinically useful executive function tasks and how that relationship can be affected by physical complaints. This study collected data from 20 healthy adults above the age of 18.    Study: Development of a Self-Report Questionnaire of Activities of Daily Living.    Mentor: Gerald Voelbel    This project developed a questionnaire that assessed cognitive impairments that can lead to a lack of participation of activities of daily living (ADL). A recent study by Gerald Voelbel and colleagues demonstrated that in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis, poorer cognitive planning skill was related to the level of assistance needed to complete ADL, such as cooking, managing bills, and taking medications. However, the amount of effort required to assess the level of assistance needed during ADL may be decreased with the development of a questionnaire that allowed participants to self-report assistance levels. This project included performing a literature search of relevant research articles and developing a questionnaire that could assess participation and level of assistance needed during ADL.    Study: The Effectiveness of Life Review and Listening-Responding in Decreasing Depressive Symptoms in the Older Adult.    PhD Candidate mentor: Tracy Chippendale    The research question for this study was, \"What are the effect(s) of life review and listening responding on depressive symptoms in the older adult?\". Students were required to write a theoretical base for the study with a focus on Erik Erikson's last stage of social development. A literature review followed that examined research supporting the effectiveness of life review on decreasing depressive symptoms in older adults. The second part of the project entailed conversations with older adults to determine their interest level in a workshop on life review, as well as information on barriers to participation and incentives for participation. The data gathered will help the primary investigator recruit participants for the study.    Study: Study of Hand Size and Joint Hypermobility in Healthy Young Adults.    Faculty Mentor: Jane Bear-Lehman PhD Candidate: Siaw Chui Chai    This study sought to explore the differences in hand size measurement and the incidence of joint hypermobility, primarily the elbow, hand and fingers in healthy young adults. The study involved the measurement of hand size using a ruler and the measurement of joint range of motion using a goniometer. Subjects of this study were recruited conveniently among NYU students on campus.    Study: The Role of the Occupational Therapists in Inclusive Classrooms of New York City    PhD Candidate mentor: Chiao-Ju Fang    This project focused on the roles and responsibilities of school-based occupational therapists (OTs) working in New York City public school institutions. The questions in this study were: 1) What is considered best practice in occupational therapy for inclusion in New York City? and 2) What steps do we, as staff members, need to take to get there? This project utilized interview data obtained from occupational therapists who work in inclusive classrooms in New York City, to obtain a context-rich picture of current experiences.       Fall 2008    Jane Bear-Lehman , Associate Professor and Department Chair, taught the two-semester course sequence, E40.2724 Occupational Therapy Research: Project Design (summer 2008) and E40.2725 Occupational Therapy Research (fall 2008). This sequence was comprised of guided research projects for students in addition to lectures and laboratory sessions. Below is a sampling of the group projects presented during the summer and fall of 2008 by Professional Program students.    Study: To what extent do individuals who have had total knee or total hip replacements use the adaptive equipment provided to them during their rehabilitation at The Burke Rehabilitation Hospital?    Faculty Mentors: Sally Poole Clinical Mentor: Serena Berger (Burke) Students: Friedman, Daniella; Miller, Melissa Jennifer; Rabinovich, Asya    Patients at Burke Rehabilitation Hospital, White Plains, New York are given a package of adaptive equipment to facilitate their adherence to safety precautions during the post-operative period following knee or hip joint replacement surgery. This study sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of providing adaptive equipment to hip arthroplasty patients. The therapists at Burke have collected data about both the kind of equipment issued and also about how this equipment is used by patients at home. Thus, students at NYU performed data analysis using SPSS in order to learn which pieces of equipment were used more often than others, and whether factors such as age, gender or body traits were relevant to the use of the equipment.    Study: Ongoing Program Evaluation and Development: NYU Entry-Level OT Program - Perceptions of Older Adults.    Faculty Mentors: Karen Buckley and Sally Poole Students: Fried, Elisheva; Klein, Sarit; Moskowitz, Elisheva; Muller, Erica    Students assessed how the entering professional OT class perceived older adults. A survey was developed by selecting questions (from an established AOTA survey) pertaining to attitudes towards working with older adults and beliefs about older adults. The survey was administered using the electronic survey tool Zoomergang, data was collected, and analyses were performed as part of this initial phase of the ongoing program evaluation project.    Study: To what extent are hand strength outcome scores influenced by knowing what the score is while engaged in voluntary isometric contraction against the instrument?    Faculty Mentors: Jane Bear-Lehman PhD Candidate: Gwen Weinstock Students: Elbogen, Risa; Reisman-Rothberger, Cheryl; Weinstein, Chana; Schoenfeld, Rachelle    This study explored the impact of visual feedback on grip strength scores. The hand-held Jamar dynamometer is commonly used to assess hand strength. This hand-held tool is designed such that the outcome score cannot be visually seen while the test is underway. Alternatively, the Jamar hand-held pinch meter allows for the host to see how the gauge advances during the voluntary squeezing effort. The study sought to investigate to what extent scores are higher when the host can monitor the gauge compared to when the gauge cannot be monitored. Two testing scenarios were set up: one that allowed for feedback during the test administration, and one that did not allow feedback during testing.    Study: What is an effective way to measure thumb opposition?    Faculty Mentor: Jane Bear-Lehman Clinical Doctoral Student: Pamela Lawton Students: Braham, Susan; Carbo, Janelle    The traditional method of using a ruler to measure the completion of thumb opposition is the primary method that therapists rely on to document and chart the progress of those who have impaired movement at the CMC joint. A new tool has been designed and marketed for the measurement of thumb opposition. This study looked at the utility of this new tool in a sample of normal adult women and a sample of women who have experienced injuries affecting their CMC joints and are undergoing treatment in NYC.    Study: The influence of Homework and Home Treatment Programs on Family Life.    Faculty Mentor: Jim Hinojosa Students: Eckert, Danielle; Fiumara, Emily; Young, Jessica; Welch, Paula    This study sought to describe and understand the experiences and perceptions of parents and their children about engaging in homework/home treatment. Homework is an activity that most school-age children are expected to participate in and for children with disabilities this may include a home treatment program. Homework is also a common activity in which parent-child friction occurs. The focus of this study was how homework and/ or home treatment programs are experienced and perceived by parents and siblings and how it influences family life. To gain this knowledge, families with children between the ages of 8-11 were interviewed about their homework or home treatment experiences.    Study: An Efficacy Study of Handwriting Interventions for School-Aged Children, Grades 1-2.    Faculty Mentor: Jim Hinojosa Clinical Doctoral Student: Karen Roston Students: Duncan, Celeste; Greenberg, Lauren; Lewin, Rebecca; Strand, Vanessa    Handwriting is the principal reason in school-based settings for referral to occupational therapists. In this research project, students assessed the efficacy of two treatment approaches: an intervention focused on practice and an intervention focused on visually directed activities. In order to compare the two interventions, two Handwriting Clubs were established for improvement of children's legibility. Standardized handwriting assessments were administered by the researchers and the data was analyzed.    Study: Ongoing Program Evaluation and Development: NYU Entry-Level OT Program - Multi-Cultural Awareness as Part of the New Curriculum.    Faculty Mentors: Karen Buckley and Sally Poole Students: Abrams, Dena; Olshanitsky, Russell; Rivera, Odalis Gladys; Kado, Masayo    One goal of the OT program at NYU is to educate students to prepare them to work with clients from a variety of racial, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds. This study assessed the professional OT class' multi-cultural awareness and sensitivity. Questions pertinent to the topic were selected from an established AOTA survey and presented using the electronic survey, Zoomerang. Surveys were administered and data collected from first year OT students. Analyses were performed for this initial phase of the ongoing program evaluation project.    Study: What are the inter-rater and intra-rater reliabilities of the \"Posture and Fine Motor Assessment of Infants\"?    Faculty Mentor: Tsu-Hsin Howe PhD Doctoral Candidate: Tien-Ni Wang Students: Lesin, Rachel; McKenzie, Kesha; Morimoto, Sonoko; Mouldovan, Talia; Pierozzi, Christina    Posture and fine motor assessment of infants (PFMAI) is a clinical assessment designed to help therapists rate qualitative aspects of a child's motor response. In this project, students recruited 6 infants (between 2 and 6 months of age, or a group of 6 infants between 6 and 12 months of age) and videotaped them performing assigned tasks in a naturalistic environment. Students scored infants' performance using PFMAI and analyzed data to determine the reliability of the assessment results.    Study: Feeding Problems in Preterm Infants.    Faculty Mentor: Tsu-Hsin Howe Students: Berkovits, Nurit; Gross, Rochelle; Rekant, Leah; Steinberg, Rachel    This interpretative literature review examined documented feeding problems associated with preterm infants. It relied on printed source material and followed a systematic review format to determine what was known in the current research.    Study: Exploratory study on infants who have feeding problems.    Faculty Mentor: Tsu-Hsin Howe Student: Fary, Mackenzie; Khan, Razia; Lynch, Sarah; Pevsner, Janet; Rosenthal, Rachel    There is a high incidence of feeding problems in premature infants. However, there is no instrument available at the present time to help therapists learn about an infant's feeding history systematically from their primary caretakers. This study developed a questionnaire suitable for collecting such information and established its reliability for clinical use. Students conducted interviews with care takers who have babies under age of 18 months and administered questionnaires.    Study: Study of the Face Validity of the Social Skills Measurement Checklist.    Faculty Mentor: Paula McCreedy Students: Klein, Alexandra; Klymasz, Cristina; Tammam, Dalia; Zheng, Jennie    This study reviewed the Social Behaviors Checklist for face validity and addressed its utility for occupational therapy.

Study: Functional Application of the Spacing Effect    Faculty Members: Yael Goverover , Ph.D., OT, Assistant Professor Students: Patricia Campbell, Linda Huang, Sarah Matthews, and Annsley Miller    This study examined \"spacing effect,\" the phenomena of an individual's learning and memory improving when trials are distributed over time (\"spaced presentation\") compared to consecutive learning trials (\"massed presentation\"). The spacing effect was studied in two functional tasks (paragraph learning and map route learning) in healthy adults.    Study: Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile: Sensory Avoiding Behaviors Related to Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder    Faculty Member: Dr. Mary Donohue, Clinical Professor (retired) Project Advisor: Fran Babiss, Ph.D., OTR, South Oaks Hospital in Amityville, NY Students: Kathryn Magill, Brandon Morris, and Kirsten Seacor    The focus of this study was to determine if individuals who meet the DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder were more predisposed to having sensory avoidant behaviors as well. Understanding these variations in sensory processing patterns could prove essential in determining appropriate interventions for individuals with emotional disorders.    Study: Social Skills and Sensory Regulation in Five- to Seven-Year-Old Boys: An Exploratory Study    Faculty Member: Jane Bear-Lehman, Ph.D., OTR, FAOTA, Associate Professor Students: Rebecca Berg, Ronni Armellino, Lauren Cardoni, and Shannon Mistretta    From the conception of sensory integration theory, anecdotal observations of sensory regulation dysfunction existing concomitantly with social skills dysfunction have pervaded the literature. This study reviewed evaluation reports in boys identified with sensory regulatory behavior in relationship to behaviors derived from the Social Skills Rating System.    Study: Behavioral Indicators Associated with ADHD and Taste Sensitivity: An Exploratory Study    Faculty Member: Paula McCreedy, M.Ed., OTR/L, Clinical Assistant Professor Students: Amy Albenda, Abby Futterman, Marisa Gruber, and Alyssa Wanamaker    The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate whether children displaying indicators of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to demonstrate oral-motor and taste sensitivities. If early detectors of ADHD are established, they can be used as red flags to facilitate in the diagnosis of ADHD.    Study: Social Identity Among Pediatric Occupational Therapists: An Exploration of Organizational and Professional Commitment    Project Advisor: Francine Seruya, M.A., OTR Students: Elissa Pinter, Rachel Rauch, Rachel Waltuch, and Deena Weinstein    The social context of a particular work setting plays a significant role in establishing a therapist's degree of social identity as an individual. With a strong sense of social identity, an individual can experience an increase in the development of their organizational commitment, professional commitment, and job satisfaction. This study compared the job satisfaction of occupational therapists in school and non-school based settings.       Fall 2005    The two-semester course sequence, E40.2724 Occupational Therapy Research: Project Design , taught during the summer of 2005, and E40.2725 Occupational Therapy Research , taught in the fall of 2005 by Associate Professor Jane Bear-Lehman , comprises guided research projects for students, in addition to lectures and laboratory. Below is a sampling of the group projects presented on December 6th &amp; 8th, 2005, by Professional Program in Occupational Therapy students upon completion of the sequence.    Study: Perceptions of Older Adults    Faculty Members: Karen Buckley , Clinical Assistant Professor Students: Geralin Kulpecz, Lauren Landy, Michelle Sanchez    Analysis of NYU occupational therapy students' attitudes toward older adults, for on-going program evaluation and development.    Study: Is There a Difference in Arm Girth when Comparing the Dominant and Non-dominant Arm?    Faculty Members: Sally Poole , Clinical Assistant Professor Students: Eileen Carroll, Kristen Ryan, Jody Sabel, Lily Seigel    Currently, there is no normative data that provides baseline measurements comparing the dominant and non-dominant arm for limb size. This information will be useful clinically when setting goals for individuals who experience a change in limb size due to edema orlymphadema.    Study: Patient Use of Adaptive Equipment After Discharge    Faculty Members: Sally Poole , Clinical Assistant Professor Project Advisor: Serena Berger, M.A., OTR Students: Jennifer DiCaro, Pepie Lapsatis, Michelle Seruya, Kelly Szczerba    Total knee and total hip replacement patients were surveyed on their use of adaptive equipment (either provided to them or available for purchase) following discharge from Burke Rehabilitation Center in White Plains, NY. Our research sought to identify trends and usage patterns among people of varying demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, diagnosis, and body mass index.    Study: Multi-Cultural Awareness of First and Second and Third Year Occupational Therapy Students at New York University    Faculty Members: Karen Buckley , Clinical Assistant Professor Students: Irene Dionisio, Stephanie Freudenberger, Kellee Ng, Tara Pena    Based on the belief that occupational therapy students need to be prepared to work with individuals who have different values, beliefs, and behaviors than those of their own, we conducted a study to take a first look about our own cultural attitudes and self-awareness. Results of the study may be used to influence curriculum or course change.    Study: Is There an Objective Measurement Tool that Can Measure Scar Tissue Density?    Project Advisor: Anita Simons, M.A., OTR, CHT Students: Amy Benjamin, Christy Freja, Sonya Jagtiani, Jihee Chung    The purpose of this pilot study was to survey the current measurement tools available to evaluate scars and whether or not the Durometer is the most objective tool for clinical use.    Study: Parents' Satisfaction with their Children's Assistive Technology Devices and Services Provided by Adaptive Design Association    Faculty Members: Anita Perr , Clinical Assistant Professor Students: Diana Alberti, Mary Holahan, Andrea Johnston, Ruth Siebers    Over the phone, 12 parents completed the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology, version 2.0 (QUEST) regarding their child's assistive technology device and services provided by the Adaptive Design Association (ADA). The ADA is a non-profit organization aimed at providing practical, affordable, and custom-fabricated equipment for children with disabilities. Results showed that the parents were generally quite satisfied with the individual factors of devices and services offered by ADA. Weight was the highest-rated device factor; therefore, the light-weight cardboard used to construct ADA's devices is obviously a strong design feature. A majority of the participants did not receive follow-up services, pointing to a possible area for improvement in ADA's services. Further research is recommended to better understand the effectiveness of ADA's devices and services.    Study: Handwriting: Relationship Between Accuracy and Wrist Position in First and Second Graders    Faculty Members: Dr. Jim Hinojosa , Professor Project Advisor: Karen Roston, OTR Students: Sarah Folland, Allyson Lipton, Patricia Morris, Adina Rogers    Legible handwriting is an essential ingredient for success in school. This study uses the Minnesota Test of Handwriting to determine how wrist position affects the accuracy of handwriting. Fifty-six 1st and 2nd graders from a public school in New York City participated in this research study.    Study: Parental Homework Involvement in Gay and Lesbian Family Structures    Faculty Members: Dr. Jim Hinojosa , Professor Students: Claire Devine, Megan McCartney, Laura Staton, Tara Whyte    This exploratory study examined the amount of time parents spend helping their children with homework. Specifically, the amount of time spent in homework activities by gay/lesbian and \"heteronormal\" family structures were of interest.    Study: Impact of the Spacing Effect on Learning and Memory    Faculty Members: Dr. Yael Goverover , Assistant Professor Students: Jamie Errickson, Lisa Jager, Amy Lichtenstein    This study examined \"spacing effect,\" the phenomena that an individual's learning and memory improves when trials are distributed over time (\"spaced presentation\") compared to consecutive learning trials (\"massed presentation\"). The spacing effect was studied in two functional tasks, paragraph learning and map route learning.    Study: Parasuicidal Behaviors as Measured by the Adult Sensory Profile: A Pilot Study    Faculty Members: Dr. Mary Donohue, Clinical Professor Project Advisor: Fran Babiss, PhD, OTR Students: Kristine Beacham, Natalie Burkley, Natasha Burt, Tierney Frawley    \"Parasuicide\" refers to the nonfatal, self-injurious behaviors often exhibited by individuals who meet the DSM-IV criteria for BPD. The focus of this study is that of self-mutilation. The purpose of the study is to find if there is a link between sensory processing and self-mutilation, with the ultimate goal of incorporating sensory integration into treatment.    Study: Attitudes of Students towards Spirituaity in Occupational Therapy Curriculum and Future Practice    Faculty Members: Dr. Mary Donohue, Clinical Professor Students: Susanna Chan, Katharyn Krokey, Brian Mims, Ellen Quan    Building upon a 2001 study by Collins, Paul and West-Frasier entitled, \"Utilization of Spirituality in Occupational Therapy: Beliefs, Practices, and Perceived Barriers,\" and a study by Taylor, Mitchell, Kenan and Tacker (2000), an interactive survey using the Zoomerang program was carried out examining attitudes of students regarding spirituality in the curriculum at NYU's Department of Occupational Therapy. Perspectives on definitions of spirituality, its place in the domain and practice of occupational therapy, and barriers in addressing spirituality in occupational therapy were studied and can be further researched in the future.    Study: Qualitative Inquiry Regarding Therapists' Perception of Barriers Impeding Returning Veterans' Readjustment to Life Roles    Faculty Members: Dr. Mary Donohue, Clinical Professor Students: Jennifer Castellano, Joselyn Goldstein, Arlene Labeste    Our qualitative study looked at the services provided to veterans that help with their readjustment to previous life roles, especially the role of worker. We interviewed three therapists (1 Army OT, 2 Readjustment Counselors) who have worked with veterans for at least five years to discuss veterans' experiences upon return, including common emotions felt, vocational problems, and barriers to receiving and/or seeking readjustment services.
