How to Prepare Flash and JPEG Files for Happenings Channel            The Happening Channels Audience    Designing a Happening Channel board is like designing for a billboard on the freeway. You have to get you message across in the few seconds they are walking by the screen. Like drivers of cars, they are not likely to stop for an in depth read. You have to assume you have got to get you message across in mere seconds.    Static boards show for 16seconds. Animated boards run the course of the full animation. However, longer is not necessarily better in this situation. If you have a series of events that you want to advertise use the following guidelines in crafting your animated board. Animation Considerations:       Vital information should be persistent on the screen: When, Where, Who, What etc    The Happenings Channel viewer is in transit - they may only see a segment of the animation. It will be frustrating to see something of interest and not know when or where it is.    Keep content to the essentials. The Happenings Channel audience is not going to want to read a lot of detail. Provide a web address, email or phone number for more detail. They will follow up if interested.      Designing for Television Format    Designing for HD format is different than designing for print or web publishing. In this document we will cover margins, backgrounds, color palette, and fonts.    Size and Margins:    The format size for our purposes is in pixels 1920w x 1080h. It is wise to give yourself at least a 90px buffer margin for your document. This will insure that you images are not cut off when broadcast. In Photoshop, you can have title safe guidelines overlaid as you work so you're extra sure. Flash Files   Keep final file sizes relatively small: around 2mb max    Beware that large files will cause the displayed board to run slower then on a local machine. This is due to bandwidth and processing power constraints of the system.   Import images/artwork at 72dpi. TV format does not display any higher resolution. A higher resolution image will not look better. It will only increase your file size and potentially slow down the animation of the board.   Use a sound track for pacing. The Happenings Channel does not play sound. However, putting in a sound track on a heavily animated file will help improve the pacing. This does not guarantee the heavy animation will play at your expected pace, but it's helpful during the editing process.     All animations must be in SWF format. The software we use only works with jpeg, gif and swf files.    If you have your full animation as a QuickTime, Aftereffects, or Final Cut file it will need to be converted and embed as a QuickTime (MPEG-4 codec) in Flash and saved as a swf.       Background:    Use the following guidelines:        Dont over power you background.    Be conservative with your use of screened images.    Remember this is not a static page, the boards rotate every 16 seconds, and so views dont have the time or inclination to try to decipher the announcement.     Color Palette    TV is a low resolution medium and it has a limited color palette that it can accurately handle. Like browser safe colors for the web, there are safe colors for TV broadcast.    Use the following guidelines when choosing colors:       Avoid large amounts of bright colors, especially pure white or intense red backgrounds.    Avoid heavily saturated colors, especially reds and yellows.    Keep the luminance values of text and background as far apart as possible. This provides easier readability.

When designing a board, keep in mind that you need fonts with substance and clarity. Sans-serifs, like NYU's signature font, Gotham, work best on the screen. A serif font that has heavy, thick serifs wont disappear on the screen - this is known as a slab serif. For more information on the differences between sans-serif and serif fonts, we recommend this infographic .    Size is also a factor. You want a font that is at least 16pts or larger. If you use a thin or script font make sure it is large enough to be readable.   If you're stuck on your font choice, there are a few fonts that we recommend:     Sans-Serif       Gotham    Arial    Verdana    Helvetica    Futura    Univers    Optima     Officina Sans     Stone Sans     Avant Garde     Eurostile          Serif Fonts       Bevan     Clarendon     Stone Serif     Bitter     Officina Serif     Rockwell     Josefin Slab     Copse"}]},

Standards for these renovations have been carefully designed by the classroom standards committee based on data collected from Stern faculty members and research in learning and instructional design. The following table lists room enhancements considered by the committee. Each classroom at a minimum has a standard podium with a networked PC, Wi-Fi, laptop connection, and standard video recording capability. Please review the table below for additional classroom enhancements and their design to facilitate in-class activities.                 Feature      Enhancement      Facilitated in-class activities              Collaborative Layout      Low-tiered floor allows students to rearrange themselves and furniture around the room. Students can see the instructor and presentations clearly, as well as hear each other.                 Allows for student-centered class discussion with instructor guidance.       Allows for collaborative pair and group activities.                        Document Camera      Document camera projects color images of tangible media (books, newspaper articles, etc.).                 Instructors can display and present student work providing an opportunity to view student conceptions and provide immediate feedback.       Instructors can display (or enable students to display) relevant print media to the class.                        Dry-erase Wallpaper      Whiteboard wall paper around the room lets students make their thinking visible to each other and the instructor during collaborative activities.                 Students can co-construct solutions to problems that are shared with others.       Provides opportunity for instructor to see student (mis)conceptions and provide immediate feedback.                        Dual Projection      Two side-by-side projectors can easily present two different items at once. Any two podium devices can be projected simultaneously.                 Instructors can simultaneously present examples and theory or different perspectives to clarify new concepts.       Instructors can simultaneously present images and text that represent the same concept for different types of learners.                        Echo360 Classroom Capture System      Records and synchronizes lecture with output of projected media so students can easily navigate through an indexed recording. Upon request, inks to the lecture are automatically posted to Blackboard.                 Students can easily review topics from recordings.       ESL students have multiple opportunities to view the lectures.                        Movable Chairs      Freestanding chairs allow students to rearrange themselves around the room. In auditoriums, movable desks.                 Allows for collaborative pair and group activities.       Movable desks allows for comfortable note-taking space in this auditorium style classroom.                        Power Outlets      Power outlets are outfitted at every student desk allowing instructors to plan class activities that leverage the new mandatory student laptop policy.                 Students can co-create presentations, perform in-class research, and use tools for problem-solving.       Students can also follow an instructor's computer activity (learning by doing).                        Student Microphones      In select large classrooms students have push-to-talk microphones at their desks.                 Students can engage in clear class discussions.       Provides high quality audio recording that includes both instructor and student participation .                        Tablet      The monitor at the podium has tablet functionality allowing instructors to save annotations to media presented through the podium computer.                 Instructors can work out examples making their expert thought-processes visible to students in a way that can be saved and re-accessed for review.       Presentations are made more dynamic and can be customized according to a particular class discussion.
