All first-year students are required to register for a CAS Freshman Seminar in either the fall or spring semester of their first year as part of the CCP. The Seminar does not need to have any connection with your anticipated field of study or future career.   The variety of Seminars spans the full range of the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. The Seminars are small, intellectually stimulating classes that are taught by extraordinary faculty who are leaders in their fields.   Unless noted as \"Spring 2015\", the seminars below are offered in the Fall 2014 semester.   You can find syllabi for many of the seminars here . A syllabus outlines readings, assignments, and topics for the semester, and often includes a breakdown of how final grades are calculated. Make sure the seminars you select are a good match for you.        Telling Their Own Stories: The Irish in New York City   FRSEM-UA 540   Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   This interdisciplinary seminar focuses on oral history as a resource for understanding the 20th century history of the Irish in America, particularly in New York. Students will explore the discipline as it has progressed over the last twenty years, developing their own research, writing, and interviewing skills along the way and enjoying access to the 300+ interviews in Glucksman Ireland House's Oral History holdings in the Archives of Irish America. The course will demonstrate how oral history gives life to ethnic communities like those of the Irish longshoremen who worked Chelsea Piers in the West Village before it was an entertainment destination, personalizes dramatic events like 9/11, or provides insight into to why John Patrick Shanley wrote Doubt . In addition to traditional texts, we will listen to and conduct interviews, read Irish-American fiction, walk the streets of the communities we study, and screen films and documentaries exploring the lives of Irish Americans. This course will introduce students not only to oral history but to the history of the Irish in America.   LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America. Her book Irish Immigrants in New York City, 1945-1995 compares the experience of the Irish who arrived in the 1950s with that of their counterparts thirty and forty years later. Professor Almeida has published chapters in The Irish World Wide , Ireland in the 1950s , and Making the Irish American , and has delivered papers on pedagogical approaches to oral history to both the Oral History Association and the International Oral History Association. Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives.   Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism   FRSEM-UA 488   Instructor: William Ambler   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT  ( Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.- 4:45  p . m . ) and Physics I RCT ( Wednesda y, 2:00 p.m.-3:15p.m.).    This course studies the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the 17th century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in ways that gave visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. We set the portraits in the context of debates that preoccupied the European courts of the time: the Reformation; the dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. We also consider the position of artists at a royal court and preexisting traditions of royal imagery.   WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth-century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there, as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.   Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice   FRSEM-UA 484   Instructor: Ulrich Baer   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15p.m.).   This seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship\u2014the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Topics include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of New York City as an international city that has turned its diversity into strength. The seminar brings in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and asks students to consider how their own actions\u2014ranging from activism to business leadership\u2014may have an impact on those outside their immediate world.   ULRICH BAER, Vice Provost of Arts, Humanities, and Multicultural Affairs and Professor of Comparative Literature and German, was awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1998 and 2004. He is the author of Remnants of Song: Trauma and the Experience of Modernity in Charles Baudelaire and Paul Celan and Spectral Evidence: The Photography of Trauma ; editor of the literary anthology 110 Stories: New York Writes after September 11 ; and editor and translator of The Poet\u2019s Guide to Life: The Wisdom of Rainer Maria Rilke . He has also published widely on photography and has co-taught a seminar entitled \u201cArchive, Image, Text\u201d with Professor Shelley Rice from the Tisch School of the Arts.   Game Theory and the Humanities   FRSEM-UA 506   Instructor: Steven J. Brams   Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-7:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15p.m.).   Game theory is a mathematical theory of strategy that has been applied to the analysis of conflict and cooperation in such fields as economics, political science, and biology. In this seminar, we discuss more unusual applications\u2014to history, literature, philosophy, the Bible, theology, and law. We discuss Abraham\u2019s decision to offer his son Isaac for sacrifice; the choices made by accused witches and their persecutors in medieval witch trials; Lady Macbeth's incitement of her husband to murder King Duncan in Shakespeare\u2019s play; several strategic games played by presidents and their antagonists in domestic crises (e.g., the Civil War) and international crises (e.g., the Cuban missile crisis), and coping mechanisms used by characters in catch-22 games (including those in Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22 ).   Prerequisite: No mathematical background beyond high school mathematics is assumed, but a willingness to learn and apply sophisticated reasoning to analyze the interactions of players in games is essential. STEVEN J. BRAMS is Professor of Politics at NYU. He is the author of several books\u2014most recently, Mathematics and Democracy and Game Theory and the Humanities \u2014that apply game theory and social choice theory to voting and elections, bargaining and fairness, international relations, and the Bible, theology and literature.

He is an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow and was a Guggenheim Fellow and Visiting Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation.    How We See   FRSEM-UA 497   Instructor: Marisa Carrasco   Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m. ).   Do we see the world the way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is? This course looks at what we know about vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing and provides important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field?   MARISA CARRASCO is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, as well as a former Chairperson of the Department of Psychology. Born and raised in Mexico City, she received her licentiate in psychology from the National University of Mexico and her PhD in psychology (cognition and perception) from Princeton University. She conducts research in cognitive neuroscience, exploring the relation between the psychological and neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and attention. Her papers have been published in the leading scientific journals in the field, and she has won numerous prestigious awards and fellowships throughout her career, such as an American Association of University Women Fellowship, a National Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation, a Cattell Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.   Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos?   FRSEM-UA 306   Instructor: Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda   Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I Lecture ( Monday, 9:3 0 a.m.\u20131 0:45 a .m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lecture ( Monday , 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.).   This seminar focuses on Latin America\u2019s longstanding problems and possible solutions to them. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic governance following independence from colonial rule, and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the slowdown of economic growth in the last 20 years and prospects for a new economic takeoff; the phenomenon of widespread violence, and growing respect for human rights; and how the traditional weakness of civil society is being overcome. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present. JORGE D. CASTA\u00d1EDA is Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth.

He is the author of, among many other books, Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left after the Cold War; Compa\u00f1ero: The Life and Death of Che Guevara; Perpetuating Power; Ex-Mex: From Migrants to Immigrants; and Leftovers: Tales of the Latin American Left (with Marco Morales) He has also written articles for many newspapers and magazines in Mexico, the United States, and other countries.   Literature and Machines   FRSEM-UA 572   Instructor: Nicola Cipani   Thursday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), Physics I Lecture ( Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m. ), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).    Machine metaphors play an important role in modern literature, conveying beliefs, anxieties, shifts, and reflections on key topics, including the nature of consciousness and creativity; the dynamics of desire and gratification; gender roles; the organization of society; the meaning of \u201cnature\u201d; and the function of technology. This course explores different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal; and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines). Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural contexts, primarily from the late 19 th and 20 th century (e.g., Belle \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion. NICOLA CIPANI is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Department of Italian Studies and has been working at NYU for ten years. His interests include reception of antiquity in medieval and early modern culture, Renaissance philosophy, the intersection of verbal/visual forms (such as the art of memory, emblem books, and representations of dreams), and 20 th -century experimental literature. At the Italian Department he has served in the capacity of Director of Language Programs (since 2005), Director of Summer Programs (2011-12), and Director of Undergraduate Studies (2011, 2013).   In Search of Lost Time   FRSEM-UA 503   Instructor: Marcelle Clements   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).   We read Marcel Proust (350 pages per week, in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. At more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is one of modern literature\u2019s most challenging and pleasurable reads, still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, and psychological acuity with a portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity. Though Proust (1871\u20131922) is often cited as France\u2019s greatest novelist, many readers never move past the first fifty pages of his novel, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. However, as its architecture cannot be appreciated until it has been read once in its entirety, we move at a brisk pace through all six volumes; when we read the final volume, we can begin to understand the extraordinarily intimate relationship Proust has created with his reader. In-class creative writing exercises are designed to help with the reading and to expand an expressive, personal response.   MARCELLE CLEMENTS is Collegiate Professor and Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations , a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman , and two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer . Her prizewinning articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications.   Political Theater   FRSEM-UA 476   Instructor: Eric Dickson   Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).      This interdisciplinary seminar offers a survey of political theater, and of the use of theatrical elements in practical politics, from the ancient Greeks to the present. How have dramatic depictions of politics changed over time? In what ways have political plays been used to advance political agendas, both by the powerful and by dissidents and protest movements? To what extent can we understand political speeches and political campaigns as essentially theatrical productions? In a typical week, students will read one full-length play, accompanied by appropriate readings from political science or social psychology. Through these readings, writing assignments, and class discussion, we address the development of different dramatic techniques and forms throughout the history of theater; the co-evolving relationship between politically-themed spectacles and changing ideas about citizenship and political legitimacy; and the political psychology of speeches and campaign techniques. ERIC S. DICKSON is Associate Professor of Politics and a faculty affiliate in the Department of Psychology. His research interests include political communication, election campaigning, political leadership, and identities in politics. His work, which uses both game theory and social-scientific experiments, focuses on the interface between political strategy and political psychology. He also has an extensive background in theater.   Political Cinema and Representation of the \u201cOther\u201d   FRSEM-UA 463   Instructor: Shimon Dotan   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u2013 12:15 p.m.) and with Advanced Ch emistry I recitation (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201310:45 a .m.).   In contemporary war \u201cthe other\u201d is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought, but often as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \u201cthe other\u201d is constructed politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them. SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have received the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive ; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. He has taught filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of America (DGA, WGA).   The Literature of Capitalism   FRSEM-UA 576   Instructor: Thomas Easton   Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20141:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and Physics I Lecture (Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m.).   This course explores how some of the most enduring themes in literature, such as greed, ambition, failure, innovation, prosperity, and opportunity, are reflected in literature about capitalism. Readings are likely to include works by eighteenth-century English essayist Samuel Johnson; children\u2019s book author Horatio Alger and novelist Mark Twain; and contemporary Chinese memoirist Aisling Juanjuan Shen. The nature of property rights, subtle distinctions between success and crime, and the relative value of diligence and luck are other themes we consider. Our discussions about characters and stories are informed by work in economics, ranging from Adam Smith\u2019s writings on productivity and ethics to Thomas Piketty\u2019s writings on income inequality. Weekly essays assigned.   THOMAS EASTON is American finance editor at the Economist , where he previously worked as New York and Hong Kong bureau chief. Earlier in his career, he was the bureau chief for The Baltimore Sun in New York and Tokyo and a senior editor at Forbes . He has taught business reporting and journalism at Columbia\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism. At the Economist , his purview also includes legal coverage. Mr. Easton holds an AB in literature from Brown, an MBA from Columbia Business School, and an MSL from Yale Law School.   Gender, Sexuality and the Law   FRSEM-UA 480   Instructor: Shelley Fischel   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m).   What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? This course explores gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in the spheres of work, politics, and social life. We address such matters as marriage and divorce law, the Civil Rights Act and Title IX, and the unique, perhaps troubling ways that criminal law treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, and sexual orientation. We also address the intersection of these matters with issues of gender identity and sexual orientation. This course offers a history of US sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial, and legislative developments.   SHELLEY D. FISCHEL served as Executive Vice President at Home Box Office, Inc., where she was responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, and labor law matters until her retirement in December 2009. She oversaw all sexual discrimination claims in the company. She received her JD from Columbia University and her LLM from NYU.   Trials of the Century   FRSEM-UA 434   Instructor: Jack Ford    Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).   How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d? What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials, which often act as a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are revealed. This course offers in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century\u201d in the US, approaching each case from a specific angle, from celebrity (the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the trial of O.J. Simpson) to race (the trials of the Scottsboro Boys), politics (the Chicago Seven), and religion (the Scopes Monkey Trial).   JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and nationally recognized trial attorney. Currently a CBS News Legal Analyst, he has had a distinguished career on network and cable television. As a litigator, he successfully handled a number of high-profile cases, such as the Northeast\u2019s first death-penalty trial; one of the nation\u2019s first corporate homicide cases; and the Wall Street insider-trading scandal of the late 1980s. He has also written articles for respected legal publications. The recipient of five honorary degrees in recognition of his professional accomplishments and his extensive public service, he has taught at, in addition to NYU, Yale College and Fordham Law School.   Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature   FRSEM-UA 449   Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld   Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Advan ced General Chem I Lab (Thursday , 2:30 p.m.-6 :45 p.m.).   This seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the Cold War era superspy. We examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how the great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Philip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history.   EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian, as well as an attorney specializing in corporate restructuring. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America. He was the senior consultant for the PBS documentary Make \u2019Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America , has appeared on Fox News, PBS, and WOR and Bloomberg Radio, has written and lectured extensively on entertainment and film, and has produced and hosted tributes to Dick Van Dyke, Eric Idle, Dick Cavett, Alan King, Robert Altman, George Carlin, and Paul Newman, among others. He received his BA from Columbia College and his JD from NYU Law School. He also teaches at Yale College.   The New Worlds of Work and Care   FRSEM-UA 500   Instructor: Kathleen Gerson   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 3:30 p.m.-6:15 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:00 p.m.).   The early 21st century represents a period of immense social change in both the public world of work and the private world of family care. New technologies have blurred the boundary between home and work. New opportunities and pressures have sent more women into the workplace. The \u201cnew economy\u201d has created jobs with more short-term flexibility, but less long-term security. And new options in intimate relationships have created more diverse and voluntary, but less predictable, family bonds. These intertwined shifts are reshaping the daily lives and life pathways of American women and men. This seminar addresses several questions: What does an overview of changes in work, family, and gender patterns tell us about where we are now and where we are going? What are the major dilemmas created by these changes, and how are people coping with these conflicts? What are the implications for the future? And what can we do to enhance the opportunities and limit the insecurities of these new social arrangements?   KATHLEEN GERSON, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Sociology, is a recognized authority on the connections among gender, work, and family life in postindustrial societies. She has held visiting positions at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, the Russell Sage Foundation in New York City, and the Center for the Study of Status Passages in the Life Course at Bremen University, Germany and has won numerous prestigious prizes for her scholarly work. Her books include The Unfinished Revolution: Coming of Age in a New Era of Gender, Work, and Family ; The Time Divide: Family, Work, and Gender Inequality (with Jerry A. Jacobs); No Man\u2019s Land: Men\u2019s Changing Commitments to Family and Work ; and Hard Choices: How Women Decide About Work, Career, and Motherhood .   \u201cLaboratories for Democracy\u201d: Making American Cities Better   FRSEM-UA 456   Instructor: Eric Gioia   Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).   Cities, states, and municipalities serve as what Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called \u201clittle laboratories for democracy\u201d\u2014where ideas flourish and problems get solved. This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action in cities in the US and around the world, particularly those related to improving the urban environment. We study best practices, evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful policies and programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically about issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today.   ERIC GIOIA is an attorney with extensive experience in business, law, and government. He joined J.P. Morgan in January 2010 after serving for eight years on the New York City Council. Prior to serving on City Council, he practiced law at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy LLP, and served in the White House under President Bill Clinton. Professor Gioia holds a BA from New York University and a JD from Georgetown University Law Center.   Is Karl Marx Still Relevant?   FRSEM-UA 413   Instructor: Jeff Goodwin   Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 3:30 p.m.-6:15 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Tuesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15 p.m.), and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   There was a time not so long ago when a critical engagement with the writings of Karl Marx was considered an obligatory intellectual and political rite of passage. No serious intellectual or political activist could not read Marx\u2014whether one ultimately accepted or rejected Marx\u2019s ideas, in whole or in part. Is this still true? Are Marx\u2019s ideas, or some of them, still relevant? Which of his ideas remain important or valuable for people who wish to understand\u2014and perhaps to change\u2014the contemporary world? Which of Marx\u2019s ideas are problematic or pass\u00e9? To address these questions, this seminar critically examines some of Marx\u2019s most important writings, including The Communist Manifesto , The German Ideology , The Civil War in France , and\u2014above all\u2014 Capital , Marx\u2019s magnum opus. In assessing the contemporary relevance of Marx\u2019s ideas, we also read several efforts by Marx\u2019s followers to understand a range of important phenomena, including the nature of the state, current US politics, and the ongoing economic crisis. JEFF GOODWIN is Professor of Sociology. He has written extensively about social movements, revolutions, and terrorism. His books include The Social Movements Reader ; Contention in Context ; Passionate Politics ; and No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945\u20131991 . He is currently writing a book about why states and rebels sometimes employ terrorism as a strategy. He is a winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   What is College For?   FRSEM-UA 474   Instructor: Trace Jordan   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.).   Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open-minded person? To gain specialized knowledge? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career? To make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents\u2019 plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and social goals of higher education and studies issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience in coming years. It also prompts students to be more reflective and purposeful about their own academic choices at NYU.   TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Professor and Associate Director of the College Core Curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement. Professor Jordan is a two-time winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   Social Challenges of Climate Change   FRSEM-UA 212   Instructor: Eric Klinenberg   Wednesday, 2:00-4:40 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15  p.m.).   Climate change is a \u201cwicked problem,\u201d so daunting, complex, and consequential that it\u2019s difficult to comprehend and analyze, let alone solve. It\u2019s also an urgent problem, because in all likelihood we have a limited time frame to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lest we create irreversible and catastrophic changes to the ecosystem that sustains human life. This seminar examines whether and how the social sciences can help us understand the challenge of climate change. We will briefly overview climate science and learn about the rise of \u201cweird weather,\u201d but the core themes of the course concern questions about communication and cognition, cultural values and material consumption, politics and persuasion, mitigation and adaptation, economics and social justice, power and social movements, and the possibility of creating new, more sustainable ways of living on earth. We will dedicate several sessions to Superstorm Sandy and its aftermath, with a focus on the question of how to rebuild a more resilient city and region in anticipation of more extreme weather events.   ERIC KLINENBERG is Professor of Sociology and Director of the Institute of Public Knowledge at NYU, as well as Research Director for the federal government's Rebuild by Design competition. He's the author of the acclaimed books Heat Wave , Fighting for Air , Going Solo , and Modern Romance (with Aziz Ansari). In addition to his scholarship, Professor Klinenberg has contributed to The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, The New York Times Magazine, and This American Life .     Branding: People, Places, Things   FRSEM-UA 422   Instructor: Richard L. Lewis   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT ( Tuesday , 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) , and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.- 5:00 p.m.).   Brands help us avoid making the same decisions over and over by building bridges of trust; it\u2019s reassuring that a visit to McDonald\u2019s is pretty much the same all around the world. Brands provide information, advice, smiles, and community, using a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us. Even brand owners are sometimes uncertain as to how their brand has cemented a relationship with an audience. This course analyzes what makes brands tick: how they\u2019re created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We also examine the dark side of brands\u2019 magnetism. Finally, we examine our budding, personal brands, or reputations, which is how our family, friends, enemies, teachers and bosses evaluate us.   RICHARD L. LEWIS is an independent marketing consultant who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime Managing Director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, and has written two bestselling books about advertising. He has also taught at Yale College.   The Doctor\u2019s Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right   FRSEM-UA 379   Instructor: Michael E. Makover   Thursday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Advanced General Chemistry I Lab ( Thursday, 2:30 p.m.\u20136:45 p.m.).   Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that just because an action or conclusion was correct did not mean that it was right . Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue, affecting patients\u2019 options and care. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \u201calternative medicine\u201d a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly.   MICHAEL E. MAKOVER is Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at the NYU School of Medicine and Attending Physician at the NYU Medical Center. He is also the Chief Medical Officer for a major union. An internist and rheumatologist, he is the author of Mismanaged Care , as well as articles on healthcare quality, ethics, and economics, and is currently writing another book entitled 120 Years Young . He was an aide to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and a spokesman for the American Cancer Society and the New York Heart Association.   Literary Theory and Its Applications   FRSEM-UA 355   Instructor: John Maynard   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   Students in this seminar read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the twentieth century to the present, and learn to evaluate different approaches. They complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis is placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities.   JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English at NYU. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature. He has published books on a variety of subjects in Victorian literature and is editor of Victorian Literature and Culture . His most recent book is on readers and reading. From 1983 to 1989, he served as chair of the Department of English. He likes New York City, New York theater, and bicycling.   Great Science, Fabulous Science, and Voodoo Science   FRSEM-UA 457   Instructor: Allen Mincer   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15  p.m.).   Science is often portrayed as following a very clearly-defined set of procedures: start with a hypothesis, do an experiment and, based on the results, reject the hypothesis or adopt it as a working assumption. The actual process, however, is rarely so straightforward. In addition, the stories as usually told or recorded may differ from what really happened. For most of the semester, we study some famous, some lesser known, and some infamous experiments, mainly in the physical sciences, selected to illustrate intellectual tours de force, sloppiness, error, self-deception, and fraud, and the sometimes murky boundaries between them. Along the way, issues such as the discarding of \u201cfaulty data,\u201d theoretical bias, and probabilistic tools for hypothesis acceptance and rejection are discussed. In the latter part of the semester, we discuss how scientific ideas are evaluated by the media, in the courtroom, and in government.   Prerequisites: students must have taken high school chemistry, physics, and calculus.   ALLEN MINCER, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Physics, specializes in experimental particle physics and particle astrophysics. He is currently a member of the ATLAS collaboration, which is studying the nature of the elementary building blocks of matter at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. His research at NYU has a long, continuous history of generous support by grants from the National Science Foundation. He is co-author of approximately 400 scientific publications, including the discovery of the top quark with the D-Zero collaboration and the discovery of a particle consistent with the Standard Model Higgs Boson with the ATLAS Collaboration. In addition to teaching in the Physics Department, he has taught in the Steinhardt School\u2019s Department of Teaching and Learning, been involved in research in physics education, and has twice been awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   The Writer in New York   FRSEM-UA 367   Instructor: Vincent Passaro   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) , Physics I RCT ( Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).   This seminar presents New York as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer\u2019s crucial powers of observation. We examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings\u2014we try to understand the New York writer\u2019s particular forms of misery and joy.   VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content . His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ , Esquire , Harper\u2019s Magazine , The Nation , the New York Times Magazine , and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller\u2019s Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.   Xenophon of Athens\u2014Cavalry Commander and Socratic Philosopher   FRSEM-UA 514   Instructor: Vincent Renzi   Tuesday, 12:30-3:15 p.m.    Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology II RCT (Tuesday, 12:3 0 p.m.-3:15 p.m.) and Physics I I Lecture (Tuesday  &amp; Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m. ) .   The greatest ancient you\u2019ve never heard of, Xenophon of Athens (c. 425\u2013355 B.C.E.) was a brilliant general, student of Socrates, and renowned author. His heroism leading the army of the Ten Thousand inspired the conquests of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. His political philosophy informed the thought of Cicero, Machiavelli, Franklin, and Jefferson. When knowledge of Greek was still required for admission to college, his fame was ubiquitous, as his writings formed the basis of the pre-college curriculum. Readings, in English translation: Apology of Socrates, Symposium, Memorabilia, Cyropaedia, Cavalry Commander, Anabasis , and the film based on the latter, The Warriors (1979). VINCENT RENZI is Clinical Professor in the Foundations of Contemporary Culture and of Classics, and is a director of undergraduate studies for the College Core Curriculum. A scholar of ancient Greek philosophy, he also has interests in arts and aesthetics and in 19th and 20th century philosophy, and is a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   The Image of Business in American Literature   FRSEM-UA 440   Instructor: Saul Rosenberg   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Ch emistry I recitations (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:1 5 p.m.) and with Advanced Ch emistry I recitation (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201310:45 a .m.).   What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? This course asks how some of the most engaging American writers and filmmakers have treated the central ideas of business from the nation\u2019s founding to the present. How did the idea of \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d fare as the Republic grew? We examine classic mid-19th century writers\u2019 thoughts about \u201cgetting and spending\u201d and reactions to the moral collapse inherent in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later 19th century of the \u201crobber barons,\u201d the rise of the corporation, and the enormous influx of immigrants. For the 20th century, we look at films Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead . The course finishes with reflections on the recent financial crisis.   SAUL ROSENBERG earned a PhD in American Literature from Columbia and degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge. In addition to teaching at NYU, he has taught American literature at Columbia University and the 92nd Street Y, and served as associate editor of Commentary magazine. He is a consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company, the leading management consulting firm, where he manages publishing and knowledge management programs. He writes regularly on books for the Wall Street Journal .   History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S.   FRSEM-UA 437   Instructor: Jack Salzman   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I Lab ( Wednesday 9:00 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.)  and Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.).   This course explores the relationship between history and memory in the United States from the mid-20th century to the present. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Aug\u00e9 argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We consider such events and issues as the response to the Holocaust; internment camps for Japanese Americans; racial segregation; the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima; anticommunism; the Civil Rights Movement; the destruction of the World Trade Center, and genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. We address the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory.   JACK SALZMAN served as the Director of the Center for American Culture Studies at Columbia University and editor of Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies . He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History . Much of his work has been devoted to the relationship between African Americans and American Jews, including Struggles in the Promised Land (with Cornel West) and Bridges and Boundaries , the catalog for an exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York. He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of memoirs by Holocaust survivors. He is writing a book on the impact of the Holocaust on Jews and social justice in the US. Professor Salzman has received the Distinguished Teaching Award and two Fulbrights.   The Cultural Nature of Language   FRSEM-UA 496   Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Chem I RCT (Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.) and Advanced General Chem I RCT ( Friday , 9:30 a.m.-10:45 a .m.).   Whether it\u2019s accents, pronouns, swearing, or spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a social practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don\u2019t (e.g., feral children), we examine speech and silence across a range of societies. We look at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \u201cEnglish Only\u201d), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such as who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and authority. BAMBI SCHIEFFELIN is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Anthropology. A linguistic anthropologist, she is the author of The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children and co-editor of, among other books, The Acquisition of Literacy: Ethnographic Perspectives ; Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory ; and Consequences of Contact . She has also published articles in the preeminent journals of her field. She is completing a book on the impact of Christianity on the language and social life of Bosavi people of Papua New Guinea over the past twenty-five years, and continues research on linguistic creativity and change as evidenced in computer-mediated communication such as IM. Professor Schieffelin received the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2010.   The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America   FRSEM-UA 218   Instructor: John E. Sexton   Wednesday, 6:30 p.m.\u20138:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 6:3 0 p.m.\u20137 :45 p.m.).   Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of church and state; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a twenty-first-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at a high and demanding level.   JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts, and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the US Supreme Court, and has testified frequently before the US Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.   Computational Thought   FRSEM-UA 385   Instructor: Dennis E. Shasha    Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note : conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).   Prerequisites: AP calculus, discrete mathematics, or programming experience Computational technology and methods lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and, regrettably, war. There are very powerful ideas underlying the field that have roots in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and biological computing. The learning style combines straight lecture, interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer programs (in the programming language Python which you will learn). Students make a few presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions to computationally motivated puzzles, the relative power of linguistic descriptions, and their very own simulations of either an auction or a multi-bank elevator. The goal is for students to learn to think about computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges. DENNIS SHASHA is Professor of Computer Science at the Courant Institute of New York University where he works with biologists on pattern discovery for network inference; with computational chemists on algorithms for protein design; with physicists and financial specialists on algorithms for time series; on clocked computation for DNA computing; and on computational reproducibility. Other areas of interest include database tuning as well as tree and graph matching. Because he likes to type, he has written six books of puzzles about a mathematical detective named Dr. Ecco, a volume of the biographies of great computer scientists, and a book about the future of computing. He has also written five technical books about database tuning, biological pattern recognition, time series, DNA computing, statistics, and causal inference in molecular networks. He has co-authored over seventy journal papers, seventy conference papers, and twenty patents. Professor Shasha has also written the puzzle column for various publications including Scientific American .   America\u2019s Role in International Affairs since World War II   FRSEM-UA 405   Instructor: James B. Sitrick   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 3:3 0 p.m.\u20136:15 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15 p.m.).   This seminar explores America\u2019s role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving current foreign policy challenges into the conversation. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan\u2019s classic book American Diplomacy, 1900\u20131950 . Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the CIA; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; US involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; US involvement in the Middle East (particularly with respect to Israel, Iran, and Iraq); the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration.   JAMES B. SITRICK serves as Of Counsel to the international law firm of Baker &amp; McKenzie, which has offices in seventy cities in forty countries. He previously served as chairman and CEO of Coudert Brothers, the oldest international law firm in the United States. His government and NGO service includes extensive work for the Department of the Treasury in drafting international legislation and negotiating treaties with foreign countries. He has also served as secretary general of the World Federation of United Nations Associations. In addition, he serves as a trustee of many American and European cultural institutions, as well as on the Arts and Science Board of Overseers at NYU.   First Amendment Freedom of Expression   FRSEM-UA 235   Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon    Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I Lecture (Monday , 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m .) ,  Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Wednesday, 9:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.), and Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.).   Prerequisites: A score of 4 o r 5 in either AP U.S. History OR in AP U.S. Government and Politics (or equivalent international exam) ; both recommended.   Conflicts over freedom of speech and the press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech and the press, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital social interests. The starting point of this course, which involves both history and law, is the robust debate that occurred in the early Republic over prosecutions for seditious libel (the crime of criticizing the government or public officials). We examine how the Supreme Court has interpreted freedom of expression by looking at a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is Associate Professor in NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. His book Ellery\u2019s Protest: How One Young Man Defied Tradition &amp; Sparked the Battle over School Prayer tells the story of the controversial Supreme Court decision in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in public schools violated the First Amendment. He is currently working on An American Invention: The Founding Generation and the Struggle for Freedom of Speech , to be published by Macmillan. Professor Solomon is a recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a JD at Georgetown University Law Center.   The Problem of Beauty   FRSEM-UA 550   Instructor: G. Gabrielle Starr   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   What is beauty for? It is common in many circumstances to think of beauty as \u201cmerely\u201d beautiful\u2014something nice to have, but an unnecessary add-on to what really matters. This hasn\u2019t always been the case. Beauty has played an important part in philosophy, ethics and theology, and now it is playing an increasingly interesting role in biology, neuroscience, social policy, and design. But what is beauty, anyway? And why should we care? This course explores the role of beauty across a variety of disciplines and across \u201clong time\u201d (not just the period from the ancient world to the present, but even the long time of evolution).   G. GABRIELLE STARR is Professor of English and Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science, she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience . In addition, Dean Starr has just published a book entitled Feeling Beauty: Aesthetic Experience in the Brain and Across the Arts.   Welcome to College: The Novel   FRSEM-UA 371   Instructor: Carol Sternhell   Wednesday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:1 5 p.m.) and Physics I RCT ( Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20133 :15 p.m.).   Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise to Tom Wolfe\u2019s I Am Charlotte Simmons . We discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical and cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it.   CAROL STERNHELL is Associate Professor of Journalism and a Director of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s Studio 20 graduate program. She created the department\u2019s study-away programs in London, Prague, and Accra and was also a founder of the Women\u2019s Studies major (now Gender and Sexuality Studies). She has written extensively about feminism, motherhood, and literature for a variety of publications. Before coming to NYU, she worked as an editor at Newsday , a general assignment reporter for the New York Post , and a freelance magazine writer. She received the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2005.   School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies   FRSEM-UA 255   Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5 :00 p.m.) and Principles of Biology I RCT ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:4 5 p.m.).   The 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students prepare reports on different aspects of the era and work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics are self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader.   ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is Associate Curator and Social Work Librarian in the Bobst Library, and has also taught in the English Department. First as a student and then as a faculty member, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.   Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature   FRSEM-UA 210   Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20134:4 5 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20135:00 p.m.).   The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \u201cpostmodern\u201d literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality.

Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber   FRSEM-UA 461   Instructor: Jing Wang   Monday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I Lab ( Monday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:30 p.m.) .   Cao Xueqin\u2019s mid-18th century literary epic The Dream of the Red Chamber is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China. With a tragic love story between two aristocratic teenagers at its dramatic center, it covers a vast terrain of culture and social life\u2014the question of what is eternal and what is ephemeral; the nature of \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; individual talent and its fragility; the decadence of the elite; and growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. The novel\u2019s manifold structure and intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes it one of the most complex and colorful of all time. Note: Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. No knowledge of Chinese culture, language, or history is required or assumed. Native Chinese speakers who wish to read and enjoy this masterpiece in the original language are advised to choose a different Freshman Seminar and take Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (EAST-UA 228) as an elective course in the future.

Telling Their Own Stories: The Irish in New York City   FRSEM-UA 540   Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   This interdisciplinary seminar focuses on oral history as a resource for understanding the 20th century history of the Irish in America, particularly in New York. Students will explore the discipline as it has progressed over the last twenty years, developing their own research, writing, and interviewing skills along the way and enjoying access to the 300+ interviews in Glucksman Ireland House's Oral History holdings in the Archives of Irish America. The course will demonstrate how oral history gives life to ethnic communities like those of the Irish longshoremen who worked Chelsea Piers in the West Village before it was an entertainment destination, personalizes dramatic events like 9/11, or provides insight into to why John Patrick Shanley wrote Doubt . In addition to traditional texts, we will listen to and conduct interviews, read Irish-American fiction, walk the streets of the communities we study, and screen films and documentaries exploring the lives of Irish Americans. This course will introduce students not only to oral history but to the history of the Irish in America.   LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America. Her book Irish Immigrants in New York City, 1945-1995 compares the experience of the Irish who arrived in the 1950s with that of their counterparts thirty and forty years later. Professor Almeida has published chapters in The Irish World Wide , Ireland in the 1950s , and Making the Irish American , and has delivered papers on pedagogical approaches to oral history to both the Oral History Association and the International Oral History Association. Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives.   Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism   FRSEM-UA 488   Instructor: William Ambler   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT  ( Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.- 4:45  p . m . ) and Physics I RCT ( Wednesda y, 2:00 p.m.-3:15p.m.).    This course studies the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the 17th century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in ways that gave visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. We set the portraits in the context of debates that preoccupied the European courts of the time: the Reformation; the dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. We also consider the position of artists at a royal court and preexisting traditions of royal imagery.   WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth-century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there, as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.   Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice   FRSEM-UA 484   Instructor: Ulrich Baer   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15p.m.).   This seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship\u2014the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Topics include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of New York City as an international city that has turned its diversity into strength. The seminar brings in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and asks students to consider how their own actions\u2014ranging from activism to business leadership\u2014may have an impact on those outside their immediate world.   ULRICH BAER, Vice Provost of Arts, Humanities, and Multicultural Affairs and Professor of Comparative Literature and German, was awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1998 and 2004.

He has also published widely on photography and has co-taught a seminar entitled \u201cArchive, Image, Text\u201d with Professor Shelley Rice from the Tisch School of the Arts.   Game Theory and the Humanities   FRSEM-UA 506   Instructor: Steven J. Brams   Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-7:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15p.m.).   Game theory is a mathematical theory of strategy that has been applied to the analysis of conflict and cooperation in such fields as economics, political science, and biology. In this seminar, we discuss more unusual applications\u2014to history, literature, philosophy, the Bible, theology, and law. We discuss Abraham\u2019s decision to offer his son Isaac for sacrifice; the choices made by accused witches and their persecutors in medieval witch trials; Lady Macbeth's incitement of her husband to murder King Duncan in Shakespeare\u2019s play; several strategic games played by presidents and their antagonists in domestic crises (e.g., the Civil War) and international crises (e.g., the Cuban missile crisis), and coping mechanisms used by characters in catch-22 games (including those in Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22 ).   Prerequisite: No mathematical background beyond high school mathematics is assumed, but a willingness to learn and apply sophisticated reasoning to analyze the interactions of players in games is essential. STEVEN J. BRAMS is Professor of Politics at NYU. He is the author of several books\u2014most recently, Mathematics and Democracy and Game Theory and the Humanities \u2014that apply game theory and social choice theory to voting and elections, bargaining and fairness, international relations, and the Bible, theology and literature.

He is an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow and was a Guggenheim Fellow and Visiting Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation.    How We See   FRSEM-UA 497   Instructor: Marisa Carrasco   Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m. ).   Do we see the world the way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is? This course looks at what we know about vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing and provides important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field?   MARISA CARRASCO is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, as well as a former Chairperson of the Department of Psychology. Born and raised in Mexico City, she received her licentiate in psychology from the National University of Mexico and her PhD in psychology (cognition and perception) from Princeton University. She conducts research in cognitive neuroscience, exploring the relation between the psychological and neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and attention.

Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos?   FRSEM-UA 306   Instructor: Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda   Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I Lecture ( Monday, 9:3 0 a.m.\u20131 0:45 a .m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lecture ( Monday , 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.).   This seminar focuses on Latin America\u2019s longstanding problems and possible solutions to them. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic governance following independence from colonial rule, and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the slowdown of economic growth in the last 20 years and prospects for a new economic takeoff; the phenomenon of widespread violence, and growing respect for human rights; and how the traditional weakness of civil society is being overcome. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present. JORGE D. CASTA\u00d1EDA is Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth.

He is the author of, among many other books, Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left after the Cold War; Compa\u00f1ero: The Life and Death of Che Guevara; Perpetuating Power; Ex-Mex: From Migrants to Immigrants; and Leftovers: Tales of the Latin American Left (with Marco Morales) He has also written articles for many newspapers and magazines in Mexico, the United States, and other countries.   Literature and Machines   FRSEM-UA 572   Instructor: Nicola Cipani   Thursday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), Physics I Lecture ( Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m. ), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).    Machine metaphors play an important role in modern literature, conveying beliefs, anxieties, shifts, and reflections on key topics, including the nature of consciousness and creativity; the dynamics of desire and gratification; gender roles; the organization of society; the meaning of \u201cnature\u201d; and the function of technology. This course explores different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal; and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines). Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural contexts, primarily from the late 19 th and 20 th century (e.g., Belle \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion. NICOLA CIPANI is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Department of Italian Studies and has been working at NYU for ten years. His interests include reception of antiquity in medieval and early modern culture, Renaissance philosophy, the intersection of verbal/visual forms (such as the art of memory, emblem books, and representations of dreams), and 20 th -century experimental literature. At the Italian Department he has served in the capacity of Director of Language Programs (since 2005), Director of Summer Programs (2011-12), and Director of Undergraduate Studies (2011, 2013).   In Search of Lost Time   FRSEM-UA 503   Instructor: Marcelle Clements   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).   We read Marcel Proust (350 pages per week, in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. At more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is one of modern literature\u2019s most challenging and pleasurable reads, still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, and psychological acuity with a portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity. Though Proust (1871\u20131922) is often cited as France\u2019s greatest novelist, many readers never move past the first fifty pages of his novel, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. However, as its architecture cannot be appreciated until it has been read once in its entirety, we move at a brisk pace through all six volumes; when we read the final volume, we can begin to understand the extraordinarily intimate relationship Proust has created with his reader. In-class creative writing exercises are designed to help with the reading and to expand an expressive, personal response.   MARCELLE CLEMENTS is Collegiate Professor and Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations , a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman , and two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer . Her prizewinning articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications.   Political Theater   FRSEM-UA 476   Instructor: Eric Dickson   Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).      This interdisciplinary seminar offers a survey of political theater, and of the use of theatrical elements in practical politics, from the ancient Greeks to the present. How have dramatic depictions of politics changed over time? In what ways have political plays been used to advance political agendas, both by the powerful and by dissidents and protest movements? To what extent can we understand political speeches and political campaigns as essentially theatrical productions? In a typical week, students will read one full-length play, accompanied by appropriate readings from political science or social psychology. Through these readings, writing assignments, and class discussion, we address the development of different dramatic techniques and forms throughout the history of theater; the co-evolving relationship between politically-themed spectacles and changing ideas about citizenship and political legitimacy; and the political psychology of speeches and campaign techniques. ERIC S. DICKSON is Associate Professor of Politics and a faculty affiliate in the Department of Psychology. His research interests include political communication, election campaigning, political leadership, and identities in politics. His work, which uses both game theory and social-scientific experiments, focuses on the interface between political strategy and political psychology. He also has an extensive background in theater.   Political Cinema and Representation of the \u201cOther\u201d   FRSEM-UA 463   Instructor: Shimon Dotan   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u2013 12:15 p.m.) and with Advanced Ch emistry I recitation (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201310:45 a .m.).   In contemporary war \u201cthe other\u201d is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought, but often as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \u201cthe other\u201d is constructed politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them. SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have received the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive ; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. He has taught filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of America (DGA, WGA).   The Literature of Capitalism   FRSEM-UA 576   Instructor: Thomas Easton   Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20141:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and Physics I Lecture (Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m.).   This course explores how some of the most enduring themes in literature, such as greed, ambition, failure, innovation, prosperity, and opportunity, are reflected in literature about capitalism. Readings are likely to include works by eighteenth-century English essayist Samuel Johnson; children\u2019s book author Horatio Alger and novelist Mark Twain; and contemporary Chinese memoirist Aisling Juanjuan Shen. The nature of property rights, subtle distinctions between success and crime, and the relative value of diligence and luck are other themes we consider. Our discussions about characters and stories are informed by work in economics, ranging from Adam Smith\u2019s writings on productivity and ethics to Thomas Piketty\u2019s writings on income inequality. Weekly essays assigned.   THOMAS EASTON is American finance editor at the Economist , where he previously worked as New York and Hong Kong bureau chief. Earlier in his career, he was the bureau chief for The Baltimore Sun in New York and Tokyo and a senior editor at Forbes . He has taught business reporting and journalism at Columbia\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism. At the Economist , his purview also includes legal coverage. Mr. Easton holds an AB in literature from Brown, an MBA from Columbia Business School, and an MSL from Yale Law School.   Gender, Sexuality and the Law   FRSEM-UA 480   Instructor: Shelley Fischel   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m).   What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? This course explores gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in the spheres of work, politics, and social life. We address such matters as marriage and divorce law, the Civil Rights Act and Title IX, and the unique, perhaps troubling ways that criminal law treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, and sexual orientation. We also address the intersection of these matters with issues of gender identity and sexual orientation. This course offers a history of US sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial, and legislative developments.   SHELLEY D. FISCHEL served as Executive Vice President at Home Box Office, Inc., where she was responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, and labor law matters until her retirement in December 2009. She oversaw all sexual discrimination claims in the company. She received her JD from Columbia University and her LLM from NYU.   Trials of the Century   FRSEM-UA 434   Instructor: Jack Ford    Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).   How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d? What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials, which often act as a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are revealed. This course offers in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century\u201d in the US, approaching each case from a specific angle, from celebrity (the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the trial of O.J. Simpson) to race (the trials of the Scottsboro Boys), politics (the Chicago Seven), and religion (the Scopes Monkey Trial).   JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and nationally recognized trial attorney. Currently a CBS News Legal Analyst, he has had a distinguished career on network and cable television. As a litigator, he successfully handled a number of high-profile cases, such as the Northeast\u2019s first death-penalty trial; one of the nation\u2019s first corporate homicide cases; and the Wall Street insider-trading scandal of the late 1980s. He has also written articles for respected legal publications. The recipient of five honorary degrees in recognition of his professional accomplishments and his extensive public service, he has taught at, in addition to NYU, Yale College and Fordham Law School.   Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature   FRSEM-UA 449   Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld   Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Advan ced General Chem I Lab (Thursday , 2:30 p.m.-6 :45 p.m.).   This seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the Cold War era superspy. We examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how the great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Philip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history.   EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian, as well as an attorney specializing in corporate restructuring. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America.

He received his BA from Columbia College and his JD from NYU Law School. He also teaches at Yale College.   The New Worlds of Work and Care   FRSEM-UA 500   Instructor: Kathleen Gerson   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 3:30 p.m.-6:15 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:00 p.m.).   The early 21st century represents a period of immense social change in both the public world of work and the private world of family care. New technologies have blurred the boundary between home and work. New opportunities and pressures have sent more women into the workplace. The \u201cnew economy\u201d has created jobs with more short-term flexibility, but less long-term security. And new options in intimate relationships have created more diverse and voluntary, but less predictable, family bonds. These intertwined shifts are reshaping the daily lives and life pathways of American women and men. This seminar addresses several questions: What does an overview of changes in work, family, and gender patterns tell us about where we are now and where we are going? What are the major dilemmas created by these changes, and how are people coping with these conflicts? What are the implications for the future? And what can we do to enhance the opportunities and limit the insecurities of these new social arrangements?   KATHLEEN GERSON, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Sociology, is a recognized authority on the connections among gender, work, and family life in postindustrial societies.

Cities, states, and municipalities serve as what Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called \u201clittle laboratories for democracy\u201d\u2014where ideas flourish and problems get solved. This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action in cities in the US and around the world, particularly those related to improving the urban environment. We study best practices, evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful policies and programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically about issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today.

Professor Gioia holds a BA from New York University and a JD from Georgetown University Law Center.   Is Karl Marx Still Relevant?   FRSEM-UA 413   Instructor: Jeff Goodwin   Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 3:30 p.m.-6:15 p.m.), Physics I RCT (Tuesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15 p.m.), and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   There was a time not so long ago when a critical engagement with the writings of Karl Marx was considered an obligatory intellectual and political rite of passage. No serious intellectual or political activist could not read Marx\u2014whether one ultimately accepted or rejected Marx\u2019s ideas, in whole or in part. Is this still true? Are Marx\u2019s ideas, or some of them, still relevant? Which of his ideas remain important or valuable for people who wish to understand\u2014and perhaps to change\u2014the contemporary world? Which of Marx\u2019s ideas are problematic or pass\u00e9? To address these questions, this seminar critically examines some of Marx\u2019s most important writings, including The Communist Manifesto , The German Ideology , The Civil War in France , and\u2014above all\u2014 Capital , Marx\u2019s magnum opus. In assessing the contemporary relevance of Marx\u2019s ideas, we also read several efforts by Marx\u2019s followers to understand a range of important phenomena, including the nature of the state, current US politics, and the ongoing economic crisis. JEFF GOODWIN is Professor of Sociology. He has written extensively about social movements, revolutions, and terrorism. His books include The Social Movements Reader ; Contention in Context ; Passionate Politics ; and No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945\u20131991 .

What is College For?   FRSEM-UA 474   Instructor: Trace Jordan   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.), and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.).   Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open-minded person? To gain specialized knowledge? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career? To make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents\u2019 plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and social goals of higher education and studies issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience in coming years. It also prompts students to be more reflective and purposeful about their own academic choices at NYU.   TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Professor and Associate Director of the College Core Curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement. Professor Jordan is a two-time winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   Social Challenges of Climate Change   FRSEM-UA 212   Instructor: Eric Klinenberg   Wednesday, 2:00-4:40 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15  p.m.).   Climate change is a \u201cwicked problem,\u201d so daunting, complex, and consequential that it\u2019s difficult to comprehend and analyze, let alone solve. It\u2019s also an urgent problem, because in all likelihood we have a limited time frame to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lest we create irreversible and catastrophic changes to the ecosystem that sustains human life. This seminar examines whether and how the social sciences can help us understand the challenge of climate change. We will briefly overview climate science and learn about the rise of \u201cweird weather,\u201d but the core themes of the course concern questions about communication and cognition, cultural values and material consumption, politics and persuasion, mitigation and adaptation, economics and social justice, power and social movements, and the possibility of creating new, more sustainable ways of living on earth. We will dedicate several sessions to Superstorm Sandy and its aftermath, with a focus on the question of how to rebuild a more resilient city and region in anticipation of more extreme weather events.   ERIC KLINENBERG is Professor of Sociology and Director of the Institute of Public Knowledge at NYU, as well as Research Director for the federal government's Rebuild by Design competition. He's the author of the acclaimed books Heat Wave , Fighting for Air , Going Solo , and Modern Romance (with Aziz Ansari). In addition to his scholarship, Professor Klinenberg has contributed to The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, The New York Times Magazine, and This American Life .     Branding: People, Places, Things   FRSEM-UA 422   Instructor: Richard L. Lewis   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT ( Tuesday , 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) , and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.- 5:00 p.m.).   Brands help us avoid making the same decisions over and over by building bridges of trust; it\u2019s reassuring that a visit to McDonald\u2019s is pretty much the same all around the world. Brands provide information, advice, smiles, and community, using a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us. Even brand owners are sometimes uncertain as to how their brand has cemented a relationship with an audience. This course analyzes what makes brands tick: how they\u2019re created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We also examine the dark side of brands\u2019 magnetism. Finally, we examine our budding, personal brands, or reputations, which is how our family, friends, enemies, teachers and bosses evaluate us.   RICHARD L. LEWIS is an independent marketing consultant who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime Managing Director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, and has written two bestselling books about advertising. He has also taught at Yale College.   The Doctor\u2019s Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right   FRSEM-UA 379   Instructor: Michael E. Makover   Thursday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Advanced General Chemistry I Lab ( Thursday, 2:30 p.m.\u20136:45 p.m.).   Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that just because an action or conclusion was correct did not mean that it was right . Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue, affecting patients\u2019 options and care. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \u201calternative medicine\u201d a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly.   MICHAEL E. MAKOVER is Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at the NYU School of Medicine and Attending Physician at the NYU Medical Center. He is also the Chief Medical Officer for a major union. An internist and rheumatologist, he is the author of Mismanaged Care , as well as articles on healthcare quality, ethics, and economics, and is currently writing another book entitled 120 Years Young . He was an aide to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and a spokesman for the American Cancer Society and the New York Heart Association.   Literary Theory and Its Applications   FRSEM-UA 355   Instructor: John Maynard   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   Students in this seminar read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the twentieth century to the present, and learn to evaluate different approaches. They complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis is placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities.   JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English at NYU. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature. He has published books on a variety of subjects in Victorian literature and is editor of Victorian Literature and Culture . His most recent book is on readers and reading. From 1983 to 1989, he served as chair of the Department of English. He likes New York City, New York theater, and bicycling.   Great Science, Fabulous Science, and Voodoo Science   FRSEM-UA 457   Instructor: Allen Mincer   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15  p.m.).   Science is often portrayed as following a very clearly-defined set of procedures: start with a hypothesis, do an experiment and, based on the results, reject the hypothesis or adopt it as a working assumption. The actual process, however, is rarely so straightforward. In addition, the stories as usually told or recorded may differ from what really happened. For most of the semester, we study some famous, some lesser known, and some infamous experiments, mainly in the physical sciences, selected to illustrate intellectual tours de force, sloppiness, error, self-deception, and fraud, and the sometimes murky boundaries between them. Along the way, issues such as the discarding of \u201cfaulty data,\u201d theoretical bias, and probabilistic tools for hypothesis acceptance and rejection are discussed. In the latter part of the semester, we discuss how scientific ideas are evaluated by the media, in the courtroom, and in government.   Prerequisites: students must have taken high school chemistry, physics, and calculus.   ALLEN MINCER, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Physics, specializes in experimental particle physics and particle astrophysics. He is currently a member of the ATLAS collaboration, which is studying the nature of the elementary building blocks of matter at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. His research at NYU has a long, continuous history of generous support by grants from the National Science Foundation. He is co-author of approximately 400 scientific publications, including the discovery of the top quark with the D-Zero collaboration and the discovery of a particle consistent with the Standard Model Higgs Boson with the ATLAS Collaboration. In addition to teaching in the Physics Department, he has taught in the Steinhardt School\u2019s Department of Teaching and Learning, been involved in research in physics education, and has twice been awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   The Writer in New York   FRSEM-UA 367   Instructor: Vincent Passaro   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology RCT (Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) , Physics I RCT ( Thursday, 2:00 p.m.-3:15 p.m.), and Advanced General Chem I Lab (Thursday, 2:30 p.m.-6:45 p.m.).   This seminar presents New York as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer\u2019s crucial powers of observation. We examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings\u2014we try to understand the New York writer\u2019s particular forms of misery and joy.   VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content . His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ , Esquire , Harper\u2019s Magazine , The Nation , the New York Times Magazine , and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller\u2019s Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.   Xenophon of Athens\u2014Cavalry Commander and Socratic Philosopher   FRSEM-UA 514   Instructor: Vincent Renzi   Tuesday, 12:30-3:15 p.m.    Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology II RCT (Tuesday, 12:3 0 p.m.-3:15 p.m.) and Physics I I Lecture (Tuesday  &amp; Thursday, 12:30 p.m.-1:45 p.m. ) .   The greatest ancient you\u2019ve never heard of, Xenophon of Athens (c. 425\u2013355 B.C.E.) was a brilliant general, student of Socrates, and renowned author. His heroism leading the army of the Ten Thousand inspired the conquests of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. His political philosophy informed the thought of Cicero, Machiavelli, Franklin, and Jefferson. When knowledge of Greek was still required for admission to college, his fame was ubiquitous, as his writings formed the basis of the pre-college curriculum. Readings, in English translation: Apology of Socrates, Symposium, Memorabilia, Cyropaedia, Cavalry Commander, Anabasis , and the film based on the latter, The Warriors (1979). VINCENT RENZI is Clinical Professor in the Foundations of Contemporary Culture and of Classics, and is a director of undergraduate studies for the College Core Curriculum. A scholar of ancient Greek philosophy, he also has interests in arts and aesthetics and in 19th and 20th century philosophy, and is a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.   The Image of Business in American Literature   FRSEM-UA 440   Instructor: Saul Rosenberg   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Ch emistry I recitations (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:1 5 p.m.) and with Advanced Ch emistry I recitation (Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201310:45 a .m.).   What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? This course asks how some of the most engaging American writers and filmmakers have treated the central ideas of business from the nation\u2019s founding to the present. How did the idea of \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d fare as the Republic grew? We examine classic mid-19th century writers\u2019 thoughts about \u201cgetting and spending\u201d and reactions to the moral collapse inherent in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later 19th century of the \u201crobber barons,\u201d the rise of the corporation, and the enormous influx of immigrants. For the 20th century, we look at films Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead . The course finishes with reflections on the recent financial crisis.   SAUL ROSENBERG earned a PhD in American Literature from Columbia and degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge. In addition to teaching at NYU, he has taught American literature at Columbia University and the 92nd Street Y, and served as associate editor of Commentary magazine. He is a consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company, the leading management consulting firm, where he manages publishing and knowledge management programs. He writes regularly on books for the Wall Street Journal .   History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S.   FRSEM-UA 437   Instructor: Jack Salzman   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I Lab ( Wednesday 9:00 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.)  and Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.).   This course explores the relationship between history and memory in the United States from the mid-20th century to the present. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Aug\u00e9 argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We consider such events and issues as the response to the Holocaust; internment camps for Japanese Americans; racial segregation; the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima; anticommunism; the Civil Rights Movement; the destruction of the World Trade Center, and genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. We address the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory.   JACK SALZMAN served as the Director of the Center for American Culture Studies at Columbia University and editor of Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies . He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History . Much of his work has been devoted to the relationship between African Americans and American Jews, including Struggles in the Promised Land (with Cornel West) and Bridges and Boundaries , the catalog for an exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York. He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of memoirs by Holocaust survivors. He is writing a book on the impact of the Holocaust on Jews and social justice in the US. Professor Salzman has received the Distinguished Teaching Award and two Fulbrights.   The Cultural Nature of Language   FRSEM-UA 496   Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin   Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with General Chem I RCT (Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.) and Advanced General Chem I RCT ( Friday , 9:30 a.m.-10:45 a .m.).   Whether it\u2019s accents, pronouns, swearing, or spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a social practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don\u2019t (e.g., feral children), we examine speech and silence across a range of societies. We look at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \u201cEnglish Only\u201d), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such as who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and authority. BAMBI SCHIEFFELIN is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Anthropology. A linguistic anthropologist, she is the author of The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children and co-editor of, among other books, The Acquisition of Literacy: Ethnographic Perspectives ; Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory ; and Consequences of Contact . She has also published articles in the preeminent journals of her field. She is completing a book on the impact of Christianity on the language and social life of Bosavi people of Papua New Guinea over the past twenty-five years, and continues research on linguistic creativity and change as evidenced in computer-mediated communication such as IM. Professor Schieffelin received the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2010.   The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America   FRSEM-UA 218   Instructor: John E. Sexton   Wednesday, 6:30 p.m.\u20138:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 6:3 0 p.m.\u20137 :45 p.m.).   Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of church and state; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a twenty-first-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at a high and demanding level.   JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts, and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the US Supreme Court, and has testified frequently before the US Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.   Computational Thought   FRSEM-UA 385   Instructor: Dennis E. Shasha    Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note : conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Monday, 12:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).   Prerequisites: AP calculus, discrete mathematics, or programming experience Computational technology and methods lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and, regrettably, war. There are very powerful ideas underlying the field that have roots in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and biological computing. The learning style combines straight lecture, interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer programs (in the programming language Python which you will learn). Students make a few presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions to computationally motivated puzzles, the relative power of linguistic descriptions, and their very own simulations of either an auction or a multi-bank elevator. The goal is for students to learn to think about computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges. DENNIS SHASHA is Professor of Computer Science at the Courant Institute of New York University where he works with biologists on pattern discovery for network inference; with computational chemists on algorithms for protein design; with physicists and financial specialists on algorithms for time series; on clocked computation for DNA computing; and on computational reproducibility. Other areas of interest include database tuning as well as tree and graph matching. Because he likes to type, he has written six books of puzzles about a mathematical detective named Dr. Ecco, a volume of the biographies of great computer scientists, and a book about the future of computing. He has also written five technical books about database tuning, biological pattern recognition, time series, DNA computing, statistics, and causal inference in molecular networks. He has co-authored over seventy journal papers, seventy conference papers, and twenty patents. Professor Shasha has also written the puzzle column for various publications including Scientific American .   America\u2019s Role in International Affairs since World War II   FRSEM-UA 405   Instructor: James B. Sitrick   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 3:3 0 p.m.\u20136:15 p.m.) and Physics I RCT (Wednesday, 5:00 p.m.-6:15 p.m.).   This seminar explores America\u2019s role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving current foreign policy challenges into the conversation. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan\u2019s classic book American Diplomacy, 1900\u20131950 . Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the CIA; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; US involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; US involvement in the Middle East (particularly with respect to Israel, Iran, and Iraq); the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration.   JAMES B. SITRICK serves as Of Counsel to the international law firm of Baker &amp; McKenzie, which has offices in seventy cities in forty countries. He previously served as chairman and CEO of Coudert Brothers, the oldest international law firm in the United States. His government and NGO service includes extensive work for the Department of the Treasury in drafting international legislation and negotiating treaties with foreign countries. He has also served as secretary general of the World Federation of United Nations Associations. In addition, he serves as a trustee of many American and European cultural institutions, as well as on the Arts and Science Board of Overseers at NYU.   First Amendment Freedom of Expression   FRSEM-UA 235   Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon    Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I Lecture (Monday , 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m .) ,  Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Wednesday, 9:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.), and Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.).   Prerequisites: A score of 4 o r 5 in either AP U.S. History OR in AP U.S. Government and Politics (or equivalent international exam) ; both recommended.   Conflicts over freedom of speech and the press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech and the press, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital social interests. The starting point of this course, which involves both history and law, is the robust debate that occurred in the early Republic over prosecutions for seditious libel (the crime of criticizing the government or public officials). We examine how the Supreme Court has interpreted freedom of expression by looking at a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is Associate Professor in NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. His book Ellery\u2019s Protest: How One Young Man Defied Tradition &amp; Sparked the Battle over School Prayer tells the story of the controversial Supreme Court decision in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in public schools violated the First Amendment. He is currently working on An American Invention: The Founding Generation and the Struggle for Freedom of Speech , to be published by Macmillan. Professor Solomon is a recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a JD at Georgetown University Law Center.   The Problem of Beauty   FRSEM-UA 550   Instructor: G. Gabrielle Starr   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:45 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab (Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5:00 p.m.).   What is beauty for? It is common in many circumstances to think of beauty as \u201cmerely\u201d beautiful\u2014something nice to have, but an unnecessary add-on to what really matters. This hasn\u2019t always been the case. Beauty has played an important part in philosophy, ethics and theology, and now it is playing an increasingly interesting role in biology, neuroscience, social policy, and design. But what is beauty, anyway? And why should we care? This course explores the role of beauty across a variety of disciplines and across \u201clong time\u201d (not just the period from the ancient world to the present, but even the long time of evolution).   G. GABRIELLE STARR is Professor of English and Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science, she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience . In addition, Dean Starr has just published a book entitled Feeling Beauty: Aesthetic Experience in the Brain and Across the Arts.   Welcome to College: The Novel   FRSEM-UA 371   Instructor: Carol Sternhell   Wednesday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Wednesday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:1 5 p.m.) and Physics I RCT ( Wednesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20133 :15 p.m.).   Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise to Tom Wolfe\u2019s I Am Charlotte Simmons . We discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical and cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it.   CAROL STERNHELL is Associate Professor of Journalism and a Director of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s Studio 20 graduate program. She created the department\u2019s study-away programs in London, Prague, and Accra and was also a founder of the Women\u2019s Studies major (now Gender and Sexuality Studies). She has written extensively about feminism, motherhood, and literature for a variety of publications. Before coming to NYU, she worked as an editor at Newsday , a general assignment reporter for the New York Post , and a freelance magazine writer. She received the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2005.   School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies   FRSEM-UA 255   Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Intro Experimental Physics I Lab ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-5 :00 p.m.) and Principles of Biology I RCT ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.-4:4 5 p.m.).   The 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students prepare reports on different aspects of the era and work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics are self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader.   ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is Associate Curator and Social Work Librarian in the Bobst Library, and has also taught in the English Department. First as a student and then as a faculty member, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.   Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature   FRSEM-UA 210   Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I RCT ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20134:4 5 p.m.) and Intro Experimental Physics I Lab ( Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.\u20135:00 p.m.).   The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \u201cpostmodern\u201d literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Virginia Woolf, Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory.   FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German. Winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal, and NYU Alumni Association Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s Program, offering courses on Nietzsche, Kafka, and other figures. He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.   The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome 1490\u20131610: Two Michelangelos, Buonarroti and Merisi da Caravaggio   FRSEM-UA 366   Instructor: Guy Walton   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I Lecture (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m. ), Principles of Biology I RCT (Wednesday, 11:00 a.m-1:45 p.m.), and Introductory Experimental Physics I Lab ( Wednesday, 9:00 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.)   Early and recent biographies and films about the lives of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Caravaggio provide the starting point for this course, which sets their art in the larger context of, first, papal patronage (the courts of Sixtus IV, Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII, Paul III, Sixtus V, and Paul V), and second, the culture of Renaissance and Counter Reformation Rome. Students develop a major research paper on the masterpieces of painting and sculpture the \u201ctwo Michelangelos\u201d produced.   GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Art History at the College of Arts and Science. His degrees are from Wesleyan University and NYU\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts (MA, PhD). His research and publications have centered on the courts of Europe of the early modern period, including those of the popes in Rome, and on the artists and architects who worked for many rulers. His published works include scholarly articles, reviews, and exhibition catalogs. He is the author of Louis XIV\u2019s Versailles .   Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber   FRSEM-UA 461   Instructor: Jing Wang   Monday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: TBD   Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I Lab ( Monday, 12:30 p.m.\u20133:30 p.m.) .   Cao Xueqin\u2019s mid-18th century literary epic The Dream of the Red Chamber is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China. With a tragic love story between two aristocratic teenagers at its dramatic center, it covers a vast terrain of culture and social life\u2014the question of what is eternal and what is ephemeral; the nature of \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; individual talent and its fragility; the decadence of the elite; and growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. The novel\u2019s manifold structure and intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes it one of the most complex and colorful of all time. Note: Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. No knowledge of Chinese culture, language, or history is required or assumed. Native Chinese speakers who wish to read and enjoy this masterpiece in the original language are advised to choose a different Freshman Seminar and take Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (EAST-UA 228) as an elective course in the future. Consult the CAS Bulletin for prerequisites.   JING WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990\u2019s .
