As a graduate of the MS program, you will have the following knowledge and competencies:     The ability to identify, define, collect, analyze, and communicate relevant data from diverse sources (tabular, web, sensors, etc.)   A depth of knowledge in a particular urban domain, such as energy, buildings, transportation, etc., and in a discipline, including visualization, decision models and optimization, simulation and computational methods   An understanding of urban science and urban informatics and their relationship to the operation and development of cities   An ability to identify and assess problems, evaluate data needs and analytical approaches to problem-solving, and develop solutions in real-world, multiple-constraint contexts   The ability to utilize large-scale data to better understand city functions   Direct, hands-on experience working in high-intensity, real-world environments with industry and agency partners   The ability to manage and lead complex processes of technology innovation and deployment   Leadership skills for your chosen career path in an entrepreneurial venture or existing organization     If your background is in mathematics, science, or engineering, the MS in Applied Urban Science and Informatics will provide you with the opportunity to engage in the interdisciplinary study of urban science and informatics and to apply your technical skills to urban problems.   The one-year, three-semester, 30-credit MS program provides core courses in urban science, urban informatics, and information and communication technology in cities. You will have the opportunity to select from multiple urban domains and informatics disciplines to gain breadth and depth in the application of big data analytics to urban problems.   The program also contains a focus on entrepreneurship and innovation leadership, and you are given the option to study technology entrepreneurship or change leadership in an existing organization.   Additionally, you will complete the Urban Science Intensive. The Intensive will place you in a multidisciplinary environment with a specific city agency and industry partner to work on a project that addresses an actual, current urban challenge in a particular domain. The project may be within larger, ongoing research efforts involving city agencies and CUSP industry partners, a self-contained effort involving agencies and corporations, or entrepreneurial in focus and content.         What Makes the Program Special?   Seven elements are at the heart of why this program is unlike any other.       Discipline Specialization   Select an informatics discipline that will guide your applied work in the program. Discipline specializations are targeted at building skills for data acquisition and management, integration, and analysis in a number of subfields.   Domain Specialization   Choose to specialize in one urban domain (transportation and mobility; buildings and the built environment; public health, security, and emergency response; or environmental sustainability) that will serve as the basis for your Urban Science Intensive project.   Entrepreneurship and Innovation Leadership Specialization   You&#8217;ll have the option to specialize in either change leadership and organizational behavior or entrepreneurship and new venture creation. These skills are critical for successfully applying your degree to real world situations.   City Challenge Program   A week-long cohort-building program and immersion in the dynamics of New York City agencies, city operations, and the CUSP intellectual community. You&#8217;ll attend the City Challenge in August before you start your first full semester.     CUSP Partnerships   CUSP is an extraordinary consortium of public and private partners \u2013 leading institutions of higher learning, leaders in the tech industry, and leaders in public service \u2014 that individually rank among the most prominent in their sectors, but together form an unsurpassed whole. As a student in the program, you will have unprecedented access to mentors, projects, and faculty from our distinguished partners.   The Urban Science Intensive   An experiential, two-semester project in which you&#8217;ll work as part of a multidisciplinary team to solve a real-world urban problem faced by a city agency or industry partner. You\u2019ll identify, evaluate, collect, and analyze data, formulate and test solutions, and finally devise a strategy to implement and deploy your selected solution.   CUSP Research   The principal scope of CUSP\u2019s research is urban informatics \u2014 the collection, integration, and analysis of data to understand and improve urban systems and quality of life. You\u2019ll be in close contact with CUSP researchers who will be building an instrumented city that will yield data for researchers and students to collect, analyze, and interpret in order to improve the everyday lives of New Yorkers and the long-term health and efficiency of New York City and cities around the globe.     Who Should Apply to the Program?   If you have an undergraduate or master\u2019s degree in science, mathematics, or engineering, along with the aptitude and inspiration to apply your quantitative and mathematics skills to the betterment of urban life, you should consider CUSP\u2019s MS in Applied Urban Science and Informatics program.   Your academic and professional experience need not be in a field directly linked to cities and urban issues. It is more important that you can demonstrate rigorous prior academic training and a passion for applying analytical skills to problem-solving in an urban context.   We seek talented students who are looking for a new challenge. We intend to bring together students with diverse technical skills who want to make a difference in how people live and improve quality of life in cities.
