Scholars at Risk Network   Hosted by New York University, The Scholars at Risk Network (SAR) is an international network of universities and colleges responding to attacks on scholars because of their words, their ideas and their place in society. SAR promotes academic freedom and defends the human rights of scholars and their communities worldwide.          NYU Women's Leadership Forum     The NYU Women's Forum concept originated in 2005 when national attention put the role, function, and challenges facing women in the academy into the spotlight. From the controversial debate about why relatively few women pursue and flourish in the sciences, to reports about the persistence of the glass ceiling in the academy and elsewhere in society, to the work/family collision course encountered by many women striving to achieve both a successful career and a home life of acceptable quality - the time seemed right for NYU to reflect upon and examine itself in that context.   The objective of the NYU Women's Leadership Forum is to foster leadership development, facilitate professional growth, and sponsor opportunities for outreach among women in leadership roles. It is expected that these efforts will create new and exciting ways for women at NYU to take part in the vibrant life of the University. Through professional and personal networking, access to electronic resources and materials, and participation in an array of events such as conferences, guest presentations, and opportunities for professional development, women can exchange information and interact with others who have common interests and goals. The Founding Chair of the NYU Women's Leadership is NYU Chief of Staff and Deputy to the President Diane Yu, with staff support from the Office of the President.
