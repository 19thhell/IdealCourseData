Likewise, and  particularly since 9/11, journalistic coverage of the region has  skyrocketed. However, these two  growing sets of experts have not been in regular and meaningful communication  with each other, nor are there enough programs and curricular materials to  support the training of experts conversant in the languages and approaches of  both journalism and Middle East Studies.       With Coverage in Context: Media and the Middle East, we aim to address these gaps. The Hagop Kevorkian Center and the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute have launched a web-based series that supports  the training of aspiring journalists in the approaches of interdisciplinary  Middle East Studies and exposes other students and scholars to the challenges faced by working journalists. With support from the Social Science Research Council , we produced a five \u201cwebisode\u201d series featuring conversations  between innovative and media-aware academics as well as experienced journalists  who have consistently produced coverage of the region within its complex  historical and political context(s).    Each module addresses the analytical, theoretical, and practical  concerns of journalists as well as academics.         Joe Sacco Farideh Farhi Zachary Lockman Anthony Shadid Shibley Telhami  Jillian Schwedler        Marc Lynch Roza Eftekhari Borzou Daragahi  Rami Khouri Lawrence Wright  The webisodes (taped in 2010-2011) cover five themes: 1) The Past in the Present (Palestine) with historian Zachary Lockman and cartoon journalist Joe Sacco ; 2) Understanding Identity (Iraq, Jordan, Yemen) with print journalist Anthony Shadid and political scientist Jillian Schwedler ; 3) Arab Public Opinion with editorial columnist Rami Khoury and political scientist Shibley Telhami 4) Authoritarianism and Resistance (Iran) with journalists Borzou Daragahi and Roza Eftekhari and policy analyst Farideh Farhi 5) A Changing Middle East with political scientist and blogger Marc Lynch and author/playwright/screenwriter Lawrence Wright   As an extension to these webisodes and working with other partners such as the Center for Religion and Media and NYU Abu Dhabi, we also convened and recorded a series of discussions among journalists, academics, media analysts and producers that delved deeper into contexts such as Afghanistan, Egypt, and Iran. Through these conversations we navigated a complex landscape of new media and explored the role of religion and gender in shaping today's rapidly changing Middle East. 1) Media, Islam and the New Arab Journalist with Lawrence Pintak (Communications, Washington State University) and Mohamed El-Nawawy (Communications, Queens University of Charlotte) 2) Television, Religion, and Gender in the Afghan Culture Wars with filmmaker Havana Marking , David Edwards (Williams College), and Wazhmah Osman (NYU) 3) Iran on Film: A Forum on Culture, Politics and Daily Life in Documentary Cinema with Negar Mottahedeh (Duke University), Persheng Vaziri (LinkTV), and filmmaker Maryam Khakipour 4) B logistan and Beyond: Religion, the Internet and Politics in Iran with Annabelle Sreberny (SOAS, University of London), Narges Bajoghli (NYU) and Hamid Dabashi (Columbia University) 5) Tahrir Square, 2012: The Voices of Women and Religious Minorities with filmmaker Viola Shafik and Yasmin Moll (NYU)            Havana Marking Persheng Vaziri Hamid Dabashi Yasmin Moll David Edwards Maryam Khakipour Narges Bajoghli          Lawrence Pintak Mohamed El-Nawawy Negar Mottahedeh  Viola Shafik Wazhmah Osman Annabelle Sreberny                                Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

Likewise, and  particularly since 9/11, journalistic coverage of the region has  skyrocketed. However, these two  growing sets of experts have not been in regular and meaningful communication  with each other, nor are there enough programs and curricular materials to  support the training of experts conversant in the languages and approaches of  both journalism and Middle East Studies.       With Coverage in Context: Media and the Middle East, we aim to address these gaps. The Hagop Kevorkian Center and the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute have launched a web-based series that supports  the training of aspiring journalists in the approaches of interdisciplinary  Middle East Studies and exposes other students and scholars to the challenges faced by working journalists. With support from the Social Science Research Council , we produced a five \u201cwebisode\u201d series featuring conversations  between innovative and media-aware academics as well as experienced journalists  who have consistently produced coverage of the region within its complex  historical and political context(s).    Each module addresses the analytical, theoretical, and practical  concerns of journalists as well as academics.

Through these conversations we navigated a complex landscape of new media and explored the role of religion and gender in shaping today's rapidly changing Middle East. 1) Media, Islam and the New Arab Journalist with Lawrence Pintak (Communications, Washington State University) and Mohamed El-Nawawy (Communications, Queens University of Charlotte) 2) Television, Religion, and Gender in the Afghan Culture Wars with filmmaker Havana Marking , David Edwards (Williams College), and Wazhmah Osman (NYU) 3) Iran on Film: A Forum on Culture, Politics and Daily Life in Documentary Cinema with Negar Mottahedeh (Duke University), Persheng Vaziri (LinkTV), and filmmaker Maryam Khakipour 4) B logistan and Beyond: Religion, the Internet and Politics in Iran with Annabelle Sreberny (SOAS, University of London), Narges Bajoghli (NYU) and Hamid Dabashi (Columbia University) 5) Tahrir Square, 2012: The Voices of Women and Religious Minorities with filmmaker Viola Shafik and Yasmin Moll (NYU)            Havana Marking Persheng Vaziri Hamid Dabashi Yasmin Moll David Edwards Maryam Khakipour Narges Bajoghli          Lawrence Pintak Mohamed El-Nawawy Negar Mottahedeh  Viola Shafik Wazhmah Osman Annabelle Sreberny                                Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Course Offerings    | MEIS | NYU                                                                Back to  previous page                                Course Offerings Language Courses Note: Language examinations are held before the first week of the fall and spring semesters and on a regular basis during the academic year.

This rich and vast literary, religious, and philosophical heritage is introduced in this course.
