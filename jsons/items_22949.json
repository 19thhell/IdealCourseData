Back to Home       Call for Papers - Language and Colonialism   The relationship between language and processes of colonization and decolonization has interested fields as diverse as anthropology, history, sociology, linguistics, and area studies. We aim to bring together the most vital and original contributions on the topics of language alienations, resistances, accommodations, refusals, and appropriations, as articulated in policies and everyday practices. Priority will be given to proposals on the British, French, Italian, and Dutch cases. Papers chosen for the workshop will be pre-circulated to facilitate serious discussion, and an edited volume from the revised papers is planned. Travel and lodging expenses will be paid for participants. Some possible themes:  Language and Colonial Authority Translators as Colonial Intermediaries Language and Racial Theories and Policies Language and/of Missionaries and Religious Orders Language and Colonial Education Uses of the Vernacular Language and Citizenship in the Colonial and Postcolonial Contexts Linguistic Dimensions of Transitions to Independence Postcolonial legacies of Colonial Language Politics and Policies Please send an abstract (up to 250 words) and a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to Ruth Ben-Ghiat ( rb68@nyu.edu ) and Alice Goheneix Polanski ( agp318@nyu.edu ) by December 20, 2013.

Back to Home       Call for Papers - Language and Colonialism   The relationship between language and processes of colonization and decolonization has interested fields as diverse as anthropology, history, sociology, linguistics, and area studies. We aim to bring together the most vital and original contributions on the topics of language alienations, resistances, accommodations, refusals, and appropriations, as articulated in policies and everyday practices. Priority will be given to proposals on the British, French, Italian, and Dutch cases. Papers chosen for the workshop will be pre-circulated to facilitate serious discussion, and an edited volume from the revised papers is planned. Travel and lodging expenses will be paid for participants. Some possible themes:  Language and Colonial Authority Translators as Colonial Intermediaries Language and Racial Theories and Policies Language and/of Missionaries and Religious Orders Language and Colonial Education Uses of the Vernacular Language and Citizenship in the Colonial and Postcolonial Contexts Linguistic Dimensions of Transitions to Independence Postcolonial legacies of Colonial Language Politics and Policies Please send an abstract (up to 250 words) and a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to Ruth Ben-Ghiat ( rb68@nyu.edu ) and Alice Goheneix Polanski ( agp318@nyu.edu ) by December 20, 2013.
