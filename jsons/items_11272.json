Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           In this course, we will explore the challenges as well as opportunities for creating and enacting effective public policies. Specifically, we will examine what counts as knowledge or evidence in the policy making process; how the opinions and experiences of marginalized groups are taken into account or consideration; and the ways in which communities and non-profit organizations mobilize to have their needs met and voices heard in the public sphere.      The main objective of this course is to expose students to current and relevant policy discussion and debates. Upon completion of this course, students should: (1) have gained a more thorough understanding of the co-production of knowledge and organizing frameworks used by advocates and non-profit leaders to have their needs met in the public sphere; (2) an understanding of the significance of public opinion, framing, and agenda setting to the policy making process; (3) understand the role of discrimination and historic inequalities in the distribution and allocation of resources in society; and (4) be better prepared to analyze, discuss, and write about key issues in public policy.
