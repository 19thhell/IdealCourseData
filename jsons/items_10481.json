Sample Syllabus                                  Anthropology                                                  Roma in Central East Europe: Enthnographic and Historical Overview Of A People Without A State - ANTH-UA 9200 - 4 points                               The course will introduce students to the development of Romany politics and culture from a persecuted minority through to the emergence of Romany organizations with an emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe. The aim is to challenge any essentializing view on Roma as either a people outside or/and without society or as perennial victims of oppression. Two main approaches have dominated the teaching of Romany issues: a culturalist/ethnic approach, which stresses Romany cultures, and an economistic approach, which stresses \u00b4poverty.\u00b4 This course will challenge mono-causal and a-historic explanations for the social situation of Roma and will stimulate students to think about Roma in a critical holistic way that brings into consideration the societies they live in. Building on a diverse selection of empirical material, ranging from ethnographic, historical and sociological case studies to artistic representations of Roma, the course will present the Roma \u201cas good to think\u201d for our comprehension of current social issues. The course is divided into three interconnected thematic blocks \u2013 1. Identity, community and culture, 2. Power, the State and social stratification, 3. History, memory and politics of representation \u2013 which will allow to cover much of the current debates on the plight of European Roma as well as a grasp of social theories on marginality.

The course begins with the pre-Romanesque and Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Classicism periods. The major focus will be on 19th and 20th Century architectural styles from Historicism and Art Nouveau through Cubism, Art-D\u00e9co, Avant-garde Functionalism, post-war Stalinist art and architecture, and the contemporary. It's necessary to have an understanding of the evolution of Mid European art and architecture, town planning and theory.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Czech Art and Architecture - ARTH-UA\u00a09662 - 4 points                               This course presents a survey of art and architecture in Prague and its environs - from the Middle Ages to the present - placed within the context of the main periods and movements of Western art history. The course will be rooted in a discussion of the city of Prague, and students are encouraged through excursions and assignments to become acquainted with the city's architecture, monuments and urban design. Students will learn to analyse formal aspects of art and architectural styles (from Romanesque to modern) and will also be encouraged to investigate their sources and theoretical foundations. Emphasis will be given to the historical and cultural context of art styles and movements. We will also look at art patronage in some key periods of Czech history to see how this reflects political, cultural and ideological change. Classroom lectures will be combined with regular excursions to examine works of art and architecture at first hand. These will include architectural walking tours and visits to temporary exhibitions as well as the city's major art galleries.

During the semester, students focus on the strategic implications of communication for modern organizations. A variety of assignments are given to stress the following communication competencies: written, spoken and nonverbal communication basics for business; effective team communication strategies; informative, persuasive and collaborative presentations; communication techniques for required junior and senior year projects. Students regularly receive personal feedback about their writing and their oral presentations from instructors and staff.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Ownership and Corporate Control in Advanced and Transition Economies -\u00a0ECON-UB 9271 - 3 points                               Prerequisites: ECON-UB 1, ECON-UA 10 or ECON-UA 11, Intermediate Microeconomics or Microeconomics (Theory). or equivalent.   NYU Stern students may take this course as a third Stern course at NYU Prague.   NYU College of Arts and Sciences Economics Department Students: Please note this course CANNOT be taken for major or minor credit.   The subject of the course is to describe one of the most profound changes to take place in the history of the world economy - the rapid change from centrally planned economies to market economies throughout what used to be known as &quot;the Soviet block&quot;. Although some reforms in some countries began much earlier, the true transition began in most Central and Eastern European countries roughly in 1990. This means that scholars and researchers are only now beginning to have the data and a sufficient distance needed to study and analyze the transition process.   Sample syllabus                                  College Core Curriculum                                                  Cultures and Contexts: Russia - Between East &amp; West - CORE-UA 9510 - 4 points                               Russia\u2019s rich and multifaced cultural identity has been shaped in a thousand year long process of interaction with a range of diverse cultural formations of the \u2018West\u2019 and \u2018East\u2019 (including Byzantine/ Christian \u2018East\u2019, Central Asian/Muslim \u2018East\u2019, South Asian/Indian \u2018East\u201d, and East Asian/Confucian \u2018East\u2019). For the last 300 years, since the era of Peter the Great, Russia\u2019s greatest statesmen, philosphers, religious thinkers, writers, poets and creative artists were obssesed with the question of Russia\u2019s distinctive cultural identity. This passionate search for the \u2018Russian soul\u2019 is apparently far from over, as the recent rise of interest in the ideas of \u2018Eurasianism\u2019 and \u2018Neo-Slavophilism\u2019 testifies. This course in Russian intellectual history explores the sources of Russia\u2019s unique cultural blend through examination of some of the principal textual and artistic images representative of traditions that emerged at the geographic and cultural crossroads of Eastern Europe, including those which constitute Russia\u2019s unique contribution to world culture. Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, community, individual, gender, and the &quot;other.&quot;   Sample syllabus                                                                      Cultures and Contexts: Prague, in the Heart of Central Europe -\u00a0CORE-UA 9548 - 4 points                               Prague is without doubts one of the most important historical, geopolitical and cultural capitals of Central Europe. The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often, it is characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East. However, most scholars agree that there is a distinct Central European culture. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel and Dvorak, to mention at least some. Central European culture is based on historical, social and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity. It is a result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of its history. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of course location in Prague, students have the opportunity to examine the primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment.

In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.   Sample syllabus                              Economics        Ownership and Corporate Control in Advanced and Transition Economies is now offered through the Stern School of Business's Economics Department.

But study limited to Europe would be pointless; the Old Continent is no longer the prime player on the planet. Therefore a series of related topics and areas will also be discussed: U.S. military might (especially compared to the European armed forces); the situation in adjacent regions (North Africa, Middle East, Russia and Ukraine) and its implication for Europe; and the new types of terrorism.   Sample syllabus                                                                    The Political Economy of Europe from a Global Perspective - EURO-UA 9294 - 4 points                               The overriding goal of this course is to reach an understanding of the key strategic issues facing Europe today and how they impact on the political economy of the region. We will track how Europe has reached the present critical juncture in its history and consider where it is headed, including the options available to European policy-makers amid the on-going crisis in the Eurozone. To this end, we will examine the key events of the 19th and 20th centuries that led to the foundation of the EU and have shaped contemporary Europe. At the same time, we will consider Europe\u2019s relations with the US as today\u2019s sole superpower, the challenges posed by the resurgence of China and Russia and Europe\u2019s role as a major player in the resource-rich Eurasian continent, where a new round of great power competition is unfolding.   The course draws largely on political economy but also on history, international relations and geopolitics. It aims to raise questions and stimulate discussion rather than provide clear-cut answers.

The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Western European Comparative Politics -\u00a0EURO-UA 9510 or POL-UA 9510 - 4 points                               This course will concentrate on the analysis of the pursuits of democracy in Western Europe. Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Imagining America, Imagining Europe-\u00a0EURO-UA 9173 - 4 points                               This class is devoted not only to a &quot;close reading&quot; of the selected texts, but also to relevant broader issues. While the approach and methods are interdisciplinary, the main emphasis is on literary theory (explaining and applying basic literary terms), literary history (both American and European), and literary criticism (analyzing different responses to given works). Every class starts with the oral presentation delivered by a student, then there is a short lecture by the teacher, and a discussion follows.

It is fundamentally about deciding not to conform with repressive regimes. It is also about choosing a mode of action that brings with it personal dangers even when, as is usual, it advocates non-violence. This course examines the nature and significance of civil resistance in Central and Eastern Europe in the 20th century. In studying resistance literature (including poetry and song), art and film, we will draw on ideas and arguments from the disciplines of history, political science, literature, art criticism, film studies and psychology.

The course will cover masterpieces of Russian, Hungarian, German, Polish and Czech cinematography, focusing on several crucial periods of history, in particular WWII and its aftermath, showing moral dilemmas of individuals and nations under the Nazi regime as well as revealing the bitter truth of the Stalinist years.

In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.

Today, Jews have only one thing in common \u2013 every Jew asks what it means to be a Jew.\u201c These are words of David ben Gurion after the Second World War. The period of the 18th to the 20th centuries of modern Jewish history in Europe belongs to the most dynamic in the whole Jewish history. What are the reasons for such radical changes? Were there differences between the development in Western, Central and Eastern Europe?&amp;; How did the changes affect Jewish religious, cultural, linguistic and national identity? These questions build the core of this course.

Students will consider numerous issues of city planning and growth. Topics will include patterns of cultural distinctiveness, the influence of ethnic and religious concerns, and the political implications apparent in architectural design, neighborhood development, housing policies, and public space.   Sample syllabus                                                                    History of Nationalism in Central and Eastern Europe -\u00a0HIST-UA 9176 - 4 points                               In the 20th Century, three phenomena had fateful consequences for Central and Eastern Europe: (1) the unsuccessful attempt to eliminate, after WWI, national tension by creating new nation-states, and the encounters with both major totalitarian ideologies, (2) Nazism and (3) Communism. The present eruptions of nationalism are rooted in the heritage of these phenomena. Comparative histories of the formation of modern national identities, including the 'national awakening' of non-dominant nations, will be interpreted against the backdrop of national policies of multi-ethnic states, national programs and leaders. The major focus of the course will be oriented toward topics surrounding post-WWI Central and Eastern Europe, Nazism and Communism. We will examine the disintegration of post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, discuss the ethnic conflicts, policies toward minorities and xenophobia. The bibliography of required and recommended reading will be handed out in class, the abbreviated titles are in the syllabus. The guidelines for mid-term and finals will be available in class two weeks before the scheduled exam.

Several forms and techniques will be explored through lecture, discussion and assignments, including: news reports, interviews, reviews (film, literature, theater), feature stories, essays, and commentaries. During the course, students will learn not only about Prague's cultural landscape but they will be encouraged to examine it in various journalistic and literary forms. One of the leading aims of this courses is also to introduce to them six extraordinary persons, whose work in their respective areas reached international attention.   Sample syllabus                                                                    International Reporting (Elective Topics) -\u00a0JOUR-UA\u00a09204 - 4 points                               This course will focus on foreign reporting in US and British newspapers and journals, looking at the history of foreign reporting, the different kinds of media in which it appears, the topics it covers and the skills necessary to perform it. Students will read and discuss contemporary reporting and famous reportage from the past, listen to foreign correspondents and write their own stories. By the end of the course students should have a good understanding of foreign reporting and will be well equipped with some of the practical skills necessary to follow it as a career.

Global Media Seminar: East-Central Europe - JOUR-UA 9505 and MCC-UE 9453 - 4 points                               The idea of the course is to inform students about European media in general, and about transformation of the Czech media after the Velvet revolution in 1989 in particular. Czech developments will be presented on the background of a wider European perspective in order to make students acquainted with the basic features of European landscape of print and electronic media. Due to the lack of literature and printed sources in English language on the subject, the course will extensively exploit internet sources related to the topics.

Yet it will do so not as part of a purely academic exercise but in order to answer some very practical philosophical questions, such as: Why isn't law the same thing as justice? Where does legality end and revolution begin? Why does the Anglo-American legal system make legal resolution into a game? Are war crimes tribunals legal proceedings or merely victor's revenge dressed up in procedural garb? Why doesn't law which is considered divinely inspired (i.e. the Old and New Testaments) serve as a legitimate basis of law in the West? The aim of this course is to show how understanding the nature and sources of law can help us understand real-world events and issues. By the end of the course students will have an appreciation of the limits of law and how law fits into the fabric of society alongside other norms, such as morality and religion. Students should also learn to identify interconnections and relationships between ideas in seemingly disparate areas of thought.

Students will read, watch, analyze and discuss a variety of text specific commercials. Attention will be devoted also to the impact of advertising on the post-communist world and to the ways by which cultural issues are framed and kept in mind in the media discourse. The main objective is to provide an introductory course that is meaningful and of practical importance to students. The course examines Advertising not only as an academic discipline, but also a way of perceiving and understanding our society.

Although many of our readings will deal with Social Network Sites (SNSs), we will attempt to form an expansive definition of what constitutes \u201csocial media.\u201d We will also work from an expansive definition of \u201ctechnology,\u201d considering the term in a cultural sense to include various practices and tools used to communicate in everyday life.

Students will explore factors shaping modern media texts, including: politics, economics, technology, and cultural traditions. The dominant critical perspectives that contribute to our understanding of media will be read, discussed, and employed. The course has three broad objectives: Develop a critical awareness of media environments, develop a familiarity with concepts, themes and theoretical approaches of media criticism, and the terms associated with these approaches, and develop an ability to adopt and adapt these frameworks in your own analyses of mediated communication. Students' active class participation is vital to this process. Active participation includes listening, building on what others say, asking questions, advancing reasoned arguments, identifying theories that are relevant to the discussion, and working collaboratively with others. Missing class and/or a record of lateness will negatively affect the final grade. An absence will be excused only in case of a medical emergency (or other extraordinary circumstance) which is justified with appropriate documentation.

A veritable buzzword, globalization refers to several newly emerged phenomena. To study it means to delve into several areas in which it manifests itself. These are, to name just the three most visible ones, the economy, culture and politics. In any of these dimensions globalization, as it is discussed in the last twenty years, functions through the media. Media does not portray globalization, but it is its important part. A study of globalization is inherently diverse and eclectic. So is this course. Students will read, watch films, analyze and discuss them. In class discussions and short papers they are expected to engage questions, issues, themes and topics connected to globalization, culture and the media. Special attention will be devoted to the impact of globalization on the late communist and post-communist world, and also to the ways by which the globalization issues are framed and discussed in the media discourse. All assigned texts and films are mandatory. Students are required to follow current events in the media (cable TV, newspapers, Internet). Class participation is expected as it is part of the final grade.

Politics                                                  East European Government and\u00a0Politics - POL-UA 9522 - 4 points                               This course is an introduction to the modern politics and government of Central and Eastern Europe from the beginning of the Twentieth Century to the present. We will examine several periods, including 1). The interwar period and the development of the first modern political systems; 2) World War II, German occupation and resistance, and official and unofficial political systems; 3). Sovietization and the adoption of non-democratic political system; 4). The Communist Era in Eastern &amp; Central Europe; 5). Democratic transitions; 6) and the processes of democratic consolidation. The course uses a comparative approach, using a few basic theories of political science to analyze the Central &amp; Eastern European case. Topics include types of political regimes, creation and breakdown of democratic systems, constitutions and state systems, political parties, elections etc.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Central Europe, NATO and the European Union POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               The course &quot;Central Europe, EU and NATO&quot; provides students with an overview of the history, institutional and political structures, and major current debates in the European integration process, including its Atlantic dimension. In particular, the course concentrates on the trends triggered by EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007, the security situation after 9/11 and the impact of globalization on EU economic and social governance.   Sample syllabus                                                                    European-American Relations in the 21st Century - POL-UA\u00a09598 - 4 points                               This course explores the recent history and the current state of political, economic and cultural relations between the United States and Europe. Ever since the end of the World War II, the cooperative relationship between these two parts of the world, often described as &quot;The West&quot;, has been a bedrock of international stability, security and prosperity. After the end of the Cold War, this relationship has undergone changes, along with the whole system of international relations. Recently, on both sides of the Atlantic, the talk has been about a crisis of the Euro-American relationship. We will examine the validity of these claims, the causes of the current disagreements and possible ways of overcoming them. Throughout, we will emphasize the overwhelming nature of common values and interests on both sides of the Atlantic as well as the risks stemming from a potential rift for both Europe and America. We will examine the compatibility of current European and U.S. policies with respect to third countries or regions, such as Russia, the Middle East, China, and other parts of the Globe. We will also analyze the specific role played in this relationship by countries of Central and Eastern Europe as relative newcomers to democracy, to the Atlantic Alliance and to European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Czech and Slovak Modern History in the Central European Context - POL-UA\u00a09994 - 4 points                               This course tells the story of the region in the geographical trap between Germany and Russia. The establishment of Czechoslovakia, the post-WW II expulsion of the German minority, Stalinism, the Prague Spring of 1968, dissident movements, the Velvet Revolution of 1989, transition to democracy, V\u00e1clav Havel and the post-Havel era will all be studied. Students will gain basic knowledge on Central European political, historical and economic issues. Critical reading of sources and independent thinking required.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Germany and East Central Europe (1871-2000) - HIST-UA9514 or POL-UA 9515 - 4 points                               This course will focus on the history of the culturally rich region of &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; through analysis of the parallel evolution of Germany and the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary. Mitteleuropa as a region produced such important figures as Franz Kafka, Gustav Mahler, Sigmund Freud, Theodor Herzl and Milan Kundera; historical personalities whose influence internationally is indisputable. We'll delve into the history of the region and on the central role played by German politics and culture from the end of the 19th century, through the turbulent 20th century to the present day.   Emphasis will be on the evolution of the concept of nationalism as well as on Germany's foreign policy in the &quot;concert of nations&quot;, especially towards its Eastern neighbors. The aim is to achieve an understanding of the complex evolution of national entities and their interaction between the birth of the modern German state and the integration of the Visegr\u00e1d countries in NATO and the European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Western European Comparative Politics -\u00a0EURO-UA 9510 or POL-UA 9510 - 4 points                               This course will concentrate on the analysis of the pursuits of democracy in Western Europe. Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.   Sample syllabus                              Religious Studies                                                  Religion, Culture and Politics in Eastern and Central Europe -\u00a0RELST-UA 9360 - 4 points                               Religion is without doubt one of the most important elements that shaped the history and contemporary face of Central Europe. Religion played an important role in the political and cultural development of this part of the world. The history of the mutual interaction between religion and politics is evident in the cultural richness of this part of the world, particularly in Bohemia and Prague.   This course explores various religious phenomena that formed political ideas and cultural values of this region indifferent historical periods. We examine particularly those religious characteristics and figures that remarkably influenced the world's history and enriched human thinking. First, we study the Christianization of Central European society and the prominent role of religion in the political and cultural transformation of the medieval period. Then we follow the religious reformation process and development of the relationship between Judeo-Christian tradition and the secular world in the early modern period. Finally, we explore the policies of communist regimes in the spheres of religion and culture and study the struggle of Christian churches against communist totalitarianism. The transformation of Catholicism in the 1960s is also examined together with the role of religion in post-communist society.   Excursions to significant historical and religious sights are an important part of the course.   Sample syllabus                                Russian and Slavic Studies                                                    Contemporary Central and East European Literature: From Kafka to Kundera -\u00a0RUSSN-UA 9832 - 4 points                               The idea of the course is not to bring a full and detailed picture of the whole of modern and contemporary Central and East European literature into perspective, but rather to take advantage of the unique occasion to offer students a more focused view. Examining Czech literary history as a specific example of the European history of national, cultural and political emancipation plans to guide &quot;newcomers&quot; along the most important cultural streams influencing the face of Czech literature in the 19th and 20th centuries. The larger cultural context includes the political role of art and literature in Czech history, language, religion, social and national currents and crosscurrents, as well as its Central and East European dimension.   Sample syllabus                              Sociology                                                  Collective Identity in a Totalitarian Regime -\u00a0SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               This course examines the totalitarian oppression from the point of view of ordinary citizens in communist Czechoslovakia. It focuses on the construction of collective mentality through everyday official/public and unofficial/private activities, including mass parades, ceremonies and performances, work relations, children\u2019s education, housing schemes or collective vacationing. The goal of the seminar is to demonstrate the consequences of life in an oppressive regime: suppression of fundamental forms of civic interaction, such as independent public communication, and distortion of moral and behavioral norms. At the end of the semester, students will be able to evaluate the main theoretical concepts and historical events of totalitarianism against the background of specific activities, problems and aspirations of the people directly affected by life in a totalitarian system, the citizens of communist Czechoslovakia.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Contemporary Issues in Law: Law and Human Rights in Central Europe - SOC-UA 9413 - 4 points                               This course explores the development of the rule of law and human rights issues in post-communist Central Europe. We will also refer to transitional systems outside the post-communist region. Although dealing with Central European region, we will often talk about American situation as well. First, we will face a short introduction into the history of the Central European region and its culture of human rights, and try to delineate this region. Next, we will examine the historical, national and international context of making constitutionalism and the rule of law in Central Europe. We will try to understand what human rights actually mean. We will face the debates that occurred when emerging democracies dealt with the former communist regimes. On several case studies, we will explain several basic attitudes towards the former communist regimes, its apparatchiks, its agents, and collaborators (lustration laws and dealing with the communist crimes). We will compare these approaches with those found elsewhere (South Africa, Latin America). Furthermore, we will examine contemporary human rights debates surrounding abortion, freedom of speech, social rights, the relation between religion and the state, the discrimination against minorities, gay rights, gender discrimination, affirmative action etc. We will also analyze the Western legal transplants in Central Europe and the post-communist application of basic rights. Finally, we will deal with the European Union and the legal dimension of the European Enlargement of 2004.

Sample Syllabus                                  Anthropology                                                  Roma in Central East Europe: Enthnographic and Historical Overview Of A People Without A State - ANTH-UA 9200 - 4 points                               The course will introduce students to the development of Romany politics and culture from a persecuted minority through to the emergence of Romany organizations with an emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe. The aim is to challenge any essentializing view on Roma as either a people outside or/and without society or as perennial victims of oppression. Two main approaches have dominated the teaching of Romany issues: a culturalist/ethnic approach, which stresses Romany cultures, and an economistic approach, which stresses \u00b4poverty.\u00b4 This course will challenge mono-causal and a-historic explanations for the social situation of Roma and will stimulate students to think about Roma in a critical holistic way that brings into consideration the societies they live in. Building on a diverse selection of empirical material, ranging from ethnographic, historical and sociological case studies to artistic representations of Roma, the course will present the Roma \u201cas good to think\u201d for our comprehension of current social issues. The course is divided into three interconnected thematic blocks \u2013 1. Identity, community and culture, 2. Power, the State and social stratification, 3. History, memory and politics of representation \u2013 which will allow to cover much of the current debates on the plight of European Roma as well as a grasp of social theories on marginality.

The course begins with the pre-Romanesque and Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Classicism periods. The major focus will be on 19th and 20th Century architectural styles from Historicism and Art Nouveau through Cubism, Art-D\u00e9co, Avant-garde Functionalism, post-war Stalinist art and architecture, and the contemporary. It's necessary to have an understanding of the evolution of Mid European art and architecture, town planning and theory.

The course will be rooted in a discussion of the city of Prague, and students are encouraged through excursions and assignments to become acquainted with the city's architecture, monuments and urban design. Students will learn to analyse formal aspects of art and architectural styles (from Romanesque to modern) and will also be encouraged to investigate their sources and theoretical foundations. Emphasis will be given to the historical and cultural context of art styles and movements. We will also look at art patronage in some key periods of Czech history to see how this reflects political, cultural and ideological change. Classroom lectures will be combined with regular excursions to examine works of art and architecture at first hand. These will include architectural walking tours and visits to temporary exhibitions as well as the city's major art galleries.

During the semester, students focus on the strategic implications of communication for modern organizations. A variety of assignments are given to stress the following communication competencies: written, spoken and nonverbal communication basics for business; effective team communication strategies; informative, persuasive and collaborative presentations; communication techniques for required junior and senior year projects. Students regularly receive personal feedback about their writing and their oral presentations from instructors and staff.

NYU Stern students may take this course as a third Stern course at NYU Prague.   NYU College of Arts and Sciences Economics Department Students: Please note this course CANNOT be taken for major or minor credit.   The subject of the course is to describe one of the most profound changes to take place in the history of the world economy - the rapid change from centrally planned economies to market economies throughout what used to be known as &quot;the Soviet block&quot;. Although some reforms in some countries began much earlier, the true transition began in most Central and Eastern European countries roughly in 1990. This means that scholars and researchers are only now beginning to have the data and a sufficient distance needed to study and analyze the transition process.   Sample syllabus                                  College Core Curriculum                                                  Cultures and Contexts: Russia - Between East &amp; West - CORE-UA 9510 - 4 points                               Russia\u2019s rich and multifaced cultural identity has been shaped in a thousand year long process of interaction with a range of diverse cultural formations of the \u2018West\u2019 and \u2018East\u2019 (including Byzantine/ Christian \u2018East\u2019, Central Asian/Muslim \u2018East\u2019, South Asian/Indian \u2018East\u201d, and East Asian/Confucian \u2018East\u2019). For the last 300 years, since the era of Peter the Great, Russia\u2019s greatest statesmen, philosphers, religious thinkers, writers, poets and creative artists were obssesed with the question of Russia\u2019s distinctive cultural identity. This passionate search for the \u2018Russian soul\u2019 is apparently far from over, as the recent rise of interest in the ideas of \u2018Eurasianism\u2019 and \u2018Neo-Slavophilism\u2019 testifies. This course in Russian intellectual history explores the sources of Russia\u2019s unique cultural blend through examination of some of the principal textual and artistic images representative of traditions that emerged at the geographic and cultural crossroads of Eastern Europe, including those which constitute Russia\u2019s unique contribution to world culture. Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, community, individual, gender, and the &quot;other.&quot;   Sample syllabus                                                                      Cultures and Contexts: Prague, in the Heart of Central Europe -\u00a0CORE-UA 9548 - 4 points                               Prague is without doubts one of the most important historical, geopolitical and cultural capitals of Central Europe. The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often, it is characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East. However, most scholars agree that there is a distinct Central European culture. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel and Dvorak, to mention at least some. Central European culture is based on historical, social and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity. It is a result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of its history. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of course location in Prague, students have the opportunity to examine the primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment.   Sample syllabus                                Comparative Literature                                                  Kafka and his Contexts - COLIT-UA 9136 and SASEM-UG 9401 - 4 points                               &quot;A book must be an ax for the frozen sea in us,&quot; wrote Franz Kafka (1883-1924), one of the best known but least understood authors of our times. In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.

Please note this course CANNOT be taken for major or minor credit by students in NYU's College of Arts and Sciences Economics Department.                    European &amp; Mediterranean Studies                                                  European Security after the Cold War -\u00a0EURO-UA 9157 - 4 points                               This course will try to put European security into the context of today\u2019s world: from the collapse of communism and dissolution of the Warsaw Pact through the years of wars in the former Yugoslavia, the wars on former Soviet territory, and to the stateless threat of terrorism today. But study limited to Europe would be pointless; the Old Continent is no longer the prime player on the planet. Therefore a series of related topics and areas will also be discussed: U.S. military might (especially compared to the European armed forces); the situation in adjacent regions (North Africa, Middle East, Russia and Ukraine) and its implication for Europe; and the new types of terrorism.   Sample syllabus                                                                    The Political Economy of Europe from a Global Perspective - EURO-UA 9294 - 4 points                               The overriding goal of this course is to reach an understanding of the key strategic issues facing Europe today and how they impact on the political economy of the region. We will track how Europe has reached the present critical juncture in its history and consider where it is headed, including the options available to European policy-makers amid the on-going crisis in the Eurozone. To this end, we will examine the key events of the 19th and 20th centuries that led to the foundation of the EU and have shaped contemporary Europe. At the same time, we will consider Europe\u2019s relations with the US as today\u2019s sole superpower, the challenges posed by the resurgence of China and Russia and Europe\u2019s role as a major player in the resource-rich Eurasian continent, where a new round of great power competition is unfolding.   The course draws largely on political economy but also on history, international relations and geopolitics. It aims to raise questions and stimulate discussion rather than provide clear-cut answers.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Modern Dissent in Central Europe: The Art of Defeat -\u00a0EURO-UA 9301 and SASEM-UG 9400 - 4 points                               Totalitarian ideologies which were used in European political discourse in the twentieth century to explain major historical changes have changed forever the relationship between the state and its citizens. The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Western European Comparative Politics -\u00a0EURO-UA 9510 or POL-UA 9510 - 4 points                               This course will concentrate on the analysis of the pursuits of democracy in Western Europe. Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Imagining America, Imagining Europe-\u00a0EURO-UA 9173 - 4 points                               This class is devoted not only to a &quot;close reading&quot; of the selected texts, but also to relevant broader issues. While the approach and methods are interdisciplinary, the main emphasis is on literary theory (explaining and applying basic literary terms), literary history (both American and European), and literary criticism (analyzing different responses to given works). Every class starts with the oral presentation delivered by a student, then there is a short lecture by the teacher, and a discussion follows.   Sample syllabus                              Film and Television                                                    Seminar in Czech Cinema - IFMTV-UT 1040 - 4 points                               Emphasizing one of the most influential film movements in the post-World War II era, the cinema of the Czech New Wave. This cinema studies course explores the history and development of Czech and Slovak cinema. Lectures are supplemented with screenings.

It is fundamentally about deciding not to conform with repressive regimes. It is also about choosing a mode of action that brings with it personal dangers even when, as is usual, it advocates non-violence. This course examines the nature and significance of civil resistance in Central and Eastern Europe in the 20th century. In studying resistance literature (including poetry and song), art and film, we will draw on ideas and arguments from the disciplines of history, political science, literature, art criticism, film studies and psychology.

The course will cover masterpieces of Russian, Hungarian, German, Polish and Czech cinematography, focusing on several crucial periods of history, in particular WWII and its aftermath, showing moral dilemmas of individuals and nations under the Nazi regime as well as revealing the bitter truth of the Stalinist years.

In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.   Sample syllabus                              Hebrew and Judaic Studies                                                  Modern Jewish History - HBRJD-UA 9103 - 4 points                               One hundred and fifty years ago all Jews had three things in common: every Jew prayed in Hebrew, he submitted to God\u2018s commandments and awaited the coming of the Messiah. Today, Jews have only one thing in common \u2013 every Jew asks what it means to be a Jew.\u201c These are words of David ben Gurion after the Second World War. The period of the 18th to the 20th centuries of modern Jewish history in Europe belongs to the most dynamic in the whole Jewish history. What are the reasons for such radical changes? Were there differences between the development in Western, Central and Eastern Europe?&amp;; How did the changes affect Jewish religious, cultural, linguistic and national identity? These questions build the core of this course.   Sample syllabus                                History                                                  The Cultural History of the City in Central Europe: Prague, Budapest, Vienna and Berlin -\u00a0HIST-UA 9091 - 4 points                               The process of urbanization in the modern era has reflected the economic differences, the social and aesthetic customs, and the political nuances of the European nations and of Europe as a whole. Students will consider numerous issues of city planning and growth. Topics will include patterns of cultural distinctiveness, the influence of ethnic and religious concerns, and the political implications apparent in architectural design, neighborhood development, housing policies, and public space.   Sample syllabus                                                                    History of Nationalism in Central and Eastern Europe -\u00a0HIST-UA 9176 - 4 points                               In the 20th Century, three phenomena had fateful consequences for Central and Eastern Europe: (1) the unsuccessful attempt to eliminate, after WWI, national tension by creating new nation-states, and the encounters with both major totalitarian ideologies, (2) Nazism and (3) Communism. The present eruptions of nationalism are rooted in the heritage of these phenomena. Comparative histories of the formation of modern national identities, including the 'national awakening' of non-dominant nations, will be interpreted against the backdrop of national policies of multi-ethnic states, national programs and leaders. The major focus of the course will be oriented toward topics surrounding post-WWI Central and Eastern Europe, Nazism and Communism. We will examine the disintegration of post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, discuss the ethnic conflicts, policies toward minorities and xenophobia. The bibliography of required and recommended reading will be handed out in class, the abbreviated titles are in the syllabus. The guidelines for mid-term and finals will be available in class two weeks before the scheduled exam.

Several forms and techniques will be explored through lecture, discussion and assignments, including: news reports, interviews, reviews (film, literature, theater), feature stories, essays, and commentaries. During the course, students will learn not only about Prague's cultural landscape but they will be encouraged to examine it in various journalistic and literary forms. One of the leading aims of this courses is also to introduce to them six extraordinary persons, whose work in their respective areas reached international attention.   Sample syllabus                                                                    International Reporting (Elective Topics) -\u00a0JOUR-UA\u00a09204 - 4 points                               This course will focus on foreign reporting in US and British newspapers and journals, looking at the history of foreign reporting, the different kinds of media in which it appears, the topics it covers and the skills necessary to perform it. Students will read and discuss contemporary reporting and famous reportage from the past, listen to foreign correspondents and write their own stories. By the end of the course students should have a good understanding of foreign reporting and will be well equipped with some of the practical skills necessary to follow it as a career.

Global Media Seminar: East-Central Europe - JOUR-UA 9505 and MCC-UE 9453 - 4 points                               The idea of the course is to inform students about European media in general, and about transformation of the Czech media after the Velvet revolution in 1989 in particular. Czech developments will be presented on the background of a wider European perspective in order to make students acquainted with the basic features of European landscape of print and electronic media. Due to the lack of literature and printed sources in English language on the subject, the course will extensively exploit internet sources related to the topics.   Sample syllabus                              Law and Society                                                    Topics in Law and Society: Society and the Philosophy of Law -\u00a0LWSOC-UA 9251- 4 points                               This course will begin by reviewing the nature and sources of law. Yet it will do so not as part of a purely academic exercise but in order to answer some very practical philosophical questions, such as: Why isn't law the same thing as justice? Where does legality end and revolution begin? Why does the Anglo-American legal system make legal resolution into a game? Are war crimes tribunals legal proceedings or merely victor's revenge dressed up in procedural garb? Why doesn't law which is considered divinely inspired (i.e. the Old and New Testaments) serve as a legitimate basis of law in the West? The aim of this course is to show how understanding the nature and sources of law can help us understand real-world events and issues. By the end of the course students will have an appreciation of the limits of law and how law fits into the fabric of society alongside other norms, such as morality and religion. Students should also learn to identify interconnections and relationships between ideas in seemingly disparate areas of thought.

Students will read, watch, analyze and discuss a variety of text specific commercials. Attention will be devoted also to the impact of advertising on the post-communist world and to the ways by which cultural issues are framed and kept in mind in the media discourse. The main objective is to provide an introductory course that is meaningful and of practical importance to students. The course examines Advertising not only as an academic discipline, but also a way of perceiving and understanding our society.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Social Media Networking - MCC-UE 9032 - 4 points                               This course will examine \u201csocial media\u201d from a cultural perspective, with a focus on how media technologies figure in practices of everyday life and in the construction of social relationships and identities. Although many of our readings will deal with Social Network Sites (SNSs), we will attempt to form an expansive definition of what constitutes \u201csocial media.\u201d We will also work from an expansive definition of \u201ctechnology,\u201d considering the term in a cultural sense to include various practices and tools used to communicate in everyday life.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Media and Cultural Analysis -\u00a0MCC-UE 9014 - 4 points                               An introduction to the theoretical approaches and practices used to analyze the content, structure, and context of media in society. Students will explore factors shaping modern media texts, including: politics, economics, technology, and cultural traditions. The dominant critical perspectives that contribute to our understanding of media will be read, discussed, and employed. The course has three broad objectives: Develop a critical awareness of media environments, develop a familiarity with concepts, themes and theoretical approaches of media criticism, and the terms associated with these approaches, and develop an ability to adopt and adapt these frameworks in your own analyses of mediated communication. Students' active class participation is vital to this process. Active participation includes listening, building on what others say, asking questions, advancing reasoned arguments, identifying theories that are relevant to the discussion, and working collaboratively with others. Missing class and/or a record of lateness will negatively affect the final grade. An absence will be excused only in case of a medical emergency (or other extraordinary circumstance) which is justified with appropriate documentation.

A veritable buzzword, globalization refers to several newly emerged phenomena. To study it means to delve into several areas in which it manifests itself. These are, to name just the three most visible ones, the economy, culture and politics. In any of these dimensions globalization, as it is discussed in the last twenty years, functions through the media. Media does not portray globalization, but it is its important part. A study of globalization is inherently diverse and eclectic. So is this course. Students will read, watch films, analyze and discuss them. In class discussions and short papers they are expected to engage questions, issues, themes and topics connected to globalization, culture and the media. Special attention will be devoted to the impact of globalization on the late communist and post-communist world, and also to the ways by which the globalization issues are framed and discussed in the media discourse. All assigned texts and films are mandatory. Students are required to follow current events in the media (cable TV, newspapers, Internet). Class participation is expected as it is part of the final grade.

We will examine several periods, including 1). The interwar period and the development of the first modern political systems; 2) World War II, German occupation and resistance, and official and unofficial political systems; 3). Sovietization and the adoption of non-democratic political system; 4). The Communist Era in Eastern &amp; Central Europe; 5). Democratic transitions; 6) and the processes of democratic consolidation. The course uses a comparative approach, using a few basic theories of political science to analyze the Central &amp; Eastern European case. Topics include types of political regimes, creation and breakdown of democratic systems, constitutions and state systems, political parties, elections etc.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Central Europe, NATO and the European Union POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               The course &quot;Central Europe, EU and NATO&quot; provides students with an overview of the history, institutional and political structures, and major current debates in the European integration process, including its Atlantic dimension. In particular, the course concentrates on the trends triggered by EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007, the security situation after 9/11 and the impact of globalization on EU economic and social governance.   Sample syllabus                                                                    European-American Relations in the 21st Century - POL-UA\u00a09598 - 4 points                               This course explores the recent history and the current state of political, economic and cultural relations between the United States and Europe. Ever since the end of the World War II, the cooperative relationship between these two parts of the world, often described as &quot;The West&quot;, has been a bedrock of international stability, security and prosperity. After the end of the Cold War, this relationship has undergone changes, along with the whole system of international relations. Recently, on both sides of the Atlantic, the talk has been about a crisis of the Euro-American relationship. We will examine the validity of these claims, the causes of the current disagreements and possible ways of overcoming them. Throughout, we will emphasize the overwhelming nature of common values and interests on both sides of the Atlantic as well as the risks stemming from a potential rift for both Europe and America. We will examine the compatibility of current European and U.S. policies with respect to third countries or regions, such as Russia, the Middle East, China, and other parts of the Globe. We will also analyze the specific role played in this relationship by countries of Central and Eastern Europe as relative newcomers to democracy, to the Atlantic Alliance and to European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Czech and Slovak Modern History in the Central European Context - POL-UA\u00a09994 - 4 points                               This course tells the story of the region in the geographical trap between Germany and Russia. The establishment of Czechoslovakia, the post-WW II expulsion of the German minority, Stalinism, the Prague Spring of 1968, dissident movements, the Velvet Revolution of 1989, transition to democracy, V\u00e1clav Havel and the post-Havel era will all be studied. Students will gain basic knowledge on Central European political, historical and economic issues. Critical reading of sources and independent thinking required.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Germany and East Central Europe (1871-2000) - HIST-UA9514 or POL-UA 9515 - 4 points                               This course will focus on the history of the culturally rich region of &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; through analysis of the parallel evolution of Germany and the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary. Mitteleuropa as a region produced such important figures as Franz Kafka, Gustav Mahler, Sigmund Freud, Theodor Herzl and Milan Kundera; historical personalities whose influence internationally is indisputable. We'll delve into the history of the region and on the central role played by German politics and culture from the end of the 19th century, through the turbulent 20th century to the present day.   Emphasis will be on the evolution of the concept of nationalism as well as on Germany's foreign policy in the &quot;concert of nations&quot;, especially towards its Eastern neighbors. The aim is to achieve an understanding of the complex evolution of national entities and their interaction between the birth of the modern German state and the integration of the Visegr\u00e1d countries in NATO and the European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Western European Comparative Politics -\u00a0EURO-UA 9510 or POL-UA 9510 - 4 points                               This course will concentrate on the analysis of the pursuits of democracy in Western Europe. Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.   Sample syllabus                              Religious Studies                                                  Religion, Culture and Politics in Eastern and Central Europe -\u00a0RELST-UA 9360 - 4 points                               Religion is without doubt one of the most important elements that shaped the history and contemporary face of Central Europe. Religion played an important role in the political and cultural development of this part of the world. The history of the mutual interaction between religion and politics is evident in the cultural richness of this part of the world, particularly in Bohemia and Prague.   This course explores various religious phenomena that formed political ideas and cultural values of this region indifferent historical periods. We examine particularly those religious characteristics and figures that remarkably influenced the world's history and enriched human thinking. First, we study the Christianization of Central European society and the prominent role of religion in the political and cultural transformation of the medieval period. Then we follow the religious reformation process and development of the relationship between Judeo-Christian tradition and the secular world in the early modern period. Finally, we explore the policies of communist regimes in the spheres of religion and culture and study the struggle of Christian churches against communist totalitarianism. The transformation of Catholicism in the 1960s is also examined together with the role of religion in post-communist society.   Excursions to significant historical and religious sights are an important part of the course.   Sample syllabus                                Russian and Slavic Studies                                                    Contemporary Central and East European Literature: From Kafka to Kundera -\u00a0RUSSN-UA 9832 - 4 points                               The idea of the course is not to bring a full and detailed picture of the whole of modern and contemporary Central and East European literature into perspective, but rather to take advantage of the unique occasion to offer students a more focused view. Examining Czech literary history as a specific example of the European history of national, cultural and political emancipation plans to guide &quot;newcomers&quot; along the most important cultural streams influencing the face of Czech literature in the 19th and 20th centuries. The larger cultural context includes the political role of art and literature in Czech history, language, religion, social and national currents and crosscurrents, as well as its Central and East European dimension.

It focuses on the construction of collective mentality through everyday official/public and unofficial/private activities, including mass parades, ceremonies and performances, work relations, children\u2019s education, housing schemes or collective vacationing. The goal of the seminar is to demonstrate the consequences of life in an oppressive regime: suppression of fundamental forms of civic interaction, such as independent public communication, and distortion of moral and behavioral norms. At the end of the semester, students will be able to evaluate the main theoretical concepts and historical events of totalitarianism against the background of specific activities, problems and aspirations of the people directly affected by life in a totalitarian system, the citizens of communist Czechoslovakia.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Contemporary Issues in Law: Law and Human Rights in Central Europe - SOC-UA 9413 - 4 points                               This course explores the development of the rule of law and human rights issues in post-communist Central Europe. We will also refer to transitional systems outside the post-communist region. Although dealing with Central European region, we will often talk about American situation as well. First, we will face a short introduction into the history of the Central European region and its culture of human rights, and try to delineate this region. Next, we will examine the historical, national and international context of making constitutionalism and the rule of law in Central Europe. We will try to understand what human rights actually mean. We will face the debates that occurred when emerging democracies dealt with the former communist regimes. On several case studies, we will explain several basic attitudes towards the former communist regimes, its apparatchiks, its agents, and collaborators (lustration laws and dealing with the communist crimes). We will compare these approaches with those found elsewhere (South Africa, Latin America). Furthermore, we will examine contemporary human rights debates surrounding abortion, freedom of speech, social rights, the relation between religion and the state, the discrimination against minorities, gay rights, gender discrimination, affirmative action etc. We will also analyze the Western legal transplants in Central Europe and the post-communist application of basic rights. Finally, we will deal with the European Union and the legal dimension of the European Enlargement of 2004.

Since the size of the claass is usually small we can put great emphasis on improving speaking in Russian on various subjects. Students will be given short topics to talk about at the beginning of every lesson and most written essays will have to be presented orally in class.   Sample Syllabus                                  Anthropology                                                  Roma in Central East Europe: Enthnographic and Historical Overview Of A People Without A State - ANTH-UA 9200 - 4 points                               The course will introduce students to the development of Romany politics and culture from a persecuted minority through to the emergence of Romany organizations with an emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe. The aim is to challenge any essentializing view on Roma as either a people outside or/and without society or as perennial victims of oppression. Two main approaches have dominated the teaching of Romany issues: a culturalist/ethnic approach, which stresses Romany cultures, and an economistic approach, which stresses \u00b4poverty.\u00b4 This course will challenge mono-causal and a-historic explanations for the social situation of Roma and will stimulate students to think about Roma in a critical holistic way that brings into consideration the societies they live in. Building on a diverse selection of empirical material, ranging from ethnographic, historical and sociological case studies to artistic representations of Roma, the course will present the Roma \u201cas good to think\u201d for our comprehension of current social issues. The course is divided into three interconnected thematic blocks \u2013 1. Identity, community and culture, 2. Power, the State and social stratification, 3. History, memory and politics of representation \u2013 which will allow to cover much of the current debates on the plight of European Roma as well as a grasp of social theories on marginality.

The course begins with the pre-Romanesque and Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Classicism periods. The major focus will be on 19th and 20th Century architectural styles from Historicism and Art Nouveau through Cubism, Art-D\u00e9co, Avant-garde Functionalism, post-war Stalinist art and architecture, and the contemporary. It's necessary to have an understanding of the evolution of Mid European art and architecture, town planning and theory.

The course will be rooted in a discussion of the city of Prague, and students are encouraged through excursions and assignments to become acquainted with the city's architecture, monuments and urban design. Students will learn to analyse formal aspects of art and architectural styles (from Romanesque to modern) and will also be encouraged to investigate their sources and theoretical foundations. Emphasis will be given to the historical and cultural context of art styles and movements. We will also look at art patronage in some key periods of Czech history to see how this reflects political, cultural and ideological change. Classroom lectures will be combined with regular excursions to examine works of art and architecture at first hand. These will include architectural walking tours and visits to temporary exhibitions as well as the city's major art galleries.

NYU Stern students may take this course as a third Stern course at NYU Prague.   NYU College of Arts and Sciences Economics Department Students: Please note this course CANNOT be taken for major or minor credit.   The subject of the course is to describe one of the most profound changes to take place in the history of the world economy - the rapid change from centrally planned economies to market economies throughout what used to be known as &quot;the Soviet block&quot;. Although some reforms in some countries began much earlier, the true transition began in most Central and Eastern European countries roughly in 1990. This means that scholars and researchers are only now beginning to have the data and a sufficient distance needed to study and analyze the transition process.   Sample syllabus                                  College Core Curriculum                                                  Cultures and Contexts: Russia - Between East &amp; West - CORE-UA 9510 - 4 points                               Russia\u2019s rich and multifaced cultural identity has been shaped in a thousand year long process of interaction with a range of diverse cultural formations of the \u2018West\u2019 and \u2018East\u2019 (including Byzantine/ Christian \u2018East\u2019, Central Asian/Muslim \u2018East\u2019, South Asian/Indian \u2018East\u201d, and East Asian/Confucian \u2018East\u2019). For the last 300 years, since the era of Peter the Great, Russia\u2019s greatest statesmen, philosphers, religious thinkers, writers, poets and creative artists were obssesed with the question of Russia\u2019s distinctive cultural identity. This passionate search for the \u2018Russian soul\u2019 is apparently far from over, as the recent rise of interest in the ideas of \u2018Eurasianism\u2019 and \u2018Neo-Slavophilism\u2019 testifies. This course in Russian intellectual history explores the sources of Russia\u2019s unique cultural blend through examination of some of the principal textual and artistic images representative of traditions that emerged at the geographic and cultural crossroads of Eastern Europe, including those which constitute Russia\u2019s unique contribution to world culture. Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, community, individual, gender, and the &quot;other.&quot;   Sample syllabus                                                                      Cultures and Contexts: Prague, in the Heart of Central Europe -\u00a0CORE-UA 9548 - 4 points                               Prague is without doubts one of the most important historical, geopolitical and cultural capitals of Central Europe. The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often, it is characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East. However, most scholars agree that there is a distinct Central European culture. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel and Dvorak, to mention at least some. Central European culture is based on historical, social and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity. It is a result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of its history. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of course location in Prague, students have the opportunity to examine the primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment.   Sample syllabus                                Comparative Literature                                                  Kafka and his Contexts - COLIT-UA 9136 and SASEM-UG 9401 - 4 points                               &quot;A book must be an ax for the frozen sea in us,&quot; wrote Franz Kafka (1883-1924), one of the best known but least understood authors of our times. In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.   Sample syllabus                              Economics        Ownership and Corporate Control in Advanced and Transition Economies is now offered through the Stern School of Business's Economics Department.

But study limited to Europe would be pointless; the Old Continent is no longer the prime player on the planet. Therefore a series of related topics and areas will also be discussed: U.S. military might (especially compared to the European armed forces); the situation in adjacent regions (North Africa, Middle East, Russia and Ukraine) and its implication for Europe; and the new types of terrorism.   Sample syllabus                                                                    The Political Economy of Europe from a Global Perspective - EURO-UA 9294 - 4 points                               The overriding goal of this course is to reach an understanding of the key strategic issues facing Europe today and how they impact on the political economy of the region. We will track how Europe has reached the present critical juncture in its history and consider where it is headed, including the options available to European policy-makers amid the on-going crisis in the Eurozone. To this end, we will examine the key events of the 19th and 20th centuries that led to the foundation of the EU and have shaped contemporary Europe. At the same time, we will consider Europe\u2019s relations with the US as today\u2019s sole superpower, the challenges posed by the resurgence of China and Russia and Europe\u2019s role as a major player in the resource-rich Eurasian continent, where a new round of great power competition is unfolding.   The course draws largely on political economy but also on history, international relations and geopolitics. It aims to raise questions and stimulate discussion rather than provide clear-cut answers.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Modern Dissent in Central Europe: The Art of Defeat -\u00a0EURO-UA 9301 and SASEM-UG 9400 - 4 points                               Totalitarian ideologies which were used in European political discourse in the twentieth century to explain major historical changes have changed forever the relationship between the state and its citizens. The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Western European Comparative Politics -\u00a0EURO-UA 9510 or POL-UA 9510 - 4 points                               This course will concentrate on the analysis of the pursuits of democracy in Western Europe. Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Imagining America, Imagining Europe-\u00a0EURO-UA 9173 - 4 points                               This class is devoted not only to a &quot;close reading&quot; of the selected texts, but also to relevant broader issues. While the approach and methods are interdisciplinary, the main emphasis is on literary theory (explaining and applying basic literary terms), literary history (both American and European), and literary criticism (analyzing different responses to given works). Every class starts with the oral presentation delivered by a student, then there is a short lecture by the teacher, and a discussion follows.   Sample syllabus                              Film and Television                                                    Seminar in Czech Cinema - IFMTV-UT 1040 - 4 points                               Emphasizing one of the most influential film movements in the post-World War II era, the cinema of the Czech New Wave. This cinema studies course explores the history and development of Czech and Slovak cinema. Lectures are supplemented with screenings.

It is fundamentally about deciding not to conform with repressive regimes. It is also about choosing a mode of action that brings with it personal dangers even when, as is usual, it advocates non-violence. This course examines the nature and significance of civil resistance in Central and Eastern Europe in the 20th century. In studying resistance literature (including poetry and song), art and film, we will draw on ideas and arguments from the disciplines of history, political science, literature, art criticism, film studies and psychology.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Central European Film - SASEM-UG 9403- 4 points                               This interdisciplinary seminar is designed to discuss and question the identity of specific nations in European space, which has always been a fascinating crossroad of ideas and ideologies as well as the birthplace of wars and totalitarian systems. The course will cover masterpieces of Russian, Hungarian, German, Polish and Czech cinematography, focusing on several crucial periods of history, in particular WWII and its aftermath, showing moral dilemmas of individuals and nations under the Nazi regime as well as revealing the bitter truth of the Stalinist years.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Modern Dissent in Central Europe: The Art of Defeat -\u00a0EURO-UA 9301 and SASEM-UG 9400 - 4 points                               Totalitarian ideologies which were used in European political discourse in the twentieth century to explain major historical changes have changed forever the relationship between the state and its citizens. The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Kafka and his Contexts - COLIT-UA 9136 and SASEM-UG 9401 - 4 points                               &quot;A book must be an ax for the frozen sea in us,&quot; wrote Franz Kafka (1883-1924), one of the best known but least understood authors of our times. In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.   Sample syllabus                              Hebrew and Judaic Studies                                                  Modern Jewish History - HBRJD-UA 9103 - 4 points                               One hundred and fifty years ago all Jews had three things in common: every Jew prayed in Hebrew, he submitted to God\u2018s commandments and awaited the coming of the Messiah. Today, Jews have only one thing in common \u2013 every Jew asks what it means to be a Jew.\u201c These are words of David ben Gurion after the Second World War. The period of the 18th to the 20th centuries of modern Jewish history in Europe belongs to the most dynamic in the whole Jewish history. What are the reasons for such radical changes? Were there differences between the development in Western, Central and Eastern Europe?&amp;; How did the changes affect Jewish religious, cultural, linguistic and national identity? These questions build the core of this course.

Students will consider numerous issues of city planning and growth. Topics will include patterns of cultural distinctiveness, the influence of ethnic and religious concerns, and the political implications apparent in architectural design, neighborhood development, housing policies, and public space.   Sample syllabus                                                                    History of Nationalism in Central and Eastern Europe -\u00a0HIST-UA 9176 - 4 points                               In the 20th Century, three phenomena had fateful consequences for Central and Eastern Europe: (1) the unsuccessful attempt to eliminate, after WWI, national tension by creating new nation-states, and the encounters with both major totalitarian ideologies, (2) Nazism and (3) Communism. The present eruptions of nationalism are rooted in the heritage of these phenomena. Comparative histories of the formation of modern national identities, including the 'national awakening' of non-dominant nations, will be interpreted against the backdrop of national policies of multi-ethnic states, national programs and leaders. The major focus of the course will be oriented toward topics surrounding post-WWI Central and Eastern Europe, Nazism and Communism. We will examine the disintegration of post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, discuss the ethnic conflicts, policies toward minorities and xenophobia. The bibliography of required and recommended reading will be handed out in class, the abbreviated titles are in the syllabus. The guidelines for mid-term and finals will be available in class two weeks before the scheduled exam.

Several forms and techniques will be explored through lecture, discussion and assignments, including: news reports, interviews, reviews (film, literature, theater), feature stories, essays, and commentaries. During the course, students will learn not only about Prague's cultural landscape but they will be encouraged to examine it in various journalistic and literary forms. One of the leading aims of this courses is also to introduce to them six extraordinary persons, whose work in their respective areas reached international attention.

Students will read and discuss contemporary reporting and famous reportage from the past, listen to foreign correspondents and write their own stories. By the end of the course students should have a good understanding of foreign reporting and will be well equipped with some of the practical skills necessary to follow it as a career.

Global Media Seminar: East-Central Europe - JOUR-UA 9505 and MCC-UE 9453 - 4 points                               The idea of the course is to inform students about European media in general, and about transformation of the Czech media after the Velvet revolution in 1989 in particular. Czech developments will be presented on the background of a wider European perspective in order to make students acquainted with the basic features of European landscape of print and electronic media. Due to the lack of literature and printed sources in English language on the subject, the course will extensively exploit internet sources related to the topics.

Yet it will do so not as part of a purely academic exercise but in order to answer some very practical philosophical questions, such as: Why isn't law the same thing as justice? Where does legality end and revolution begin? Why does the Anglo-American legal system make legal resolution into a game? Are war crimes tribunals legal proceedings or merely victor's revenge dressed up in procedural garb? Why doesn't law which is considered divinely inspired (i.e. the Old and New Testaments) serve as a legitimate basis of law in the West? The aim of this course is to show how understanding the nature and sources of law can help us understand real-world events and issues. By the end of the course students will have an appreciation of the limits of law and how law fits into the fabric of society alongside other norms, such as morality and religion. Students should also learn to identify interconnections and relationships between ideas in seemingly disparate areas of thought.

Students will read, watch, analyze and discuss a variety of text specific commercials. Attention will be devoted also to the impact of advertising on the post-communist world and to the ways by which cultural issues are framed and kept in mind in the media discourse. The main objective is to provide an introductory course that is meaningful and of practical importance to students. The course examines Advertising not only as an academic discipline, but also a way of perceiving and understanding our society.

Although many of our readings will deal with Social Network Sites (SNSs), we will attempt to form an expansive definition of what constitutes \u201csocial media.\u201d We will also work from an expansive definition of \u201ctechnology,\u201d considering the term in a cultural sense to include various practices and tools used to communicate in everyday life.

Students will explore factors shaping modern media texts, including: politics, economics, technology, and cultural traditions. The dominant critical perspectives that contribute to our understanding of media will be read, discussed, and employed. The course has three broad objectives: Develop a critical awareness of media environments, develop a familiarity with concepts, themes and theoretical approaches of media criticism, and the terms associated with these approaches, and develop an ability to adopt and adapt these frameworks in your own analyses of mediated communication. Students' active class participation is vital to this process. Active participation includes listening, building on what others say, asking questions, advancing reasoned arguments, identifying theories that are relevant to the discussion, and working collaboratively with others. Missing class and/or a record of lateness will negatively affect the final grade. An absence will be excused only in case of a medical emergency (or other extraordinary circumstance) which is justified with appropriate documentation.

A veritable buzzword, globalization refers to several newly emerged phenomena. To study it means to delve into several areas in which it manifests itself. These are, to name just the three most visible ones, the economy, culture and politics. In any of these dimensions globalization, as it is discussed in the last twenty years, functions through the media. Media does not portray globalization, but it is its important part. A study of globalization is inherently diverse and eclectic. So is this course. Students will read, watch films, analyze and discuss them. In class discussions and short papers they are expected to engage questions, issues, themes and topics connected to globalization, culture and the media. Special attention will be devoted to the impact of globalization on the late communist and post-communist world, and also to the ways by which the globalization issues are framed and discussed in the media discourse. All assigned texts and films are mandatory. Students are required to follow current events in the media (cable TV, newspapers, Internet). Class participation is expected as it is part of the final grade.

Politics                                                  East European Government and\u00a0Politics - POL-UA 9522 - 4 points                               This course is an introduction to the modern politics and government of Central and Eastern Europe from the beginning of the Twentieth Century to the present. We will examine several periods, including 1). The interwar period and the development of the first modern political systems; 2) World War II, German occupation and resistance, and official and unofficial political systems; 3). Sovietization and the adoption of non-democratic political system; 4). The Communist Era in Eastern &amp; Central Europe; 5). Democratic transitions; 6) and the processes of democratic consolidation. The course uses a comparative approach, using a few basic theories of political science to analyze the Central &amp; Eastern European case. Topics include types of political regimes, creation and breakdown of democratic systems, constitutions and state systems, political parties, elections etc.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Central Europe, NATO and the European Union POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               The course &quot;Central Europe, EU and NATO&quot; provides students with an overview of the history, institutional and political structures, and major current debates in the European integration process, including its Atlantic dimension. In particular, the course concentrates on the trends triggered by EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007, the security situation after 9/11 and the impact of globalization on EU economic and social governance.   Sample syllabus                                                                    European-American Relations in the 21st Century - POL-UA\u00a09598 - 4 points                               This course explores the recent history and the current state of political, economic and cultural relations between the United States and Europe. Ever since the end of the World War II, the cooperative relationship between these two parts of the world, often described as &quot;The West&quot;, has been a bedrock of international stability, security and prosperity. After the end of the Cold War, this relationship has undergone changes, along with the whole system of international relations. Recently, on both sides of the Atlantic, the talk has been about a crisis of the Euro-American relationship. We will examine the validity of these claims, the causes of the current disagreements and possible ways of overcoming them. Throughout, we will emphasize the overwhelming nature of common values and interests on both sides of the Atlantic as well as the risks stemming from a potential rift for both Europe and America. We will examine the compatibility of current European and U.S. policies with respect to third countries or regions, such as Russia, the Middle East, China, and other parts of the Globe. We will also analyze the specific role played in this relationship by countries of Central and Eastern Europe as relative newcomers to democracy, to the Atlantic Alliance and to European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Czech and Slovak Modern History in the Central European Context - POL-UA\u00a09994 - 4 points                               This course tells the story of the region in the geographical trap between Germany and Russia. The establishment of Czechoslovakia, the post-WW II expulsion of the German minority, Stalinism, the Prague Spring of 1968, dissident movements, the Velvet Revolution of 1989, transition to democracy, V\u00e1clav Havel and the post-Havel era will all be studied. Students will gain basic knowledge on Central European political, historical and economic issues. Critical reading of sources and independent thinking required.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Germany and East Central Europe (1871-2000) - HIST-UA9514 or POL-UA 9515 - 4 points                               This course will focus on the history of the culturally rich region of &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; through analysis of the parallel evolution of Germany and the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary. Mitteleuropa as a region produced such important figures as Franz Kafka, Gustav Mahler, Sigmund Freud, Theodor Herzl and Milan Kundera; historical personalities whose influence internationally is indisputable. We'll delve into the history of the region and on the central role played by German politics and culture from the end of the 19th century, through the turbulent 20th century to the present day.   Emphasis will be on the evolution of the concept of nationalism as well as on Germany's foreign policy in the &quot;concert of nations&quot;, especially towards its Eastern neighbors. The aim is to achieve an understanding of the complex evolution of national entities and their interaction between the birth of the modern German state and the integration of the Visegr\u00e1d countries in NATO and the European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Western European Comparative Politics -\u00a0EURO-UA 9510 or POL-UA 9510 - 4 points                               This course will concentrate on the analysis of the pursuits of democracy in Western Europe. Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.   Sample syllabus                              Religious Studies                                                  Religion, Culture and Politics in Eastern and Central Europe -\u00a0RELST-UA 9360 - 4 points                               Religion is without doubt one of the most important elements that shaped the history and contemporary face of Central Europe. Religion played an important role in the political and cultural development of this part of the world. The history of the mutual interaction between religion and politics is evident in the cultural richness of this part of the world, particularly in Bohemia and Prague.   This course explores various religious phenomena that formed political ideas and cultural values of this region indifferent historical periods. We examine particularly those religious characteristics and figures that remarkably influenced the world's history and enriched human thinking. First, we study the Christianization of Central European society and the prominent role of religion in the political and cultural transformation of the medieval period. Then we follow the religious reformation process and development of the relationship between Judeo-Christian tradition and the secular world in the early modern period. Finally, we explore the policies of communist regimes in the spheres of religion and culture and study the struggle of Christian churches against communist totalitarianism. The transformation of Catholicism in the 1960s is also examined together with the role of religion in post-communist society.   Excursions to significant historical and religious sights are an important part of the course.   Sample syllabus                                Russian and Slavic Studies                                                    Contemporary Central and East European Literature: From Kafka to Kundera -\u00a0RUSSN-UA 9832 - 4 points                               The idea of the course is not to bring a full and detailed picture of the whole of modern and contemporary Central and East European literature into perspective, but rather to take advantage of the unique occasion to offer students a more focused view. Examining Czech literary history as a specific example of the European history of national, cultural and political emancipation plans to guide &quot;newcomers&quot; along the most important cultural streams influencing the face of Czech literature in the 19th and 20th centuries. The larger cultural context includes the political role of art and literature in Czech history, language, religion, social and national currents and crosscurrents, as well as its Central and East European dimension.   Sample syllabus                              Sociology                                                  Collective Identity in a Totalitarian Regime -\u00a0SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               This course examines the totalitarian oppression from the point of view of ordinary citizens in communist Czechoslovakia. It focuses on the construction of collective mentality through everyday official/public and unofficial/private activities, including mass parades, ceremonies and performances, work relations, children\u2019s education, housing schemes or collective vacationing. The goal of the seminar is to demonstrate the consequences of life in an oppressive regime: suppression of fundamental forms of civic interaction, such as independent public communication, and distortion of moral and behavioral norms. At the end of the semester, students will be able to evaluate the main theoretical concepts and historical events of totalitarianism against the background of specific activities, problems and aspirations of the people directly affected by life in a totalitarian system, the citizens of communist Czechoslovakia.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Contemporary Issues in Law: Law and Human Rights in Central Europe - SOC-UA 9413 - 4 points                               This course explores the development of the rule of law and human rights issues in post-communist Central Europe. We will also refer to transitional systems outside the post-communist region. Although dealing with Central European region, we will often talk about American situation as well. First, we will face a short introduction into the history of the Central European region and its culture of human rights, and try to delineate this region. Next, we will examine the historical, national and international context of making constitutionalism and the rule of law in Central Europe. We will try to understand what human rights actually mean. We will face the debates that occurred when emerging democracies dealt with the former communist regimes. On several case studies, we will explain several basic attitudes towards the former communist regimes, its apparatchiks, its agents, and collaborators (lustration laws and dealing with the communist crimes). We will compare these approaches with those found elsewhere (South Africa, Latin America). Furthermore, we will examine contemporary human rights debates surrounding abortion, freedom of speech, social rights, the relation between religion and the state, the discrimination against minorities, gay rights, gender discrimination, affirmative action etc. We will also analyze the Western legal transplants in Central Europe and the post-communist application of basic rights. Finally, we will deal with the European Union and the legal dimension of the European Enlargement of 2004.

This course is centrally concerned with the Roman Catholic Church, but the Shoah laid bare a mortal flaw of Christendom itself, certainly including Protestantism. Even in the hopeful era of Pope Francis, that flaw is not finished with. EURO-GA 2162 European Culture and the Decline of Religious Faith (Thursdays, 2:00pm\u20144:00pm, CEMS seminar room)  EURO-GA 2163 The Hapsburg Monarchy (Thursdays, 2:00pm\u20144:00pm, CEMS seminar room)  EURO-GA 2301 What is Europe? (Wednesdays 3:00 p.m\u20145:00 p.m, CEMS seminar room) The   meaning of Europe has changed significantly over time. After the fall   of the Berlin Wall and the end of communism in Eastern Europe, the term   Europe mainly refers to the European Union, even though several European   states are not a member of the EU. This course will focus on the   post-WWII era to explore the changing meaning of Europe and the   formation of the EU. As a major actor in Europe today, the European   Union is influencing policies and shaping policy choices in member   states on a broad range of topics. We will study major concepts of   EU-integration, explore the institutions and policies of the EU and   discuss the role of citizens\u00b4 participation and euroscepticism. Why do   states transfer sovereignty to the EU? What is the role of nation-states   today and to what extent can they influence EU-politics? How do   citizens view the EU and what is their influence on the politics and   policies on the European level? Is crisis management and regulation   sufficient, or does the EU need a stronger basis of legitimacy? These   are some of the questions we will address in this seminar. At the end of   the semester, students will not only be familiar with key concepts of   European integration and governance in the EU, such as economic   governance and security policies. They will also have a tool kit for a   critical analysis of EU-policies and the key challenges Europe is facing   today, such as increasing immigration, economic disparities, and common   foreign policy. EURO-GA 2660 The Mediterranean in Historical Perspective (Thursdays, 10:00am\u201412:00pm, CEMS seminar room) This course focuses on Mediterranean European countries with an authoritarian tradition: Italy, Greece, Portugal, and Spain. It adopts a cross-national analysis of these countries throughout the 20th century and deals with several repressive state policies, such as propaganda and censorship and their effects. The course analyzes the ideology and tactics that were adopted in order to enforce ultra-conservative ideological agendas against the backdrop of economic crises, political instability and social insurrection. Questions that will be dealt with include the role of the Army in politics, the connections between authoritarian ideologies an violence, the regimes' inner transformations, the role of charismatic personalities such as Mussolini, France, Salazar, and Metaxas, and similarities and differences with totalitarian systems, such as Nazi Germany. A later part of the course focuses on issues such as cultural resistances, torture, but also the fictional representation of the regimes in literature and film. Spring 2015 EURO-GA 2670 A Modern Mediterranean Region (Thursdays, 3:00p.m\u20145:00pm, CEMS seminar room) From   the time of Fernand Braudel\u2019s magnum opus La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e et le Monde   M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en \u00e0 l'Epoque de Philippe II (1949) the Mediterranean has   been reconfigured extensively not only in political, economic and   cultural terms but also in the ways in which it is viewed, experienced   and conceptualized. This interdisciplinary course aspires to look at the   modern Mediterranean as a space of complexity, generating \u201cold\u201d style   conflicts \u2013 including genocide, ethnic cleansing, and riots \u2013 and \u201cnew\u201d   phenomena such as radical urban transformation, mass tourism, dynamic   social movements and hybrid identities. The course explores the region   in terms of both the scholarly (historical, anthropological) but also   the literary imagination in its wider facets (literary, cinematic) and   focuses on issues of memory and political uses of the past. The course   includes a theoretical component (on issues regarding nationalism,   orientalism, exoticism) and various case studies that cover both the   Eastern and Western Mediterranean, including divided cities (Jerusalem,   Beirut), cosmopolitan nostalgia (Istanbul, Salonica, Smyrna), the   decolonization of North Africa, the memory of Italian war crimes, the   Jewish and Armenian genocides, Spanish amnesia regarding Franco, and   Cypriot mass graves after 1974. EURO-GA 3000 Graduate Seminar (Wednesdays, 10:00am\u201412:00pm, CEMS seminar room) Required   for CEMS MA students. Not open to visiting students. This course   explores the design of research methodologies employed in the field of   European Studies. During the class we will cover various types of   empirical methods, focusing on qualitative ones, particularly   ethnography, historical research, visual analysis and digital media   analysis. We will look at different examples of how these methods can be   effectively used and combined for studying different aspects of   European societies, EU\u2019s political institutions, and cultural practices.   The course will emphasize the framing of research questions, the choice   of best methods for doing thesis research, and how methodological   approaches influence the significance, meaning, and impact of the   results. Assignments from this course are designed to help students   prepare for and advance their MA thesis projects. They will consist of   several relatively small projects as well as a larger research project   employing an original methodology. EURO-GA 3905 Topics in   European Politics: European Union in International Politics (Thursdays,   10:00am\u201412:00pm, CEMS seminar room) Since the Treaty of   Lisbon the European Union has a High Representative for Foreign Affairs   and Security Policy. Yet this institutional innovation cannot hide the   fact that the European Union has difficulties to find a common role in   international politics. In this course we will first analyze the   cultural, historical and political problems of European governance in a   field which is still very much governed by national sovereignty. Second,   we will look into case-studies of the European Union\u2019s actions in   international politics. These case-studies will include examples from   foreign and security policy, trade policy, and enlargement policy.   Third, we will discuss the conditions that would enable the European   Union to play a more effective and more democratically legitimized role   in international politics. EURO-GA 3213 Eastern Europe Workshop (Wednesdays, (generally twice per month), CEMS seminar room) The   Eastern Europe workshop is an informal 2-credit lunchtime workshop for   graduate students and advanced undergraduates meeting together to hear   speakers and discuss issues concerning Eastern Europe. EURO-GA 3900 Independent Study (self-scheduled) Permission of the department required EURO-GA 3902 Internship (self-scheduled) Students   can earn academic credit for a structured and supervised professional   work-learn experience within an approved organization.

EURO-GA 2660 Mediterranean in Historical Perspective (Thursdays 12:00 p.m\u20142:00 p.m, CEMS seminar room) This course focuses on Mediterranean European countries with an authoritarian tradition: Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain. It adopts a cross-national analysis of these countries throughout the 20th century and deals with several repressive state policies, such as torture, propaganda and censorship and their effects. The course analyzes the ideology and tactics that were adopted in order to enforce ultra-conservative ideological agendas against the backdrop of economic crises, political instability and social insurrection. The first part draws on a number of theoretical studies on the origins of fascism, and the various forms of authoritarianism and military regimes. A later part of the course analyzes the regimes\u2019 inner transformations. Questions that will be dealt with include the role of the Army in politics, the connections between authoritarian ideologies and violence, the role of charismatic personalities such as Mussolini, Franco, Salazar and Metaxas, and the similarities and differences with totalitarian systems, such as Nazi Germany. EURO-GA 2612 Topics: European Public Spheres (Tuesdays 10:00 a.m\u201412:00 p.m, CEMS seminar room) The European Union has been so far very much a project of elites. In this seminar we will analyze the importance of discourses and conflicts in civil society for European democracy. We will not only investigate debates on Europe for example in political parties and NGOs, but also the actions of protest movements. The exchanges between the public spheres of Parliaments and of civil society will be addressed to. We will look to media coverage of European affairs and to discourses in cultural spheres like film and theater. On the basis of empirical knowledge about European public spheres, we will discuss proposals that could enhance the emergence of a European Public Sphere and thereby strengthen European Democracy. EURO-GA 3213 Eastern European Workshop (Wednesdays 12:30 p.m\u20142:00 p.m (generally twice per month), CEMS seminar room) The Eastern Europe workshop is an informal 2-credit lunchtime workshop for graduate students and advanced undergraduates meeting together to hear speakers and discuss issues concerning Eastern Europe. EURO-GA 3112 Sovereignty: 20th Century Ideas, Aesthetics, and Practices (Thursdays 4:55 p.m\u20147:35 p.m, location to be announced by History Department) This course proposes to re-examine the concept and predominant figures of sovereignty in the twentieth century, as these emerge not just in philosophical discussions but in histories of sovereignty and modernity, in political and legal arguments, and in aesthetic and epistemological discourses. Part of its basic thesis is that the problem and concept of sovereignty is frequently misunderstood as applied to the twentieth-century European world when it is understood as mostly a problem of politics, particularly of any politics in which democracy is at the heart of the question. The aesthetic forms and the epistemological grounds of a sovereignty radically transformed in and by the twentieth century, remain anemically engaged in most discussions. EURO-GA 3901 Sincerity and Authenticity in European Thought (Thursdays 2:00 p.m\u20144:00 p.m, CEMS seminar room) The course will examine the emergence, in European thought, of the related ideals of sincerity and authenticity. We will investigate the ways in which they have shaped moral and political thought in Europe, particular through their roles in debates about identity, nationalism and multiculturalism. We will do so mainly through an examination of primary texts, ranging from philosophical and political texts to novels and poetry. Alongside these we will also read some of the contemporary literature on the significance of authenticity as an ideal. EURO-GA 3905 Topics in European Politics: the Welfare State in Europe and America (Mondays 4:00 p.m\u20146:00 p.m, CEMS seminar room) Charitable attempts to help the poor can be found throughout history, but the modern welfare state has sought not just to alleviate poverty but to assure citizens the right to a basic standard of living. It has, moreover, attempted to ensure protection for all citizens, not just the unfortunate, against a broad palette of natural and social risks. And in its most ambitious formulations, it has aimed to redistribute income and moderate economic and social inequalities. The welfare state has thus been an ambitious attempt to intervene in the market and assert society's control over the economy. Its beginnings in the late XIX century, its expansion in the XX century, and its current embattled condition have all therefore been accompanied by intense political controversy. This course will place the welfare state in its broad historical context, examining the radical break it represented, exploring the way in which it has differed among nations and assessing its current condition: victim of its own success or embattled ideal?
