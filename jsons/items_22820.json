The core curriculum focuses on the fundamentals of global affairs. Areas of concentration include:     Environment/Energy Policy   Human Rights and International Law   International Development and Humanitarian Assistance   International Relations   Peacebuilding   Private Sector   Transnational Security     The graduate thesis involves primary-source research under the guidance of a faculty member. The capstone project involves the development of a collaboratively designed action plan informed by scholarship, which seeks to reveal new solutions to a difficult challenge facing the international community.   The program is structured to meet the needs of working professionals and full-time students. Typically, students complete the degree within two years of full-time study, or within two to five years of part-time study.             Expand All   Collapse All          Core Curriculum        The core curriculum is designed to provide you with a deep and broad foundation that supports concentration course work and serves you throughout your career. Students are required to take all of the following courses.                        Course     Title     Credits                        Concentrations        Students are required to complete a total of six courses in any one of the seven concentrations, as well as two elective courses chosen from any concentration. With the approval of the faculty advisor or program director, students may take their two elective courses at other schools across NYU, including the NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service .              Environment/Energy Policy        This concentration analyzes the implications of the changing global energy and environmental landscape, as well as the new and emerging opportunities and challenges energy and climate changes present for national and global sustainability and security. The modern energy sector is experiencing rapid change with new oil and gas developments reshaping traditional energy geopolitics; a strong and growing renewable energy sector impacting local, national, and international energy policies and future forecasts; and innovative technological advances that are transforming all areas of the energy supply chain. This concentration prepares students to compete and thrive in this challenging and exciting sector, taking advantage of the opportunities occurring across the energy and environmental landscape. Courses reflect the increasing importance of energy in the formulation of national and foreign policy among countries the world over, as well as the impact of climate change on our environment.                      Course     Title     Credits                     Human Rights and International Law        International law and its enforcement, transitional justice, human rights, laws of war, protection of the environment, national reconstruction, and international organizations all play an increasingly important role in the discourse of international affairs. This concentration not only provides an exploration of international law and basic human rights standards, but it also explores areas such as the women's human rights movement and the environment and human rights, as well as providing opportunities to develop skills in human rights research and advocacy.                      Course     Title     Credits                     International Development and Humanitarian Assistance        What can be done about the massive disparities in wealth, development, and opportunity between and within the countries of the world? Among the issues explored by this concentration are global poverty, the state and civil society in development, foreign aid, the role of gender in poverty alleviation, and the principles and politics of humanitarian assistance and intervention, including those aimed at refugees and internally displaced persons.                      Course     Title     Credits                     International Relations        The pace of change in international relations (IR) is accelerating rapidly and strategic surprise is now the norm. Nearly every day we wake up to something new and unanticipated. This concentration is designed to give students an advanced understanding of the factors shaping IR, and to place these factors in a futures context. What alternate future scenarios can we imagine? What are the forces for change in IR? How are these forces shaping the policies and capabilities of states and nonstate actors? What are the emerging issues that the world will have to face, and how might they be addressed? Courses within this concentration help students improve their ability to anticipate change, and equip them with the analytical tools essential for professional success in a transforming environment.                      Course     Title     Credits                     Peacebuilding        The concentration in peacebuilding examines the methodologies and the applied strategies used to establish long-term, sustainable peace and security on a global scale. Peacebuilding emphasizes attaining stability and institutional reform on a structural level through the mediation of government institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and the United Nations.                        Course     Title     Credits                     Private Sector        The private sector concentration provides a comprehensive introduction to the contemporary principles of international business and finance, as well as in-depth examinations of such emerging issues as corporate governance and social responsibility, impact investing philosophies, and the increasing role of private-public partnerships. Attention is paid to the challenges of economic globalization and interdependence, the issues and problems associated with economic growth, income inequality, and the relationship between economic growth and human development. This concentration uniquely prepares students for gainful employment in the private sector, civil society, and governmental and supra-governmental organizations.                      Course     Title     Credits                     Transnational Security        Security is everyone's business, and a growing global concern in this age of resource wars, intercommunal violence, terrorism, cross-border crime, and pandemics. This concentration introduces students to the new transnational security agenda by combining the study of traditional issues such as war and disarmament with more contemporary issues, including terrorism, organized crime, and human security scourges. These complex and interconnected challenges are as often the domain of aid workers, police officers, and development specialists as they are of soldiers, spies, and diplomats. The concentration provides students with a combination of knowledge and practical skills preparing them to address security issues and risk assessment in the context of the private and NGO sector, as well as government service.

Course     Title     Credits                     International Relations        The pace of change in international relations (IR) is accelerating rapidly and strategic surprise is now the norm. Nearly every day we wake up to something new and unanticipated. This concentration is designed to give students an advanced understanding of the factors shaping IR, and to place these factors in a futures context. What alternate future scenarios can we imagine? What are the forces for change in IR? How are these forces shaping the policies and capabilities of states and nonstate actors? What are the emerging issues that the world will have to face, and how might they be addressed? Courses within this concentration help students improve their ability to anticipate change, and equip them with the analytical tools essential for professional success in a transforming environment.
