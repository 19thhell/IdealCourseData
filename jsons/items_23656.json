                                                        Taught by Associate Professor Judith Siegel , this online course strengthens skills in assessing individuals, with an emphasis on application of the DSM-5 in understanding mental disorders. The course considers the historical perspective of diagnosis and the development as well as the use and limitations of the DSM and ICD. The diagnostic criteria for most of the major mental disorders from childhood through late adulthood are studied from a biopsychosocial perspective that includes neurobiology research. Implications for clinical interventions and specific treatment approaches are considered.   This is an asynchronous course that students take on an individualized basis. Each of the fourteen lessons contains notes, video lectures, and videos of clients. They also contain links to most of the assigned readings from required books and journal articles.

the DSM-5 in understanding mental disorders. The course considers the historical perspective of diagnosis and the development as well as the use and limitations of the DSM and ICD. The diagnostic criteria for most of the major mental disorders from childhood through late adulthood are studied from a biopsychosocial perspective that includes neurobiology research. Implications for clinical interventions and specific treatment approaches are considered.   This is an asynchronous course that students take on an individualized basis. Each of the fourteen lessons contains notes, video lectures, and videos of clients. They also contain links to most of the assigned readings from required books and journal articles.
