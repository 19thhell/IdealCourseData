In environments of material scarcity, where people operate on the margins of power structures, social change leaders see abundant possibility. They work with resourceful and purposeful action, propelled to enact a vision of a more just world. RCLA sees this collective work toward the common good as leadership essential to guarantee, sustain and invigorate democracy.   As a dormant American civil society awakens in the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis, the lessons social change organizations hold for the field of public service could not be more timely. RCLA partners with grassroots leaders to co-produce and document knowledge and facilitate learning about social change leadership practices that deepen civic participation and make social transformation possible.   The Network Has Three Main Aims:   To document and share knowledge within the field and with other public service leaders about effective social change leadership practices through a process that strengthens the relationship between academics and social change organizers;   To support and connect leaders effectively advancing social change by facilitating opportunities for personal and organizational capacity-building and dialogue; and   To foster global leadership by connecting local efforts to international networks and frameworks.   Connection. Action. Reflection.  Social Change Learning Sessions   Network learning sessions provide collaborative spaces that give social change leaders opportunities to reflect critically on their work, obtain new skills and learn from other dynamic individuals at organizations confronting similar dilemmas. They yield new and practical insights and strategies for building organizational capacity and sustainability.   Click here to learn about previous learning sessions.   The Link between Local Advocacy and Global Transformation   More than 20,000 civic networks and organizations working to tackle global policy issues have become active on the world stage - 90 percent of them in the last 30 years. These networks can amplify the voice of US social justice organizations by linking their work to similar efforts in other countries and to international rights frameworks. However, grassroots organizations often lack the time, finances and other resources to contribute to global conversations while focusing on the everyday well-being of their communities. Through the Social Change Leadership Network, RCLA provides US social change organizations with learning resources that enable them to incorporate a global worldview into their work and to more systematically direct their advocacy efforts globally.

In environments of material scarcity, where people operate on the margins of power structures, social change leaders see abundant possibility. They work with resourceful and purposeful action, propelled to enact a vision of a more just world. RCLA sees this collective work toward the common good as leadership essential to guarantee, sustain and invigorate democracy.   As a dormant American civil society awakens in the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis, the lessons social change organizations hold for the field of public service could not be more timely. RCLA partners with grassroots leaders to co-produce and document knowledge and facilitate learning about social change leadership practices that deepen civic participation and make social transformation possible.   The Network Has Three Main Aims:   To document and share knowledge within the field and with other public service leaders about effective social change leadership practices through a process that strengthens the relationship between academics and social change organizers;   To support and connect leaders effectively advancing social change by facilitating opportunities for personal and organizational capacity-building and dialogue; and   To foster global leadership by connecting local efforts to international networks and frameworks.   Connection. Action. Reflection.

The Link between Local Advocacy and Global Transformation   More than 20,000 civic networks and organizations working to tackle global policy issues have become active on the world stage - 90 percent of them in the last 30 years. These networks can amplify the voice of US social justice organizations by linking their work to similar efforts in other countries and to international rights frameworks. However, grassroots organizations often lack the time, finances and other resources to contribute to global conversations while focusing on the everyday well-being of their communities. Through the Social Change Leadership Network, RCLA provides US social change organizations with learning resources that enable them to incorporate a global worldview into their work and to more systematically direct their advocacy efforts globally.

The tools below emerged from a series of Social Change Leadership Network learning sessions on how nonprofits can use the latest social networking applications to advance\u00a0their organizational mission. These sessions were facilitated by Ted Perlmutter, director of Knowledge Management at the Center for International Conflict Resolution at Columbia University and co-author of Networking the Networks: How Pro-Immigrant Advocacy Groups Use the Internet , and Tom Glaisyer, Communications PhD candidate at Columbia University and project manager specializing in the use of social media in domestic and international politics.   UNDERSTANDING THE NEW SOCIAL MEDIA ENVIRONMENT   \u00a0   Today's evolving society of networks\u00a0requires navigating beyond\u00a0the traditional, hierarchical system of organization. Geography and institutional identity are becoming increasingly permeable as people build communities around collaboration and alternative methods of communication.   How\u00a0can organizations decide who their priority contacts are and simultaneously keep their work at the top of the Web audience's radar? The shift requires a different culture - one in which organizations are constantly thinking about day-to-day steps they can take to expand their online presence while making their social platforms interactive.   Tools:     Videos   The Machine is Using Us   An Anthropological Introduction to YouTube   Web sites   Tech Soup offers nonprofits a one-stop resource for technology needs by providing free information, resources, and support.   DigiActive is an all-volunteer organization dedicated to helping grassroots activists around the world use the\u00a0Web and mobile phones to increase their impact.   WHICH SOCIAL MEDIA TOOLS AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE?   \u00a0   Understanding new social media requires\u00a0understanding and using\u00a0the tools that are building blocks of online communication. Implicit in this is the assumption that as you use the tools, you will appreciate the possibilities of conversational media and collaboration that are transforming organizations.

Organizations can also increasingly draw on a wide variety of social media tools to advance work from development to organizing.

It complements the range of course offerings at Gallatin and NYU by focusing on connection between theories of social change and the\u00a0 practice \u00a0of social change. This course thus gives students a platform to question and start defining their roles in social change, through readings, case studies, conversations with activists, and reflection exercises. \u201cTools for Social Change\u201d is a course for proactive, humble-yet-ambitious students who are motivated to engage deeply with the challenges of this coursework. This hands-on course will help students make important decisions about their own values and belief systems, and figure out how to put those into practice. Students will then reflect on the experience in the form of small writing exercises and a final project. Guest speakers will include activists from local organizations and former Gallatin students who have gone on to pursue activism. Readings will include a range of \u201cclassic\u201d and more contemporary texts on the connection between critical theories and practice, including: Paulo Freire, Martin Luther King, Cornel West, Frances Moore Lappe, among others.
