Mali Bowers and Natalie Nazarian - Empty Healing                               Empty Healing, Mali Bowers   Concentration: Balance: Non-action in Action    Mali Bowers is from Los Angeles and London. Her concentration focuses on tangible applications of the Buddhist concept of sunyata, or emptiness. Ranging from art-making to the human form, the physical and philosophical resonance of &quot;emptiness&quot; inspires her to explore a wide array of disciplines. Her pursuits include sculpture, green design, philosophy, architecture, yoga as architecture of the body, music composition and printmaking, as ways to investigate the fundamentally compassionate principle of sunyata. Her current primary practice is printmaking, as an exploration of emptiness in the creative process. - Mali\u2019s Adviser is Jeanette Tran, Ph.D.   Empty Healing, Natalie Nazarian   Concentration: Compassionate Art, Compassionate Science: An Alternative Approach for the Pre-Medical Student     A native of Minneapolis, Minnesota, Natalie Nazarian is studying art and science, specifically the implications that intersections between these disciplines might have for the future of medicine. Focusing on modes of practice in the simultaneous studies of studio art, and the physical and natural sciences has allowed her to find both conceptual and practical connections. In this vein, she believes that methods of contemporary visual art practice and criticism can be of valuable use in instigating tangible changes to the current culture of the doctor-patient relationship.   Natalie and Mali began collaborating out of the realization that their concentrations were not only complimentary, but inherently connected. They discovered the opportunity for creative collaboration, and how changing the way we see can ultimately change the way we approach healing. Their individual art practices have led them to the conviction that compassionate art can lead to creative responses in healthcare, rather than pre-packaged cures. - Natalie\u2019s Adviser is Leslie Satin, Ph.D.                                                                                                                                                                Rachel Brazie - Towards a Haunted Community                               Towards a Haunted Community, Rachel Brazie   Concentration: (De)Constructing Community: Identity Narrative, Grief, and Politics     Rachel Brazie\u2019s academic and personal interests center around community. To this end, she participated in NYU's Residential College for her first three years before moving to Brooklyn to live in a co-operative. In Gallatin, she is a member of Americas Scholars. She co-founded a Critical Theory Collective to extend intellectual community beyond the walls of the classroom.    Her Senior Project explores three of Toni Morrison's novels - interrogating the ways in which Morrison negotiates America's racial wounds through the personal traumas of her characters. Rachel argues that Morrison's use of haunting offers a necessary interval between mourning and melancholia, a mode of grieving that acknowledges loss without fully letting the go of the ghost.   Outside of school, Rachel has traveled extensively working on rural and urban organic farms, including a summer stint studying indigenous agricultural practices in Peru. Most recently, she apprenticed at the Brooklyn Grange rooftop farm. - Rachel\u2019s Adviser is George Shulman, Ph.D.                                                                                                                                                               Anthony Giambra - We Have the Remote, But Are We Changing the Channel                               We Have the Remote, But Are We Changing the Channel, Anthony Giambra  Concentration: Visual Media Imperialism     Anthony Giambra studies a combination of film, sociology, and media studies at NYU. During his senior year, he has worked as Assistant Media Producer to Mario Batali, Production Intern for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and currently interns as a Development Intern at MTV News &amp; Docs. For his entire junior year, he studied abroad, first in Prague, then in Buenos Aires. In both cities, he delved further into the golden ages of each nation's cinemas. Noticing a difference in national representation and understanding before and after times of political oppression, he grew interested in the influence of media flows throughout the globe, which helped to add a narrowing lens to his academic focus and to create the platform for his TEDx talk. At the moment, he would love to work in late night television after graduation. - Anthony\u2019s Adviser is Rahul Hamid, M.A                                                                                                                                                           Nicole Johnson - The (Re)birth of the Double Consciousness                               The (Re)birth of the Double Consciousness, Nicole Johnson   Concentration: Ethics Management &amp; Production in the Arts     Nicole Johnson studies Ethics, Management &amp; Production in the Arts.

Emergence is the phenomenon by which simple systems governed by simple rules give rise to complex phenomena on a larger scale. Simple systems are able to self-organize into large-scale collective behavior.   In her senior project, What Pattern Recognition Systems Teach Us About Patterns, Adams built a Deep Belief Network (DBN), which is an artificial neural network used in machine learning that mimics the parallel processing of the brain, in order to better understand what is being recognized in pattern recognition.   In preparation for PhD studies in Complexity Theory, Adams will independently commence study of the similarities between efficient designs in natural and artificial systems namely the similarities between leaf vein patterns and housing patterns.   While at NYU, Jane was on the editorial board of the Gallatin Research Journal, and studied Culture, Development, and Globalization in India. Jane earned the Dean\u2019s Award for Graduating Seniors. Adams\u2019 adviser is Jose Perillan, PhD.

By seeking to comprehend the social, political, and economic infrastructures at work specifically in cities (particularly in the megacities of the global south), Bernstein hopes to to acquire an insight into how such systems might be adapted to achieve both local and global sustainability with respect to the environment and the economy. Jennie pays particular attention to a classical capitalist conception, where growth in the Gross Domestic Product acts as the principal metric for measuring economic growth/development.   While at NYU Jennie went abroad to Fortaleza, Brazil, to study Social Justice and Sustainable Development. She hopes to work as an environmental educator in Aspen, Colorado for a year prior to persuing in a Masters program in Urban Ecology. She earned the Dean\u2019s Award for Graduating Seniors.

Mali Bowers and Natalie Nazarian - Empty Healing                               Empty Healing, Mali Bowers   Concentration: Balance: Non-action in Action    Mali Bowers is from Los Angeles and London. Her concentration focuses on tangible applications of the Buddhist concept of sunyata, or emptiness. Ranging from art-making to the human form, the physical and philosophical resonance of &quot;emptiness&quot; inspires her to explore a wide array of disciplines. Her pursuits include sculpture, green design, philosophy, architecture, yoga as architecture of the body, music composition and printmaking, as ways to investigate the fundamentally compassionate principle of sunyata. Her current primary practice is printmaking, as an exploration of emptiness in the creative process. - Mali\u2019s Adviser is Jeanette Tran, Ph.D.   Empty Healing, Natalie Nazarian   Concentration: Compassionate Art, Compassionate Science: An Alternative Approach for the Pre-Medical Student     A native of Minneapolis, Minnesota, Natalie Nazarian is studying art and science, specifically the implications that intersections between these disciplines might have for the future of medicine. Focusing on modes of practice in the simultaneous studies of studio art, and the physical and natural sciences has allowed her to find both conceptual and practical connections. In this vein, she believes that methods of contemporary visual art practice and criticism can be of valuable use in instigating tangible changes to the current culture of the doctor-patient relationship.   Natalie and Mali began collaborating out of the realization that their concentrations were not only complimentary, but inherently connected. They discovered the opportunity for creative collaboration, and how changing the way we see can ultimately change the way we approach healing. Their individual art practices have led them to the conviction that compassionate art can lead to creative responses in healthcare, rather than pre-packaged cures. - Natalie\u2019s Adviser is Leslie Satin, Ph.D.                                                                                                                                                                Rachel Brazie - Towards a Haunted Community                               Towards a Haunted Community, Rachel Brazie   Concentration: (De)Constructing Community: Identity Narrative, Grief, and Politics     Rachel Brazie\u2019s academic and personal interests center around community. To this end, she participated in NYU's Residential College for her first three years before moving to Brooklyn to live in a co-operative. In Gallatin, she is a member of Americas Scholars. She co-founded a Critical Theory Collective to extend intellectual community beyond the walls of the classroom.    Her Senior Project explores three of Toni Morrison's novels - interrogating the ways in which Morrison negotiates America's racial wounds through the personal traumas of her characters. Rachel argues that Morrison's use of haunting offers a necessary interval between mourning and melancholia, a mode of grieving that acknowledges loss without fully letting the go of the ghost.   Outside of school, Rachel has traveled extensively working on rural and urban organic farms, including a summer stint studying indigenous agricultural practices in Peru. Most recently, she apprenticed at the Brooklyn Grange rooftop farm. - Rachel\u2019s Adviser is George Shulman, Ph.D.                                                                                                                                                               Anthony Giambra - We Have the Remote, But Are We Changing the Channel                               We Have the Remote, But Are We Changing the Channel, Anthony Giambra  Concentration: Visual Media Imperialism     Anthony Giambra studies a combination of film, sociology, and media studies at NYU. During his senior year, he has worked as Assistant Media Producer to Mario Batali, Production Intern for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and currently interns as a Development Intern at MTV News &amp; Docs. For his entire junior year, he studied abroad, first in Prague, then in Buenos Aires. In both cities, he delved further into the golden ages of each nation's cinemas. Noticing a difference in national representation and understanding before and after times of political oppression, he grew interested in the influence of media flows throughout the globe, which helped to add a narrowing lens to his academic focus and to create the platform for his TEDx talk. At the moment, he would love to work in late night television after graduation. - Anthony\u2019s Adviser is Rahul Hamid, M.A                                                                                                                                                           Nicole Johnson - The (Re)birth of the Double Consciousness                               The (Re)birth of the Double Consciousness, Nicole Johnson   Concentration: Ethics Management &amp; Production in the Arts     Nicole Johnson studies Ethics, Management &amp; Production in the Arts.

Its methods come with a guarantee of making progress towards accruing more accurate information about our world. Daniel Seara is working towards understanding the roles that humans have in performing the incontrovertibly human activity we call \u201cscience\u201d. Specifically, Daniel studies physics, philosophy and their histories in an attempt to understand the fluid progression that physics has undergone since the 17th century.   Daniel is currently researching liquid crystal colloidal dispersions, studying the colloids\u2019 interactions and self-assembly via optical microscopy at the NYU Center for Soft Matter Research under David J. Pine, PhD. He participated in the NSF funded summer program RiSE at Rutgers University, studying graphene growth on various substrates via pulsed laser deposition as a function of time.

Emergence is the phenomenon by which simple systems governed by simple rules give rise to complex phenomena on a larger scale. Simple systems are able to self-organize into large-scale collective behavior.   In her senior project, What Pattern Recognition Systems Teach Us About Patterns, Adams built a Deep Belief Network (DBN), which is an artificial neural network used in machine learning that mimics the parallel processing of the brain, in order to better understand what is being recognized in pattern recognition.   In preparation for PhD studies in Complexity Theory, Adams will independently commence study of the similarities between efficient designs in natural and artificial systems namely the similarities between leaf vein patterns and housing patterns.   While at NYU, Jane was on the editorial board of the Gallatin Research Journal, and studied Culture, Development, and Globalization in India. Jane earned the Dean\u2019s Award for Graduating Seniors. Adams\u2019 adviser is Jose Perillan, PhD.                                                                  Jennie Bernstein - Brazil, Coastal Erosion, Sustainable Development                               Jennie Bernstein - Brazil, Coastal Erosion, Sustainable Development (Video)   Brazil, Coastal Erosion, Sustainable Development, Jennie Bernstein   Concentration: Sustainable Urban Development   Jennie Bernstein\u2019s concentration combines an understanding of economic development with an appreciation for the social and environmental systems at work on our planet.   By seeking to comprehend the social, political, and economic infrastructures at work specifically in cities (particularly in the megacities of the global south), Bernstein hopes to to acquire an insight into how such systems might be adapted to achieve both local and global sustainability with respect to the environment and the economy. Jennie pays particular attention to a classical capitalist conception, where growth in the Gross Domestic Product acts as the principal metric for measuring economic growth/development.   While at NYU Jennie went abroad to Fortaleza, Brazil, to study Social Justice and Sustainable Development. She hopes to work as an environmental educator in Aspen, Colorado for a year prior to persuing in a Masters program in Urban Ecology. She earned the Dean\u2019s Award for Graduating Seniors.

Specifically, Notini looks at the interaction between language and society in post-colonial environments.   His senior project, Language Commoditization in Rural Minority Speech Communities analyzes insider-outsider dynamics in tourist destinations through linguistic performance and language ideologies. To illustrate the relationship his paper uses two case studies: the Pennsylvania Dutch speaking populations of Lancaster County, PA and Irish speaking communities in the west of Ireland.   Prior to commencing MA work at University of Chicago in the Fall of 2013, Will plans to travel to Guatemala to research the roles of Mayan languages in the socialization and education of Guatemala City\u2019s children.&amp;nbsp; While at NYU, Notini was editor-in-chief for the Gallatin Research Journal and studied abroad at NYU-Dublin.

The concluding aspect of this concentration, through an analysis of legal frameworks, analyzed the role of the law in empowering and providing justice to historically marginalized communities.   Waggeh\u2019s senior project, Che and Lumumba: 20th Century Socialists juxtaposes the political history of Cuba and the Democratic Republic of Congo through an analysis of the two prime Marxists and revolutionaries of the African Diaspora in the 20th century: Ernesto Che Guevara and Patrice Lumumba. Fatoumata will be Gallatin\u2019s Banner Bearer for graduation and commencement ceremonies.

The reading of different dramatic texts and viewing of various films throughout the semester will serve to expand lexicon, strengthen grammar and improve the student's style. The objective of this course is that the students familiarize themselves with everyday language of current newspapers and magazines, at the same time as they enter into the world of Spanish literature.   The most important goal of the course is to offer a methodologically simple approximation that helps the student to develop a greater verbal and communicative dexterity. To this end, every week the students will analyze and debate the cultural and literary content texts that are to be studied and every two weeks the students will present a written composition of the topics covered in class. In the classroom linguistic correction will be emphasized along with auditory practice through the use of a wide range of materials and resources: theoretical explanations, comprehension and vocabulary exercises, film viewing, as well as exercises that highlight certain morphological aspects or grammatical usage of Spanish.

The objective of the course is to analyze the social, cultural and political transformations experienced in Argentina during the XX century. The scheduled activities are divided into theory-practice classes and cultural visits. There are required readings for the classes which are usually based in a general bibliography that will give the student a factual context of each unit. Ideas exchange will take place, so the students should read the material in advance in order to continue with the course. The objective of cultural activities is to link the students with the material dimension of history, putting themselves in contact with crucial clues for its comprehension.

Through a lively discussion of current cultural conflicts in politics, literature, music, drama and film, the course will enhance the listening and reading abilities of the students, while improving their speaking and writing proficiency in Spanish. These said conflicts and their transformations are key to an understanding of the way porte\u00f1os speak and think. From a first section devoted to political discourse, we will move onto a consideration of its rhetorical precedents in argentine literature. This will give us the critical tools we need to further our inquiries in other fields such as rock, drama, journalism and film.

The course is designed to introduce students to the work of Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century. Through reading, analysis, and discussion of short fiction or poems and critical bibliography, the students will examine the dichotomy civilization-barbarism in Borges works (in connection to the Argentine cultural tradition since nineteenth century); some key topics in his texts such as tigers, labyrinths and libraries; the relationship between writing and translation (specifically in the English translations of his fictions); the political aspects of the literature produced by Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers on Eva Per\u00f3n. The course will also develop the connections between Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers.

This course deals with themes of culture, cultural identity and the politics of culture and identity, with reference to five specific Latin American cases: a). Indigenous communities of the Amazon (Achuar) and the Pampas-Patagonia region (Mapuche, Rank\u00fclche); b) Andean peasants (Aymaras) and indigenous proletariat of the Chaco (Toba); c). working class and ethnic neighborhoods of the city. By means of this empirical survey we hope to illustrate and discuss the some of the different ideas that have come to the fore in recent debates about \u201cculture,\u201d including essentialism and constructivism; rethinking of the nature/culture dichotomy; and the idea of cultural identity as a right, as a strategy of domination or as a form of resistance, etc.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Fotograf\u00eda y literatura en Am\u00e9rica Latina - SPAN-UA 9550 - 4 points                               Este curso se pregunta qu\u00e9 es y c\u00f3mo se lee una fotograf\u00eda.

Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now.

Prerequisites: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), or Introduction to Economic Analysis (ECON-UA 5) or equivalents.   There are two parts to this course. In the first part of the course we will study two of the main financial asset markets: bond markets and stock markets. We will study the concept and determination of interest rates; the risk structure and the term structure of interest rates; stock pricing and the efficient markets hypothesis; cross-border arbitrage. We will also analyze financial structure in Argentina and other Latin American banks.   In the second part of the course we will study the monetary and financial system. We will study how money is created, the tools of monetary policy, the commercial banking industry and its links to monetary policy and the Central Bank, and how monetary policy affects the economy in general. In this part we will also analyze how market failures (such as information asymmetries) and distortionary policies (such as financial repression) may hinder the contribution of financial markets and monetary policy to macroeconomic stability. The roles of state-owned banks in Latin American economies will also be discussed.

Two sections, one in each city, will meet and collaborate simultaneously via internet to address several key questions: How are art and politics understood and expressed differently and similarly in these two American metropolises and why? How do shared aesthetic features of public art reflect the global circulation of urban creative modes? What do we learn about local politics from looking at the art and writing on a city\u2019s public spaces? Teams of students in both cities will conduct field work in selected neighborhoods to help create an archive of murals, graffiti, performances, and installations. Then, drawing from readings in history, art criticism, and urban studies, as well as from census and electoral data and using GIS technology, we will analyze how social and political processes like gentrification, inequality, and planning generate and reflect creative political expression as captured in our database, culminating in transnational, collaborative projects that explore what wisdom and truths America's streets continue to reveal, 500 years after conquest.

The experiential part will consist of 10 weekly hours of work within a pre-arranged organization. The academic part is meant to assist students in getting the most from this experience and provide theoretical and methodological elements to critically examine their experiences. It weaves together research design and methods with an empirical and theoretical examination of recent social phenomena in Argentina. We will use selected themes and topics to explore theoretical perspectives and selected aspects of contemporary Argentine society. In parallel we will explore how to construct a research project, collect data and analyze its contents.

This course introduces students to key concepts in health policy formation, implementation and evaluation in a global context. Using a comparative lens, students explore organization, financing and delivery of health care services and health systems around the world. We examine the role of governmental and non-governmental agencies in delivering care and contributing to a health care infrastructure using case studies and other materials in a comparative approach. Key lessons in the implementation of new health policies and initiatives are explored across the developing world, as well as in a US as students explore health system performance, the quality and cost of care, the management of health care services, the process of health improvement and health reform. The course will use a multidisciplinary approach that employs sociological, political, economics, and ethical perspectives. The objective is to build an understanding of the fundamental ideas, issues, and problems currently debated in global health policy and management and to provide a foundation for future studies and careers in the global health field. Epidemiology in a Global World and Health and Society in a Global Context are recommended but not required pre-requisites for the course.

There is a central question for the course: Is there any singularity in Latin American media? The answer assumes that there is a specific relation between tradition and modernity in Latin American societies with many consequences for mass culture and media. The constitution of mass audiences in societies where literacy was not a universal value, made significant the development of audiovisual media. The course will focus on melodrama as a configuration that made possible the emergence of specific genres in Latin American cinema, radio and television. Particularly, the \u201ctelenovela\u201d is simultaneously an aesthetic, industrial and audience phenomenon with local and global circulation. Finally, the course will discuss the role of media in dictatorship and democratic processes. Censorship and alternative media enabled many different practices for radio journalists, filmmakers or contemporary bloggers.

Covering in parallel the evolution of the international system and the changing position of the region in that same system, the course attempts to reinterpret the frameworks of analysis as perceived from the Western Hemisphere. The student will be provided with a Latin American view of the main economic developments and political processes that have given shape to each stage in time- to the structure and dynamics of the international system. The ultimate goal is to make students aware that where you stand depends on where you sit by exposing them to alternate views on concepts they are already familiar with.

Queer Cultures and Democracy - SPAN-UA 9481 or SCA-UA 9844 - 4 points                               In the last ten years, several Latin American nations have witnessed decisive progress in the legal recognition of non-normative sexualities and gender identities. Argentina passed the same-sex marriage law in 2010 and the gender identity law in 2011, followed by Uruguay; Colombia approved the legal recognition of same sex couples, and in Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, the pressure of queer demands and visibility in the public sphere is stronger than ever. The conventional map of \u201cadvanced democracies\u201d crafting models of democratization that could be exported to less developed nations seems definitely challenged: a new understanding of the complex, and multiple temporalities of queer cultures in North and South America is more necessary than ever.    In order to explore this rich and multi-layered landscape, this course wants to trace and reconstruct the historical detours of queer cultures in Buenos Aires and New York. Taking as starting point the present context of growing acceptance and inclusion of queer citizens both in Latin America and the US, the course revisits the last three decades in order to question the dominant and frequently reductive narratives of steady, lineal progress. Our goal is precisely to advance a periodization sensitive to the nuances and contradictions of this complex historical transformation.

COLIT-UA 998         Course Descriptions  Readings in Contemporary Lit: The form of Planetary Criticism/Death Drive/Aesthetics of Catastrophe Apter This   course will examine theories of the death drive in the aesthetics of   catastrophism drawing on classic texts by Freud, Italo Svevo, Melanie   Klein, Lacan, Georges Bataille and Marguerite Duras, as well as recent   work on worlds as places of catastrophe, dystopia, planetary dysphoria   (depression), and earthly extinction (Ray Brassier\u2019s \u201cnihil unbound,\u201d   Eugene Thacker\u2019s \u201cdark pantheism\u201d). The aim will be to emphasize   psychical processes in diagnoses of planetarity, while trying to avoid a   heavy-handed reliance on allegories of World System or the Planet or   Capital that impute subjective personalities to political entities and   geographic phantasms. We will experiment with an \u201cecology\u201d of what   Melanie Klein called \u201cthe depressive position,\u201d as it suffuses every   aspect of everyday life.   Readings in Contemporary Lit: Feminist Theory and Philosophy  Bianchi In   this course we will address key texts and debates in feminist and   gender theory. We will consider various theoretical foundations -   Marxism, psychoanalysis, structuralism \u2013 that have informed feminist   politics and thought, and focus on conflicts within feminism emerging   along lines of class, race, and sexual and gender identity. The course   will examine feminist approaches to knowledge and power, in particular   feminist/queer approaches to pornography, sexuality and sex work in a   global frame, and feminist critiques of science.  Junior Theory Seminar: Black Atlantic Writers  Garcia What kind of designation is the \u201cBlack Atlantic\u201d and which writers belong within its reach? This seminar explores European, Caribbean and American texts alongside theories of the Black Atlantic and other accounts of modern racial formation. Writers include Frederick Douglass, Alain Locke, Edouard Glissant, Nella Larsen, W. E. B. Du Bois, Fernando Ortiz, C. L. R. James and Stuart Hall. Topics include modernism in African American literary culture, the reading of \u201crace\u201d in British cultural studies, and the history of Afro-Cuban modernity.  Comparative Imperialisms: Anglophone Middle Eastern Literature   Halim Although literature by Middle Easterners, particularly Arabs, in English not a new phenomenon, it has boomed in recent decades. In addressing Anglophone Middle Eastern literatures, this course covers the output of both writers resident in their country of origin and ones living in the diaspora, across a range of genres, including poetry, fiction, essay, and memoir (especially cookbook memoirs). Focusing on the increasing racialization of Arabs and Muslims in the USA after 9/11 and the War on Iraq, we will pay special attention to Anglophone literature by Arab-Americans and the riposte to stereotypes it represents. Drawing on postcolonial theory and transnational studies, the course will pose, among others, the following questions: How do we parse the legacy of Orientalism in the way religion and gender inflect the perceptions of Middle Easterners, for example in the image of the veil in relation to the trope of the harem? Are there certain genres that have been privileged over others by \u00e9migr\u00e9s from the Middle East, and if so, how would we explain this? What risks of complicity may come with identities hyphenated across warring sides? What are the uses and perils at stake in deploying \u201cexile\u201d as a metaphor? Just to what extent are the terms available to describe these \u00e9migr\u00e9s \u2013 \u201cArab-American\u201d; \u201cIranian-American\u201d; \u201cAmerican Muslim\u201d; \u201cMiddle Easterner\u201d \u2013 adequate or incisive? In what way has the Arab Spring affected perceptions of Middle Easterners in Norh America? Readings by, among others: Diana Abu-Jaber; Carol Bardenstein; Hamid Dabashi; Suheir Hammad; Mohja Kahf; Hisham Matar; Nadine Naber; Azar Nafisi; Edward W. Said; Ahdaf Soueif.  Intro to Comp Lit: ECSTASY  Lezra Ec-stasy , to be drawn out of one\u2019s place, out of oneself; to be moved, enraptured, captivated. A religious experience, an erotic one, an aesthetic one; the fruit of alcohol or psychotropics, of reading or thinking, of a transcendent vision, of a sublime experience, of the touch of flesh on flesh. Also a hint of the dangerous: to lose oneself, or to lose the self\u2014with the threat that one will be unable to return to what one was, or that one will be destroyed. A fringe-concept and a fringe-experience. Literature\u2014itself a sort of border-concept, attached to different forms of expression: philosophy, theology, mythology, visual art, film, music\u2014has an old, peculiar relation to ecstasy. That relation is the subject of our class. This course serves as an Introduction to Comparative Literature through ecstasy. We will read, watch, view and listen to philosophical works by Plato (the \u201cSymposium\u201d and the \u201cPhaedrus\u201d), Kant ( Critique of Judgment ), Bataille, Adorno, Irigaray, Williams, Foucault, Deleuze, Berlant and others; fiction by Woolf ( To the Lighthouse ), Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, and Lispector; religious/autobiographical works by Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross; poetry by Ovid, Petrarch, Donne, Ronsard, Shakespeare, Quevedo, Shelley, Hopkins, and Moore; films by Bu\u00f1uel ( Belle de jour ), Almod\u00f3var ( Matador ), Hitchcock ( Rope ); Mozart/da Ponte\u2019s opera Don Giovanni ); selections from Beethoven\u2019s Fidelio , and albums by Patti Smith, the Velvet Underground, the Doors, and Nirvana; and sexological treatises by Sacher-Masoch. (Not all of these, but many of them.)  The Spanish Civil War: Fascism, Violence and Memory  Matos-Martin Widely acknowledged as a precursor to World War II, the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) \u201crevealed what war on European soil could mean, presaging the purificatory, genocidal, and retributive conflicts of those many other civil wars waged across the continent between 1939 and the end of the 1940s,\u201d as historian Helen Graham argues. As the earliest example of battleground against fascism, those conflict years fascinated and attracted individuals from across the world, including George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway, and have continued to be the object of numerous books and other cultural products. Not so well known and studied, however, is the long-lasted and violent fascist regime established once the democratic Spanish Republic was eventually defeated. The purpose of this course is to examine the war and the fascist dictatorship that followed and perpetuated the logic of war through its politics of death and repression, with a special focus on fictional and cultural representations. Literary texts, films, and documentaries will be analyzed in comparison with other artistic and cultural forms of expression (photography, painting), and accompanied by readings in history and theory. Topics to be discussed might include political and ideological dynamics of war and fascism (comparing the Spanish case with other fascist regimes such as the Nazis through such theoretical lenses as biopolitics, for example), representations of violence, memory and history, and justice. Writers, directors and artists whose works we might examine include: Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Max Aub, Guillermo del Toro, Ken Loach, Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez, Rafael Alberti, Pablo Neruda, Isaac Rosa, David Trueba, Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuerda, Pablo Picasso, and Isaac Rosa.  Text and Ideas: Paranoia  Sanders It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and of technology. But could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works, such as Daniel Paul Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness , George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four , Bessie Head\u2019s A Question of Power , J.M. Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace , as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires .  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Documents, Documentary, Fiction  Vatulescu This course will explore representative works from key moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel, literatura fakta, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression documentary books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films. What accounts for the waxing and waning of the documentary through time, as evident in its recent popularity in American culture? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. This semester\u2019s special topics are 1) the archive, 2)word/image relations, and 3) fiction vs. document. Theoretical forays around and into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in an archive of your choice.

Mali Bowers and Natalie Nazarian - Empty Healing                               Empty Healing, Mali Bowers   Concentration: Balance: Non-action in Action    Mali Bowers is from Los Angeles and London. Her concentration focuses on tangible applications of the Buddhist concept of sunyata, or emptiness. Ranging from art-making to the human form, the physical and philosophical resonance of &quot;emptiness&quot; inspires her to explore a wide array of disciplines. Her pursuits include sculpture, green design, philosophy, architecture, yoga as architecture of the body, music composition and printmaking, as ways to investigate the fundamentally compassionate principle of sunyata. Her current primary practice is printmaking, as an exploration of emptiness in the creative process. - Mali\u2019s Adviser is Jeanette Tran, Ph.D.   Empty Healing, Natalie Nazarian   Concentration: Compassionate Art, Compassionate Science: An Alternative Approach for the Pre-Medical Student     A native of Minneapolis, Minnesota, Natalie Nazarian is studying art and science, specifically the implications that intersections between these disciplines might have for the future of medicine. Focusing on modes of practice in the simultaneous studies of studio art, and the physical and natural sciences has allowed her to find both conceptual and practical connections. In this vein, she believes that methods of contemporary visual art practice and criticism can be of valuable use in instigating tangible changes to the current culture of the doctor-patient relationship.   Natalie and Mali began collaborating out of the realization that their concentrations were not only complimentary, but inherently connected. They discovered the opportunity for creative collaboration, and how changing the way we see can ultimately change the way we approach healing. Their individual art practices have led them to the conviction that compassionate art can lead to creative responses in healthcare, rather than pre-packaged cures. - Natalie\u2019s Adviser is Leslie Satin, Ph.D.                                                                                                                                                                Rachel Brazie - Towards a Haunted Community                               Towards a Haunted Community, Rachel Brazie   Concentration: (De)Constructing Community: Identity Narrative, Grief, and Politics     Rachel Brazie\u2019s academic and personal interests center around community. To this end, she participated in NYU's Residential College for her first three years before moving to Brooklyn to live in a co-operative. In Gallatin, she is a member of Americas Scholars. She co-founded a Critical Theory Collective to extend intellectual community beyond the walls of the classroom.    Her Senior Project explores three of Toni Morrison's novels - interrogating the ways in which Morrison negotiates America's racial wounds through the personal traumas of her characters. Rachel argues that Morrison's use of haunting offers a necessary interval between mourning and melancholia, a mode of grieving that acknowledges loss without fully letting the go of the ghost.   Outside of school, Rachel has traveled extensively working on rural and urban organic farms, including a summer stint studying indigenous agricultural practices in Peru. Most recently, she apprenticed at the Brooklyn Grange rooftop farm. - Rachel\u2019s Adviser is George Shulman, Ph.D.                                                                                                                                                               Anthony Giambra - We Have the Remote, But Are We Changing the Channel                               We Have the Remote, But Are We Changing the Channel, Anthony Giambra  Concentration: Visual Media Imperialism     Anthony Giambra studies a combination of film, sociology, and media studies at NYU. During his senior year, he has worked as Assistant Media Producer to Mario Batali, Production Intern for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and currently interns as a Development Intern at MTV News &amp; Docs. For his entire junior year, he studied abroad, first in Prague, then in Buenos Aires. In both cities, he delved further into the golden ages of each nation's cinemas. Noticing a difference in national representation and understanding before and after times of political oppression, he grew interested in the influence of media flows throughout the globe, which helped to add a narrowing lens to his academic focus and to create the platform for his TEDx talk. At the moment, he would love to work in late night television after graduation. - Anthony\u2019s Adviser is Rahul Hamid, M.A                                                                                                                                                           Nicole Johnson - The (Re)birth of the Double Consciousness                               The (Re)birth of the Double Consciousness, Nicole Johnson   Concentration: Ethics Management &amp; Production in the Arts     Nicole Johnson studies Ethics, Management &amp; Production in the Arts.

Emergence is the phenomenon by which simple systems governed by simple rules give rise to complex phenomena on a larger scale. Simple systems are able to self-organize into large-scale collective behavior.   In her senior project, What Pattern Recognition Systems Teach Us About Patterns, Adams built a Deep Belief Network (DBN), which is an artificial neural network used in machine learning that mimics the parallel processing of the brain, in order to better understand what is being recognized in pattern recognition.   In preparation for PhD studies in Complexity Theory, Adams will independently commence study of the similarities between efficient designs in natural and artificial systems namely the similarities between leaf vein patterns and housing patterns.   While at NYU, Jane was on the editorial board of the Gallatin Research Journal, and studied Culture, Development, and Globalization in India. Jane earned the Dean\u2019s Award for Graduating Seniors.

The goal of the course is to serve as a complement for the beginner and intermediate level  student pursuing a career in the health care professions or a student generally interested  in communicating with patients in Spanish. It has been structured to serve the specific  needs of the nursing, medical and global public health student community. Students will  typically take this course in conjunction with a beginner or an intermediate level Spanish  language course.

The course is designed for students who want to perfect their Spanish as they expand their knowledge regarding literature, cinema, and social and political problems that exist today within modern Argentine society. The reading of different dramatic texts and viewing of various films throughout the semester will serve to expand lexicon, strengthen grammar and improve the student's style. The objective of this course is that the students familiarize themselves with everyday language of current newspapers and magazines, at the same time as they enter into the world of Spanish literature.   The most important goal of the course is to offer a methodologically simple approximation that helps the student to develop a greater verbal and communicative dexterity. To this end, every week the students will analyze and debate the cultural and literary content texts that are to be studied and every two weeks the students will present a written composition of the topics covered in class. In the classroom linguistic correction will be emphasized along with auditory practice through the use of a wide range of materials and resources: theoretical explanations, comprehension and vocabulary exercises, film viewing, as well as exercises that highlight certain morphological aspects or grammatical usage of Spanish.

Through the analysis of artistic images of Mexico , Peru, Brazil and Argentina, will discuss the role of visual representation in the process of conquest and colonization of the territory in Latin America, and later in the construction and consolidation of national states and regional identities. With the alternation of guided visits to museums in Buenos Aires and classes, students will have the opportunity to learn about artistic languages \u200b\u200b, techniques , iconography , production systems , and some aspects of Latin American history .

Mitos, \u00edconos y tradiciones inventadas is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the rich and complex history of Latin America through the study of some of its most known and iconic cultural expressions. It does also work as an introductory map to the most influential and widespread approaches in Latin American social sciences, cultural studies and literary criticism. Thus, students will not only have a first encounter with key historical processes that lie behind some well know cultural icons, but also will be introduced to arguments and ways of writing that help constitute modern Latin American educated Spanish. The course will be structured in seven topics; each topic will be covered in two weeks. During these four classes, students will be exposed to different kinds of cultural materials, including literary texts, film, papers from several disciplines, theater plays, art shows and live concerts.

When Taught in Spanish, Prerequisite of Advanced Spanish language skills required. (NYU SPAN-UA 100 Advanced Grammar &amp; Composition or equivalent.)   The objective of the course is to analyze the social, cultural and political transformations experienced in Argentina during the XX century. The scheduled activities are divided into theory-practice classes and cultural visits. There are required readings for the classes which are usually based in a general bibliography that will give the student a factual context of each unit. Ideas exchange will take place, so the students should read the material in advance in order to continue with the course. The objective of cultural activities is to link the students with the material dimension of history, putting themselves in contact with crucial clues for its comprehension.

La lengua de Buenos Aires is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the most outstanding features of the Spanish of the Rio de la Plata area. It does also work as an introductory map to the main problems and questions of the culture of the city of Buenos Aires. Through a lively discussion of current cultural conflicts in politics, literature, music, drama and film, the course will enhance the listening and reading abilities of the students, while improving their speaking and writing proficiency in Spanish. These said conflicts and their transformations are key to an understanding of the way porte\u00f1os speak and think. From a first section devoted to political discourse, we will move onto a consideration of its rhetorical precedents in argentine literature. This will give us the critical tools we need to further our inquiries in other fields such as rock, drama, journalism and film.

The course is designed to introduce students to the work of Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century. Through reading, analysis, and discussion of short fiction or poems and critical bibliography, the students will examine the dichotomy civilization-barbarism in Borges works (in connection to the Argentine cultural tradition since nineteenth century); some key topics in his texts such as tigers, labyrinths and libraries; the relationship between writing and translation (specifically in the English translations of his fictions); the political aspects of the literature produced by Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers on Eva Per\u00f3n. The course will also develop the connections between Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers.

Indigenous communities of the Amazon (Achuar) and the Pampas-Patagonia region (Mapuche, Rank\u00fclche); b) Andean peasants (Aymaras) and indigenous proletariat of the Chaco (Toba); c). working class and ethnic neighborhoods of the city. By means of this empirical survey we hope to illustrate and discuss the some of the different ideas that have come to the fore in recent debates about \u201cculture,\u201d including essentialism and constructivism; rethinking of the nature/culture dichotomy; and the idea of cultural identity as a right, as a strategy of domination or as a form of resistance, etc.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Fotograf\u00eda y literatura en Am\u00e9rica Latina - SPAN-UA 9550 - 4 points                               Este curso se pregunta qu\u00e9 es y c\u00f3mo se lee una fotograf\u00eda.

Argentina passed the same-sex marriage law in 2010 and the gender identity law in 2011, followed by Uruguay; Colombia approved the legal recognition of same sex couples, and in Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, the pressure of queer demands and visibility in the public sphere is stronger than ever. The conventional map of \u201cadvanced democracies\u201d crafting models of democratization that could be exported to less developed nations seems definitely challenged: a new understanding of the complex, and multiple temporalities of queer cultures in North and South America is more necessary than ever.    In order to explore this rich and multi-layered landscape, this course wants to trace and reconstruct the historical detours of queer cultures in Buenos Aires and New York. Taking as starting point the present context of growing acceptance and inclusion of queer citizens both in Latin America and the US, the course revisits the last three decades in order to question the dominant and frequently reductive narratives of steady, lineal progress. Our goal is precisely to advance a periodization sensitive to the nuances and contradictions of this complex historical transformation.

Despite conditions of economic and political oppression, Latin America has managed in recent years to forge a dynamically original cinema. After studying some European films that highlight the colonial background of current struggles in the world, we take a brief look at African cinema and then look closely at Latin American cinema, with films from Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Cuba. The emphasis throughout is on a common theme \u2013 the struggle against foreign domination and on the search for an authentic, innovative national cinematic style.

Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now.

There are two parts to this course. In the first part of the course we will study two of the main financial asset markets: bond markets and stock markets. We will study the concept and determination of interest rates; the risk structure and the term structure of interest rates; stock pricing and the efficient markets hypothesis; cross-border arbitrage. We will also analyze financial structure in Argentina and other Latin American banks.   In the second part of the course we will study the monetary and financial system. We will study how money is created, the tools of monetary policy, the commercial banking industry and its links to monetary policy and the Central Bank, and how monetary policy affects the economy in general. In this part we will also analyze how market failures (such as information asymmetries) and distortionary policies (such as financial repression) may hinder the contribution of financial markets and monetary policy to macroeconomic stability. The roles of state-owned banks in Latin American economies will also be discussed.

Two sections, one in each city, will meet and collaborate simultaneously via internet to address several key questions: How are art and politics understood and expressed differently and similarly in these two American metropolises and why? How do shared aesthetic features of public art reflect the global circulation of urban creative modes? What do we learn about local politics from looking at the art and writing on a city\u2019s public spaces? Teams of students in both cities will conduct field work in selected neighborhoods to help create an archive of murals, graffiti, performances, and installations. Then, drawing from readings in history, art criticism, and urban studies, as well as from census and electoral data and using GIS technology, we will analyze how social and political processes like gentrification, inequality, and planning generate and reflect creative political expression as captured in our database, culminating in transnational, collaborative projects that explore what wisdom and truths America's streets continue to reveal, 500 years after conquest.                                                                      Internship Seminar and Fieldwork SCA-UA 9042 or INDIV-UG 9150 - 4 points                               Enrollment by permission only. Application required. Please visit the NYU Buenos Aires Internships Page for application information. Intermediate Spanish or above is strongly recommended.   This course requires a 90-minute weekly seminar and a minimum of 10 hours fieldwork a week at an approved internship field site. The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Argentine Civil Society. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency. The course provides you with tools to analyze your organization\u2019s approach, its policies, its programs, and the political, legal, social, economic and cultural contexts in which it operates. Guest-speakers are invited to the seminar and case studies on Argentina civil society are discussed.&amp;nbsp; You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

Argentina passed the same-sex marriage law in 2010 and the gender identity law in 2011, followed by Uruguay; Colombia approved the legal recognition of same sex couples, and in Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, the pressure of queer demands and visibility in the public sphere is stronger than ever. The conventional map of \u201cadvanced democracies\u201d crafting models of democratization that could be exported to less developed nations seems definitely challenged: a new understanding of the complex, and multiple temporalities of queer cultures in North and South America is more necessary than ever.    In order to explore this rich and multi-layered landscape, this course wants to trace and reconstruct the historical detours of queer cultures in Buenos Aires and New York. Taking as starting point the present context of growing acceptance and inclusion of queer citizens both in Latin America and the US, the course revisits the last three decades in order to question the dominant and frequently reductive narratives of steady, lineal progress. Our goal is precisely to advance a periodization sensitive to the nuances and contradictions of this complex historical transformation.

Advanced Spanish skills (beyond Intermediate II) recommended.   This course combines a seminar based weekly section together with intensive internships in businesses, NGOs or other organizations. The experiential part will consist of 10 weekly hours of work within a pre-arranged organization. The academic part is meant to assist students in getting the most from this experience and provide theoretical and methodological elements to critically examine their experiences. It weaves together research design and methods with an empirical and theoretical examination of recent social phenomena in Argentina. We will use selected themes and topics to explore theoretical perspectives and selected aspects of contemporary Argentine society. In parallel we will explore how to construct a research project, collect data and analyze its contents.

It is intimately related to public health and policy making, as it provides elemental \u201cinformation for action\u201d. This course is designed to introduce students to the history, basic principles and methods of epidemiology.     Topics covered in this course are history, background and different perspectives of epidemiology, measures of disease frequency; measures of association; epidemiologic study designs; public health surveillance; outbreak investigations; assessment of causality; and relationship between epidemiology and public health policies. In addition, students are expected to develop skills to critically read, interpret and evaluate health information from published epidemiological studies and mass media sources.

This course introduces students to key concepts in health policy formation, implementation and evaluation in a global context. Using a comparative lens, students explore organization, financing and delivery of health care services and health systems around the world. We examine the role of governmental and non-governmental agencies in delivering care and contributing to a health care infrastructure using case studies and other materials in a comparative approach. Key lessons in the implementation of new health policies and initiatives are explored across the developing world, as well as in a US as students explore health system performance, the quality and cost of care, the management of health care services, the process of health improvement and health reform. The course will use a multidisciplinary approach that employs sociological, political, economics, and ethical perspectives. The objective is to build an understanding of the fundamental ideas, issues, and problems currently debated in global health policy and management and to provide a foundation for future studies and careers in the global health field. Epidemiology in a Global World and Health and Society in a Global Context are recommended but not required pre-requisites for the course.

In this course students will develop, pitch, research, report, write, edit and present original articles of various kinds on several subjects throughout the semester. Using the city and people of Buenos Aires as their focus, students will work in teams for some projects and individually for others to hone their skills as observers, interviewers, reporters and writers.

Despite conditions of economic and political oppression, Latin America has managed in recent years to forge a dynamically original cinema. After studying some European films that highlight the colonial background of current struggles in the world, we take a brief look at African cinema and then look closely at Latin American cinema, with films from Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Cuba. The emphasis throughout is on a common theme \u2013 the struggle against foreign domination and on the search for an authentic, innovative national cinematic style.

There is a central question for the course: Is there any singularity in Latin American media? The answer assumes that there is a specific relation between tradition and modernity in Latin American societies with many consequences for mass culture and media. The constitution of mass audiences in societies where literacy was not a universal value, made significant the development of audiovisual media. The course will focus on melodrama as a configuration that made possible the emergence of specific genres in Latin American cinema, radio and television. Particularly, the \u201ctelenovela\u201d is simultaneously an aesthetic, industrial and audience phenomenon with local and global circulation. Finally, the course will discuss the role of media in dictatorship and democratic processes. Censorship and alternative media enabled many different practices for radio journalists, filmmakers or contemporary bloggers.

Covering in parallel the evolution of the international system and the changing position of the region in that same system, the course attempts to reinterpret the frameworks of analysis as perceived from the Western Hemisphere. The student will be provided with a Latin American view of the main economic developments and political processes that have given shape to each stage in time- to the structure and dynamics of the international system. The ultimate goal is to make students aware that where you stand depends on where you sit by exposing them to alternate views on concepts they are already familiar with.

COLIT-UA 998         Course Descriptions  Readings in Contemporary Lit: The form of Planetary Criticism/Death Drive/Aesthetics of Catastrophe Apter This   course will examine theories of the death drive in the aesthetics of   catastrophism drawing on classic texts by Freud, Italo Svevo, Melanie   Klein, Lacan, Georges Bataille and Marguerite Duras, as well as recent   work on worlds as places of catastrophe, dystopia, planetary dysphoria   (depression), and earthly extinction (Ray Brassier\u2019s \u201cnihil unbound,\u201d   Eugene Thacker\u2019s \u201cdark pantheism\u201d). The aim will be to emphasize   psychical processes in diagnoses of planetarity, while trying to avoid a   heavy-handed reliance on allegories of World System or the Planet or   Capital that impute subjective personalities to political entities and   geographic phantasms. We will experiment with an \u201cecology\u201d of what   Melanie Klein called \u201cthe depressive position,\u201d as it suffuses every   aspect of everyday life.   Readings in Contemporary Lit: Feminist Theory and Philosophy  Bianchi In   this course we will address key texts and debates in feminist and   gender theory. We will consider various theoretical foundations -   Marxism, psychoanalysis, structuralism \u2013 that have informed feminist   politics and thought, and focus on conflicts within feminism emerging   along lines of class, race, and sexual and gender identity. The course   will examine feminist approaches to knowledge and power, in particular   feminist/queer approaches to pornography, sexuality and sex work in a   global frame, and feminist critiques of science.  Junior Theory Seminar: Black Atlantic Writers  Garcia What kind of designation is the \u201cBlack Atlantic\u201d and which writers belong within its reach? This seminar explores European, Caribbean and American texts alongside theories of the Black Atlantic and other accounts of modern racial formation. Writers include Frederick Douglass, Alain Locke, Edouard Glissant, Nella Larsen, W. E. B. Du Bois, Fernando Ortiz, C. L. R. James and Stuart Hall. Topics include modernism in African American literary culture, the reading of \u201crace\u201d in British cultural studies, and the history of Afro-Cuban modernity.  Comparative Imperialisms: Anglophone Middle Eastern Literature   Halim Although literature by Middle Easterners, particularly Arabs, in English not a new phenomenon, it has boomed in recent decades. In addressing Anglophone Middle Eastern literatures, this course covers the output of both writers resident in their country of origin and ones living in the diaspora, across a range of genres, including poetry, fiction, essay, and memoir (especially cookbook memoirs). Focusing on the increasing racialization of Arabs and Muslims in the USA after 9/11 and the War on Iraq, we will pay special attention to Anglophone literature by Arab-Americans and the riposte to stereotypes it represents. Drawing on postcolonial theory and transnational studies, the course will pose, among others, the following questions: How do we parse the legacy of Orientalism in the way religion and gender inflect the perceptions of Middle Easterners, for example in the image of the veil in relation to the trope of the harem? Are there certain genres that have been privileged over others by \u00e9migr\u00e9s from the Middle East, and if so, how would we explain this? What risks of complicity may come with identities hyphenated across warring sides? What are the uses and perils at stake in deploying \u201cexile\u201d as a metaphor? Just to what extent are the terms available to describe these \u00e9migr\u00e9s \u2013 \u201cArab-American\u201d; \u201cIranian-American\u201d; \u201cAmerican Muslim\u201d; \u201cMiddle Easterner\u201d \u2013 adequate or incisive? In what way has the Arab Spring affected perceptions of Middle Easterners in Norh America? Readings by, among others: Diana Abu-Jaber; Carol Bardenstein; Hamid Dabashi; Suheir Hammad; Mohja Kahf; Hisham Matar; Nadine Naber; Azar Nafisi; Edward W. Said; Ahdaf Soueif.  Intro to Comp Lit: ECSTASY  Lezra Ec-stasy , to be drawn out of one\u2019s place, out of oneself; to be moved, enraptured, captivated. A religious experience, an erotic one, an aesthetic one; the fruit of alcohol or psychotropics, of reading or thinking, of a transcendent vision, of a sublime experience, of the touch of flesh on flesh. Also a hint of the dangerous: to lose oneself, or to lose the self\u2014with the threat that one will be unable to return to what one was, or that one will be destroyed. A fringe-concept and a fringe-experience. Literature\u2014itself a sort of border-concept, attached to different forms of expression: philosophy, theology, mythology, visual art, film, music\u2014has an old, peculiar relation to ecstasy. That relation is the subject of our class. This course serves as an Introduction to Comparative Literature through ecstasy. We will read, watch, view and listen to philosophical works by Plato (the \u201cSymposium\u201d and the \u201cPhaedrus\u201d), Kant ( Critique of Judgment ), Bataille, Adorno, Irigaray, Williams, Foucault, Deleuze, Berlant and others; fiction by Woolf ( To the Lighthouse ), Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, and Lispector; religious/autobiographical works by Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross; poetry by Ovid, Petrarch, Donne, Ronsard, Shakespeare, Quevedo, Shelley, Hopkins, and Moore; films by Bu\u00f1uel ( Belle de jour ), Almod\u00f3var ( Matador ), Hitchcock ( Rope ); Mozart/da Ponte\u2019s opera Don Giovanni ); selections from Beethoven\u2019s Fidelio , and albums by Patti Smith, the Velvet Underground, the Doors, and Nirvana; and sexological treatises by Sacher-Masoch. (Not all of these, but many of them.)  The Spanish Civil War: Fascism, Violence and Memory  Matos-Martin Widely acknowledged as a precursor to World War II, the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) \u201crevealed what war on European soil could mean, presaging the purificatory, genocidal, and retributive conflicts of those many other civil wars waged across the continent between 1939 and the end of the 1940s,\u201d as historian Helen Graham argues. As the earliest example of battleground against fascism, those conflict years fascinated and attracted individuals from across the world, including George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway, and have continued to be the object of numerous books and other cultural products. Not so well known and studied, however, is the long-lasted and violent fascist regime established once the democratic Spanish Republic was eventually defeated. The purpose of this course is to examine the war and the fascist dictatorship that followed and perpetuated the logic of war through its politics of death and repression, with a special focus on fictional and cultural representations. Literary texts, films, and documentaries will be analyzed in comparison with other artistic and cultural forms of expression (photography, painting), and accompanied by readings in history and theory. Topics to be discussed might include political and ideological dynamics of war and fascism (comparing the Spanish case with other fascist regimes such as the Nazis through such theoretical lenses as biopolitics, for example), representations of violence, memory and history, and justice. Writers, directors and artists whose works we might examine include: Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Max Aub, Guillermo del Toro, Ken Loach, Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez, Rafael Alberti, Pablo Neruda, Isaac Rosa, David Trueba, Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuerda, Pablo Picasso, and Isaac Rosa.  Text and Ideas: Paranoia  Sanders It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and of technology. But could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works, such as Daniel Paul Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness , George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four , Bessie Head\u2019s A Question of Power , J.M. Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace , as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires .  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Documents, Documentary, Fiction  Vatulescu This course will explore representative works from key moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel, literatura fakta, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression documentary books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films. What accounts for the waxing and waning of the documentary through time, as evident in its recent popularity in American culture? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. This semester\u2019s special topics are 1) the archive, 2)word/image relations, and 3) fiction vs. document. Theoretical forays around and into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in an archive of your choice.
