American Anthropological Association, Archaeology Division Monograph 8.      Gender and Archaeology (1996) (editor) - University of Pennsylvania Press.  Current News/Projects Updated August 2014 My research continues to be focused on the Near East and South Asia.   This year (2014) the American Anthropological Association will hold its   annual meeting in Washington D.C. and I have organized the session, Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage 2014 and Beyond .   Throughout history, Afghanistan has stood at a crossroads of   civilizations and a meeting of cultures visible in its monuments,   especially from the Islamic, Buddhist, and Hellenistic periods. The   names of great men like Babur and Alexander the Great have made their   place in history there. Equally significant and less well known are the   country's pre- and proto-historic past that continues to be at risk. In   the session, we will approach the years ahead by revisiting successful   projects undertaken to preserve the country's archaeological sites and   material culture in museums and on the ground during years of conflict.   Our call is the urgent need to join with Afghan scholars, American   archaeologists with varied expertise and others to save Afghanistan's   past, as the country moves forward toward increased development and   changed geopolitical realities. It is with these concerns that I   traveled to Afghanistan in July 2011 with my collaborator, Joseph   Schuldenrein, a geoarchaeologist, to the sites of Mes Aynak, where a   salvage project is taking place to preserve a major Buddhist site. The   site is located on one of the world's largest copper mines soon to be   subjected to strip mining. My purpose was to explore the Mes Aynak   landscape for evidence of ancient mining and settlement in the   prehistoric periods, coincident with the extensive trade in copper and   tin in the third millennium B.C.E. There are promising possibilities but   conducting research in the field will have to wait and now revert to   the laboratory. At the AAA meetings we will present preliminary results   of a mapping project, Mapping on Afghanistan's Archaeological and   Natural Resources, co-authored by myself, Carrie Hritz, Vincent Pigott,   Joseph Schuldenrein, and Reed Goodman. This paper chronicles part of   Afghanistan's global past, by compiling a gazetteer of archaeological   sites and its natural resource. The map integrates publicly available   satellite imagery and paper maps with past archaeological data sets in a   GIS format. Collectively, these data record millennia-long,   longitudinal shifts in human settlement, and present archaeological   landscapes that have since disappeared. A preliminary analysis of Bronze   Age settlement and its relationship to known natural resources suggests   that prehistoric sites were spatially dependent, and indicate that,   even at this early date, Afghanistan figured prominently in the Bronze   Age economy of the greater Middle East. Finally, in 2013 I organized the   conference, Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage. Honoring Omar Khan   Massoudi, in celebration of an Honorary Degree awarded to Mr. Massoudi   at NYU's 2013 commencement. Mr. Massoudi is the Director of National   Museums of Afghanistan. The conference was funded by ISAW, the   Department of Anthropology, the Center for Ancient Studies, and   CNRS/NYU. In a related project, I organized a Forum/Workshop at   the Society for American Archaeological meetings in 2013 on the renewed   interest among climatologists on the effects of climate change in South   Asia. Colleagues conducting regional research in key areas of Pakistan   and India were brought together to evaluate settlement histories,   ecological variabilities and adaptations in the face of climate change   (co-organized with Steven Weber and Joe Schuldenrein). The focus of this   session was on establishing collaborative approaches that better   document the relationship between climate change and human   adaptabilities. Claims that climate change events provide useful models   for resolving present-day debates necessitates understandings of the   complexities of climate change, the historical component that documents   human reactions to change and regional variabilities. I presented some   of our results at a paper delivered in Stockholm, Sweden in July 2014,   sponsored by the European Association of South Asian Archaeology and Art   (EASAA). The EASAA conference was my second trip to Stockholm.   The first was in June 2013, when I was invited by the Axel and Margaret   Axeson Johnson Foundation to contribute to a conference on   Civilizations, the results of which are now published in Civilisation, Perspectives from the Engelsberg Seminar 2013    (2014). Contributors included twenty-nine scholars from around the   world, who lectured on topics as broad ranging as prehistory and the   modern era, present and past politics, and philosophy. I also joined a   small group of four other scholars at a follow-on seminar. Thirty   students and faculty from Upsala and Ludden Universities continued   discussions on various aspects of civilizations, including the problem   of American power, aspects of war and disarmament, philosophy and   modernity, and the \"decline\" of the west. The seminars were held at   Engelsberg Ironworks, a UNESCO World Heritage Site where some of the   finest iron was produced in the 17th and 18th centuries, though iron   production began there in the 13th century. Several new   publications in 2013 are available on the department website. They   include \"Commodities and Things - The Kulli in Context.\" Editors, S.   Abraham, P. Gulpalli, T. Raczek, U. Rizvi.

Thirty   students and faculty from Upsala and Ludden Universities continued   discussions on various aspects of civilizations, including the problem   of American power, aspects of war and disarmament, philosophy and   modernity, and the \"decline\" of the west. The seminars were held at   Engelsberg Ironworks, a UNESCO World Heritage Site where some of the   finest iron was produced in the 17th and 18th centuries, though iron   production began there in the 13th century. Several new   publications in 2013 are available on the department website. They   include \"Commodities and Things - The Kulli in Context.\" Editors, S.   Abraham, P. Gulpalli, T. Raczek, U. Rizvi.

This interest coincides with an interest in histories of mobility generated by contemporary discourses of the global. It has taken a variety of forms, from attention to the modalities and effects of circulation - the result of diplomatic exchange and gifting, long-distance trade, or looting and reuse, for example - to research on media and regions that lie on the margins of the Islamic world, or outside the traditional boundaries of the canon. Points of Contact introduces some of the exciting new scholarship generated by these developments.           2015                 April 23, 2015       Art and Architecture of the Deccan: A Conversation       Navina\u00a0Haidar ,\u00a0 Curator of Islamic Art , Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York      and           Phillip B.

Archive      Mellon Research Initiative: Surfaces\u00a0(15th-19th\u00a0Centuries)                 Organized by Noemie Etienne, Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow, Institute of Fine Arts-NYU    This one-day symposium addresses the issue of surface in paintings, but also in sculptures, architecture and the decorative arts in Europe between the 15th and 19th centuries. The focus of this reflection is an examination of how surfaces function: how do their specific properties challenge representation or the viewer? How do they determine the consumption and engagement with the object? Later variations such as graffiti, repairs, or traces of multiple hands, may also be of interest in understanding how the surface of an artwork is redefined over time.

Representations of Musicians in the Coroplastic Art of the Ancient World: Iconography, Ritual Contexts and Functions                 Terracottas figurines with representations of musicians are a privileged field of investigation in understanding the importance of music in both its production and performative contexts. Figurines of male and female musicians are emblematic of the close link between musical practice and the sacred and ritual spheres. They contribute not only to the reconstruction of what music and the production of music meant for ancient societies, but also provide information concerning the relationship of performance to the deities, and about which musical instruments were best suited to the particulars of diverse ritual occasions, including sacred and funerary contexts.

From 'Surface' to 'Substrate': The Archaeology, Art History, and Science of Material Transfers                 The movement of materials beyond their source areas is an elementary feature of human social life. The history of complex material transfers can be traced as a continuous thread from today\u2019s global commodity flows back to the prehistoric origins of our species, when exotic substances such as ochre and shell were transported over great distances to be deployed in rituals for the dead. In recent decades the empirical base from which the history of material transfers is written has undergone a significant but rarely examined transformation.

The Koons Effect                 On the occasion of the Whitney\u2019s exhibition\u00a0 Jeff Koons: A Retrospective , this symposium brings together artists, curators, and scholars to consider Koons\u2019s significance in contemporary art and culture as well as his dialogue with certain narratives of Western art history.    click here .                 Materiality in Japan                 Japan is widely regarded as an exemplar in terms of the preservation of material integrity, the perpetuation of historical production techniques and the responsible preservation of works of architecture and artifacts in museum contexts. The Japanese certification system for Cultural Property \u2013 which also includes the category of Living National Treasures for specialist craftsmen who embody manufacturing techniques as Intangible Cultural Property \u2013 has earned far-reaching acclaim. It is frequently overlooked, however, that there is actually a wide range of divergent approaches towards originality and authenticity even in contemporary Japan. While some of these inconsistencies find their counterparts in the West, others are related to pre-modern cultural practices, e.g. concurrent concepts of artifacts in divergent contexts of reception and evaluation.

In the past few years, interest in contemporary art as a viable subject for art historical scholarship and pedagogy has substantially expanded. As increasing numbers of graduate students pursue dissertations and masters theses on the art produced in their lifetimes, many art history programs have sought to enlarge course offerings and faculty expertise in these fields. While these trends certainly reflect the growing clout of contemporary art in the marketplace and museums it may also suggest a larger shift in the discipline of art history itself.

Workshop on Digital Tools                 The\u00a0Workshop on Digital Tools\u00a0examined the use and potential of digital technologies in the research of art history, archaeology, and conservation.\u00a0With support from the Mellon Foundation, the\u00a0IFA distributed grants to five students to further their research by learning and applying tools such as GIS technology and\u00a0ImageJ\u00a0software. At the workshop, the students presented the progress of their research and their experience of using digital tools.

Duke House: A Case Study in Architecture, Decoration, and Art History                 2012 marks the hundredth year since the completion of the Duke House \u2013 originally designed for tobacco magnate, James B. Duke by the Philadelphia architect, Horace Trumbauer. In 1958, Mrs. James B. Duke and her daughter Miss Doris Duke donated the structure to New York University to house the Institute of Fine Arts. Architect Robert Venturi was charged with adapting the house for the Institute's use, which he did without altering its original architecture.    The Institute has observed this anniversary with programs that explored the Duke House in the context of architecture, urbanism and the social history of New York.\u00a0 On February 1-2, 2013 we will mark the close of the centennial celebrations with the conference\u00a0Duke House: A Case Study in Architecture, Decoration, and Art History. The conference will consider the IFA's presence at the Duke House by looking at the building \u2013 from its commissioning by the Dukes to its eventual transformation into an educational and research facility (Friday, February 1), as well as the work and influence of some of the professors who have been its inhabitants (Saturday, February 2) \u2013 Donald Hansen, Richard Krautheimer, Erwin Panofsky, and Kirk Varnedoe.
