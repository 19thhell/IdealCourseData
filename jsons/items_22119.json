Students from the two disciplines study side by side and are encouraged to take advantage of these specializations, which are supported by an internationally acclaimed faculty representing diverse styles. Graduate film composers are presented in yearly concerts at venues such as The Walter Reade Theatre in collaboration with The Film Society of Lincoln Center, The National Gallery in Washington D.C., the Tribeca Film Festival and intensive film scoring workshops in collaboration with ASCAP . Graduate concert composers participate in a yearlong course in writing for string quartet, which culminates in a performance of their works by the JACK Quartet in a public New York City venue. In addition they have the opportunity to hear their music in concerts throughout the year as well as on portrait concerts of their works at the end of their second year. All composition students have access to all departments at the university and collaborations with choreographers, visual artists, writers, filmmakers, and scholars in other fields are encouraged.    The faculty includes Robert Rowe, Julia Wolfe, Ron Sadoff, Ira Newborn, Michael Gordon, Justin Dello Joio, Mark Snow, Sonny Kompanek, Mark Suozzo, Youngmi Ha, and Tae Hong Park, among others. Guest composers in the last two years have included Steve Reich, Bruce Broughton, Louis Andriessen, Mark Isham, Meredith Monk, Jimmy Webb, DJ Spooky, Carter Burwell, Uri Caine, Morton Subotnick, Don Byron, Martin Bresnick, and more.    The Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions offers a warm and collegial atmosphere. Compositions students enjoy the support of all of the faculty and their peers. Our reputation, faculty, and location provide students with a unique opportunity to develop as composers and gain an understanding of how to pursue a career in music composition.
