The following are frequent questions asked about NYU Traveler, it's travel safety services and associated travel online booking services.   If you have any questions about NYU Traveler, please call the ITS Service Desk at 212-998-3333 or e-mail AskITS@nyu.edu , or visit www.nyu.edu/its/askits/helpdesk for support information at NYU's global sites.               General Questions  About NYU Traveler                                                    Why has the University created NYU Traveler?                               We created NYU Traveler as a   tool to enhance the safety of students, faculty, administrators, and staff traveling on   University-related business. When you book or register through NYU Traveler, your travel plans are   routed through Worldcue, a traveler safety service with which NYU has contracted. Worldcue will   automatically alert the individual traveler to dangerous conditions that may have emerged where he   or she will be traveling, and will automatically alert the University to emergencies, allowing it to   move more rapidly to assist members of the NYU community.                                                              Do I have to use NYU Traveler to book my   travel arrangements?                               NYU has a special responsibility for the   welfare of its undergraduate students, so if you are a faculty member, student, administrator, or   staff-member participating in or accompanying in an NYU trip involving undergraduates, then you and   all participants in the trip must use NYU Traveler, either to book your trip or to register your   travel arrangements.   Apart from these circumstances, the use of NYU Traveler will be   voluntary for faculty, doctoral students, post-docs, and researchers. For administrators, unit heads   will determine whether the use of NYU Traveler will be mandatory or voluntary.                                                                How do I use NYU Traveler?                               Choice was an important precept as we created NYU Traveler. When you use NYU Traveler, you have the choice of booking your arrangements with AMEX Travel or Egencia or using any travel agency you wish and registering your travel arrangements directly with Worldcue (however, by using AMEX or Egencia on the NYU Traveler site, you can save yourself that extra step of registering your travel plans with Worldcue - it\u2019s done automatically). To access AMEX or Egencia, simply enter your NYU Net ID and password.                                                                Is there training available on how to use NYU Traveler?                               The NYU Traveler team may be contacted at nyutraveler.info@nyu.edu to schedule trainings. The user guides for AMEX Travel, Egencia, and Worldcue may also assist you in your search for answers or general information.                                                                Can I book travel for someone without an NYU Net ID?                               If you are a NET ID holder, you may book travel for a non-NYU individual (i.e.: spouse, partner, guest speaker) by calling Egencia. These reservations can not be made online.                                                                How did you choose American Express and   Egencia?                               We chose these two firms because they are proven: they are widely used by   other universities and businesses for their travel programs; their on-line booking technology is   intuitive; they have 24/7 customer service, including by phone; and we were able to work with them   to automatically forward travel plan information to our travel safety service Worldcue.                                                                What if I have a travel agent whom I have always used?                               It's fine to go ahead and use him or her; it\u2019s still perfectly compatible with NYU Traveler. After you book your travel arrangements with your agent, just go to the NYU Traveler site and register your information before you travel. However, if you use AMEX or Egencia to book your travel, you will save yourself a step because reservations made via these two agencies are automatically forwarded to Worldcue, and thus Public Safety.                                                                What kind of travel should be registered on   NYU Traveler?                               For the purpose of using NYU Travel, \u201ctravel\u201d is defined as air travel   (domestic or international), travel by major rail (Amtrak or EuroRail), or a hotel stay.                                                                Can I find lower fares on other online   booking websites?                               American Express and Egencia have access to all published airfares. Either   travel management company will provide the lowest fare inventory available for the class of service   requested at the time of booking unless instructed that a less restrictive ticket is needed. When a   lower fare is found for the same flight through a different booking source such as an airline   website, it is most often because the inventory was available at the moment of the search.   Therefore, with that being said, there may be times when another site or travel agent quotes a lower   cost. Should you prefer to book your reservations through another website or agency, it's not a   problem: afterwards, you can go to NYU Traveler and register your travel info.                                                                Do AMEX or Egencia offer any price   guarantees?                               Both Egencia and AMEX offer their own fare guarantees based on specific   parameters. More information on each of these guarantees can be found within the AMEX and Egencia   booking sites.                                                                What happens after I either book or register through NYU Traveler?                               If you book through either AMEX or Egencia on the NYU Traveler site, you will receive three separate e-mails: 1) a confirmation of your itinerary from AMEX or Egencia, 2) a paid invoice from AMEX or Egencia, and 3) a Welcome e-mail from Worldcue.   If you have booked your travel though an outside agency, and register your travel through Worldcue, you will receive one e-mail: the Welcome e-mail from Worldcue. This e-mail will contain a link to create your profile with Worldcue. It is important to click on the link and complete the profile the first time as this will enable you to update your previously registered travel plans should the need arise.   Subsequently, regardless of how you booked your travel, Worldcue will alert you with follow-up e-mails if there are any current or emerging threats or safety risks in the area you are traveling to.   In addition, if you are traveling to a country that is designated as particularly dangerous, NYU's Office of Public Safety will reach out to you directly to discuss your safety and necessary provisions for your safe travel.                                                              What is this whole \"Worldcue\" thing about?   Will my information be private and secure?                               Worldcue is a service created to help protect the individual traveler: it   analyzes news and information from around the world to identify emerging issues which be a threat to   a traveler going to a particular destination. These issues became acute for the University during   the earthquake in Haiti and the uprisings in Egypt, where evacuation of NYU personnel was made more   difficult and time-consuming by the absence of precise travel information. NYU's arrangement with   Worldcue is that, after booking or registering through NYU Traveler, automatic e-mail updates will   be sent to travelers about changing conditions and threats in their destinations. The privacy of   NYU community members is important to us: your travel plan information is held safely and securely;   it will only be accessed if there is an emergency or a serious threat, and then only by the senior   leadership of NYU's Department of Public Safety.                        ^ back to top             Egencia                                                    How do I contact Egencia to make a   reservation over the phone?

The following are frequent questions asked about NYU Traveler, it's travel safety services and associated travel online booking services.   If you have any questions about NYU Traveler, please call the ITS Service Desk at 212-998-3333 or e-mail AskITS@nyu.edu , or visit www.nyu.edu/its/askits/helpdesk for support information at NYU's global sites.               General Questions  About NYU Traveler                                                    Why has the University created NYU Traveler?                               We created NYU Traveler as a   tool to enhance the safety of students, faculty, administrators, and staff traveling on   University-related business. When you book or register through NYU Traveler, your travel plans are   routed through Worldcue, a traveler safety service with which NYU has contracted. Worldcue will   automatically alert the individual traveler to dangerous conditions that may have emerged where he   or she will be traveling, and will automatically alert the University to emergencies, allowing it to   move more rapidly to assist members of the NYU community.                                                              Do I have to use NYU Traveler to book my   travel arrangements?                               NYU has a special responsibility for the   welfare of its undergraduate students, so if you are a faculty member, student, administrator, or   staff-member participating in or accompanying in an NYU trip involving undergraduates, then you and   all participants in the trip must use NYU Traveler, either to book your trip or to register your   travel arrangements.   Apart from these circumstances, the use of NYU Traveler will be   voluntary for faculty, doctoral students, post-docs, and researchers. For administrators, unit heads   will determine whether the use of NYU Traveler will be mandatory or voluntary.                                                                How do I use NYU Traveler?                               Choice was an important precept as we created NYU Traveler. When you use NYU Traveler, you have the choice of booking your arrangements with AMEX Travel or Egencia or using any travel agency you wish and registering your travel arrangements directly with Worldcue (however, by using AMEX or Egencia on the NYU Traveler site, you can save yourself that extra step of registering your travel plans with Worldcue - it\u2019s done automatically). To access AMEX or Egencia, simply enter your NYU Net ID and password.                                                                Is there training available on how to use NYU Traveler?                               The NYU Traveler team may be contacted at nyutraveler.info@nyu.edu to schedule trainings. The user guides for AMEX Travel, Egencia, and Worldcue may also assist you in your search for answers or general information.                                                                Can I book travel for someone without an NYU Net ID?                               If you are a NET ID holder, you may book travel for a non-NYU individual (i.e.: spouse, partner, guest speaker) by calling Egencia. These reservations can not be made online.                                                                How did you choose American Express and   Egencia?                               We chose these two firms because they are proven: they are widely used by   other universities and businesses for their travel programs; their on-line booking technology is   intuitive; they have 24/7 customer service, including by phone; and we were able to work with them   to automatically forward travel plan information to our travel safety service Worldcue.                                                                What if I have a travel agent whom I have always used?                               It's fine to go ahead and use him or her; it\u2019s still perfectly compatible with NYU Traveler. After you book your travel arrangements with your agent, just go to the NYU Traveler site and register your information before you travel. However, if you use AMEX or Egencia to book your travel, you will save yourself a step because reservations made via these two agencies are automatically forwarded to Worldcue, and thus Public Safety.                                                                What kind of travel should be registered on   NYU Traveler?                               For the purpose of using NYU Travel, \u201ctravel\u201d is defined as air travel   (domestic or international), travel by major rail (Amtrak or EuroRail), or a hotel stay.                                                                Can I find lower fares on other online   booking websites?                               American Express and Egencia have access to all published airfares. Either   travel management company will provide the lowest fare inventory available for the class of service   requested at the time of booking unless instructed that a less restrictive ticket is needed. When a   lower fare is found for the same flight through a different booking source such as an airline   website, it is most often because the inventory was available at the moment of the search.   Therefore, with that being said, there may be times when another site or travel agent quotes a lower   cost. Should you prefer to book your reservations through another website or agency, it's not a   problem: afterwards, you can go to NYU Traveler and register your travel info.                                                                Do AMEX or Egencia offer any price   guarantees?                               Both Egencia and AMEX offer their own fare guarantees based on specific   parameters. More information on each of these guarantees can be found within the AMEX and Egencia   booking sites.                                                                What happens after I either book or register through NYU Traveler?                               If you book through either AMEX or Egencia on the NYU Traveler site, you will receive three separate e-mails: 1) a confirmation of your itinerary from AMEX or Egencia, 2) a paid invoice from AMEX or Egencia, and 3) a Welcome e-mail from Worldcue.   If you have booked your travel though an outside agency, and register your travel through Worldcue, you will receive one e-mail: the Welcome e-mail from Worldcue. This e-mail will contain a link to create your profile with Worldcue. It is important to click on the link and complete the profile the first time as this will enable you to update your previously registered travel plans should the need arise.   Subsequently, regardless of how you booked your travel, Worldcue will alert you with follow-up e-mails if there are any current or emerging threats or safety risks in the area you are traveling to.   In addition, if you are traveling to a country that is designated as particularly dangerous, NYU's Office of Public Safety will reach out to you directly to discuss your safety and necessary provisions for your safe travel.                                                              What is this whole \"Worldcue\" thing about?   Will my information be private and secure?                               Worldcue is a service created to help protect the individual traveler: it   analyzes news and information from around the world to identify emerging issues which be a threat to   a traveler going to a particular destination. These issues became acute for the University during   the earthquake in Haiti and the uprisings in Egypt, where evacuation of NYU personnel was made more   difficult and time-consuming by the absence of precise travel information. NYU's arrangement with   Worldcue is that, after booking or registering through NYU Traveler, automatic e-mail updates will   be sent to travelers about changing conditions and threats in their destinations. The privacy of   NYU community members is important to us: your travel plan information is held safely and securely;   it will only be accessed if there is an emergency or a serious threat, and then only by the senior   leadership of NYU's Department of Public Safety.                        ^ back to top             Egencia                                                    How do I contact Egencia to make a   reservation over the phone?
