The Center was established to help advance NYU\u2019s goal of creating the country\u2019s leading data science training and research facilities, and arming researchers and professionals with tools to harness the power of big data.   CDS recently accepted its second cohort of students, who will begin the 2-year Master of Science in Data Science program this September 2014.\u00a0Admission to the MS in Data Science requires substantial but specific mathematical competencies, typical of a major in mathematics, statistics, engineering, physics, theoretical economics, and computer science with sufficient mathematical training. In addition, applicants to the degree should have some training in programming and basic computer science.   In anticipation of welcoming its second cohort, CDS is seeking an adjunct professor to teach its introductory-level graduate course: DS-GA 1008 Programming for Data Science this fall 2014 semester. \u00a0This course will serve as preparation for the higher-level required courses in the program:\u00a0 http://cds.nyu.edu/ academics/ms-in-data-science/ curriculum/required-courses/ .   The adjunct professor will give 2 back-to-back 50-minute lectures (with a 10-minute break) once per week for 14 weeks. \u00a0A lab will also be held once per week for the 14 weeks of the semester, and the professor will be able to help select the lab leader and shape the content of the lab instruction.   The course should cover the following topics:       Python 2.7   Numpy   Software engineering   The Unix command line   The pandas DataFrame structure and library   Reading and writing of CSV files using pandas   IPython command line toolkit   Matplotlib       The adjunct professor should be well-versed in the above-mentioned topics, have teaching experience, and be willing to commit to the course for the full 14-week semester. Degree(s) in computer science, data science, or similar fields are preferred.   Please note that applicants\u00a0should also be NY-based, or be able to attend all lectures and office hours as needed. \u00a0The course will take place at the Washington Square campus of NYU, and the department is unfortunately\u00a0unable to provide reimbursement for transportation, accommodations, and other living expenses.   Interested applicants should e-mail their resume/CV and cover letters to\u00a0 ds-jobs-group@nyu.edu .

The Center was established to help advance NYU\u2019s goal of creating the country\u2019s leading data science training and research facilities, and arming researchers and professionals with tools to harness the power of big data.   CDS recently accepted its second cohort of students, who will begin the 2-year Master of Science in Data Science program this September 2014.\u00a0Admission to the MS in Data Science requires substantial but specific mathematical competencies, typical of a major in mathematics, statistics, engineering, physics, theoretical economics, and computer science with sufficient mathematical training. In addition, applicants to the degree should have some training in programming and basic computer science.   In anticipation of welcoming its second cohort, CDS is seeking an adjunct professor to teach its introductory-level graduate course: DS-GA 1008 Programming for Data Science this fall 2014 semester. \u00a0This course will serve as preparation for the higher-level required courses in the program:\u00a0 http://cds.nyu.edu/ academics/ms-in-data-science/ curriculum/required-courses/ .   The adjunct professor will give 2 back-to-back 50-minute lectures (with a 10-minute break) once per week for 14 weeks. \u00a0A lab will also be held once per week for the 14 weeks of the semester, and the professor will be able to help select the lab leader and shape the content of the lab instruction.   The course should cover the following topics:       Python 2.7   Numpy   Software engineering   The Unix command line   The pandas DataFrame structure and library   Reading and writing of CSV files using pandas   IPython command line toolkit   Matplotlib       The adjunct professor should be well-versed in the above-mentioned topics, have teaching experience, and be willing to commit to the course for the full 14-week semester. Degree(s) in computer science, data science, or similar fields are preferred.   Please note that applicants\u00a0should also be NY-based, or be able to attend all lectures and office hours as needed. \u00a0The course will take place at the Washington Square campus of NYU, and the department is unfortunately\u00a0unable to provide reimbursement for transportation, accommodations, and other living expenses.
