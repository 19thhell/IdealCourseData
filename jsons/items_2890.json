Is the Jury Trial Dying?   Hosted by the Center on Civil Justice as part of the Milbank Tweed Forum   With additional support from the American Constitution Society and the Federalist Society   Jury trials in civil cases are part of our Bill of Rights, and the jury trial has always been thought of as a pillar of American democracy. In practice, however, it is increasingly rare. Why is this happening? What does the demise of the jury trial mean for our civil justice system? Does it change democratic citizenship? Can the trend be reversed? Should we try, or just allow the jury trial become a relic of an earlier time? Our distinguished panel of trial and appellate lawyers and academic experts discussed these and other hotly debated questions.   Watch the debate.
