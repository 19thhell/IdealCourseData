The hundreds of college juniors who apply each year are evaluated on academics, leadership, extracurricular activities, and community service before 10 finalists are chosen to receive $3,000 cash prizes\u2014and to be profiled in the magazine.   Prakash wowed the judges by founding the nonprofit Brighter Today , which uses eco-friendly lightbulbs to alleviate poverty in developing nations. And as part of the festivities, Glamour paired her with mentor Dave Gilboa, founder of Warby Parker , to discuss\u2014oh...you know, changing the world.   NYU Stories caught up with Prakash to talk about her star turn\u2014and what she does in her downtime. We know this isn\u2019t the last time we\u2019ll be seeing her name in headlines.                               Hometown:  Manila, Philippines   Proudest moment so far:  Taking the risk to start my own nonprofit organization, Brighter Today.   How the idea for Brighter Today came about:  In 2010, I visited a small rural Indian town called Behlana Village with my grandparents. I noticed that the families in this town, while they had incandescent bulbs, avoided utilizing lighting due to exorbitant electricity costs, which in turn prevented students from studying and inhibited women from working at home. I was stunned that this issue had become such a severe roadblock to the villagers. After interacting further with the community, I learned that the high costs stemmed in part from the use of incandescent bulbs.

The hundreds of college juniors who apply each year are evaluated on academics, leadership, extracurricular activities, and community service before 10 finalists are chosen to receive $3,000 cash prizes\u2014and to be profiled in the magazine.   Prakash wowed the judges by founding the nonprofit Brighter Today , which uses eco-friendly lightbulbs to alleviate poverty in developing nations. And as part of the festivities, Glamour paired her with mentor Dave Gilboa, founder of Warby Parker , to discuss\u2014oh...you know, changing the world.   NYU Stories caught up with Prakash to talk about her star turn\u2014and what she does in her downtime. We know this isn\u2019t the last time we\u2019ll be seeing her name in headlines.                               Hometown:  Manila, Philippines   Proudest moment so far:  Taking the risk to start my own nonprofit organization, Brighter Today.   How the idea for Brighter Today came about:  In 2010, I visited a small rural Indian town called Behlana Village with my grandparents. I noticed that the families in this town, while they had incandescent bulbs, avoided utilizing lighting due to exorbitant electricity costs, which in turn prevented students from studying and inhibited women from working at home. I was stunned that this issue had become such a severe roadblock to the villagers. After interacting further with the community, I learned that the high costs stemmed in part from the use of incandescent bulbs. I decided to make a change that summer by implementing CFL bulbs in 12 households. This figure eventually multiplied to 530 households (about 80% of the village) by early 2014 due to increased awareness around the community.   How did it feel to win the Glamour contest?  Both exciting and overwhelming. I am truly honored to be recognized part of such an incredibly passionate group of women. I am humbled by their work, by how impressive they are each as people, and by the ways I know they will create a significant impact and change the world.
