The Histopathology Core is tightly integrated with the Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Core , the second component of the Experimental Pathology Shared Resource.   Services offered by the Histopathology Core include tissue preparation, processing, sectioning and histochemical staining of both animal and fixed human tissues. All human samples are\u00a0obtained athrough the closely affiliated Human Specimen Resource Center (HSRC) , or other IRB-approved sources. In addition, the Histopathology Core provides instrumentation that is available on a self-serve basis, such as a state-of the-art Laser Dissection Microscope, a microtome, a cryostat and a microscope fitted with a digital camera, and a digital whole slide scanner.
