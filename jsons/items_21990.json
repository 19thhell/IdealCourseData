All students must enroll in the following course:      Writing for the Screen NCRD-UT 1000    Participants will examine the principles and   processes of writing for the screen. Topics include finding and   developing story ideas, film language and script structure. By the end   of the course, students will have participated in in-depth film analysis   and intensive screenwriting exercises and discussions. At the end of   the course, students are expected to complete a film treatment (prose   description of your film) with a step outline for a feature film or T.V.   episode you plan to write. In addition, you must hand in the first   scene (3-5 pages) of your script with dialogue. Non-credit tuition: $1,790 View course schedule . Next, students must enroll in two (2) of the following production courses.    Fundamentals of Sight and Sound: Filmmaking    NCRD-UT 43    Every student will conceive, produce, direct and edit five short projects (3 silent and 2 with sound) with digital filmmaking technology. Working in crews of four, students will be exposed to a variety of specific assignments in visual storytelling that feature a broad spectrum of technical, aesthetic, craft and logistical problems to be solved. Collaborating with other students through rotating crew positions will be a central focus of all production work. Lectures, labs, critiques, technical seminars, screenings and written production books will be an important component of this class. All student work is screened and discussed in class. Students should not schedule any other course on the same days as Sight &amp; Sound: Filmmaking. Non-credit tuition: $5,743 Lab fee: $566 View course schedule . Fundamentals of Sight and Sound: Studio   NCRD-UT 51                              The course provides an in-depth   exploration of the creative capabilities (technical, logistical,   aesthetic) of producing narrative-based studio production work in a   multiple camera television studio environment. Students will be trained   in working with actors and learning how to connect script and   performance to the production of four short studio based projects (each   of increasing complexity). Students will have the opportunity to develop   a single idea into a full-scale production that will be produced \"live\"   in the studio at the end of the semester. The fundamental skills   learned in this class (script, performance, lighting, camera, art   direction, coverage) will serve as a foundation for all narrative-,   experimental-, and documentary-based production work and will be   applicable in classes. Note: some casting and rehearsals will need to   be undertaken outside of class. Non-credit tuition: $5,743 Lab fee: $566 View course schedule .  Fundamentals of Sight and Sound: Documentary   NCRD-UT 80 The   course teaches students to look at their world and to develop the   ability to create compelling and dramatic stories in which real people   are the characters and real life is the plot. Through close study and   analysis of feature length and short documentaries, as well as hands on   directing, shooting, sound-recording and editing, students rigorously   explore the possibilities and the power of non-fiction storytelling for   video. The course is a dynamic combination of individual and group   production work in which each student will be expected to complete five   projects. Non-credit tuition: $5,743 Lab fee: $566 View course schedule .  Intermediate Experimental Workshop    NCRD-UT 1046 Prerequisite: NCRD-UT 43 | Sight and Sound Film Production A production course in which students experiment with non-narrative   approaches to content, structure, technique, and style. Themes and   orientations include many possibilities, such as music, choreography,   visual or audio art, investigations of rhythm, color, shape, and line;   poetry, fragmentation and collage, abstraction, performance; and   subversion of linear narrative and documentary conventions.  Non-credit tuition: $5,743    Lab fee: $566 View course schedule . Intermediate Production: The Short Commercial Form    NCRD-UT 1246 Prerequisite: NCRD-UT 43 | Sight and Sound Film Production From the Silver Screen and the television screen to computer portals,   the iPod and cell phones, the proscenium for motion pictures, videos,   commercials and new forms of web based media has evolved/de-evolved into   ever decreasing screen sizes for moving image based media content and   distribution. As screen sizes have decreased, opportunities have   increased for emerging technologies to facilitate the production and   distribution of both long and short form film, video and animation based   work. This class is intended for students with an interest in exploring   the creative and commercial aspects of the short form (30 seconds to 7   minutes). The goal of this class is for students to produce work that   results in a series of final projects that can serve as the basis of a   demo reel that will also be \"uploaded\" to a class created web site. 10   Advanced Short Form projects will be selected on the basis of a variety   of classroom research projects and concept pitches. Students will be   able to produce up to 15 minutes of completed \"short form\" work   throughout the semester working in a variety of short form genres.
