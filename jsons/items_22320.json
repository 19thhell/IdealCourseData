Focus will be on developing creativity, evolving technical and artistic skills, deepening an appreciation and understanding of the art form, and preparing students for future goals in higher education and careers in the dance field. This two-week summer session will offer an overview of dance, in its various forms, through practice, discussion, and observation. Students will: practice Classical Ballet, Modern Dance, and Jazz Dance techniques, as well as cultural/traditional world dance forms; explore improvisation as a tool for broadening creativity; learn choreography to further develop artistry and performance qualities; create dances as a means of expression and communication; observe, analyze, and reflect on the history of dance and make conjectures for the future. As part of their studies, students will attend performances and have the opportunity to discuss arts-related and higher education topics with peers and professionals in the dance field. The Summer Dance Intensive at NYU will be a unique opportunity for students to engage in a collegiate experience in one of the most arts-supportive, culturally diverse cities in the world, New York City.    Faculty    Carla Flores , Program Director    Carla Flores is originally from Austin, Texas, but moved to Houston to attend the distinguished High School for the Performing and Visual Arts as a dance major. She later graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a BFA in Ballet Pedagogy, and later completed her Master of Arts in Teaching Dance in the Professions with a concentration in American Ballet Theatre&rsquo;s (ABT) Ballet Pedagogy from New York University. Ms. Flores currently serves as program administrator, assistant director for the dance concerts, and as an adjunct professor for New York University&rsquo;s Dance Education program. She is a certified ballet teacher in ABT&rsquo;s National Training Curriculum, and currently teaches at ABT&rsquo;s Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School in the children&rsquo;s division and as part of the educational outreach program. Some of her career highlights have been touring abroad in China and France, performing ballets such as George Balanchine&rsquo;s Concerto Barocco and Ben Stevenson&rsquo;s Sentimientos , and her work with Eliot Feld&rsquo;s Ballet Tech School.

Focus will be on developing creativity, evolving technical and artistic skills, deepening an appreciation and understanding of the art form, and preparing students for future goals in higher education and careers in the dance field. This two-week summer session will offer an overview of dance, in its various forms, through practice, discussion, and observation. Students will: practice Classical Ballet, Modern Dance, and Jazz Dance techniques, as well as cultural/traditional world dance forms; explore improvisation as a tool for broadening creativity; learn choreography to further develop artistry and performance qualities; create dances as a means of expression and communication; observe, analyze, and reflect on the history of dance and make conjectures for the future. As part of their studies, students will attend performances and have the opportunity to discuss arts-related and higher education topics with peers and professionals in the dance field. The Summer Dance Intensive at NYU will be a unique opportunity for students to engage in a collegiate experience in one of the most arts-supportive, culturally diverse cities in the world, New York City.
