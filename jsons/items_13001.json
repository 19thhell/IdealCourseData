Semester: Spring       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Many developing countries have been significantly reforming the scope and organization of the public sector in recent years. This course critically examines the changing structures and operations of government fiscal systems in developing countries, with particular emphasis on the growing trend to strengthen sub-national levels. Major topics include: understanding broader national fiscal reform processes; determining an appropriate division of fiscal responsibilities among levels of government; evaluating mechanisms for decentralized government revenue mobilization; and, assessing prospects and options for pursuing decentralization and intergovernmental fiscal reform. The course focuses on economic analysis, but attention is also given to political, institutional and cultural considerations that are critical for effective policy design and implementation.

Multinational firms must have regard to the competition systems of these and other developing nations when engaging in merger activity, collaborating with competitors, and pricing, distributing, and licensing their products. Competition authorities in countries at different stages of development are trying to meet the daunting challenges posed by public and private power, cronyism and privilege, and are trying to make their markets work for the good of their peoples. This program will address the coming of age of developing countries\u2019 competition law systems, and what this means in law, policy and on-the-ground reality for entrepreneurs, consumers, \u201cthe people,\u201d and the world.
