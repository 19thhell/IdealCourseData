Intensive programs are offered throughout the year. Whether your goal is to excel in this competitive job market, to expand your overall marketability by mastering a new skill, or to embark on a journey of personal enlightenment, intensive programs at the School provide you with the tools and the knowledge base you need to succeed. Study options are available in a wide range of disciplines. Be sure to register early for these currently offered intensives as enrollment is limited and courses fill quickly!   An increasing number of intensives are offered throughout the year. However, the vast majority are offered during the summer. No matter when you choose to enroll in an intensive, you will find that the small class sizes, condensed formats, and convenient schedules provide a distinct advantage. Intensives allow you to immerse yourself in your studies and absorb a wealth of information in a short period of time. Hone your skills, broaden your horizons, and build your professional network, while studying on-site, online, or abroad.
