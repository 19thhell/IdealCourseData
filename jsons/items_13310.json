The core curriculum includes laboratory rotations, ordinarily in two or three of   the Center's laboratories . By the end of the first year, students   have usually selected an area and laboratory in which they wish to pursue their dissertation research.   A three-member faculty committee, including the chosen research sponsor oversees the conduct of   students' research. This committee is typically supplemented by two additional members to form   the examining committee for the doctoral dissertation.        NYU Shanghai track in Neural Science  NYU's portal campus in Shanghai is recruiting doctoral students through  the Shanghai track of the Doctoral Program in Neural Science. NYU Shanghai  and its partner East China Normal University jointly operate an  Institute of Brain and Cognitive Science. IBCS has a broad vision, the  areas of research include neural circuit mechanisms of cognitive  function (such as decision-making and human language), and  inter-disciplinary computational neuroscience. For more information  about IBCS and its faculty, see   the NYU Shanghai page .     Students in the Shanghai track will spend one and half years at  NYU in New York for course work and laboratory rotations, before  joining a laboratory in Shanghai for thesis research. They will  maintain a close tie with New York, and they will receive an NYU Ph.D.         New Admission Process - See Below        Academic Requirements    Overall Requirements  Students in the Doctoral Program in Neural Science normally register for 9-12 credits of course work each semester; a minimum of 72 course credits is required for the Ph.D.    Core Curriculum  All students are required to take the 28-credit core curriculum, normally in the two semesters of the first year. This curriculum consists of lecture and laboratory courses taught by a team of Center faculty members who provide in-depth treatment of all major areas in neuroscience.   Laboratory  The laboratory component of the curriculum includes both hands-on experience with a variety of neurobiological methods in a weekly six-hour instructional laboratory and also two or three rotations in laboratories of members of the Center. The rotations are of particular importance for students joining the program, because they provide experience in the variety of research topics and methods used in the Center. The rotations also allow students to investigate possible laboratories for thesis work. In addition, students attend a weekly one-hour colloquium at which outside speakers discuss their research. Several journal clubs provide forums for student discussion of the current research literature.    Research  Pre- and postdoctoral trainees formally present their current research at the Center's semi-monthly Fellows' Seminar . An advisor and two other faculty members guide the student in selection of courses and laboratory rotations. Students are encouraged to interact with all other members of the Center, who are also available for advice and guidance.   Further Study  After completing the core curriculum, each student's program is individually tailored to take maximum advantage of course offerings in areas relevant to his or her selected areas of interest.    Advanced Curriculum  Extensive doctoral course offerings available in the Center for Neural Science, the Programs in Basic Medical Sciences, and the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology provide a rich and advanced curriculum in all areas of neuroscience and related sciences. In addition, members of the Center offer advanced seminars in areas of their own research.    General Requirements for the doctorate at NYU  The Graduate School of Arts and Science home page provides listings of these offerings as well as information on transfer credits and other general requirements for the doctorate at New York University. It is expected that the student will fulfill the course requirements, complete the doctoral research, and defend the thesis within five years.           Ph.D. Course Requirements and Sample Ph.D. Curriculum      A minimum of 72 points is required, at least 32 of which must be taken in residence at New York University.      For students who began the program in September 2000 or later , at least 37 points must be    taken in graded courses. The first year core curriculum, required of all    students, includes the following graded courses: Cellular, Molecular    &amp; Developmental Neural Science, G80.2201 (4 points); Sensory &amp;    Motor Systems, G80.2202 (4 points); Cognitive &amp; Behavioral Neural    Science, G80.2205 (4 points); Mathematical Tools for Neural Science,    G80.2207 (4 points); Laboratory in Neural Science I &amp; II G80.2203    &amp; 2204 (3 points each); and Introduction to Research in Neural    Science I, II G80.2210, 2211 (3 points each). These are all graded    courses. In addition, students attend the   Seminar in    Current Topics , the  Fellows' Seminar , and a series of Workshops for Emerging Scientists .   Note that second and third year students ordinarily register for 9 points per semester.  Students in the fourth year and beyond ordinarily register only for the courses needed to  meet the 72 points required for graduation.   Students who have earned 72 points \"maintain matriculation.  That is, they maintain registration as full-time students without registering for courses.   CNS students may maintain matriculation without charge for six semesters.   \"Introduction to Research\" course should be taken only by students who are doing  rotations. Once you are attached to a laboratory, these courses are inappropriate.   The courses \"Readings in Neural Science\" and \"Research Problems in Neural Science\"  are intended to provide appropriate course credits for the faculty-guided readings and research necessary for preparation of the PhD thesis. These courses can be taken more than once for credit.      \"Dissertation Research\" courses should be taken only by students who have completed  about 66 points and the required number of points in graded courses. These courses are  ordinarily taken by students who are preparing the thesis document.

The main research facilities of the Center comprise 26,000 square feet of newly renovated laboratory and office space at 4 Washington Place, adjacent to the Departments of Physics and Psychology. Facilities include laboratories for the 16 core faculty, and shared laboratories for histology, microscopy, cell and molecular biology, photography, digital imaging, and computing. Associates of the Center with adjacent laboratories in the Departments of Physics and Psychology have an additional 12,000 square feet of laboratory space; associates with laboratories in other departments have use of a further 19,000 square feet. The Center incorporates modern vivarium facilities operated by the University's Office of Laboratory Animal Services, which provides suitable support personnel to assist researchers and students in animal research, including work with nonhuman primates. The Center jointly operates an electronic and machine shop with the Department of Psychology; the shop provides modern facilities for the development of specialized electronic and mechanical devices.       The Center's research laboratories contain an unusually comprehensive array of modern research instrumentation. A centrally supported network of superminicomputers and microcomputers guarantees the availability of the most modern computing facilities for experimental work, data analysis, and modeling. Individual laboratories are fully equipped with modern instrumentation and computers and provide facilities for advanced research in neurochemistry, neurophysiology, biophysics, behavioral neuroscience, visual science, auditory science, mathematical biology, computational neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. In addition, the Center stresses the shared use of advanced facilities in areas such as computer-aided neuroanatomy, molecular and cellular neurobiology, and computer graphics and image processing, thereby making available research tools of a caliber not usually encountered in individual research laboratories.      A 1,500-square-foot teaching laboratory, used for  laboratory courses in both the doctoral and undergraduate programs,  provides a high-quality environment for hands-on training in the  techniques of modern neuroscience. The laboratory provides outstanding  facilities for topical experimentation in neurophysiology and biophysics,  neurochemistry, experimental neuroanatomy, and behavioral neuroscience. A  separate computer laboratory provides modern facilities for laboratory  instruction in computational and theoretical neuroscience.             Admissions, Financial Aid & Housing    Admissions     The Doctoral Program in Neural Science (Faculty of Arts and Science) and the  Doctoral Program in Neuroscience & Physiology (Sackler Institute, School  of Medicine) have harmonized their academic and research requirements and  will process applications jointly. Details of the shared neuroscience  curriculum and combined pool of neuroscience faculty mentors can be found  at neuroscience.nyu.edu .  Your application will therefore be  considered by a joint admissions committee, and you will be eligible  for admission to either program. Our goal is to help you match with  the program that best fits your interests.    Admission to the Doctoral Program in Neural Science is limited to qualified students, as documented by high scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), superior undergraduate grades, and excellent letters of recommendation.   Students seeking admission should have a strong background in one or more of the academic areas involved in neuroscience, such as biology, experimental psychology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science, or engineering science.   Students with foreign qualifications must demonstrate their command of written and spoken English before admission to the Center. Qualified women and minority students are especially encouraged to apply.    Applications are due by December 1 for admission the following fall.   For more information (including instructions, forms, and FAQs) and to complete an application, please visit the GSAS Application ResourceCenter.      Financial Aid  The Center provides support for students in the neural science program through fellowships, traineeships and assistantships so that students can devote themselves full time to their studies. Stipend levels equal or exceed those at other major research universities. Support for the first year is normally in the form of a University fellowship or NIH traineeship; in subsequent years, support is available in the form of traineeships, teaching assistantships and research assistantships.   Students are also actively encouraged to seek fellowship support from such outside sources as NSF and NIH, but the availability of multiple support mechanisms assures for each student in good standing the continuation of support for at least the five years normally required for completion of the doctorate.    Housing     Doctoral students in the Neural Science program are eligible to receive housing benefits while they are enrolled full time and in good standing:      1) First year students are guaranteed subsidized, furnished housing,  through the MacCracken program, located in Stuyvesant Town, which is  approximately 1 mile from the Center and served by a free campus shuttle bus.  More information on the MacCracken Housing Program can be found at   http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.financialaid.mhp        2) Students in non-University, off-campus apartments will receive  an allowance specifically to help offset the cost of market-rate,  New York City housing. Students in good standing in the program will  receive an allowance for every month they reside off-campus, including  during the first year if they do not elect the MacCracken option described  above. The NYU Off-Campus Housing Office can assist students to find  housing: http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/off-campus-living.html .       NYU has limited on-campus graduate housing for students after their  first year. Interested students can apply to the Housing Office to be  placed on a waitlist. When selecting students from the waitlist, GSAS  gives priority to international students and to students who have a  permanent United States address that is more than 35 miles from NYU.  More information about on-campus housing options can be found at:   http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living.html.

Support for the first year is normally in the form of a University fellowship or NIH traineeship; in subsequent years, support is available in the form of traineeships, teaching assistantships and research assistantships.   Students are also actively encouraged to seek fellowship support from such outside sources as NSF and NIH, but the availability of multiple support mechanisms assures for each student in good standing the continuation of support for at least the five years normally required for completion of the doctorate.    Housing     Doctoral students in the Neural Science program are eligible to receive housing benefits while they are enrolled full time and in good standing:      1) First year students are guaranteed subsidized, furnished housing,  through the MacCracken program, located in Stuyvesant Town, which is  approximately 1 mile from the Center and served by a free campus shuttle bus.  More information on the MacCracken Housing Program can be found at   http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.financialaid.mhp        2) Students in non-University, off-campus apartments will receive  an allowance specifically to help offset the cost of market-rate,  New York City housing. Students in good standing in the program will  receive an allowance for every month they reside off-campus, including  during the first year if they do not elect the MacCracken option described  above. The NYU Off-Campus Housing Office can assist students to find  housing: http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/off-campus-living.html .       NYU has limited on-campus graduate housing for students after their  first year. Interested students can apply to the Housing Office to be  placed on a waitlist. When selecting students from the waitlist, GSAS  gives priority to international students and to students who have a  permanent United States address that is more than 35 miles from NYU.  More information about on-campus housing options can be found at:   http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living.html.

Experimental approaches in neural science  vary from analyses of molecular and cellular mechanisms in nerve cells and  groups of nerve cells to behavioral and psychological studies of whole  organisms. Theoretical tools include mathematical and computational  modeling approaches that have proved useful in other areas of science.  Experimental questions include issues related to biophysical and  neurochemical mechanisms within single nerve cells, functional neural  circuits consisting of small numbers  of neurons, the behavior of large systems of neurons, and the  relationship between the activity of elements of the nervous system and the  behavior of organisms.          The undergraduate Neural Science curriculum blends courses from many of the  basic sciences as a foundation for higher level work in Neural Science.            Minimum requirements for graduation include:         6 courses in Neural Science (24 pts)   3 courses in Biology (12 pts)    2 courses in Chemistry (10 pts)    1 course in Physics (5 pts)    1 course in Psychology (Statistics) (4 pts)      1 course at the Calculus level in mathematics (4 pts)    1 upper level elective course in either Biology or Experimental  Psychology.

Advisors at the College Advising office,  and DUSs in other departments, cannot declare a student a Neural  Science major. In order to be eligible to declare a Neural Science major, a  student must have grades of C or better in all courses required for the  major that have been completed   at the time of declaration. Students cannot officially declare the Neural  Science Major until they have received a grade of B- or better in   Introduction to Neural Science (INTRONS) .       Students who have completed INTRONS may submit their request to declare  their major electronically here:           Declaration of Neural Science Major             Students who are not eligible to declare the major may request to receive  announcements of interest to intended majors here:           Neural Science Interest Form           Specific Course Requirements for the Major      Neural Science Courses:   The first course students take in Neural Science is Introduction to  Neural Science (INTRONS) , taught annually in the Fall; ideally this  course should be taken in the sophomore year after a student has completed  the first 2 courses of the Biology Core sequence (Bio I, Bio II). Following  Introduction to Neural Science, students take each of two higher level  Neural Science courses: Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology (CMNB) ,  taught annually in the Fall, and Behavioral and Integrative Neuroscience  (BINS) , taught annually in the Spring; these courses should ideally be  taken in the Sophomore or Junior year.     Students then take three of the Neural Science elective courses:  e.g., Development and Dysfunction of the NS , Computational  Neuroscience , or Special Topics in Neural Science .         Biology Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take the first 3 courses of  the Biology core curriculum: Principles of Biology I, II , and   Molecular and Cell Biology I . The first two of these courses are  preparation for Introduction to Neural Science. The third, MCBio 1, is the  prerequisite to Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology , and is typically  taken in the same semester as INTRONS. MCBio 1 is only offered in the Fall  semester.   In addition, majors can then choose to  take one or more courses from a selection of upper level offerings in the  Biology curriculum (see list below).        Psychology Courses:      Neural science majors are required to take a statistics course:   Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences PSYCH-UA 10. Students  may request the substitution of other courses from minors or other majors  for this requirement as well, but Quantitative Reasoning in the College Core Curriculum is not an  acceptable substitution.  Majors can then choose to take one or more courses from a selection of   upper-level  offerings in the Experimental Psychology curriculum (see list below).        Chemistry Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take 2 chemistry courses with the  associated labs: General Chemistry I & II . As these classes are a  prerequisite to MCBio 1, most majors will take these courses in conjunction  with Bio I & II in their freshmen year. PreHealth note: Pre-health  students must also take Organic Chemistry I & II .        Physics Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take one course in Physics:   General Physics II . Pre-health students must also take General  Physics I .      Physics II is offered annually in the  Spring and is required prior to Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology .   Neural Science majors who are not completing the Pre-Health track   may request an  exemption from the Physics I prerequisite to Physics II from the Physics  department when registering in the Spring semester.        Mathematics Courses:      All Neural Science majors must take Calculus I . There is room in  the curriculum in the event that students require precalculus-level  mathematics. Students interested in Computational Neuroscience research are encouraged  to pursue Caluclus II or above.       Computer Science Courses:    Introduction to Computer Science is recommended for all students,  but not required.     Grading and Academic Performance Requirements   The minimum acceptable grade in courses required for the major is C.  These academic standards must be maintained in order for major standing to  continue.       Honors  Students must apply to the DUS for admission to the Honors Track.   Students requesting Honors status must receive a B or better in  Introduction to Neural Science, achieve a grade point average of 3.65 or  better in all courses required for the major and 3.65 over all courses  taken for credit. Students should also demonstrate a genuine interest in  research. Students must conduct at least one semester of research with a  faculty member affiliated with the Center for Neural Science (or an  otherwise approved faculty member). The student must submit an honors  thesis that must be accepted for Honors   standing by the faculty sponsor and the DUS. Presentation of the  thesis work at NYU's annual Undergraduate Research Conference is required.  Students must also complete 8 additional credits of coursework by taking two laboratory classes and an  Honors seminar.    To apply for admission to the Honors Track, please   submit the application here .       For key dates pertaining to the Honors and Research Track, please see here .      For formatting guidelines for the Honors thesis, please see here .                     Minors   There is no Minor concentration in Neural Science. Neural Science  courses can be taken as electives through the Biology or Psychology  Departments for interested students. Students wishing to major in Neural  Science and declare a Minor in another science department must take 1-2  additional courses in that department, beyond those required for the major  (one for Chemistry, two for Psychology). Students may not minor in Biology.             Double Majors   Students wishing to major in Neural Science and declare a second major in  another science department may be required to take 1-2 additional courses  beyond those required for the major in that department as approved by the  DUSs.           For students wishing to double major in Psychology and Neural  Science:   PSYCH 10 ( Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences ) and NEURL-UA 220  ( Behavioral & Integrative NS ) can be used toward the degree in both  majors. If the student chooses to fulfill the 'Biology/Psychology' elective  requirement with a Psychology course, this course can not be one used  toward the Psychology degree.             There is no allowed double-major for Neural Science and Biology.              Core Curriculum of the College of Arts and Science   All students must meet the additional requirements of the College Core Corriculum in order to have a broad,  well-rounded liberal arts education. Neural Science students need to  satisfy the Expository Writing, Foreign Language, and Foundations of  Contemporary Culture components of the Core Curriculum. In addition, students may need  to pass the English Writing Proficiency exam administered by the Expository  Writing program. The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) requirement is satisfied through the Neural Science major course requirements.          Study Abroad   Neural Science now has study away courses that can be taken at NYU Shanghai.  They are Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology and three Neural Science  electives: Neural Bases of Speech and Language; Networks and Dynamics;  and Free Will and the Brain. In addition, the major requires many  science classes outside of the department, which can be taken abroad.  Students studying in London or Sydney typically take  Physics II (PHYS-UA 9012) and Cognition (PSYCH-UA 9029) to fulfill  the upper-level Biology/Psychology Elective requirement of the major.  Molecular and Cellular Biology II and Biochemistry I can also be taken  at NYU Tel Aviv, while Perception can be taken at NYU Berlin to fulfill  the upper-level Biology/Psychology elective requirement. Due to the  sequential nature of Neural Science courses, Neural Science majors  should plan to study away in the Spring of their Sophomore or Junior  year, or possibly in the Fall of their Senior year. Physics II must  be completed prior to taking Cellular Molecular Neurobiology (NEURL-UA 210),  which is only offered in Spring semesters. This is the primary  sequential constraint on the Spring semester for majors. Majors  intending to do Honors are encouraged to study away during the  Sophomore year. Non-honors majors are better served studying away in  the Junior year, unless they began the major \"late\" - e.g. taking  Introduction to Neural Science (NEURL-UA 100) in their Junior instead  of Sophomore year. Students who wish to study in a non-London or  Sydney location can typically do so if they are not Pre-Health.  We also strongly encourage students to consider Summer and Winter  Study Abroad at other locations when possible. Students should consult  with their Neural Science Advisor for individualized course planning.      For more information, click here for a PDF.

The core curriculum includes laboratory rotations, ordinarily in two or three of   the Center's laboratories . By the end of the first year, students   have usually selected an area and laboratory in which they wish to pursue their dissertation research.   A three-member faculty committee, including the chosen research sponsor oversees the conduct of   students' research. This committee is typically supplemented by two additional members to form   the examining committee for the doctoral dissertation.        NYU Shanghai track in Neural Science  NYU's portal campus in Shanghai is recruiting doctoral students through  the Shanghai track of the Doctoral Program in Neural Science. NYU Shanghai  and its partner East China Normal University jointly operate an  Institute of Brain and Cognitive Science. IBCS has a broad vision, the  areas of research include neural circuit mechanisms of cognitive  function (such as decision-making and human language), and  inter-disciplinary computational neuroscience. For more information  about IBCS and its faculty, see   the NYU Shanghai page .     Students in the Shanghai track will spend one and half years at  NYU in New York for course work and laboratory rotations, before  joining a laboratory in Shanghai for thesis research. They will  maintain a close tie with New York, and they will receive an NYU Ph.D.         New Admission Process - See Below        Academic Requirements    Overall Requirements  Students in the Doctoral Program in Neural Science normally register for 9-12 credits of course work each semester; a minimum of 72 course credits is required for the Ph.D.    Core Curriculum  All students are required to take the 28-credit core curriculum, normally in the two semesters of the first year. This curriculum consists of lecture and laboratory courses taught by a team of Center faculty members who provide in-depth treatment of all major areas in neuroscience.   Laboratory  The laboratory component of the curriculum includes both hands-on experience with a variety of neurobiological methods in a weekly six-hour instructional laboratory and also two or three rotations in laboratories of members of the Center. The rotations are of particular importance for students joining the program, because they provide experience in the variety of research topics and methods used in the Center. The rotations also allow students to investigate possible laboratories for thesis work. In addition, students attend a weekly one-hour colloquium at which outside speakers discuss their research. Several journal clubs provide forums for student discussion of the current research literature.    Research  Pre- and postdoctoral trainees formally present their current research at the Center's semi-monthly Fellows' Seminar . An advisor and two other faculty members guide the student in selection of courses and laboratory rotations. Students are encouraged to interact with all other members of the Center, who are also available for advice and guidance.   Further Study  After completing the core curriculum, each student's program is individually tailored to take maximum advantage of course offerings in areas relevant to his or her selected areas of interest.    Advanced Curriculum  Extensive doctoral course offerings available in the Center for Neural Science, the Programs in Basic Medical Sciences, and the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology provide a rich and advanced curriculum in all areas of neuroscience and related sciences. In addition, members of the Center offer advanced seminars in areas of their own research.    General Requirements for the doctorate at NYU  The Graduate School of Arts and Science home page provides listings of these offerings as well as information on transfer credits and other general requirements for the doctorate at New York University. It is expected that the student will fulfill the course requirements, complete the doctoral research, and defend the thesis within five years.           Ph.D. Course Requirements and Sample Ph.D. Curriculum      A minimum of 72 points is required, at least 32 of which must be taken in residence at New York University.      For students who began the program in September 2000 or later , at least 37 points must be    taken in graded courses. The first year core curriculum, required of all    students, includes the following graded courses: Cellular, Molecular    &amp; Developmental Neural Science, G80.2201 (4 points); Sensory &amp;    Motor Systems, G80.2202 (4 points); Cognitive &amp; Behavioral Neural    Science, G80.2205 (4 points); Mathematical Tools for Neural Science,    G80.2207 (4 points); Laboratory in Neural Science I &amp; II G80.2203    &amp; 2204 (3 points each); and Introduction to Research in Neural    Science I, II G80.2210, 2211 (3 points each). These are all graded    courses. In addition, students attend the   Seminar in    Current Topics , the  Fellows' Seminar , and a series of Workshops for Emerging Scientists .   Note that second and third year students ordinarily register for 9 points per semester.  Students in the fourth year and beyond ordinarily register only for the courses needed to  meet the 72 points required for graduation.   Students who have earned 72 points \"maintain matriculation.  That is, they maintain registration as full-time students without registering for courses.   CNS students may maintain matriculation without charge for six semesters.   \"Introduction to Research\" course should be taken only by students who are doing  rotations. Once you are attached to a laboratory, these courses are inappropriate.   The courses \"Readings in Neural Science\" and \"Research Problems in Neural Science\"  are intended to provide appropriate course credits for the faculty-guided readings and research necessary for preparation of the PhD thesis. These courses can be taken more than once for credit.      \"Dissertation Research\" courses should be taken only by students who have completed  about 66 points and the required number of points in graded courses. These courses are  ordinarily taken by students who are preparing the thesis document.

The main research facilities of the Center comprise 26,000 square feet of newly renovated laboratory and office space at 4 Washington Place, adjacent to the Departments of Physics and Psychology. Facilities include laboratories for the 16 core faculty, and shared laboratories for histology, microscopy, cell and molecular biology, photography, digital imaging, and computing. Associates of the Center with adjacent laboratories in the Departments of Physics and Psychology have an additional 12,000 square feet of laboratory space; associates with laboratories in other departments have use of a further 19,000 square feet. The Center incorporates modern vivarium facilities operated by the University's Office of Laboratory Animal Services, which provides suitable support personnel to assist researchers and students in animal research, including work with nonhuman primates. The Center jointly operates an electronic and machine shop with the Department of Psychology; the shop provides modern facilities for the development of specialized electronic and mechanical devices.       The Center's research laboratories contain an unusually comprehensive array of modern research instrumentation. A centrally supported network of superminicomputers and microcomputers guarantees the availability of the most modern computing facilities for experimental work, data analysis, and modeling. Individual laboratories are fully equipped with modern instrumentation and computers and provide facilities for advanced research in neurochemistry, neurophysiology, biophysics, behavioral neuroscience, visual science, auditory science, mathematical biology, computational neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. In addition, the Center stresses the shared use of advanced facilities in areas such as computer-aided neuroanatomy, molecular and cellular neurobiology, and computer graphics and image processing, thereby making available research tools of a caliber not usually encountered in individual research laboratories.      A 1,500-square-foot teaching laboratory, used for  laboratory courses in both the doctoral and undergraduate programs,  provides a high-quality environment for hands-on training in the  techniques of modern neuroscience. The laboratory provides outstanding  facilities for topical experimentation in neurophysiology and biophysics,  neurochemistry, experimental neuroanatomy, and behavioral neuroscience. A  separate computer laboratory provides modern facilities for laboratory  instruction in computational and theoretical neuroscience.             Admissions, Financial Aid & Housing    Admissions     The Doctoral Program in Neural Science (Faculty of Arts and Science) and the  Doctoral Program in Neuroscience & Physiology (Sackler Institute, School  of Medicine) have harmonized their academic and research requirements and  will process applications jointly. Details of the shared neuroscience  curriculum and combined pool of neuroscience faculty mentors can be found  at neuroscience.nyu.edu .  Your application will therefore be  considered by a joint admissions committee, and you will be eligible  for admission to either program. Our goal is to help you match with  the program that best fits your interests.    Admission to the Doctoral Program in Neural Science is limited to qualified students, as documented by high scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), superior undergraduate grades, and excellent letters of recommendation.   Students seeking admission should have a strong background in one or more of the academic areas involved in neuroscience, such as biology, experimental psychology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science, or engineering science.   Students with foreign qualifications must demonstrate their command of written and spoken English before admission to the Center. Qualified women and minority students are especially encouraged to apply.    Applications are due by December 1 for admission the following fall.   For more information (including instructions, forms, and FAQs) and to complete an application, please visit the GSAS Application ResourceCenter.      Financial Aid  The Center provides support for students in the neural science program through fellowships, traineeships and assistantships so that students can devote themselves full time to their studies. Stipend levels equal or exceed those at other major research universities. Support for the first year is normally in the form of a University fellowship or NIH traineeship; in subsequent years, support is available in the form of traineeships, teaching assistantships and research assistantships.   Students are also actively encouraged to seek fellowship support from such outside sources as NSF and NIH, but the availability of multiple support mechanisms assures for each student in good standing the continuation of support for at least the five years normally required for completion of the doctorate.    Housing     Doctoral students in the Neural Science program are eligible to receive housing benefits while they are enrolled full time and in good standing:      1) First year students are guaranteed subsidized, furnished housing,  through the MacCracken program, located in Stuyvesant Town, which is  approximately 1 mile from the Center and served by a free campus shuttle bus.  More information on the MacCracken Housing Program can be found at   http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.financialaid.mhp        2) Students in non-University, off-campus apartments will receive  an allowance specifically to help offset the cost of market-rate,  New York City housing. Students in good standing in the program will  receive an allowance for every month they reside off-campus, including  during the first year if they do not elect the MacCracken option described  above. The NYU Off-Campus Housing Office can assist students to find  housing: http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/off-campus-living.html .       NYU has limited on-campus graduate housing for students after their  first year. Interested students can apply to the Housing Office to be  placed on a waitlist. When selecting students from the waitlist, GSAS  gives priority to international students and to students who have a  permanent United States address that is more than 35 miles from NYU.  More information about on-campus housing options can be found at:   http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living.html.

Experimental approaches in neural science  vary from analyses of molecular and cellular mechanisms in nerve cells and  groups of nerve cells to behavioral and psychological studies of whole  organisms. Theoretical tools include mathematical and computational  modeling approaches that have proved useful in other areas of science.  Experimental questions include issues related to biophysical and  neurochemical mechanisms within single nerve cells, functional neural  circuits consisting of small numbers  of neurons, the behavior of large systems of neurons, and the  relationship between the activity of elements of the nervous system and the  behavior of organisms.          The undergraduate Neural Science curriculum blends courses from many of the  basic sciences as a foundation for higher level work in Neural Science.            Minimum requirements for graduation include:         6 courses in Neural Science (24 pts)   3 courses in Biology (12 pts)    2 courses in Chemistry (10 pts)    1 course in Physics (5 pts)    1 course in Psychology (Statistics) (4 pts)      1 course at the Calculus level in mathematics (4 pts)    1 upper level elective course in either Biology or Experimental  Psychology.

Advisors at the College Advising office,  and DUSs in other departments, cannot declare a student a Neural  Science major. In order to be eligible to declare a Neural Science major, a  student must have grades of C or better in all courses required for the  major that have been completed   at the time of declaration. Students cannot officially declare the Neural  Science Major until they have received a grade of B- or better in   Introduction to Neural Science (INTRONS) .       Students who have completed INTRONS may submit their request to declare  their major electronically here:           Declaration of Neural Science Major             Students who are not eligible to declare the major may request to receive  announcements of interest to intended majors here:           Neural Science Interest Form           Specific Course Requirements for the Major      Neural Science Courses:   The first course students take in Neural Science is Introduction to  Neural Science (INTRONS) , taught annually in the Fall; ideally this  course should be taken in the sophomore year after a student has completed  the first 2 courses of the Biology Core sequence (Bio I, Bio II). Following  Introduction to Neural Science, students take each of two higher level  Neural Science courses: Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology (CMNB) ,  taught annually in the Fall, and Behavioral and Integrative Neuroscience  (BINS) , taught annually in the Spring; these courses should ideally be  taken in the Sophomore or Junior year.     Students then take three of the Neural Science elective courses:  e.g., Development and Dysfunction of the NS , Computational  Neuroscience , or Special Topics in Neural Science .         Biology Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take the first 3 courses of  the Biology core curriculum: Principles of Biology I, II , and   Molecular and Cell Biology I . The first two of these courses are  preparation for Introduction to Neural Science. The third, MCBio 1, is the  prerequisite to Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology , and is typically  taken in the same semester as INTRONS. MCBio 1 is only offered in the Fall  semester.   In addition, majors can then choose to  take one or more courses from a selection of upper level offerings in the  Biology curriculum (see list below).        Psychology Courses:      Neural science majors are required to take a statistics course:   Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences PSYCH-UA 10. Students  may request the substitution of other courses from minors or other majors  for this requirement as well, but Quantitative Reasoning in the College Core Curriculum is not an  acceptable substitution.  Majors can then choose to take one or more courses from a selection of   upper-level  offerings in the Experimental Psychology curriculum (see list below).        Chemistry Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take 2 chemistry courses with the  associated labs: General Chemistry I & II . As these classes are a  prerequisite to MCBio 1, most majors will take these courses in conjunction  with Bio I & II in their freshmen year. PreHealth note: Pre-health  students must also take Organic Chemistry I & II .        Physics Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take one course in Physics:   General Physics II . Pre-health students must also take General  Physics I .      Physics II is offered annually in the  Spring and is required prior to Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology .   Neural Science majors who are not completing the Pre-Health track   may request an  exemption from the Physics I prerequisite to Physics II from the Physics  department when registering in the Spring semester.        Mathematics Courses:      All Neural Science majors must take Calculus I . There is room in  the curriculum in the event that students require precalculus-level  mathematics. Students interested in Computational Neuroscience research are encouraged  to pursue Caluclus II or above.       Computer Science Courses:    Introduction to Computer Science is recommended for all students,  but not required.     Grading and Academic Performance Requirements   The minimum acceptable grade in courses required for the major is C.  These academic standards must be maintained in order for major standing to  continue.       Honors  Students must apply to the DUS for admission to the Honors Track.   Students requesting Honors status must receive a B or better in  Introduction to Neural Science, achieve a grade point average of 3.65 or  better in all courses required for the major and 3.65 over all courses  taken for credit. Students should also demonstrate a genuine interest in  research. Students must conduct at least one semester of research with a  faculty member affiliated with the Center for Neural Science (or an  otherwise approved faculty member). The student must submit an honors  thesis that must be accepted for Honors   standing by the faculty sponsor and the DUS. Presentation of the  thesis work at NYU's annual Undergraduate Research Conference is required.  Students must also complete 8 additional credits of coursework by taking two laboratory classes and an  Honors seminar.    To apply for admission to the Honors Track, please   submit the application here .       For key dates pertaining to the Honors and Research Track, please see here .      For formatting guidelines for the Honors thesis, please see here .                     Minors   There is no Minor concentration in Neural Science. Neural Science  courses can be taken as electives through the Biology or Psychology  Departments for interested students. Students wishing to major in Neural  Science and declare a Minor in another science department must take 1-2  additional courses in that department, beyond those required for the major  (one for Chemistry, two for Psychology). Students may not minor in Biology.             Double Majors   Students wishing to major in Neural Science and declare a second major in  another science department may be required to take 1-2 additional courses  beyond those required for the major in that department as approved by the  DUSs.           For students wishing to double major in Psychology and Neural  Science:   PSYCH 10 ( Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences ) and NEURL-UA 220  ( Behavioral & Integrative NS ) can be used toward the degree in both  majors. If the student chooses to fulfill the 'Biology/Psychology' elective  requirement with a Psychology course, this course can not be one used  toward the Psychology degree.             There is no allowed double-major for Neural Science and Biology.              Core Curriculum of the College of Arts and Science   All students must meet the additional requirements of the College Core Corriculum in order to have a broad,  well-rounded liberal arts education. Neural Science students need to  satisfy the Expository Writing, Foreign Language, and Foundations of  Contemporary Culture components of the Core Curriculum. In addition, students may need  to pass the English Writing Proficiency exam administered by the Expository  Writing program. The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) requirement is satisfied through the Neural Science major course requirements.          Study Abroad   Neural Science now has study away courses that can be taken at NYU Shanghai.  They are Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology and three Neural Science  electives: Neural Bases of Speech and Language; Networks and Dynamics;  and Free Will and the Brain. In addition, the major requires many  science classes outside of the department, which can be taken abroad.  Students studying in London or Sydney typically take  Physics II (PHYS-UA 9012) and Cognition (PSYCH-UA 9029) to fulfill  the upper-level Biology/Psychology Elective requirement of the major.  Molecular and Cellular Biology II and Biochemistry I can also be taken  at NYU Tel Aviv, while Perception can be taken at NYU Berlin to fulfill  the upper-level Biology/Psychology elective requirement. Due to the  sequential nature of Neural Science courses, Neural Science majors  should plan to study away in the Spring of their Sophomore or Junior  year, or possibly in the Fall of their Senior year. Physics II must  be completed prior to taking Cellular Molecular Neurobiology (NEURL-UA 210),  which is only offered in Spring semesters. This is the primary  sequential constraint on the Spring semester for majors. Majors  intending to do Honors are encouraged to study away during the  Sophomore year. Non-honors majors are better served studying away in  the Junior year, unless they began the major \"late\" - e.g. taking  Introduction to Neural Science (NEURL-UA 100) in their Junior instead  of Sophomore year. Students who wish to study in a non-London or  Sydney location can typically do so if they are not Pre-Health.  We also strongly encourage students to consider Summer and Winter  Study Abroad at other locations when possible. Students should consult  with their Neural Science Advisor for individualized course planning.      For more information, click here for a PDF.

We teach you how to design new organizational structures, how to resolve conflicts, and how to supervise and mentor talented employees. We also help you with outsourcing issues, as well as decisions about which among the continually evolving technologies out there today can best nurture an organization&rsquo;s growth.   At the School of Engineering, you&rsquo;ll learn such skills because our program is flexible. You choose the concentration that interests you most before enrolling in seminar-style classes. Held in the evenings, these classes allow our students to tend to their busy lives and still earn a degree. Better yet, the seminar format allows students to work closely with their classmates and to receive individual attention from faculty. Depending on your course load, you can earn your MS in 1 to 2 years.   Admission Requirements   Criteria for admission include a bachelor&rsquo;s degree with at least a B average from an accredited college or university and demonstrated evidence of motivation, maturity, and the ability to benefit from and contribute to professional graduate studies in Organizational Behavior, Systems, and Analytics. Applicants who do not meet all the criteria may be admitted as nondegree students with the subsequent opportunity to become a degree candidate. Satisfactory scores on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) or an acceptable equivalent test, such as the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), may be used as additional support for admission to degree studies.   Students who have not completed an undergraduate course in statistics must enroll in MG 5050 Probability and Managerial Statistics or its equivalent. Students without an adequate background in computers may be required to enroll in 1 or more of the preparatory courses offered by the Department of Computer and Information Sciences.
