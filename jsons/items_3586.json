Includes ideological and political considerations and works by Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Louis Kahn, Alvar Aalto, Philip Johnson, James Stirling, Frank Gehry, and Santiago Calatrava, among others.    Neoclassicism to Realism    ARTH-UA 411 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   The Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau, celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism. Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these three stylistic movements, this course examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its political consequences as well.    Impressionism to Expressionism    ARTH-UA 412 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Beginning by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the artistic aims of 19th-century realism, this course follows the development of progressive art to the brink of cubism and pure abstraction in the first years of the 20th century. Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fauvism, and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem with the social and cultural conditions that generated them.    Cubism to Abstract Expressionism    ARTH-UA 413 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   After analyzing the invention of cubism by Picasso and Braque, this course examines its international reverberations, including Italian futurism, the later phases of German expressionism, the de Stijl movement in the Netherlands, and suprematism and constructivism in revolutionary Russia. The dada movement in the period during and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy, cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihilistic impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. The course then examines the tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as an extension and transformation of prewar trends.    Postmodern Art and Contemporary Art    ARTH-UA 414 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Surveys art in the postmodern era, ca. 1955 to the present. After examining the innovations of the neo-avant-garde generation (1955\u201375), our focus shifts from the radical innovations in mediums, materials, and techniques to the expanded field of critical engagement that contemporary art encompasses. Discrete \"early\" developments sometimes dubbed neo-dada, such as op, pop, and fluxus, but also minimalism, conceptual art, and arte povera, radically diversified the look of art and forced the dissolution of stylistic and formal categorization in favor of a classification based on a particular question, mediatic intervention, or mode of critique. If the late 20th century brought a new emphasis on gender, race, and a number of newly pressing political forces and motivations, as we enter the 21st century, post-studio (and perhaps also \"post-critical\") artistic practices increasingly tend to be reoriented toward technology and globalism, further complicating our idea of art's relationship with its own present.    Aesthetic History of Photography    ARTH-UA 431 Identical to PHTI-UT 1102. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Chronicles the history of photography's complex and symbiotic relationship to the other visual arts: painting, sculpture, architecture, installation, and performance, among others. Beginning with the medium's invention and the early fights of its practitioners to establish themselves as fine artists, the course describes photographers' unique attempts to negotiate their relationships with both artistic movements and the media culture of which they are a part. Robinson, Cameron, Emerson, F. Holland Day, Stieglitz, Moholy-Nagy, Rodchenko, Weston, \u00c1lvarez Bravo, Lartigue, De Carava, Cahun, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, and Cindy Sherman (among others) are seen within the context of their respective art worlds, so the impact of art movements, cultural attitudes, and new technologies on photographers during different historical periods can be assessed.    Social History of Photography    ARTH-UA 432 Identical to PHTI-UT 1101. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. The course emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.    South Asian Art I: Indus Valley to 1200    ARTH-UA 530 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the history of South Asia from 2000 B.C.E. to 1200 C.E., with an emphasis on the Indian subcontinent. From the Indus Valley culture to the present day, artistic production has played a critical role in the transmission of religious beliefs and the development of cultural systems in and around South Asia. Diverse regions were linked by trade, politics, and cultural relationships, and interaction can be charted through the changing forms and functions of art. We consider the historical circumstances surrounding the production of South and Southeast Asian art, as well as the problems that art historians face when trying to interpret the surviving evidence. We look at art in a variety of media, including, but not limited to, architecture, urban form, sculpture, painting, and performance.    South Asian Art II: 1200 to Present    ARTH-UA 531 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the history of South Asian art from ca. 1200 C.E. to the present.

It follows the cultivation of new tastes in the Mughal and Rajput courts through the vigorous interaction among Persian, Indic, and European artists and elites. Finally, it turns to the colonial and postcolonial artistic responses to South Asia's complex past(s). By looking at art in a range of media\u2014including, but not limited to, painting, sculpture, architecture, and photography\u2014this course considers the ways in which art actively served as expressions of political authority and cultural identity.    Art in the Islamic World I: From the Prophet to the Mongols    ARTH-UA 540 Offered periodically. 4 points.   Provides an outline of Islamic material in its early and classical periods, from 650 to 1200 C.E. The period saw the initial formation of an Arab empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, a decline in centralized authority, and the rise to political prominence of various North African, Iranian, and Central Asian dynasties from the 10th century onward. These political developments are reflected in the increasingly heterogeneous nature of Islamic material culture over this time span.    Art in the Islamic World II: From the Mongols to Modernism    ARTH-UA 541 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introduction to the arts of Islam during a period of dynamic cultural and political change in the Islamic world.

Major emphasis is given to colonial painting, sculpture, and architecture in Mexico and Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andes. Painting and sculpture of the 19th century and the secularization of Latin American art is then examined before a discussion of the establishment of modernism that comes about with the formation of academies and the travels of many artists from all parts of Latin America and the Caribbean to Europe and the U.S. from 1900 onward.

Focusing on the creation of modern building types such as the bank, state capitol, museum, railroad station, and skyscraper, the course begins in the later 18th century with the idealistic designs of Ledoux and Boull\u00e9e. After considering the forms and meanings associated with neoclassicism, the course examines the Gothic revival and subsequent 19th-century movements (e.g., high Victorian Gothic, Second Empire, beaux-arts classicism) as efforts to find appropriate expressions for diverse building forms. Students consider changes resulting from the Industrial Revolution, including developments in technology, and the reforms of art nouveau and secession architecture. Works of Adam, Soane, Jefferson, Schinkel, Pugin, Richardson, and Sullivan; McKim, Mead, and White; Mackintosh, early Frank Lloyd Wright, and others.    Modern Architecture: 1914 to the Present    ARTH-UA 409 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or Early Modern Architecture: 1776-1914 (ARTH-UA 408), or History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), or Expressive Culture: Architecture in New York Field Study (MAP-UA 722), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Neoclassicism to Realism    ARTH-UA 411 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   The Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau, celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism. Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these three stylistic movements, this course examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its political consequences as well.    Impressionism to Expressionism    ARTH-UA 412 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Beginning by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the artistic aims of 19th-century realism, this course follows the development of progressive art to the brink of cubism and pure abstraction in the first years of the 20th century. Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fauvism, and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem with the social and cultural conditions that generated them.    Cubism to Abstract Expressionism    ARTH-UA 413 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   After analyzing the invention of cubism by Picasso and Braque, this course examines its international reverberations, including Italian futurism, the later phases of German expressionism, the de Stijl movement in the Netherlands, and suprematism and constructivism in revolutionary Russia. The dada movement in the period during and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy, cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihilistic impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. The course then examines the tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as an extension and transformation of prewar trends.    Postmodern Art and Contemporary Art    ARTH-UA 414 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Surveys art in the postmodern era, ca. 1955 to the present. After examining the innovations of the neo-avant-garde generation (1955\u201375), our focus shifts from the radical innovations in mediums, materials, and techniques to the expanded field of critical engagement that contemporary art encompasses. Discrete \"early\" developments sometimes dubbed neo-dada, such as op, pop, and fluxus, but also minimalism, conceptual art, and arte povera, radically diversified the look of art and forced the dissolution of stylistic and formal categorization in favor of a classification based on a particular question, mediatic intervention, or mode of critique. If the late 20th century brought a new emphasis on gender, race, and a number of newly pressing political forces and motivations, as we enter the 21st century, post-studio (and perhaps also \"post-critical\") artistic practices increasingly tend to be reoriented toward technology and globalism, further complicating our idea of art's relationship with its own present.    Aesthetic History of Photography    ARTH-UA 431 Identical to PHTI-UT 1102. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Chronicles the history of photography's complex and symbiotic relationship to the other visual arts: painting, sculpture, architecture, installation, and performance, among others. Beginning with the medium's invention and the early fights of its practitioners to establish themselves as fine artists, the course describes photographers' unique attempts to negotiate their relationships with both artistic movements and the media culture of which they are a part. Robinson, Cameron, Emerson, F. Holland Day, Stieglitz, Moholy-Nagy, Rodchenko, Weston, \u00c1lvarez Bravo, Lartigue, De Carava, Cahun, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, and Cindy Sherman (among others) are seen within the context of their respective art worlds, so the impact of art movements, cultural attitudes, and new technologies on photographers during different historical periods can be assessed.    Social History of Photography    ARTH-UA 432 Identical to PHTI-UT 1101. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. The course emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.    South Asian Art I: Indus Valley to 1200    ARTH-UA 530 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the history of South Asia from 2000 B.C.E. to 1200 C.E., with an emphasis on the Indian subcontinent. From the Indus Valley culture to the present day, artistic production has played a critical role in the transmission of religious beliefs and the development of cultural systems in and around South Asia. Diverse regions were linked by trade, politics, and cultural relationships, and interaction can be charted through the changing forms and functions of art. We consider the historical circumstances surrounding the production of South and Southeast Asian art, as well as the problems that art historians face when trying to interpret the surviving evidence. We look at art in a variety of media, including, but not limited to, architecture, urban form, sculpture, painting, and performance.

It follows the cultivation of new tastes in the Mughal and Rajput courts through the vigorous interaction among Persian, Indic, and European artists and elites. Finally, it turns to the colonial and postcolonial artistic responses to South Asia's complex past(s). By looking at art in a range of media\u2014including, but not limited to, painting, sculpture, architecture, and photography\u2014this course considers the ways in which art actively served as expressions of political authority and cultural identity.

The period saw the initial formation of an Arab empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, a decline in centralized authority, and the rise to political prominence of various North African, Iranian, and Central Asian dynasties from the 10th century onward. These political developments are reflected in the increasingly heterogeneous nature of Islamic material culture over this time span.    Art in the Islamic World II: From the Mongols to Modernism    ARTH-UA 541 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introduction to the arts of Islam during a period of dynamic cultural and political change in the Islamic world.

Students read the work of prewar and postwar architecture critics, focusing on those who live(d) and work(ed) in New York City and those who write and wrote for the popular press. Six class sessions are devoted to thematic groupings of reviews\u2014on the skyscraper, the museum, urban planning, and more\u2014in order to compare critical language, approach, and taste, while also tracking changes in architectural style from 1900 to the present. These reviews are supplemented with readings in architectural theory that attempt to define the styles of the past and present century. Students also write three reviews themselves, including one on a building, shop, or urban plan of their choice. The course should offer both an alternative history of 20th-century New York City and an opportunity to think and write about architecture in a new and opinionated way.    Parks, Plants, and People    ARTH-UA 679 Prerequisites: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661), and permission of the program director.

Whyte and the role that good planting and a connection with nature play in improving the quality of life in the city.

Offered in the spring. 4 points.   A survey of the history, philosophy, and practice of historic preservation on the national and local levels. Through case studies, students learn about the field as a civic responsibility and public activity.
