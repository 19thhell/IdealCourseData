It creates an exhibition space unlike any other, forming not a series of rooms, but a continuing progression of movement along the exhibits.    The layout of the exhibition is chronological, starting with Hadid's student work and progressing to her recent commissions through canvases, models, prototypes and TV monitors screening recent interviews with Hadid. This chronological continuation as you progress up the ramp forms the first of many dialogues within the exhibition among the physical exhibition material, the concepts behind the work and the physical space of display, as well as the visitor's own relation to the works and concepts, thus creating an arena for the intermingling of many different dialogues between artist, curator, work, space and visitor.    The linear/chronological approach to exhibiting an artist might seem at odds with Hadid's architectural goals, breaking down preconceived hierarchies of space and movement. However, once her work is examined closely it is clear that to try and clarify it any other way would only create confusion. Although her work may be squarely placed into the \"unbuilt,\" \"built\" and \"yet to be built\" categories, to try and marshal her work in terms of aesthetic form of fashion would, I think, to be too risky - her architectural and aesthetic style remains unique throughout her career. What the Guggenheim's space does is to overlay this linear chronology with the cyclical space of the rotunda, every turn of the ramp allows the visitor to look up, down, back and across at the exhibition, to be able to view it almost as a whole.    This allows the chronology to be debased, because it means one can see what is to come, to \"anticipate\" the exhibition. It also allows the retrospection of viewing where you have just come from, forming an almost instantaneous assimilation of the present space, the space previously occupied, and that to come. This occupation of four dimensions (space and time) interacts with Hadid's own concept drawings, which, following Cubist principles, deliberately present multiple viewpoints of a single object in the two-dimensional plane of the canvas. These paintings are characterized by reduced, angular shapes; an \"explosion\" which deconstructs the building on canvas but also reconstructs it through the viewing experience. Add to these ideas the \"real time\" of the exhibition itself and the visitor becomes an epicenter of seeing and thinking, the nexus of several planes of thought, interpretation and experience. Again, this invests the visitor with a certain cultural power, that of interacting with the art in a physical, spatially aware way.          Zaha Hadid, Grand Buildings, 1985.       On the theme of aesthetics (or \"entertainment\") versus education, the Guggenheim is largely concerned with the former. I had no sense of the exhibition wanting to teach the public, it merely required a passive audience to appreciate the art, marvel at the space, and to question Hadid's architectural brilliance. The passivity of viewing was encouraged by the audio guide \"observe the organic curves Hadid uses in this building\" and the severe lack of wall text. We never hear the other side of the argument, that Hadid could be said to sacrifice simplicity of construction and practicality of space in order to pursue aesthetic and socio-political goals. Although we are told again and again about the challenges Hadid throws out at the establishment, the exhibition hurls none at her.    Here exhibition politics may be seen at work, and a certain trade-off between the Guggenheim and Hadid. Hadid gets to be exhibited at one of the recognized top art institutions in the world (a luxury rarely afforded to architects, let alone living ones), thus raising her profile even more; and the already-trendy Guggenheim gets to further its \"hip\" cache by exhibiting the most desirable architect of the year.    What the Guggenheim does is to banish any questioning of Hadid'd work through an artistic \"drugging\" of the public. Hadid's images arrest the eye and the mind so immediately that one is left very little time to absorb the larger questions, carried along up the ramp as you are by one disorienting painting after another, leading to meticulous and beautiful sculptures and space-age prototypes for cars, kitchens, lights and sofas. The visitor gets visually swept along.    For all the social dynamics of the exhibition space, the Guggenheim is catering to an art elite; it is not an exhibition designed to teach or inform the masses. The sheer lack of information on Hadid, her inspirations, methods or the process of turning her designs into reality all underlined this preoccupation with focusing instead on the \"wow\" factor. One theory might be that through too much unpicking of the dense visual trickery of Hadid some of the mystique is lost, and function of the exhibition changes to being a critique rather than a celebration/retrospective of her work. However, more likely is that the Guggenheim is firmly positing itself in the role of pleasing a section of art-going elite, media critics and corporate sponsors with a high-profile artist in a high-profile show.          Phaeno Science Center, Wolfsburg, Germany, 1999-05. Photo: Helene Binet.       Here is an exhibition in which form and function do not marry. The form of the exhibition, the space and layout, is superb, and the visual and social dialogues which it creates are unique and asserting to the exhibitionary experience, enriching the work on show. It also engages in complex meta-narratives thrusted across space and time, achieving the four-dimensionality Hadid herself searches for in her canvases. Where the exhibition falls down is the inability to marry this stunning aesthetic with a strong factual basis. The didacticism is a didacticism of image, not of information. We are told to accept the images and not to question them.    The lack of focus in explaining the images and models, the desire to maintain the mystique of the creative process, are all contributing factors to the hollowness of the experience. The smooth veneer is barely scratched, only here and there do we perceive other stories which may be told, other viewpoints which need addressing. This again is at odds with the multiple perspectives with which we can scrutinize the objects on display and the people looking at them. As an exhibition of concepts and processes Zaha Hadid is almost flawless: as an exhibition of learning, of concrete things, it falls short. But this is perhaps only to be expected when the real products of these processes are not to be found in the exhibition, they are simply too large. Perhaps then a conceptual exhibition such as this, dealing with the process of creation, can only ever achieve a small part of the whole that is a building. This is why the exhibition space feels so dynamic, with ideas passed back and forth from canvas to model to TV monitor to visitor. In this light the setting seems even more pertinent. The continuous climbing ramp symbolic of a process of movement that never reaches a definite and fixed concrete point. At the top we reach no conclusion to this story, only continuation, and so walk back down through the works, watching the unfolding of contemporary art as much as of contemporary architecture.

It creates an exhibition space unlike any other, forming not a series of rooms, but a continuing progression of movement along the exhibits.    The layout of the exhibition is chronological, starting with Hadid's student work and progressing to her recent commissions through canvases, models, prototypes and TV monitors screening recent interviews with Hadid. This chronological continuation as you progress up the ramp forms the first of many dialogues within the exhibition among the physical exhibition material, the concepts behind the work and the physical space of display, as well as the visitor's own relation to the works and concepts, thus creating an arena for the intermingling of many different dialogues between artist, curator, work, space and visitor.    The linear/chronological approach to exhibiting an artist might seem at odds with Hadid's architectural goals, breaking down preconceived hierarchies of space and movement. However, once her work is examined closely it is clear that to try and clarify it any other way would only create confusion. Although her work may be squarely placed into the \"unbuilt,\" \"built\" and \"yet to be built\" categories, to try and marshal her work in terms of aesthetic form of fashion would, I think, to be too risky - her architectural and aesthetic style remains unique throughout her career. What the Guggenheim's space does is to overlay this linear chronology with the cyclical space of the rotunda, every turn of the ramp allows the visitor to look up, down, back and across at the exhibition, to be able to view it almost as a whole.    This allows the chronology to be debased, because it means one can see what is to come, to \"anticipate\" the exhibition. It also allows the retrospection of viewing where you have just come from, forming an almost instantaneous assimilation of the present space, the space previously occupied, and that to come. This occupation of four dimensions (space and time) interacts with Hadid's own concept drawings, which, following Cubist principles, deliberately present multiple viewpoints of a single object in the two-dimensional plane of the canvas. These paintings are characterized by reduced, angular shapes; an \"explosion\" which deconstructs the building on canvas but also reconstructs it through the viewing experience. Add to these ideas the \"real time\" of the exhibition itself and the visitor becomes an epicenter of seeing and thinking, the nexus of several planes of thought, interpretation and experience. Again, this invests the visitor with a certain cultural power, that of interacting with the art in a physical, spatially aware way.          Zaha Hadid, Grand Buildings, 1985.       On the theme of aesthetics (or \"entertainment\") versus education, the Guggenheim is largely concerned with the former. I had no sense of the exhibition wanting to teach the public, it merely required a passive audience to appreciate the art, marvel at the space, and to question Hadid's architectural brilliance. The passivity of viewing was encouraged by the audio guide \"observe the organic curves Hadid uses in this building\" and the severe lack of wall text. We never hear the other side of the argument, that Hadid could be said to sacrifice simplicity of construction and practicality of space in order to pursue aesthetic and socio-political goals. Although we are told again and again about the challenges Hadid throws out at the establishment, the exhibition hurls none at her.    Here exhibition politics may be seen at work, and a certain trade-off between the Guggenheim and Hadid. Hadid gets to be exhibited at one of the recognized top art institutions in the world (a luxury rarely afforded to architects, let alone living ones), thus raising her profile even more; and the already-trendy Guggenheim gets to further its \"hip\" cache by exhibiting the most desirable architect of the year.    What the Guggenheim does is to banish any questioning of Hadid'd work through an artistic \"drugging\" of the public. Hadid's images arrest the eye and the mind so immediately that one is left very little time to absorb the larger questions, carried along up the ramp as you are by one disorienting painting after another, leading to meticulous and beautiful sculptures and space-age prototypes for cars, kitchens, lights and sofas. The visitor gets visually swept along.    For all the social dynamics of the exhibition space, the Guggenheim is catering to an art elite; it is not an exhibition designed to teach or inform the masses. The sheer lack of information on Hadid, her inspirations, methods or the process of turning her designs into reality all underlined this preoccupation with focusing instead on the \"wow\" factor. One theory might be that through too much unpicking of the dense visual trickery of Hadid some of the mystique is lost, and function of the exhibition changes to being a critique rather than a celebration/retrospective of her work. However, more likely is that the Guggenheim is firmly positing itself in the role of pleasing a section of art-going elite, media critics and corporate sponsors with a high-profile artist in a high-profile show.          Phaeno Science Center, Wolfsburg, Germany, 1999-05. Photo: Helene Binet.       Here is an exhibition in which form and function do not marry. The form of the exhibition, the space and layout, is superb, and the visual and social dialogues which it creates are unique and asserting to the exhibitionary experience, enriching the work on show. It also engages in complex meta-narratives thrusted across space and time, achieving the four-dimensionality Hadid herself searches for in her canvases. Where the exhibition falls down is the inability to marry this stunning aesthetic with a strong factual basis. The didacticism is a didacticism of image, not of information. We are told to accept the images and not to question them.    The lack of focus in explaining the images and models, the desire to maintain the mystique of the creative process, are all contributing factors to the hollowness of the experience. The smooth veneer is barely scratched, only here and there do we perceive other stories which may be told, other viewpoints which need addressing. This again is at odds with the multiple perspectives with which we can scrutinize the objects on display and the people looking at them. As an exhibition of concepts and processes Zaha Hadid is almost flawless: as an exhibition of learning, of concrete things, it falls short. But this is perhaps only to be expected when the real products of these processes are not to be found in the exhibition, they are simply too large. Perhaps then a conceptual exhibition such as this, dealing with the process of creation, can only ever achieve a small part of the whole that is a building. This is why the exhibition space feels so dynamic, with ideas passed back and forth from canvas to model to TV monitor to visitor. In this light the setting seems even more pertinent. The continuous climbing ramp symbolic of a process of movement that never reaches a definite and fixed concrete point. At the top we reach no conclusion to this story, only continuation, and so walk back down through the works, watching the unfolding of contemporary art as much as of contemporary architecture.
