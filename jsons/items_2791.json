Edge of Empires vividly illustrates the international,\u00a0pluralistic character of\u00a0 Dura-Europos , a city strategically located high above the Euphrates River, between Syria and Mesopotamia. The exhibition focuses on its final phase, in the third century CE, when Dura-Europos served as an important Roman stronghold on the empire\u2019s eastern edge. Many of the objects on view demonstrate the coexistence of multiple religions\u2014including polytheistic cults, Judaism, and Christianity\u2014the great variety of languages employed by its population, and its role as an international military garrison.          This exhibition has been organized by the Yale University Art Gallery and\u00a0the McMullen Museum , Boston College.\u00a0The ISAW presentation has been made possible through the support of\u00a0the Leon Levy Foundation . Additional funding has been generously provided by the David Berg Foundation.

Edge of Empires vividly illustrates the international,\u00a0pluralistic character of\u00a0 Dura-Europos , a city strategically located high above the Euphrates River, between Syria and Mesopotamia. The exhibition focuses on its final phase, in the third century CE, when Dura-Europos served as an important Roman stronghold on the empire\u2019s eastern edge. Many of the objects on view demonstrate the coexistence of multiple religions\u2014including polytheistic cults, Judaism, and Christianity\u2014the great variety of languages employed by its population, and its role as an international military garrison.          This exhibition has been organized by the Yale University Art Gallery and\u00a0the McMullen Museum , Boston College.\u00a0The ISAW presentation has been made possible through the support of\u00a0the Leon Levy Foundation .

The colloquium explores the place of Judaism and Christianity in the historical and social setting of the ancient world. The formative period for classical Judaism and the origins of Christianity unfolded in the wider setting of the cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and Mesopotamia. Yet, Judaism and Christianity are often studied in isolation from this broader context. Scholars of Judaism and Christianity will examine the many ways that these two religions were shaped by the experience of living among these ancient civilizations.   Presentations include \u201cSelling Souls: Early Christians (and Their Neighbors) as Religious Entrepreneurs\u201d and \u201cPractices of Seeing God(s) in Late Antiquity\u201d as well as \u201cThe New Testament as a Source for the History of the Jews and Judaism,\u201d the keynote address by NYU\u2019s Lawrence Schiffman (March 26, 5:15 p.m.).   The full program may be viewed here .   The event is free and open to the public, which may call 212.992.7978 or email ancient.studies@nyu.edu for more information.

Edge of Empires vividly illustrates the international,\u00a0pluralistic character of\u00a0 Dura-Europos , a city strategically located high above the Euphrates River, between Syria and Mesopotamia. The exhibition focuses on its final phase, in the third century CE, when Dura-Europos served as an important Roman stronghold on the empire\u2019s eastern edge. Many of the objects on view demonstrate the coexistence of multiple religions\u2014including polytheistic cults, Judaism, and Christianity\u2014the great variety of languages employed by its population, and its role as an international military garrison.          This exhibition has been organized by the Yale University Art Gallery and\u00a0the McMullen Museum , Boston College.\u00a0The ISAW presentation has been made possible through the support of\u00a0the Leon Levy Foundation .

The colloquium explores the place of Judaism and Christianity in the historical and social setting of the ancient world. The formative period for classical Judaism and the origins of Christianity unfolded in the wider setting of the cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and Mesopotamia. Yet, Judaism and Christianity are often studied in isolation from this broader context. Scholars of Judaism and Christianity will examine the many ways that these two religions were shaped by the experience of living among these ancient civilizations.   Presentations include \u201cSelling Souls: Early Christians (and Their Neighbors) as Religious Entrepreneurs\u201d and \u201cPractices of Seeing God(s) in Late Antiquity\u201d as well as \u201cThe New Testament as a Source for the History of the Jews and Judaism,\u201d the keynote address by NYU\u2019s Lawrence Schiffman (March 26, 5:15 p.m.).   The full program may be viewed here .   The event is free and open to the public, which may call 212.992.7978 or email ancient.studies@nyu.edu for more information.

Its former students include 14 popes, notably Pope Pius XII, Pope Paul VI, and Pope John Paul I, as well as 20 saints and 39 beatified, including Saint Robert Bellarmine, Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, Saint Maximilian Kolbe, and Roger Boscovich. Schiffman, who served on the International Liaison Committee for global Catholic-Jewish dialogue, constructed a course, which runs through mid-December, to investigate the significance of the Dead Sea Scrolls for reconstructing the history of Judaism in Second Temple times. Schiffman\u2019s students, primarily priests and nuns from around the globe, are learning about what the scrolls tell us about groups other than the Dead Sea sectarians (Essenes), who collected the texts at Qumran, and on issues related to the development of Rabbinic Judaism. Attendees to Schiffman\u2019s lectures have included the German ambassador to the Vatican. Reporters interested in speaking with Schiffman should contact James Devitt, NYU\u2019s Office of Public Affairs, at 212.998.6808 or james.devitt@nyu.edu , or Schiffman directly at lhs1@nyu.edu .
