As members of a metropolitan community, NYU students have access to the University\u2019s greatest resource: New York City itself. They use the city to launch a great career. Students intern for the world\u2019s most influential companies, biggest media outlets and largest organizations. They network with some of the most powerful people in the city, the country and the globe. Students also get involved in the community, volunteering or working for one of the city\u2019s many charities or even starting community service organizations of their own. That\u2019s just one example of how students take leadership positions that prepare them for what lies ahead after college.          NYU is \"in and of the city,\" and now with its growing global presence, in and of the world. Student Life at NYU reflects this.

They can develop and engage in a diverse, personal spiritual life. Academy Award winning directors and prize winning writers have honed their craft in NYU classrooms. Students can follow in their footsteps, exploring radio, film and the printed word by contributing to or joining one of the University\u2019s student media outlets. From Washington Square News to WNYU Radio to Tisch film courses, NYU students take advantage of New York City as a global center for media, journalism and communications.

Students can live in residential housing near the Washington Square campus\u2014soaking in the vibrant Greenwich Village neighborhood\u2014or they can live off campus in one of the five boroughs and beyond. With either option, students aren\u2019t just residents of a college campus; they are citizens, users and a vital aspect of one of the world\u2019s largest, diverse, most interesting cities.     As members of a metropolitan community, NYU students have access to the University\u2019s greatest resource: New York City itself. They use the city to launch a great career. Students intern for the world\u2019s most influential companies, biggest media outlets and largest organizations. They network with some of the most powerful people in the city, the country and the globe. Students also get involved in the community, volunteering or working for one of the city\u2019s many charities or even starting community service organizations of their own. That\u2019s just one example of how students take leadership positions that prepare them for what lies ahead after college.          NYU is \"in and of the city,\" and now with its growing global presence, in and of the world. Student Life at NYU reflects this. An NYU education is an experience like no other: diverse, cosmopolitan, vibrant and rich. NYU students do not just become well-rounded college graduates, but accomplished global citizens.

Art, Education, and Community Practice    Welcome to our new, socially oriented Art + Education program at NYU. Fall 2014 will be the first year of this innovative master's program that explores the intersections between contemporary artistic practice, educational theory, and social activism. We are looking for students who are interested in envisioning new ways that artists, educators, designers, community organizers, and social activists can work together, and within community-based settings to propose critical interventions that inspire dialogue and catalyze social change through the arts. Investigate:       What is artistic activism?    How is artistic activism similar to and different from social practice or socially engaged art?    What are the aesthetics and ethics of artistic activism?    How do we know when artistic activism is most effective, toward what ends?       Explore:       Greenwich Village and New York City, the cultural capital of the world, including world renown museums such as The New Museum, MoMA, and the Whitney Museum, along with nearby galleries in the Lower East Side and Chelsea    A comprehensive curriculum in contemporary visual art, educational theory, and social activism that combines theory with practice    A flexible program of study that can be tailored to your interests       Collaborate:       Work with practicing artists and educators in community-based and neighborhood settings around New York City    An internationally renowned and dedicated faculty from across New York University schools and programs    A richly diverse and multicultural community committed to social justice       Connect to Communities Grounded in the work of critical educational theorists including Paolo Freire and bell hooks, this program supports artists and other publicly situated activists to connect visual strategies with the needs of a community. Students learn from artists who do socially engaged work, examining how art and design can open dialogue about a community&rsquo;s history, culture, and social needs. Drawing on community organizing strategies and artistic activism, students are directly involved in putting ideas generated with the community into practice. This hands-on approach leads to a capstone project, which provides an opportunity to design and implement a community-based art project that allows for social transformation. In this program students assume major roles in changing the social, cultural, political, and economic landscape through their artistic practice. This interdisciplinary program prepares students to work within community-based settings, museums, NGOs, or broader public and civic contexts to initiate social change through the arts.    This program does not lead to certification for teaching. One-Year Program with Small Classes Classes are small and personal attention is given to each student throughout the duration of program, from initial advisement through completion of the master's final project.    The program can be completed in as little as 3 semesters or 12 months, as a full-time student. The program can also be completed as a part-time student in two years.    Enrollment    The Art, Education, and Community Practice program serves individuals interested in socially engaged art who want to work outside of or in collaboration with traditional venues (museum, gallery arena, and classrooms). Students come from a wide variety of backgrounds including studio art and design, community-based organizations, social activism, and a variety of education contexts. Graduates may also serve as artists and organizers working as educators, curators, and artists in museums, community-based organizations, and NGOs. The program will initially enroll a total of 5-7 new students in the Fall semester of each year.    For Examples of Student Work    Visit our Art, Education, and Community Practice blog .    More Information    Information sessions for the Art + Education MA programs will be offered in the Fall semester.
