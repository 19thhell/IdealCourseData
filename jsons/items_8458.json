Another term  apw  , roughly signs, figures, was the term for the  actual hieroglyphic symbols.       The  Egyptians had a strong belief in the efficacy of the written or spoken word, or  of images. What was written or otherwise  depicted had the potentiality to become real.         ka -statue         Extensive use of statues and other  images in Egyptian religion        Egyptian religion is frequently  characterized as a cult religion       Creation by  logos .

He is the nexus between the world of humanity and that of the gods. His divinity is of a lesser quality.        the   king is responsible for the maintenance of  M3`t , maat roughly rightful order, guidance upon earth. He is charged with this obligation by the  gods at his ascension to the throne. Later,  the duty to maintain Maat becomes more or less  universalized throughout society.
