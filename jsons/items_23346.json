A focus on research-informed, direct practice with individuals, groups, and families runs though our entire MSW curriculum.   We also offer emphasis on policy practice for students with community and policy interests, integrated primary and behavioral health care, and global social work practice with opportunities to study abroad. All programs have a strong social justice commitment. Our faculty includes the nation's top scholars who are creating new knowledge for tomorrow's social work practice.   The nationally acclaimed NYU Master of Social Work degree is attainable through three full-time and three part-time programs to meet the needs and interests of our student population. We also offer four dual-degree program options in the areas of child development, global public health, law and management.     MSW assessment findings from the 2009 CSWE EPAS ( PDF ).

A focus on research-informed, direct practice with individuals, groups, and families runs though our entire MSW curriculum.   We also offer emphasis on policy practice for students with community and policy interests, integrated primary and behavioral health care, and global social work practice with opportunities to study abroad. All programs have a strong social justice commitment. Our faculty includes the nation's top scholars who are creating new knowledge for tomorrow's social work practice.   The nationally acclaimed NYU Master of Social Work degree is attainable through three full-time and three part-time programs to meet the needs and interests of our student population. We also offer four dual-degree program options in the areas of child development, global public health, law and management.     MSW assessment findings from the 2009 CSWE EPAS ( PDF ).

discipline for leadership positions at the national and global levels. Our specific aim is to competitively position graduates for top-tier academic and research opportunities, such as faculty positions at leading research universities, and to cultivate the next wave of independent investigators, scholars, and social work leaders. NYU Silver immerses its doctoral students in cutting-edge quantitative and qualitative research, providing them with the rigorous methodological, conceptual, and statistical research training critical for next-level success. We enrich students through more than our advanced coursework. Silver School doctoral students are paired from day one with a research mentor as part of our personalized mentoring program, helping them develop competencies in core research, scholarship, and teaching areas.   NYU Silver\u2019s outstanding faculty are renowned for their expertise in several key research areas, including poverty studies, mental health services research, and children and family research. We offer an unparalleled research environment and platform for study. Silver School doctoral students impact and are impacted by the diversity, dynamism, and richness of New York City, while NYU\u2019s Global Network University initiative provides global opportunities to address critical social welfare issues through research and direct service abroad.

A focus on research-informed, direct practice with individuals, groups, and families runs though our entire MSW curriculum.   We also offer emphasis on policy practice for students with community and policy interests, integrated primary and behavioral health care, and global social work practice with opportunities to study abroad. All programs have a strong social justice commitment. Our faculty includes the nation's top scholars who are creating new knowledge for tomorrow's social work practice.   The nationally acclaimed NYU Master of Social Work degree is attainable through three full-time and three part-time programs to meet the needs and interests of our student population. We also offer four dual-degree program options in the areas of child development, global public health, law and management.     MSW assessment findings from the 2009 CSWE EPAS ( PDF ).
