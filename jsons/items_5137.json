Among the panelists will be Cheryl Krugel-Lee,\u00a0Deena Sami,\u00a0 Katarina Wong and Michael George. \u00a0   Cheryl Krugel-Lee    Cheryl Krugel-Lee is a Brooklyn-based composer, arranger, and orchestrator, whose work spans both the commercial and classical worlds.\u00a0Cheryl earned her Bachelor of Music from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and her Master of Music degree from New York University, where she studied primarily with Ira Newborn. She has composed scores for theatre productions and films, orchestrated for musical theatre, collaborated with choreographers and created numerous works for a concert setting. Cheryl has had her music performed at Carnegie Hall, Jones Hall in Houston, Texas, Dixon Place, and The Actors Temple Theatre. Cheryl\u2019s professional advice for students interested in careers in the arts would be:       To pursue their artistic goals.   To get involved with the arts administration of an organization as these organizations can offer opportunities from within that might not be available to people not working in that specific environment. On the other hand, in case one decides that he/she is no longer interested in pursuing a purely artistic career, having experience at an arts organization helps later on with other kinds of work.        Deena Sami     Deena Sami is currently an Associate Producer for CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper 360.\u00a0Deena graduated with double majors in Journalism and Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies and minored in Politics. She interned anywhere she could get her feet in and gained \u201creal world\u201d experiences that she believes are crucial to landing a job. Deena\u2019s passion for \u201ceverything Middle East and Egypt\u201d led her to pursue a thesis on the 2011 Egyptian revolution. On an unrelated note: she\u2019s an (amateur) foodie and started an (amateur) blog chronicling her creations in the kitchen! \u00a0   Katarina Wong   Katarina studied Classics and Philosophy at St. John\u2019s College and, until recently, was the Director of Community and Curatorial Engagement at Edelman, the largest global PR firm, where she started their corporate art collection and art gallery as a Curator. Katarina will be launching her new business MADE on 10/16, which is dedicated to making art collecting more social.   Her personal and professional advice to students is:     Follow your curiosity even if it leads out of your primary area of specialty.   Be generous with your colleagues, whether it&#8217;s sharing information, donating your time or being supportive. In fact, on a networking level, artists, freelance designers, and many others in the arts industry are small business owners, so be smart.   Be knowledgeable. Don&#8217;t shy away from learning about marketing, legal issues that affect your future work (e.g., contracts, consignment agreements), taxes (and deductions!), etc.     Michael George    Michael George is a freelance editorial portrait and travel photographer based in Brooklyn, who graduated with a degree in Photography &amp; Imaging from the NYU Tisch School of the Arts in 2011. Michael currently runs his own business and works for clients such as WIRED, Runner\u2019s World, and Hello Mr. magazine. Mr. George\u2019s career advice for aspiring artists is:     To pursue personal projects alongside the work that helps keep financial stability. As you keep your passion alive for the work you really care about, eventually your paid and personal work will be one in the same.   Prove your skills to a possible hiring manager. For example, if you want to make travel work, pinch your pennies and travel.   Be patient. You will invest a lot and you will often fail, but you have to give yourself the necessary time as every industry forces you into years of paying your dues before you feel like your head is above water. Not everyone is going to be the next Ryan McGinley. Success is a strange mix of luck, networking, and incredibly hard work.

Below is her account of the visit to one of the largest sustainable industrial parks in the United States.   As part of NYU Spring at the Square, the NYU Wasserman Center hosted a visit to the Brooklyn Naval Yard, a national model for sustainable urban industrial parks and home to modern manufacturers that are tech-driven and socially responsible.   Our first stop was BLDG 92 , a building with LEED Platinum certification, that is also a public space that showcases the history and innovation of The Brooklyn Navy Yard \u2013 from the Revolutionary War to the transformation in jobs and industry happening in New York City right now. For over 15 years, much to my surprise, the Navy Yard Development Corporation has operated an on-site Employment Center, and is dedicated to connecting local residents to employment opportunities with any of its 330 tenants or local retailers. To give you a little context, \u00a0for 150 years the Yard churned out America&#8217;s most famous fighting ships, from the USS Maine to the USS Missouri. Today, the Yard houses 300+ designers and manufactures working towards increasing a greener way of life.     At the center, they specialize in placements for job seekers of all skill levels, with emphasis on local residents (including NYCHA residents), Veterans, and individuals with experience in the following sectors: industrial/manufacturing, tech, sustainability, green design, hospitality, and warehouse/distribution to name a few. They also provide: placements both inside and outside of the Yard, assistance with interviewing &amp; other \u201csoft\u201d skills, training and education classes and support services post-placement. For further information about the Employment Center please email/call at: ecenter@brooklynnavyyard.org | 718-907-5996.   Back on the tour, our second stop was EcoLogic Solutions (ELS), a sustainable corporation specializing in manufacturing and distributing environmentally friendly cleaning products. The mission of ELS to provide their products to an array of industries \u2014 food service, hotels, and educational institutions. By providing sustainable products, EcoLogic Solutions helps businesses green their operations, while keeping costs low. We learned how their products are made and had insightful and inspiring Q&amp;A session with the company\u2019s CEO, Anselm Doering.     At the end of the tour, I got to thinking: since the days of the Industrial Revolution, we\u2019ve tied manufacturing to smoke stacks and polluting factories. But today\u2019s generation of manufacturers \u2014 with a keen eye on environmental impact \u2014 are cleaning up the sector\u2019s reputation through use of cutting-edge technology, highly efficient processes and a broad array of natural materials that are both high quality and eco-friendly. More than a few of these companies are housed in the revitalized Brooklyn Naval Yard. Our ability to choose, to decide for ourselves the type of world we want to help create and live in, has never been so readily available, as it is at The Yard.                       &rarr; Leave a comment                    Posted in Around the University , Events , Special Events                              Tagged a day in the life , career development , career exploration , career opportunities , career paths , career resources , career transition , careers , events , Spring on the Square , wasserman center                                        Develop A Personal Website To Land A Dream Job             Posted on November 1, 2013  by heathert  | Leave a comment                  Are you preparing for an interview at a marketing firm, talent agency, communications bureau, or advertising agency?

The NYU Wasserman Center @ SCPS\u2019 webinar: Business Card to Relationship gave students actionable steps to change that colorful card stock into a meaningful, real life relationship.   STEP 1: Make Your Connection   The sooner you can make your connection with the contact person, the better. \u00a0Generally we suggest that you follow up within two days. \u00a0This is the perfect time to ask your contact to connect over a quick cup of coffee or 15-minute phone conversation. You can also reconnect with someone you have lost touch with. \u00a0Be sure to mention in your message:       Reminder of how you met       Why you would like to connect       How you would like to connect       After your meeting, be sure to follow up with a sincere thank you note!   STEP 2: Maintain the Relationship After Your Contact       (1-3 Months): Send a message to remind your contact of your passion for industry and that you value them as a professional contact. \u00a0Lend a \u201cvirtual hand\u201d by sending an interesting article or blog post related to your industry or invite your contact to an event that might be of interest to them.       (6+ Months): Check in with your contact and keep the relationship active. \u00a0This is a great time to share your own personal professional updates and perhaps invite them to a relevant professional event. \u00a0Prove that this is a reciprocal relationship by showing interest in their lives and careers as well.       1 Year: If you have completed these steps, you have established a relationship where you are now able to ask for an introduction to other contacts.       STEP 3: Track Your Outreach   Remember to note all of your progress as you begin to reach out to your industry contacts. \u00a0This will allow you to plan, prepare, and engage on an appropriate time frame. \u00a0You can also write down details of your conversations so you know what details to mention in your follow up.   STEP 4: Set Goals   Develop a plan for networking with achievable goals such as: meet two new contacts every week, schedule one informational interview each month, etc. Schedule an appointment with your NYU Career Counselor to go over your networking plan and help to tailor your correspondence.                       &rarr; Leave a comment                    Posted in Events                              Tagged events , networking , scps                                        Spotlight on Careers in Writing and Publishing Part 2             Posted on April 16, 2013  by heathert  | Leave a comment                  Meet successful people in the career of writing and publishing!

This year, we\u2019ll have an informal conversation, hosted by the Wasserman Center for Career Development, about the experience of Strauss Zelnick, President and Founder of Zelnick Media, in building a meaningful life.\u00a0 Students will learn first-hand about how Zelnick defines success, and the goals and skills by which he strives to achieve it.\u00a0 As an undergraduate at Wesleyan University, Strauss majored in English and Psychology, and went on to learn management and law degrees at Harvard University.\u00a0 Before founding\u00a0Zelnick Media, Zelnick was CEO and President of three major\u00a0 entertainment companies, including\u00a0 BMG Entertainment, Crystal Dynamics,\u00a0and 20th Century Fox.\u00a0 He is the author\u00a0of Success: A Concise Guide to Having the Life You Want (2011):   \u201cWhen I talk to people about their careers, I often pose the question: &#8220;What factor is most highly correlated with success?&#8221; The answers I generally hear include: intelligence, education, competence, ambition, perseverance, talent, passion and luck&#8230;In my case, I&#8217;m often asked how my own professional success came about&#8230;Over the years, as my career and interests have evolved, I&#8217;ve taken the time to change my goals accordingly, as well as to include personal ones. Knowing what I want and focusing on it has helped me largely to achieve it&#8230;The most important thing you can do to achieve the success you desire is to discover your ambition, narrow its scope with as great a degree of specificity as possible, emblazon it on your consciousness and revisit it daily.\u201d     Please join us on Wednesday, April 3, at 5:30 at the Wasserman Center for Career Development.\u00a0 To RSVP, click here .

Try speed networking!     The Women\u2019s Foreign Policy Group 2013 Mentoring Fair brought together dozens of foreign policy professionals and NYU students for a night of quick but critical insights to the field.      Even WFPG\u2019s president, Patricia Ellis , participated by speaking on her experience as a journalist for fifteen years.      Donna Welton , with over twenty-five years of experience as a diplomat and arts professional, shared her public diplomacy experiences in Japan, Indonesia, Afghanistan, and Washington. She emphasized the need for interpersonal skills, as diplomacy is often done one person at a time.   But don\u2019t let event\u2019s name mislead you: several male mentors also gave their vital expertise on how to effectively work the international affairs career path.      Donna was joined by David Firestein , Vice President for the Strategic Trust-Building Initiative and Track 2 Diplomacy at the EastWest Institute, who gave valuable advice on entering a career with the US Foreign Service. David stressed that the State Department\u2019s biggest need is smart people who can effectively communicate, recalling an experience in China where he needed to negotiate with an air traffic controller in order to secure an immediate flight out of the country.      Dan Konigsburg of Deloitte underscored the fact that professionals should bring every part of themselves to their profession, rather than have the two severed. Upon telling me that he never leaves a big event without three business cards, I astutely handed him mine.      With mentoring rounds lasting fifteen minutes each, attendees found the event helpful despite the fast pace.
