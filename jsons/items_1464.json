Prince Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Baseball is neither a metaphor for life nor a perfect explanation for the uniqueness of American culture or American character. But sport-and, for some cogent reasons, baseball in particular-does provide a way into an examination of major contemporary historical questions in the areas of race, gender, and class. The Brooklyn Dodgers' pioneering role in American racial integration in the years after World War II, for example, and the Yankees' early failure to follow suit provide useful laboratories for a study of race. The strongly macho character of baseball reveals basic gender aspirations and prejudices more subtly evoked in other areas of American life. To the extent that baseball is indeed a working-class game, fan involvement reveals much about the nature of urban class values and tensions in the 20th century. A full-length baseball-related research paper is required.    CARL E. PRINCE is Professor of History Emeritus and past president of the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic. He has published four books and numerous articles on early American political culture and edited the five-volume Papers of William Livingston. A former baseball player and lifelong fan, he is also the author of Brooklyn's Dodgers: The Bums, the Borough, and the Best of Baseball (1996), which opened for him a new academic field.    Computer Simulation (V50.0207; call # 72215) Instructor: Charles S. Peskin Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m. Prerequisites: AP calculus and physics    Since the starting point for any computer simulation is a mathematical model (i.e., a collection of equations that describe the phenomenon to be simulated), the true prerequisite for this seminar is a love of mathematics, especially calculus. Computer simulation is one way that mathematics gets applied to the real world. In this hands-on course students learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological processes. Examples include the orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of epidemic and endemic diseases in a population, including the evolution of a population in response to an endemic disease; the production of sound by musical instruments; the flow of traffic on a highway or in a city; and the electrical activity of nerves. The seminar meets alternately in a classroom and in a computer laboratory setting. The techniques needed to perform computer simulations, and to present the results in terms of elementary graphics, animations, and sounds, are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by students working individually or in teams. Topics for student projects may be drawn from those discussed in class as listed above, but students are also free to do other projects that reflect their own interests.    CHARLES S. PESKIN is Professor of Mathematics and Neural Science . His field of research is mathematical modeling and computer simulation applied to biology and medicine. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a former MacArthur Fellow, and a recipient of the Mayor's Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, as well as the Great Teacher Award of the NYU Alumni Association.    Professional Responsibility: Markets, Ethics, and Law (V50.0208; call # 72216) Instructor: Daniel Diamond Monday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    Every individual, regardless of his or her chosen field of study or occupation, will in time function as a professional or manager in a business, not-for-profit, or government organization. This course is designed to enable individuals to think critically about the ethical context and consequences of the decisions they will make in their respective professional and organizational settings. In previous generations understanding and practicing one's professional responsibilities was desirable, if not required, behavior. In our society today it is a necessity. We explore the reasons for this change and, by examining the interactions between the marketplace, societal norms, and the law, develop the ethical, analytical, and reasoning tools necessary to identify and weigh often competing interests. Ideally this enables individuals to make decisions that simultaneously cause no harm to the affected parties-customers, co-workers, community, etc.-further the goals of the organization, and enhance the professional career of the decision maker. The requisite ethical reasoning tools are developed through a series of cases and related readings dealing with a variety of topics, including ethics of the individual business professional, product liability, the social responsibility of the corporation, moral standards across borders, ethical issues in financial markets, termination and downsizing, sexual harassment, and privacy. Since this is a case course, students play an active role in the learning process during class sessions.    DANIEL DIAMOND is Professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business. He served as Dean of the Stern Undergraduate College and as Vice Dean of the Stern School from 1985 to 1995. He also held the position of Dean of the College of Management Science at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell and Director of the Northeast Region Small Business Development Center. He has published extensively in the areas of U.S. economic history, labor force trends, and labor policy. He currently teaches \"The Global Business Environment: International Macroeconomics and Finance\" and \"Professional Responsibility\" in the Stern School's M.B.A. program.    Great Poems (V50.0209; call # 72217) Instructor: David Lehman Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    The aim of this course is to change your life. We will read a selection of the greatest poems in the English language and consider what makes them great. We will discuss what distinguishes American from British poetry, and we will give some attention to questions of poetic influence and methods of composition. But the primary focus will be on reading, interpreting, and evaluating the poems themselves. The poets under consideration will include Shakespeare, Donne, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Byron, Whitman, Dickinson, Yeats, Eliot, Frost, Stevens, Auden, and Bishop. The course will conclude with some examples of contemporary American poetry.    DAVID LEHMAN is a poet, critic, and editor. In 1988 he initiated \"The Best American Poetry,\" and he continues as the general editor of this distinguished anthology series. In 1991 he published a critique of deconstruction entitled Signs of the Times: Deconstruction and the Fall of Paul de Man. His recent books include The Daily Mirror: A Journal in Poetry and The Last Avant-Garde: The Making of the New York School of Poets. His gathering of Great American Prose Poems: From Poe to the Present appeared in 2003. He is now preparing a new edition of The Oxford Book of American Poetry. He has taught the \"Great Poems\" seminar since 1997. He has also taught at Columbia University, New School University, and Bennington College.    Language and Reality in 20th-Century Science and Literature (V50.0210; call # 72218) Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the so-called two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \"postmodern\" literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\" and the \"undecidability\" of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon and from nontechnical texts on quantum and chaos theories.    Note: This seminar will meet in Weinstein Residence Hall. All students who register for this course and who requested University housing will be assigned to Weinstein.    FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German and Director of Deutsches Haus. Winner of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching, the University's Distinguished Teaching Medal, and its Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master's Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.    Cinema and Affect: Why the Movies Move Us (V50.0217; call # 72220) Instructor: Charles Affron Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Popular cinema most obviously appeals to its viewers by telling stories and representing a semblance of life. But if the movies ultimately move us they do so because they convey story and true-to-lifeness through style and through the specific properties of the cinematic medium. This seminar focuses on \"conventional\" narrative films of the 1930s and 1940s to examine how (1) the weight of style and (2) the intrinsically emotional elements of the medium elicit the viewer's affective response. The model of life serves the model of art; viewers respond to the medium when its conditions echo those of life. Film beguiles viewers to enter into its processes, and then uses those processes to capture lifelike representations of emotional situations. How do framing, display, staging, camera movement, sound, theatricality, irony, and duration conspire with narrative to move us to tears? How are viewers impelled to move with moving pictures, to be moved by them?    CHARLES AFFRON is Professor of French and Director of Graduate Studies in that department. In addition to books on the French novel and on the French Romantic theater and poetry, he has published Star Acting: Gish, Garbo, Davis, Divine Garbo (in French), Cinema and Sentiment, and Sets in Motion (with Mirella Jona Affron), a study of the relationship between set design and narrative in cinema. In 2001 he published the biography Lillian Gish: Her Legend, Her Life.    The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America (V50.0218; call # 72221) Instructor: John E. Sexton Monday, 7:00-9:00 p.m.    Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of Church and State; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a 21st-century liberal constitutional democracy.    JOHN E. SEXTON , President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and he has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.    Freedom, Classical Liberal Principles,and 21st-Century Problems (V50.0227; call # 72223) Instructor: Mario J. Rizzo Monday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the principles of classical liberalism through the discussion of theoretical and empirical issues in economics, law, and ethics. \"Classical liberalism\" is the political, economic, social, and moral philosophy that is severely skeptical of the power of the state and seeks to reduce its power over the citizen. It advances the view that society, under the rule of law, is largely self-regulating, and so government intervention, whether in economic or in social affairs, is either unnecessary or simply makes problems worse. Sometimes classical liberalism is called \"19th-century liberalism,\" but its development has roots in ancient Roman thought and in the 18th-century Scottish Enlightenment, as well as in many strains of 20th-century philosophy and economics. Its leading thinkers have included Adam Smith, F. A. Hayek, and Milton Friedman. The course considers philosophical principles and empirical issues in the context of such contemporary problems as free trade, property rights, income distribution, and social-religious toleration.    MARIO J. RIZZO is Associate Professor of Economics , as well as co-director of the Austrian Economics Program. His fields of research lie at the interface of a number of academic subjects, including the economic analysis of law, ethics and economics, and the methodology and philosophy of economics. He also has a long-standing interest in political philosophy. He is the author (with Gerald O'Driscoll) of The Economics of Time and Ignorance, many articles in law journals, and philosophically oriented articles on economic theory.    From Moving Articulators to Sound Structure (V50.0233; call # 74958) Instructor: Adamantios I. Gafos Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m.    Meaning in spoken language is communicated via sound. Sound is generated from a limited physical medium of moving articulators and their acoustic consequences. How can this physical system, the human vocal tract, communicate such richness of distinctions in meaning? To what extent is the structure of sound patterns in language influenced by constraints of the physical system? This course addresses these questions by seeking to identify the proper way to understand the relation between the cognitive aspects of sound structure and their manifestation as physical activity in the vocal tracts of actual speakers. The course begins by providing the necessary tools for exploring language sound structure. Using a research tool for visualizing multiple articulatory movements (called Mavis), we study how humans produce the consonants and vowels of different languages in isolation and in sequences. We then study how abstract sound patterns can be described as a system of conflicting and universal constraints. Different hierarchical relations between the same constraints give rise to the sound patterns of different languages. In the final part of the course, through a sequence of readings and group projects, students tackle issues in the relation between abstract sound patterns in a language of their choice and their realization in terms of activity in the vocal tract.    ADAMANTIOS I. GAFOS is Assistant Professor of Linguistics . After completing the Ph.D. in cognitive science at Johns Hopkins, and before coming to NYU, he taught at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, MIT, and Yale. His research focuses primarily on phonology, as a subfield of cognitive science, and specifically on the nature of phonological representations. He is the author of the book The Articulatory Basis of Locality in Phonology and of many scholarly articles.    In Search of Lost Time (V50.0240; call # 72227) Instructor: Marcelle Clements Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically-with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel in seven volumes and 4,500 pages, In Search of Lost Time addresses literature's richest theme: desire-its remembrance, loss, perversion, defeat, triumph, and final resurgence in the form of art. Almost 100 years old, it remains a dazzling portrait of turn-of-the-century French beau monde and, even more, of the power and elegance of its narrator's sensibility. It is still unparalleled in how it combines breadth, virtuosity, and irony, the author's extraordinary psychological acuity and the glamour of his world, as well as how it merges social history, ennui, and lust. It is also one of the world's greatest, most pleasurable, and elating reads. Although Marcel Proust (1871-1922) is usually assumed to be France's greatest novelist, his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move on, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while the texture of In Search of Lost Time (association, evocation, magnification, play of words, and memory) may have been its most radical contribution to the art of the novel, this work cannot be understood until it has been read in its entirety. In this seminar, we will keep moving at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, Time Regained.    MARCELLE CLEMENTS is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Her articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations; a novel, Rock Me; and a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman: Single Women Reinventing Single Life. Her most recent book is a novel, Midsummer.    Realism and How to Get Rid of It (V50.0244; call # 74962) Instructor: Tom Bishop Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    Realism relates both to a permanent concern of literature and art and to a \"school\" that became the dominant mode of 19th-century artistic expression. In the large sense, realism is accuracy in the portrayal of life or reality; referring to the 19th-century literary movement, realism reflects the ordinary life of the average person. The realistic novel and theater focused on the conflicts and characters familiar to readers and spectators by means of artistic conventions relating to the credibility of plot and characters, the role of narration, the function of the reader/spectator. The 20th century turned its back on realism through a series of powerful modernist and avant-garde movements that reacted against linear narrative and a literal depiction of reality. Following an examination of 19th-century realism in the novel and theater (Balzac, James, Ibsen), the seminar stresses 20th-century reactions (Borges, Beckett, Robbe-Grillet, Coover, Pirandello, Brecht, Ionesco, Genet, Pinter). These reactions include stream-of-consciousness novel, surrealism, abstract expressionism, Brechtian epic theater, theater of the absurd, first-person singular narrative, postmodern fiction. Attention is concentrated on form and language, on conventions, and on the relationship of the work to the reader or spectator. Film viewings concentrate on non-narrative cinema (Renais, Antonioni). The work of realist and nonrealist painters is also discussed.    TOM BISHOP is the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and Professor of Comparative Literature and Director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture. He chaired the Department of French for 33 years. He has written extensively on European and American theater and on contemporary French fiction and civilization. His books include studies of Beckett, Sartre, 20th-century theater, and French cultural and political life. His most recent book, From the Left Bank: Reflections on Contemporary French Theater and Fiction, appeared in 1997. He has received numerous decorations from the French government and was awarded the Grand Prize of the Acad?mie Fran?aise.    What If?: The Art and Science of Imaginative Social Constructions (V50.0249; call # 75032) Instructor: Robert Max Jackson Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    Imaginary constructions of unknown futures or pasts that never happened can help us push our understanding of social life beyond the boundaries of historical experience. What if we discover a drug that stops the aging process? What if fossil fuels had never been found? By writing stories around such puzzling questions, science fiction writers explore imaginary social worlds far outside the boundaries erected by social science's normal study of the real world and real history. In this class, we try to discover how such imaginary constructions can help us understand social life and the meanings we attach to it. Each week we pose a \"What if . . . ?\" question, read a classic work of science fiction in which that question looms large, write our own analyses of what we think possible, then discuss the merits of these alternative interpretations. This class aims to develop students' analytical skills, to explore the scientific and philosophical foundations of social issues in a new way, and to offer a special window into the wonders of science fiction.    ROBERT MAX JACKSON , Professor of Sociology , studies the ways that social inequality changes over time, reflecting his enduring puzzlement with the trajectory that took him from his youth as rural poor, white trash in the American Midwest to adulthood as a New York academic. His Destined for Equality: The Inevitable Rise of Women's Status analyzes the social causes of women's rising status in American history, and his The Formation of Craft Labor Markets shows how markets for skilled labor became organized in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During breaks from his scholarly work, he indulges his secret addiction to science fiction and mystery novels, occasionally thinking he should discover some way to portray this fascination as serious work.    New Media Law and Content Creation (V50.0253; call # 72229) Instructor: Karl P. Kilb Monday, 6:20-8:50 p.m. This course explores the legal and journalistic issues surrounding the creation and distribution of content in the \"Electronic Information Age.\" Content is a commodity that is packaged in many forms, known as \"media.\" We are all consumers of content, which is tailored by each media organization to target specific audiences. Consumers base their content choices on the type of information, as well as on the method of delivery. The traditional print and broadcast media have found a powerful, relatively inexpensive new means of distribution: the Internet. The rapid packaging of content by means of new technology has forced content creators and distributors to develop new interpretations of fundamental intellectual property issues, including copyright law. The seminar will promote active research and discussions with leaders in the media and legal professions, and explore how legislation and industry practices are responding to new technology.    KARL P. KILB, ESQ. , is the General Counsel of Bloomberg LP, managing a global Legal/Contracts Department. Before becoming an attorney in 1995, he was a broadcast journalist at FNN, CNBC, 1010 WINS Radio, Bloomberg, and various other networks and stations in New York for twelve years, having graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in broadcast journalism from NYU. He frequently lectures at universities and industry organizations about media and intellectual property law.    School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies (V50.0255; call # 72230) Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The decades of the 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition, through shared background reading, class members will work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics will be self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader.    ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is an Associate Curator in the Bobst Library and has taught in the English Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science. He is currently the librarian for education in the Social Sciences Department. First as a student and then as faculty, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.    Modern Concepts of Matter and the Cosmos (V50.0256; call # 72231) Instructor: Daniel Zwanziger Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. Prerequisite: high school physics    Since the 1970s our understanding of matter has been dominated by a paradigm known as \"the Standard Model\" of elementary particle physics. According to this model, the basic forces of nature are the strong and electro-weak forces that are transmitted by \"gauge\" fields, and the gravitational force that is described by general relativity. Elementary particles are either the quanta of the gauge fields themselves, including gluons and photons, or quarks and leptons that interact and are bound by the exchange of these quanta. This seminar reviews the Standard Model and the evidence for it. The geometric character of gauge and gravitational fields is described. Modern theories of the cosmos are presented, in the light of recent observations. Since the nature of modern physical theories is quite mathematical and geometrical, students taking this course should be intrigued by mathematical concepts.    DANIEL ZWANZIGER is Professor of Physics. His special research interest is quantum field theory applied to elementary particles. His most recent publications deal with the theory of quarks and gluons known as quantum chromodynamics.    Terrorism, Nihilism, and Modernity (V50.0267; call # 72236) Instructor: James Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The past century has witnessed violence the character and scale of which are so unique and unprecedented that we have had to create a new vocabulary to describe it (genocide, terrorism) and the ideologies that underlie it (totalitarianism, fundamentalism). To understand modern violence, we will examine the origin of the modern mind in the 17th century, when science, based on universal doubt, ended the Age of Faith, and the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority lost credibility. Nietzsche called this the \"death of God\" (and the Devil); it could also be called the death of Good and Evil, leading to another set of new words (nihilism, agnosticism, anomie, anarchy). We will study the origins and implications of these developments by reading Shakespeare and John Donne, Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, Beckett and Wittgenstein, Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well as modern mass murderers from Hitler to bin Laden. Finally, we will ask whether the modern human sciences can help us understand how to reverse or at least limit this escalation of violence.    JAMES GILLIGAN headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry. He is now an Adjunct Professor at NYU, Director of the Center for the Study of Violence, a member of President Clinton's National Commission on Youth Violence, and author of Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic and Preventing Violence: An Agenda for the Coming Century. He has been a consultant to the Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention at the World Health Organization, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and numerous other organizations.    The Art of the Enemy (V50.0270; call # 72237) Instructor: Hector Feliciano Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    The destruction of the art of the enemy, or cultural looting, has almost always been one of the staple by-products of international, civil, or religious strife. From ancient or biblical times to the recent wars in the former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, art plunder and the willful destruction of cultural patrimony-from palaces, museums, libraries, churches, mosques, and synagogues to paintings, statues, icons, and books-have been used by the victors as a supplementary means to conquer, annihilate, and humiliate the enemy. By studying some examples of destruction and looting, we will explore the enemies' fascinating political, aesthetic, or religious justifications for these acts. We will also consider why some enemies destroy while others simply take along, sell, or abandon; we will describe the positive and negative role of museums in some of these events, and learn how the \"values of collecting\" and the creation of museums may have helped to preserve art destined to be destroyed or looted by others. Above all, we will constantly be redefining what art is and what it means-to us and to our enemies. There will be guest speakers and field trips to museums.    HECTOR FELICIANO is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Formerly cultural writer for the Paris bureaus of the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, he is the author of The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works (1997); first published in French, this work has since been translated into several other languages. He served on the Panel of Experts of the Presidential Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States. He is the organizer of the First International Symposium on Cultural Property and Patrimony (Columbia University, 1999) and of a panel discussion entitled \"The Art of the Enemy\" (School of Visual Arts in New York City, 2002).    What Makes a Great Leader?: Perspectives from Government, Law, and Business (V50.0275; call # 72238) Instructor: Diane C. Yu Monday, 6:30-9:00 p.m.    Machiavelli wrote in 1532, \"There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.\" This seminar explores some of the ways in which leaders, particularly over the past two centuries, have arisen in a number of settings. How do we define greatness in leadership? Have the standards remained static, or have they changed over time? How have leaders overcome the obstacles in their paths? What, if any, traits do they have in common? Do leaders make the times in which they serve, or do the times dictate the leaders who emerge? Are leadership skills innate, or can they be learned and developed? The seminar will stimulate thinking through readings and discussion about notable figures from politics and government, such as the Founding Fathers, Lincoln, Mandela, Gandhi, and Churchill, while looking at contemporary examples drawn from the business and legal world as well. Readings include selections from biography, Confucius, Shakespeare, analysis and commentary, history, and autobiography. The seminar also features sessions with prominent figures from the business, media, and political worlds who will discuss their views and firsthand observations about leadership.    DIANE C. YU, ESQ. , is Chief of Staff and Deputy to the President of NYU. She has been a high-ranking executive at a Fortune 250 company, California judicial officer, general counsel for a California public corporation, and appointed by the President as a White House Fellow. Her B.A. is from Oberlin and her J.D. from the University of California at Berkeley. A national bar leader, she serves on numerous boards, has won awards for her service to the legal profession, and was the first woman of color to chair the American Bar Association's Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, which accredits American law schools. She currently chairs the ABA's Commission on Women in the Profession.    The Biology of Infectious Diseases (V50.0276; call # 72239) Instructors: Martin Blaser and Joel Ernst Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    Infectious diseases have shaped human biology, genes, culture, and imagination. After the advent of antibiotics, we thought that we could win the \"war\" on infectious diseases. Antibiotic resistance and AIDS, among other events, have taught us that the war is not winnable. Rather, we must understand our place in the microbial world and learn to adapt strategies that minimize infectious disease impact, and maximize our symbiosis with indigenous organisms. After introductory discussions, the course is conducted as a series of seminars by students on topics that provide greater understanding of the underlying biological issues. Topics that may be discussed include genetic susceptibility to diseases such as malaria, problems involved in antibiotic resistance, the evolution of HIV, good microbes vs. bad, and infectious diseases in the postmodern world.    MARTIN BLASER is the Frederick H. King Professor of Internal Medicine and Chairman of the Department of Medicine, and Professor of Microbiology at the NYU School of Medicine. A practicing physician and specialist in Infectious Diseases, he has progressively become a biologist. His research interests have spanned clinical medicine, epidemiology, molecular biology and genetics, evolutionary biology, mathematics, and history. The recipient of numerous honors and awards, he is founder and publisher of the Bellevue Literary Review.    JOEL ERNST is the Jeffrey Bergstein Professor of Medicine, Director of Infectious Diseases, and Professor of Microbiology at the NYU School of Medicine. A clinician and specialist in infectious diseases, he directs his immunology research at discovery of mechanisms used by microbial pathogens to evade the immune system. He is a frequently sought speaker at international meetings on infectious diseases and immunology.    Ethics, Pointillism, Epidemiology, and Epistemology: EPEE Dueling with Scientific Health Information (V50.0278; call # 72241) Instructor: Ralph V. Katz Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    The common citizen is well challenged-if not overly challenged-trying to deal with the flood of scientific health information as presented in the media. \"Scientific\" health findings of this week seem routinely to conflict with the \"scientific\" health findings of last week. As the movie theme song asked so poignantly 35 years ago, \"What's it all about, Alfie?\" This course explores that question as it relates to scientific health information as used both by individuals to make personal life decisions about health behaviors and by society to protect its citizens via court decisions and governmental regulations. Concepts from the fields of ethics, art, and science are central to readings and discussions focused on how to make sense of it all. Beginning with the history and foundation concepts of bioethics and epidemiology, the course provides a framework for understanding this flood of scientific health information, i.e., what are the strengths and limitations (and misuses) of this free flow of scientific health findings in our democratic \"instant, electronic news\" world. Textbooks and videos cover background on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, polar bears, and rubbish. As the major course assignment, each student writes a newspaper-style \"op-ed\" article, backed up by an annotated bibliography.    RALPH V. KATZ is Professor of Epidemiology and Chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion in the NYU College of Dentistry. He is Director of the NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP (Research on Adolescent and Adult Health Promotion) Center and leads a current study investigating whether minorities are less willing to participate in biomedical studies as research subjects and, if so, why. Having served on the National Tuskegee Legacy Committee, he was a Presidential Invitee to the White House for President Clinton's 1997 apology to the African-American community. His epidemiologic research has ranged from oral disease studies to the development of epidemiologic research methods. In addition to his dental degree, he holds a master's degree in public health and a Ph.D. in epidemiology.    W. E. B. Du Bois: The Making of a Radical Scholar-Activist (V50.0279; call # 72242) Instructor: Jeff Goodwin Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    W. E. B. Du Bois (1868-1963) was one of the most remarkable scholars and political activists of the 20th century. The first African-American to earn a doctorate at Harvard, Du Bois wrote perhaps the most trenchant analysis of the African-American condition, The Souls of Black Folk (1903), the first sociological study of a Black community, The Philadelphia Negro (1899), and one of the most influential works of American history, Black Reconstruction in America (1935). Du Bois also founded the Niagara Movement in 1905, breaking decisively with the \"accommodationist\" politics of Booker T. Washington, and was a major figure in the Pan-Africanist movement. This course examines the life, times, and writings of Du Bois, focusing on the years between his birth in 1868 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and 1910, when he left Atlanta University to become editor of The Crisis, the official publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The course tries to understand, among other issues, how such a remarkable and cosmopolitan individual could have emerged from such a humble and seemingly parochial background, a small town in western Massachusetts with a tiny African-American community.    JEFF GOODWIN , Professor of Sociology , is the author of No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991 and coeditor of Passionate Politics: Emotions and Social Movements and The Social Movements Reader. He has taught courses on social movements and revolutions at NYU since 1991. His interests also include social theory and the African-American tradition in sociology, including the works of Du Bois, Charles S. Johnson, E. Franklin Frazier, St. Claire Drake, and Oliver Cromwell Cox.    From the Rise of Christianity to Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on Two Millennia (V50.0282; call # 72245) Instructor: Edward W. Lehman Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The new millennium has dawned with growing disenchantment with traditional left-right cleavages and with the claim that the United States is increasingly a nation of isolated individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is eroding civic virtues and its democratic institutions. Our aim is to assess the trajectory of our culture using the dimensions of autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism. This seminar begins by probing these diagnoses in the broader context of moral and social transformations in the West over the last two thousand years. We examine social-science analyses of pivotal changes that have occurred in that period. We consider the sociologist Rodney Stark's highly acclaimed The Rise of Christianity, which focuses on developments during the first four centuries of the first millennium of the common era. Our final reading is the political scientist Robert Putnam's controversial Bowling Alone, which is currently the most publicized critique of contemporary American civic life.    EDWARD W. LEHMAN is a Professor of Sociology . His research interests include political sociology, cultural sociology, and sociological theory. He is the author of Coordinating Health Care: Explorations in Interorganizational Relations, Political Society: A Macrosociology of Politics, and The Viable Polity. He is coeditor of A Sociological Reader in Complex Organizations. He has edited and published Autonomy and Order: A Communitarian Anthology, a collection of original essays by 15 authors that explores how the fraying of shared moral understandings and the erosion of communal bonds affect our capacity to balance individual rights and collective responsibilities. He is currently book review editor of The Responsive Community.    The Representation of \"the Other\" in the Israeli-Palestinian Cinema (V50.0286; call # 72249) Instructor: Shimon Dotan Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Representation of the Other is a variation of the search for self-identity. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its political cinema exhibit a clear pattern in which the parties attribute to the Other qualities and traits that reflect their own distress and aspirations. This pattern is examined in a series of contemporary films (1980 to the present). Each class consists of a screening followed by a discussion concentrating on representation in the context of the political conflict, variations in the use of film language to achieve a subjective portrayal, and modalities of representation and self-critique. Screenings include Divine Intervention, by Elia Suleiman; Beyond the Walls, by Uri Barabash; Close, Closed, Closure, by Ram Loevi; Wedding in the Galilee, by Michel Khleifi; and The Smile of the Lamb, by Shimon Dotan.    SHIMON DOTAN , a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with ten feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival (The Smile of the Lamb) numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director (Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb) and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival (You Can Thank Me Later). Dotan has taught filmmaking at Tel Aviv University in Israel and Concordia University in Montreal.    Communications and Human Values (V50.0291; call # 72254) Instructor: Richard D. Heffner Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This seminar critically analyzes how much our sense of what it means to be an American at the dawn of the 21st century has been molded by the media, with particular reference to their socializing and value-legitimating content. To deal appropriately and reasonably with such media power, students are asked first to identify their own respective approaches to the power of the state and its proper relationship to the individual through discussion both of such readings as Walter Lippmann's Public Opinion, Robert Merton's Mass Persuasion, J. S. Mill's On Liberty, Herman Melville's Billy Budd, and Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death, and of such films as Birth of a Nation, 12 Angry Men, Hearts and Minds, and JFK. Finally, class emphasis is on such contemporary media issues as a Fairness Doctrine (the real or imagined \"chilling effect\" of a requirement for media fairness and balance); cameras in the courts (do televised trials enhance justice, or instead create a \"mobocracy\" with trial by a new jury of public opinion?); media self-regulation (can there in fact be meaningful voluntary self-discipline in a free market, free speech, mass media-driven society?).    RICHARD D. HEFFNER is Producer/Moderator of the weekly public television series The Open Mind, which he began nearly a half century ago. Earlier a broadcaster and executive at ABC, NBC, and CBS, in 1962 he became the Founding General Manager of New York's pioneering Channel 13. Trained as an American historian, he is the author of A Documentary History of the United States (1952) and the editor of Tocqueville's Democracy in America (1956). His newest books are a collaboration entitled Conversations with Elie Wiesel (2001) and, to be published in November 2004, the paperback edition of As They Saw It . . . A Half Century of Conversations from The Open Mind. From 1974 to 1994 Mr. Heffner served as Chairman of the film industry's voluntary classification and rating system in Hollywood, commuting from Rutgers, where he has been University Professor of Communications and Public Policy since 1964.    Galileo and Hobbes (V50.0295; call # 72258) Instructor: William Klein Friday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    In 1636, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes visited the aged and blind Galileo at his house in Florence, but there is no record of what was said. That leaves us free to speculate as we enter into the works of these two great innovators and critics of the Aristotelian worldview. Using selections from both philosophers (and in those days there was often no difference between philosophers and scientists, except in terms of quality-Hobbes was a very good philosopher but perhaps not such a good scientist), we will try to decide whether Galileo would have approved of Hobbes's radical development of his physics and cosmology into a comprehensive philosophy of nature, human nature, and the state.    WILLIAM KLEIN is Visiting Professor of Humanities at NYU's School of Continuing and Professional Studies, on leave from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he teaches the history of Western social thought. He specializes in early modern European legal and political thought but has also published, under a pen name, several mysteries for young adults.    The Crusades and Their Legacy (V50.0296; call # 72259) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    In the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, the Crusades, which began at the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters, if not the most important chapter. The Crusades began as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. For two hundred years the Crusaders managed to hold on to their possessions, losing more of them with every passing decade, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the East was lost to Western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades themselves, but focuses on the relations among the three great religions and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. We study the differences among the religions as well as their many similarities. Most of all, we address some of the problems that are crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a holy war; the issue of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the legacy of the crusading era. Readings include Muslim, Jewish, and Christian writings of the era, in translation, as well as secondary works.    JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the Crusader era extensively. She served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.    Behind Government: How Politics, Media, and Money Shape Policies (V50.0298; call # 72261) Instructor: Mark Green Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    To read Congressional Records and State of the Union addresses, one might think that all policy emanated from facts, logic, and merit. And when Karl Rove, President Bush's top strategic adviser, said that the President doesn't consider politics when determining policy, it was a pleasant fiction no one was expected to believe. This seminar looks at the hidden aspects that drive government by focusing on five recent public leaders-President Bush (43), President Clinton, Mayor Giuliani, Ralph Nader, and former Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. How did their varying styles, values, intellects, and personalities affect their offices or campaigns? Are there particular approaches that can best accomplish great goals? How do media and money affect the success of these powerful people? How much does the public actually know about those who govern them?    MARK GREEN was the Distinguished Visiting Lecturer at NYU Law School in 2002. The author/editor of 18 books (including Who Runs Congress?), he was the Consumer Affairs Commissioner of New York City (1990-93), the elected Public Advocate of New York City (1994-2001), and the Democratic nominee for Mayor (2001). He appears weekly on NY1's Wiseguys with Ed Koch and Al D'Amato.    Afghanistan and the World (V50.0300; call # 72263) Instructor: Robert D. McChesney Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Since September 11, Afghanistan has emerged as a country whose interests and future are linked in a major way with those of the United States. The United States is not the first country and probably not the last to find itself enmeshed in the politics and society of this small nation in central Asia. The seminar begins with the subject of Afghanistan's geophysical environment and the economic consequences that follow from that. Next it reviews the country's social and cultural features, with an emphasis on tribalism, religion, and the literary and artistic heritage. The geopolitics of Afghanistan are then considered in light of the preceding with emphasis on the country's relations with the nations that immediately surround it today-Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China. Finally, the subject of Afghanistan in a global framework is discussed: Afghanistan's jihad against the Soviet Union, the civil war and the Taliban, and Afghanistan's relations with al-Qa'ida, the United States, and the United Nations.    ROBERT D. MCCHESNEY is Professor of Middle Eastern Studies , with a special interest in the early modern history of Iran and Central Asia. He is the author of Waqf in Central Asia (1991), Central Asia: Foundations of Change (1996), and Kabul under Siege (1999).    Law and Globalization (V50.0302; call # 72265) Instructor: Richard Stewart Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This seminar examines the role of law and legal institutions in fostering global market integration and economic growth and in addressing the discontents of globalization. The globalization of the economy has brought many benefits, but also many problems and criticisms. These discontents include disparities in power and wealth between rich and poor, which many claim have been exacerbated by globalization; lack of participation and transparency in decision-making by the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, and other international organizations; marginalization of developing-country interests; cultural homogenization and displacement of local political and economic self-determination; loosening of social safety nets and regulatory protection; and subordination of environmental, labor, and human rights concerns. These discontents, and the law's response to them, are examined critically. Topics include the role of contract, trade, and financial law in promoting international markets; the role of international treaties and organizations in managing the global economy, its benefits, and its adverse impacts; international environmental, labor, and human rights laws; how law affects the distribution of the burdens and benefits of globalization in areas such as intellectual property and trade/environment controversies; the role of multinational corporations and the global corporate social responsibility movement; the concerns of indigenous peoples; and the role of non-government organizations and the \"democracy deficit\" in global governance.

Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos? (V50.0306; call # 72269) Instructor: Jorge G. Casta?eda TBA    This seminar focuses on several aspects of Latin America's problems in the past and their possible solutions today. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and vigor of civil society today. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present.    JORGE G. CASTA?EDA returned to NYU in fall 2003 as Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies .

From the Birth of Tragedy to the Birth of Pleasure (V50.0309; call # 72272) Instructor: Carol Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The Birth of Tragedy symbolized by the story of Oedipus has long been linked with the birth of Western civilization. In this seminar, we will examine this linkage and also a tradition of resistance that extends from Greek tragedy through 19th-century fugitive slave narratives to the liberation movements of the late 20th century and postcolonial fiction. The Birth of Pleasure picks up this tradition of resistance and shows its psychological roots in studies of infancy, research with adolescent girls and young boys, and the findings of neuroscience. Knowing a tragic story, how do we keep from repeating it? Readings will be drawn from psychology and literature, and students will write short weekly reflection papers as well as a final paper.    CAROL GILLIGAN came to NYU as a University Professor in 2002. For the preceding 34 years she was on the faculty of Harvard University, where her award-winning research on gender and human development led to the creation of Harvard's first professorship in gender studies. Her 1982 book, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development, has been translated into 17 languages. Her most recent book, The Birth of Pleasure, was published last year.    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V50.0311; call # 74825) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court's interpretation and application of the Constitution, and the Court's new, self-defined role, have adversely affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \"Imperial Judiciary.\" Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them, and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis, the Court's participation in the debate, and the effect that nine people appointed for life (the justices) have on how we live. Topics include abortion, euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights, gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; affirmative action; college speech codes, including \"hate\" speech, verbal sexual harassment, group liable and symbolic speech; prayer in school and students' right of privacy; and racial and ethnic profiling, government's right to detain accused terrorists, and the USA PATRIOT Act. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the political spectrum.    ALAN J. POMERANTZ, ESQ ., is a practicing lawyer and partner of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, LLP, a major international law firm.

Memoirs and Diaries in Modern European Jewish History (V50.0312; call # 74826) Instructor: Marion Kaplan Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.    This course analyzes modern Jewish history through the use of memoirs and diaries, which can offer an abundance of detail about the public political, economic, social, and religious worlds and provide valuable, often rare glimpses into the motivations and expectations of Jews regarding the non-Jewish world. Moreover, memoirs and diaries disclose the private aspects of everyday life, revealing crucial concealed thoughts and emotions as well as attitudes and behaviors within the family, friendship networks, and the Jewish community. They allow students to delve into relations between parents and children, spouses, generations, neighbors, and friends. The course begins with the most famous memoir written by a Jewish woman, Glikl of Hameln, in the late 17th century, and continues through the mid-20th century and the Holocaust. It includes the autobiographies of Leon Modena, a 17th-century Venetian rabbi; Solomon Maimon, an 18th-century Jewish philosopher-bohemian-heretic; Pauline Wengeroff, a traditional Jewish woman in 19th-century Russia; and Puah Rakowski, a Polish radical. Readings from the period of the Holocaust include two classics, the diaries of Anne Frank, a young girl, and Victor Klemperer, an elderly Jewish man. Students are responsible for reading the primary sources, and the instructor includes introductory materials to place the memoirs in their historical context in each class.    MARION KAPLAN is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History . She has also taught at Queens College, CUNY. She is the author of The Jewish Feminist Movement in Germany: The Campaigns of the J?discher Frauenbund, 1904-1938 (1979), The Making of the Jewish Middle Class: Women, Family, and Identity in Imperial Germany (1991), and Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany (1998).

She has edited books on European women's history-When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany and The Marriage Bargain: Dowries in European History-and is currently editing and writing a history of Jewish daily life from the 17th century until 1945.    German Romantic Music, 1815-1850 (V50.0313; call # 74827) Instructor: Robert Bailey Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.    Many artists of this period revolted against prevailing artistic, and even social and political, institutions. They reacted against both the current cult of the virtuoso and the increasingly commercial climate dominated by music publishers. They withdrew into a private artistic world, and the Artist became the typical Romantic hero. The Wanderer in turn became the ideal symbolic projection of an artist alienated from a society uninterested in his work and in his welfare. This withdrawal led artists to participate in a private symbolic system accessible to themselves, but only partly accessible to middle-class audiences. German artists often restructured traditional relationships and affinities among the musical, poetic, and visual arts. Unable to find fulfillment in the troublesome present, they frequently sought vindication for their artistic ideals in the past. Hence, their interest in folksong, which inspired a large body of new poetry appropriate for musical setting. Such poetry provided the foundation for a flowering of song publications, which flourished alongside popular publications of actual folksongs. Opera, the song cycle, and the multi-movement piano cycle are the genres that most fully project the intricate system of interlocking and closely aligned musical, poetic, and visual imagery. The works in these genres by Weber, Schubert, Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Schumann, and Wagner are of central concern to the seminar.    ROBERT BAILEY is the Carroll and Milton Petrie Professor of Music in the Faculty of Arts and Science. As an undergraduate at Dartmouth, he majored in music and German. He then studied piano at the Academy of Music in Munich. He did his graduate work in musicology at Princeton, where his principal mentors were Oliver Strunk and Milton Babbitt. He also continued piano study with Edward Steuermann, who was on the faculty of the Juilliard School. Before joining the faculty of NYU in 1986, he taught at Yale and at the Eastman School of Music.    Opium and China (V50.0314; call # 74828) Instructor: Joanna Waley-Cohen Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar highlights opium's material and symbolic role in China's history before and after the Opium Wars of the 19th century. Using both primary and secondary courses, it explores such issues as opium's economic role within China and in the global market; the nature and extent of addiction in China; global attitudes to opium use; the role of Chinese middlemen and consumers in the extraordinarily rapid spread of opium in China; and ways in which opium both complemented and changed perceptions of gender, in terms of drug use as well as in terms of foreign perceptions of China, since opium came to serve in complicated ways as a symbol for China itself.    JOANNA WALEY-COHEN is the author of The Sextants of Beijing: Global Currents in Chinese History (1999) and Exile in Mid-Qing China: Banishment to Xinjiang, 1759-1820 (1991), as well as numerous articles on Chinese legal history, the military culture of the Qing empire, and the history of Hong Kong. Her current project is on gastronomy and gluttony in early modern China. Since 1992 she has taught a range of undergraduate and graduate courses in Chinese history at NYU, most recently on material culture, on the Silk Roads, on Qing history, and on interactions with Europe and the wider world.    Sport, Race, Ethnicity, and Gender in 20th-Century America (V50.0315; call # 74967) Instructor: Peter Levine Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    Although you may well learn why Nat Holman is in the Basketball Hall of Fame, why Ralph Branca cried in l951, or who Senda Berenson was, this seminar is not concerned with preparing you for sports trivia contests. Rather, its central purpose is to explore how race, ethnicity, gender, and class have influenced the development of organized sport as a major social and cultural institution of American life. During the first part of the semester we will collectively explore readings and films that touch on these themes. Later, we will devote considerable time learning how to write a major research paper, using both secondary and primary sources, including oral histories. Where possible and practical, students will be encouraged to make use of New York as a site for investigation and research.    PETER LEVINE was for many years Professor of American History and Director of American Studies at Michigan State University, before returning to his native Brooklyn in 2000. Whether focusing on ethnic studies or on popular culture, he has been especially attracted to interdisciplinary approaches and to reaching out to both scholarly and popular audiences. Best known for his work in sport and American social history, he is the author of Ellis Island to Ebbets Field: Sport and the American Jewish Experience (1992), A. G. Spalding and the Rise of Baseball (1985), and, with Robert Lipsyte, Idols of the Game (1995).    Latin American Nobel Prize Winners (V50.0316; call # 74966) Instructor: Mary Louise Pratt Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m.    Prerequisite: ability to understand spoken and written Spanish This course is aimed at students who have a strong background in Spanish and enjoy studying literature. We will study the lives and works of the five writers who have won the Nobel Prize in Literature: the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral (1942), the Guatemalan novelist Miguel Angel Asturias (1967), the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (1971), the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garc?a M?rquez (1982), and the Mexican poet Octavio Paz (1990). In addition, we will look at the work of three writer-activists who have won the Nobel Peace Prize: the Costa Rican Oscar Arias (1987), the Argentine Adolfo Perez Esquivel (1980), and the Guatemalan Rigoberta Mench? (1992).We will study these writers in their Latin American context, and consider what it was about them that drew international attention. Reading their acceptance speeches, we will ask how they sought to negotiate the place of Latin America in the international imagination, and how their work was received at home and abroad. At the textual level, especially with poetic texts, we will compare different translations, as a way of exploring the use of language. Class and readings will be mainly in Spanish; class participation and written work may be in Spanish or English. The course will count toward the Spanish or Latin American Studies major.    MARY LOUISE PRATT , Silver Professor of Latin American Literature and Culture , is an eminent scholar in the field of Latin American culture. During the year 2003, she served as President of the Modern Language Association. She is the author of, among many other titles, Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation, \"I Rigoberta Mench? and the Culture Wars,\" and \"Apocalypse in the Andes: Contact Zones and the Struggles for Interpretive Power.\"    From Mycenae to the Acropolis: Greek History and Art (V50.0317; call # 74965) Instructor: Guenter Kopcke Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This class aims at an understanding of the first thousand years of Greece's-and hence Western-political history. By the end of the fifth century B.C. the product (at least in Athens) is the individual familiar to us-the self-aware citizen, knowingly responsible for his or her actions. Greek art begins in the second millennium as a weapon of last resort of the disadvantaged in a lawless social climate. In the first millennium, as strife was progressively resolved by sparring with mental means rather than with physical force, the outline of a rationally controllable world emerges. That, in essence, will be seen as giving meaning to early Greek history and art. Demonstration will rely mostly on the contemporary mind and experience in reading (analyzing) primary evidence.    GUENTER KOPCKE is the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities at NYU's Institute of Fine Arts. Before coming to this country, he served as Assistant Curator in Munich, taught at the University of Zurich, and participated in many excavations in Greece and Israel. In outlook more historian than archaeologist or art historian, he is interested chiefly in understanding the critical role of (visual) art in the image of man in the Western tradition. His fields of concentration are the first thousand years of this tradition, from the middle of the second millennium B.C. to the middle of the first millennium B.C.    The Many Faces of Shahrazad: Arab Women in Culture, Literature, and 20th-Century Film (V50.0318; call # 74957) Instructor: Mona N. Mikhail Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar introduces students to the role and status of women in Arab societies today. Through the examination of selected texts from a variety of sources, be they sacred or profane, students investigate the role of the religious, social, and cultural as well as the political in the formation of the lives and roles of contemporary Arab women. Whether in Qur'anic suras or tales from the Thousand and One Nights, contemporary Arab-American poets or novelists from the Arab world, the course assesses the traditional gender roles versus the rapidly changing status of women. Close readings of selected essays, poems, novels, and short fiction, written by both women and men, as well as the viewing of selected films and documentaries, seek to address some of these timely topics.    MONA N. MIKHAIL , Associate Professor of Middle Eastern Studies , is the author of numerous books, notably Studies in the Short Fiction of Naguib Mahfouz and Yusuf Idris, and has written extensively on the cultural, social, and political context of modern Arabic literature, while also translating several important Arabic works into English. She is currently working on the growing body of women's literature in the Arab world and exploring women's role in popular culture/literature in oral genres such as proverbs, drama, song, and humor. Her latest work, Seen and Heard, was published in spring 2004. She also recently directed and produced a documentary about the theater in Egypt.    Recycling Music: from Classical to Broadway, Film, and Pop (V50.0319; call # 74829) Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    In 1953, the Russian symphonist Alexander Borodin, who had been dead for 66 years, was named co-recipient of a Broadway Tony Award for the use of his compositions in the musical Kismet. Two well-known musical-comedy writers had reworked several movements from Borodin's oeuvre to construct the score. This is one of many instances in which musicians and composers of the 20th century have reached back into the past for inspiration, whether of direct musical content, instrumental forces, or literary material, not only for the Broadway stage or the movie screen but also for dance and the popular idiom. This class examines representative examples of these borrowings in several media: the Broadway stage (Kismet, Anya, Rent, Aida), ballet (Le Spectre de la Rose and any number of Chopin favorites), film (Fantasia, Brief Encounter, Elvira Madigan; Warner Brothers cartoons), and popular music (Eric Carmen, \"All by Myself,\" \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\"). After a brief introduction to the concepts of musical transference and parody in music, classes compare original \"classical\" compositions with their subsequent reinterpretations on Broadway or in popular music, and examine the kinds of changes that went into the transference from the original medium to the later incarnation. Also considered is the cross-over between classical composers/conductors and the popular music scene.    RENA CHARNIN MUELLER is a musicologist specializing in 19th-century music. Her work on Liszt's compositional aesthetic has appeared in various journals. Her most recent publication is an essay on the Liszt lieder in the Cambridge Companion to the Lied (2004). She has published new editions of Les Pr?ludes (1997), Trois ?tudes de Concert (1996) and the two Ballades (1996); and her edition of the newly discovered Liszt Walse was published in 1996. With M?ria Eckhardt, she is the author of the Franz Liszt \"List of Works\" for The New Grove 2000, and they are also co-authoring the new Franz Liszt Thematischer Verzeichnis (forthcoming). In 2003 she was a winner of the College's Outstanding Teaching Award.    Lost and Found in Translation (V50.0320; call # 75132) Instructor: Kathleen Ross Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    Although we are not always aware of it, the process of translation figures prominently in our daily lives. Understanding another person's speech or writing is an act of translation, even when we speak the \"same\" language; according to some linguistic theories, all language is ultimately a translation. Translation, throughout history, has often been portrayed as an inevitable loss, a violence done to one language by another; the translator is characterized as a traitor, an imperialist, a thief, and the translation as only a pale copy of the \"original.\" Yet translation is crucial to the expansion of our sense of self in relation to an \"Other,\" and we cannot live fully without it. This course first examines some basic history and theories of translation, then considers the question of what is \"lost\" and what is \"found\" in the process, taking up examples from various historical moments. Throughout the course we will make use of multiple English translations of texts to spark our thinking. No knowledge of a language besides English is necessary.    KATHLEEN ROSS is Associate Professor of Spanish in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese , where she has served as Director of Undergraduate Studies and as Chair. She is both a scholar of the Latin American colonial period and an active translator of 19- and 20th-century Spanish American essays, poetry, and fiction. She has published translations of works by C?sar Vallejo, Roque Dalton, Julieta Campos, and others. Her translation of Domingo F. Sarmiento's classic 1845 essay Facundo: Civilization and Barbarism was published by the University of California Press in 2004.    Travelers and Travelogues in History (V50.0321; call # 75111) Instructor: Zvi Ben-Dor Benite Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    This seminar uses travelogues-journals and memoirs written by travelers-as historical sources. We will read several travelogues written by different travelers from different periods and learn to devise ways and methods to interrogate them for the purpose of historical inquiry. During the course we will try to answer several questions such as: Who are the authors of the travelogues and what can we learn about them from their texts? How do they describe the societies and landscapes they visit and what can we learn from the travelogues? Most importantly, we will try to come up with a list of many other questions the answers for which can be found in travelogues. The travelogues selected for this seminar stretch over different periods and cover different regions of the world such as Asia, Africa, and Europe and America from the Middle Ages to the Early Modern period. We will read travel stories by, among others, Benjamin of Tudela, Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, and Olaudah Equiano.    ZVI BEN-DOR BENITE is Assistant Professor of History . His specialty is world history, specifically the relations between East Asia, West Asia, and Europe during the Middle Ages and the early modern periods. He is the author of The Dao of Muhammad: A Cultural History of Muslims in Late Imperial China.    Staging Shakespeare's Comedies (V50.0322; call # 75380) Instructor: Peter W. Meineck Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This course examines the comedic work of William Shakespeare, focusing specifically on five major works-The Comedy of Errors, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Twelfth Night, and The Tempest. The course involves a practical element where students discuss staging, performance, interpretation, and the meaning of these works today. Class members are expected to participate in active workshops and dramatic explorations, although they do not need to have any performing experience; these practical workshops are designed to be purely exploratory and not performative. In addition to practical work, this course studies Shakespeare's influences, examining the origin of comedy, the theater of ancient Greece and Rome, including the works of Aristophanes, Menander, Plautus, and Terence, traditional English comedic forms, and Elizabethan satire, culture, and politics. It also considers the influence of Shakespearean comedy on successive dramatic forms, including the theater, film, and television. Students interested in this course should be prepared actively and intelligently to participate in discussions and practical workshops and follow a good amount of reading.    PETER W. MEINECK is Clinical Assistant Professor of Classics and Ancient Studies at NYU and the Artistic Director of the Aquila Theatre Company, a New York and national professional theater group specializing in fresh and innovative productions of classical drama, especially Shakespeare. Recently the Aquila's Othello formed the main focus of the National Endowment for the Arts' Shakespeare in American Communities program. Professor Meineck has published several translations of Greek plays with Hackett Press, his Aeschylus' Oresteia winning the 2000 Louis Galanti?re Award for Outstanding Translation from the American Translators Association. He has been teaching at NYU for the past five years and has also held academic appointments at Princeton and Harvard, among other U.S. universities. He is originally from London, England.    Before Cleopatra: Royal Women of Ancient Egypt (V50.0323; call # 75381) Instructor: Ann Macy Roth Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Long before Cleopatra, the royal women of ancient Egypt often had a great deal of influence on world events. Some even became pharaohs in their own right, and were depicted with a beard and a male body or wearing the ceremonial dress of a king over the modest traditional dress of a woman. Others exercised religious authority in priestly offices or as the ceremonial wife of a god. This course examines the lives and roles of these women, as reflected in the art, archaeology, and texts of their own times, and often in their own words. Questions examined include the assumptions about gender and sex underlying Egyptian culture, the practical and symbolic roles of queens, the character of women's monuments, the destruction of some monuments of powerful women by later generations, and changes in the roles of elite women over almost three millennia of Egyptian history. Through their culturally anomalous position, we come to understand some important principles of gender and power in Egypt, and perhaps elsewhere as well. In addition, we examine the views of these women taken by Western scholars and popular media, and how such understandings of their roles reflect the evolution of our own cultural attitudes.    ANN MACY ROTH is Clinical Associate Professor in the Departments of Hebrew and Judaic Studies and Fine Arts . Her research focuses mainly on the earlier periods of ancient Egyptian culture, particularly mortuary traditions and the roles of gender and sexuality in Egyptian society. She is director of the Giza Cemetery Project, and since 1987 has conducted archaeological research in the officials' tombs to the west of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Her publications include Egyptian Phyles of the Old Kingdom: The Evolution of a System of Social Organization, A Cemetery of Palace Attendants at Giza, and numerous articles. She has been invited to write three essays for Daughter of Re: Hatshepsut, King of Egypt, the catalogue of an exhibition opening in spring 2006 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.    Making Choices in Contemporary America: Dedication, Deception, and Deals (V50.0324; call # 74964) Instructor: Frederick G. More Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    Have you ever done what you thought was the right thing only do find yourself feeling that your right choice left you at a disadvantage? This course uses a case-study approach to reflect on issues in bioethics and contemporary life. Examples include such cases as that of Erin Brockovich, whose routine work in a law office led to the discovery of injustices suffered by citizens in a California city; a family who wanted to remove their daughter from life support, after years in a persistent vegetative state, only to become the focus of a legal controversy that reached the Supreme Court; the research project in which for 40 years U.S. Public Health Service researchers deprived 600 black men with syphilis of their right to health care; the Reagan administration's denial of the HIV epidemic in the U.S.; and the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommendations about nutrition that resulted from an intensely partisan process and deal-making. During the course we use movies, books, articles, and self-study as vehicles for reflection about the personal values that one can employ for decision-making and for exploration of personal and medical ethics.    FREDERICK G. MORE is Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion and the Department of Pediatric Dentistry in the NYU College of Dentistry. While formerly associate dean for academic affairs there, he developed and implemented the present dental curriculum.

Dr. More has served on the NYU Committee on the Use of Human Subjects in Research Activities and is currently on the NYU School of Medicine Institutional Review Board Associates.    By Any Means Necessary: Presidential Politics in the Post-Watergate Era (V50.0325; call # 74963) Instructor: Cheryl Mills Wednesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.    Since Watergate, the policy agenda of the presidency has become increasingly defined not just by the ideas of the individual holding office but by the tactical allegations and actions of forces external to the White House. Today, a president's agenda gains support or faces opposition from governmental forces-in the executive branch, Congress, and the judiciary-and nongovernmental forces, including political parties, special-interest groups, think tanks, political action organizations, and the media. It has become commonplace for all parties, including the president and his staff, to seek to accomplish their public policy aims by engaging in the politics of obstruction and personal attack to undermine confidence in the opposition's agenda for America. From election campaigns to presidential appointments to impeachment to the exercise of war powers, the president and his political opposition must be adept at navigating the politics of personal destruction. This class studies presidential politics since Watergate. It examines the presidency in relation to its governmental counterparts, the judiciary and Congress, as well as to the nongovernmental entities. Using media accounts (electronic, print, and televised), congressional and judicial testimony, judicial decisions, historical accounts, and first-person narratives, it assesses the players, the methods, and the impact on the presidency of public policy dissent and disagreement by any means necessary.    CHERYL MILLS, ESQ. , is Senior Vice President and Counselor for Operations and Administration at NYU. She received the J.D. from Stanford Law School, where she was elected to the Stanford Law Review. In the Clinton administration she served as Deputy Counsel to the President at the White House, where she supervised 35 attorneys and staff. She gained national prominence for her defense of President Clinton during the 1999 Senate impeachment trial.

She serves on the boards of numerous foundations, schools, and corporations.    Vienna 1900: The Art and Culture of Viennese Modernism (V50.0326; call # 75378) Instructor: Guy Walton Tuesday and Thursday, 12:30-1:45 p.m.    At the turn of the 20th century, Vienna, the capital of the Austrian Empire, became an important center of \"modern\" architecture, art, applied arts, music, philosophy, and science (particularly medicine/psychiatry). After a brief survey of the geography and history of the Austrian Empire and description of the city of Vienna, the course examines a selection of the major monuments of Vienna, especially those related to European modernism, and five operas. The focus is thus on art, architecture, and music, stressing the relationship of these to the cultural and intellectual milieu of this splendid capital city. Among the artists to be studied are Otto Wagner, Josef Hoffmann, Adolf Loos, Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, and Richard Strauss. New York museums, commercial art galleries, and the new Neue Galerie provide an important resource for the seminar.    GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Fine Arts in the College of Arts and Science. He received his Ph.D. from NYU's Institute of Fine Arts and is well known for his publications on the art of the royal courts of Europe, particularly those of France, Sweden, and Russia. He is also a collector of 20th-century Austrian decorative arts.    The Politics of Judicial Decision-Making (V50.0327; call # 75128) Instructor: Anna Harvey Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    This seminar is about how we can and should understand how U.S. Supreme Court justices decide cases. We begin by posing the problem of the countermajoritarian Court. Given the apparent absence of mechanisms to hold the justices accountable to popular preferences, can we come up with rules of statutory and constitutional interpretation that constrain the justices' decisions in normatively desirable ways? We review several of these theories of interpretation. What do they prescribe? How constraining would they be in practice? Would they in fact lead to better outcomes? We then turn to work that seeks to determine what the justices are actually doing when they decide cases. We first examine the justices' decisions in cases involving statutory interpretation. We then examine their decisions in constitutional cases. What kinds of data are used in these studies? What are their conclusions? How believable are they? Is the Court really countermajoritarian? Finally, we return to the normative theories with which we started. Given what we have learned from the positive work on the Court, do they still have any relevance?    ANNA HARVEY is Associate Professor of Politics . She received her Ph.D. from Princeton University. Having joined the Department of Politics in 1994, she served as its chair from 2000 to 2003. She is the author of Votes without Leverage: Women in American Electoral Politics, 1920-1970, as well as of many scholarly articles. Her research focuses on two areas: the nature of partisanship in the American electorate and the political constraints on judicial decision-making. In the latter project, she and her collaborator at NYU's Law School are investigating the extent to which the Supreme Court is constrained by the political branches in constitutional cases.    Charity, Philanthropy, and the Nonprofit Sector (V50.0328; call # 75379) Instructors: Harvey P. Dale and Jill S. Manny Wednesday, 3:30-5:30 p.m.    This course explores the nonprofit sector and its role in society, from a perspective that touches on legal, economic, policy, and other realms. After a look at the history and scope of the nonprofit sector, we discuss the burdens and benefits of philanthropy and the nonprofit sector. We consider how charities derive resources and how they expend them to further their charitable purposes. We examine the distinction between public charities and private foundations, and invite leaders of both sorts of charities to join us in class for a discussion. We discuss governance of charities, both by federal and state regulators and by officers, directors, and trustees. We focus on the things that the nonprofit sector does well, and some of its performance failures, as we consider recent publicized scandals and abuses within the sector and estimate their impact on the sector. We analyze relevant legal concepts and theories, including the rules for tax exemption and tax deductions, and consider why these benefits are offered to certain organizations. We also consider those who donate their time and resources, examining both donor motivation and donor intent. Finally, we discuss nonprofit speech viewed through the lens of legal restrictions on lobbying and political campaign activities by nonprofits.    HARVEY P. DALE is University Professor of Philanthropy and the Law at NYU. Since 1988 he has been Director of the National Center on Philanthropy and the Law at NYU. The Founding President of The Atlantic Philanthropies, he has also served as board member of or consultant to a wide range of other nonprofit organizations and institutions. He is the author of numerous publications on philanthropy and the law. JILL S. MANNY joined the faculty at NYU School of Law in 1993, where she teaches courses on Nonprofit Law, Tax-Exempt Organizations, and Tax Aspects of Charitable Giving. In 1995 she assumed there the additional position of Executive Director of the National Center on Philanthropy and the Law. She also teaches Nonprofit Law at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service.    Extra-solar Planets and Astrobiology (V50.0329; call # 75382) Instructor: Glennys Farrar Monday, 4:55-7:25    Questions about the existence of other planets and about life on those planets have been with us since the dawn of time. Since the realization that not only the Earth but the other planets of our solar system orbit the Sun and that life on Earth depends on sunlight, mankind has searched for more planets in our own solar system and for planets orbiting other stars. In the last ten years these searches have finally succeeded. The search for and study of other planetary systems is now a major theme of current astrophysics research. This course introduces that work, exploring why searching for planets is so difficult and why it finally succeeded. It presents an overview of cosmology and star formation, to see how stars \"work\" and why planets around other stars would be expected to be common. By contrast, the scientific study of the origin and evolution of life (astrobiology) is an emerging discipline, with quite different ideas on how widespread life may be in the universe. This state of affairs gives students a chance to observe a new scientific discipline in its formative period, and to understand how scientists go about posing and refining questions, even when there are many more questions than answers and it is not yet clear how to formulate the fundamental problems.    GLENNYS FARRAR is Professor of Physics and Director of the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics at NYU. Before coming to NYU in 1998, she was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and on the faculties of the California Institute of Technology and Rutgers University. Her current work focuses mainly on problems at the intersection of astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics, including ultrahigh energy cosmic rays, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the origin of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter.    Departmental Seminars Available for Freshmen       Freshman Colloquium: Borges, the Storyteller (V95.0250, sec. 001; call # 74352) Instructor: Sylvia Molloy Tuesday, 2:00-4:40 p.m. Prerequisite: score of 4 or 5 on Spanish AP examination or permission of the director of undergraduate studies.    This seminar, conducted in Spanish, has two goals: to read the work of the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges and to reflect on narrative, specifically, on storytelling. Why do we tell stories? How do we put them together in order to achieve the desired results? Are stories \"just\" fiction? Is history \"just\" a story? What about autobiography? What power do storytellers have over us and why do we listen to them? Why do we call them fabricators and, at the same time, say that their stories ring true? A master narrator, Borges resorts to storytelling in all the genres he practices-short fiction, principally, but also essays and poetry. A close reading of his work allows us not only to reflect on the question of narrative but also, more importantly, to enjoy the pleasure of the written text. Readings include Borges's Ficciones , El Aleph , El informe de Brodie , and Antologia poetica .    Freshman Colloquium: Nueva York (V95.0250, sec. 002; call # 74353) Instructor: James Fern?ndez Wednesday, 2:00-4:40 p.m. Prerequisite: score of 4 or 5 on Spanish AP examination or permission of the director of undergraduate studies.    Through the analysis of a series of essays, short stories, novels, plays, and films, this course explores (1) New York as an important site of production of Spanish-language culture from the early 19th century to the present and (2) representations of New York in Spanish-language culture during that same period. Readings include Jos? Mart? (Cuba), Cr?nicas de Nueva York ; Federico Garc?a Lorca (Spain), Poeta en Nueva York ; Rene Marqu?s (Puerto Rico), La carreta ; Ernesto Qui?onez (Ecuador), El vendedor de sue?os ; Antonio Mu?oz Molina (Spain), and Ventanas de Manhattan. The course is conducted in Spanish.                        Welcome!

Prince Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Baseball is neither a metaphor for life nor a perfect explanation for the uniqueness of American culture or American character. But sport-and, for some cogent reasons, baseball in particular-does provide a way into an examination of major contemporary historical questions in the areas of race, gender, and class. The Brooklyn Dodgers' pioneering role in American racial integration in the years after World War II, for example, and the Yankees' early failure to follow suit provide useful laboratories for a study of race. The strongly macho character of baseball reveals basic gender aspirations and prejudices more subtly evoked in other areas of American life. To the extent that baseball is indeed a working-class game, fan involvement reveals much about the nature of urban class values and tensions in the 20th century. A full-length baseball-related research paper is required.    CARL E. PRINCE is Professor of History Emeritus and past president of the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic. He has published four books and numerous articles on early American political culture and edited the five-volume Papers of William Livingston. A former baseball player and lifelong fan, he is also the author of Brooklyn's Dodgers: The Bums, the Borough, and the Best of Baseball (1996), which opened for him a new academic field.    Computer Simulation (V50.0207; call # 72215) Instructor: Charles S. Peskin Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m. Prerequisites: AP calculus and physics    Since the starting point for any computer simulation is a mathematical model (i.e., a collection of equations that describe the phenomenon to be simulated), the true prerequisite for this seminar is a love of mathematics, especially calculus. Computer simulation is one way that mathematics gets applied to the real world. In this hands-on course students learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological processes. Examples include the orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of epidemic and endemic diseases in a population, including the evolution of a population in response to an endemic disease; the production of sound by musical instruments; the flow of traffic on a highway or in a city; and the electrical activity of nerves. The seminar meets alternately in a classroom and in a computer laboratory setting. The techniques needed to perform computer simulations, and to present the results in terms of elementary graphics, animations, and sounds, are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by students working individually or in teams. Topics for student projects may be drawn from those discussed in class as listed above, but students are also free to do other projects that reflect their own interests.    CHARLES S. PESKIN is Professor of Mathematics and Neural Science . His field of research is mathematical modeling and computer simulation applied to biology and medicine. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a former MacArthur Fellow, and a recipient of the Mayor's Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, as well as the Great Teacher Award of the NYU Alumni Association.    Professional Responsibility: Markets, Ethics, and Law (V50.0208; call # 72216) Instructor: Daniel Diamond Monday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    Every individual, regardless of his or her chosen field of study or occupation, will in time function as a professional or manager in a business, not-for-profit, or government organization. This course is designed to enable individuals to think critically about the ethical context and consequences of the decisions they will make in their respective professional and organizational settings. In previous generations understanding and practicing one's professional responsibilities was desirable, if not required, behavior. In our society today it is a necessity. We explore the reasons for this change and, by examining the interactions between the marketplace, societal norms, and the law, develop the ethical, analytical, and reasoning tools necessary to identify and weigh often competing interests. Ideally this enables individuals to make decisions that simultaneously cause no harm to the affected parties-customers, co-workers, community, etc.-further the goals of the organization, and enhance the professional career of the decision maker. The requisite ethical reasoning tools are developed through a series of cases and related readings dealing with a variety of topics, including ethics of the individual business professional, product liability, the social responsibility of the corporation, moral standards across borders, ethical issues in financial markets, termination and downsizing, sexual harassment, and privacy. Since this is a case course, students play an active role in the learning process during class sessions.    DANIEL DIAMOND is Professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business. He served as Dean of the Stern Undergraduate College and as Vice Dean of the Stern School from 1985 to 1995. He also held the position of Dean of the College of Management Science at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell and Director of the Northeast Region Small Business Development Center. He has published extensively in the areas of U.S. economic history, labor force trends, and labor policy. He currently teaches \"The Global Business Environment: International Macroeconomics and Finance\" and \"Professional Responsibility\" in the Stern School's M.B.A. program.    Great Poems (V50.0209; call # 72217) Instructor: David Lehman Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    The aim of this course is to change your life. We will read a selection of the greatest poems in the English language and consider what makes them great. We will discuss what distinguishes American from British poetry, and we will give some attention to questions of poetic influence and methods of composition. But the primary focus will be on reading, interpreting, and evaluating the poems themselves. The poets under consideration will include Shakespeare, Donne, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Byron, Whitman, Dickinson, Yeats, Eliot, Frost, Stevens, Auden, and Bishop. The course will conclude with some examples of contemporary American poetry.    DAVID LEHMAN is a poet, critic, and editor. In 1988 he initiated \"The Best American Poetry,\" and he continues as the general editor of this distinguished anthology series. In 1991 he published a critique of deconstruction entitled Signs of the Times: Deconstruction and the Fall of Paul de Man. His recent books include The Daily Mirror: A Journal in Poetry and The Last Avant-Garde: The Making of the New York School of Poets. His gathering of Great American Prose Poems: From Poe to the Present appeared in 2003. He is now preparing a new edition of The Oxford Book of American Poetry. He has taught the \"Great Poems\" seminar since 1997. He has also taught at Columbia University, New School University, and Bennington College.    Language and Reality in 20th-Century Science and Literature (V50.0210; call # 72218) Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the so-called two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \"postmodern\" literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\" and the \"undecidability\" of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon and from nontechnical texts on quantum and chaos theories.    Note: This seminar will meet in Weinstein Residence Hall. All students who register for this course and who requested University housing will be assigned to Weinstein.    FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German and Director of Deutsches Haus. Winner of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching, the University's Distinguished Teaching Medal, and its Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master's Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.    Cinema and Affect: Why the Movies Move Us (V50.0217; call # 72220) Instructor: Charles Affron Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Popular cinema most obviously appeals to its viewers by telling stories and representing a semblance of life. But if the movies ultimately move us they do so because they convey story and true-to-lifeness through style and through the specific properties of the cinematic medium. This seminar focuses on \"conventional\" narrative films of the 1930s and 1940s to examine how (1) the weight of style and (2) the intrinsically emotional elements of the medium elicit the viewer's affective response. The model of life serves the model of art; viewers respond to the medium when its conditions echo those of life. Film beguiles viewers to enter into its processes, and then uses those processes to capture lifelike representations of emotional situations. How do framing, display, staging, camera movement, sound, theatricality, irony, and duration conspire with narrative to move us to tears? How are viewers impelled to move with moving pictures, to be moved by them?    CHARLES AFFRON is Professor of French and Director of Graduate Studies in that department. In addition to books on the French novel and on the French Romantic theater and poetry, he has published Star Acting: Gish, Garbo, Davis, Divine Garbo (in French), Cinema and Sentiment, and Sets in Motion (with Mirella Jona Affron), a study of the relationship between set design and narrative in cinema. In 2001 he published the biography Lillian Gish: Her Legend, Her Life.    The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America (V50.0218; call # 72221) Instructor: John E. Sexton Monday, 7:00-9:00 p.m.    Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of Church and State; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a 21st-century liberal constitutional democracy.    JOHN E. SEXTON , President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and he has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.    Freedom, Classical Liberal Principles,and 21st-Century Problems (V50.0227; call # 72223) Instructor: Mario J. Rizzo Monday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the principles of classical liberalism through the discussion of theoretical and empirical issues in economics, law, and ethics. \"Classical liberalism\" is the political, economic, social, and moral philosophy that is severely skeptical of the power of the state and seeks to reduce its power over the citizen. It advances the view that society, under the rule of law, is largely self-regulating, and so government intervention, whether in economic or in social affairs, is either unnecessary or simply makes problems worse. Sometimes classical liberalism is called \"19th-century liberalism,\" but its development has roots in ancient Roman thought and in the 18th-century Scottish Enlightenment, as well as in many strains of 20th-century philosophy and economics. Its leading thinkers have included Adam Smith, F. A. Hayek, and Milton Friedman. The course considers philosophical principles and empirical issues in the context of such contemporary problems as free trade, property rights, income distribution, and social-religious toleration.    MARIO J. RIZZO is Associate Professor of Economics , as well as co-director of the Austrian Economics Program. His fields of research lie at the interface of a number of academic subjects, including the economic analysis of law, ethics and economics, and the methodology and philosophy of economics. He also has a long-standing interest in political philosophy. He is the author (with Gerald O'Driscoll) of The Economics of Time and Ignorance, many articles in law journals, and philosophically oriented articles on economic theory.    From Moving Articulators to Sound Structure (V50.0233; call # 74958) Instructor: Adamantios I. Gafos Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m.    Meaning in spoken language is communicated via sound. Sound is generated from a limited physical medium of moving articulators and their acoustic consequences. How can this physical system, the human vocal tract, communicate such richness of distinctions in meaning? To what extent is the structure of sound patterns in language influenced by constraints of the physical system? This course addresses these questions by seeking to identify the proper way to understand the relation between the cognitive aspects of sound structure and their manifestation as physical activity in the vocal tracts of actual speakers. The course begins by providing the necessary tools for exploring language sound structure. Using a research tool for visualizing multiple articulatory movements (called Mavis), we study how humans produce the consonants and vowels of different languages in isolation and in sequences. We then study how abstract sound patterns can be described as a system of conflicting and universal constraints. Different hierarchical relations between the same constraints give rise to the sound patterns of different languages. In the final part of the course, through a sequence of readings and group projects, students tackle issues in the relation between abstract sound patterns in a language of their choice and their realization in terms of activity in the vocal tract.    ADAMANTIOS I. GAFOS is Assistant Professor of Linguistics . After completing the Ph.D. in cognitive science at Johns Hopkins, and before coming to NYU, he taught at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, MIT, and Yale. His research focuses primarily on phonology, as a subfield of cognitive science, and specifically on the nature of phonological representations. He is the author of the book The Articulatory Basis of Locality in Phonology and of many scholarly articles.    In Search of Lost Time (V50.0240; call # 72227) Instructor: Marcelle Clements Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically-with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel in seven volumes and 4,500 pages, In Search of Lost Time addresses literature's richest theme: desire-its remembrance, loss, perversion, defeat, triumph, and final resurgence in the form of art. Almost 100 years old, it remains a dazzling portrait of turn-of-the-century French beau monde and, even more, of the power and elegance of its narrator's sensibility. It is still unparalleled in how it combines breadth, virtuosity, and irony, the author's extraordinary psychological acuity and the glamour of his world, as well as how it merges social history, ennui, and lust. It is also one of the world's greatest, most pleasurable, and elating reads. Although Marcel Proust (1871-1922) is usually assumed to be France's greatest novelist, his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move on, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while the texture of In Search of Lost Time (association, evocation, magnification, play of words, and memory) may have been its most radical contribution to the art of the novel, this work cannot be understood until it has been read in its entirety. In this seminar, we will keep moving at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, Time Regained.    MARCELLE CLEMENTS is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Her articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations; a novel, Rock Me; and a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman: Single Women Reinventing Single Life. Her most recent book is a novel, Midsummer.    Realism and How to Get Rid of It (V50.0244; call # 74962) Instructor: Tom Bishop Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    Realism relates both to a permanent concern of literature and art and to a \"school\" that became the dominant mode of 19th-century artistic expression. In the large sense, realism is accuracy in the portrayal of life or reality; referring to the 19th-century literary movement, realism reflects the ordinary life of the average person. The realistic novel and theater focused on the conflicts and characters familiar to readers and spectators by means of artistic conventions relating to the credibility of plot and characters, the role of narration, the function of the reader/spectator. The 20th century turned its back on realism through a series of powerful modernist and avant-garde movements that reacted against linear narrative and a literal depiction of reality. Following an examination of 19th-century realism in the novel and theater (Balzac, James, Ibsen), the seminar stresses 20th-century reactions (Borges, Beckett, Robbe-Grillet, Coover, Pirandello, Brecht, Ionesco, Genet, Pinter). These reactions include stream-of-consciousness novel, surrealism, abstract expressionism, Brechtian epic theater, theater of the absurd, first-person singular narrative, postmodern fiction. Attention is concentrated on form and language, on conventions, and on the relationship of the work to the reader or spectator. Film viewings concentrate on non-narrative cinema (Renais, Antonioni). The work of realist and nonrealist painters is also discussed.    TOM BISHOP is the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and Professor of Comparative Literature and Director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture. He chaired the Department of French for 33 years. He has written extensively on European and American theater and on contemporary French fiction and civilization. His books include studies of Beckett, Sartre, 20th-century theater, and French cultural and political life. His most recent book, From the Left Bank: Reflections on Contemporary French Theater and Fiction, appeared in 1997. He has received numerous decorations from the French government and was awarded the Grand Prize of the Acad?mie Fran?aise.    What If?: The Art and Science of Imaginative Social Constructions (V50.0249; call # 75032) Instructor: Robert Max Jackson Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    Imaginary constructions of unknown futures or pasts that never happened can help us push our understanding of social life beyond the boundaries of historical experience. What if we discover a drug that stops the aging process? What if fossil fuels had never been found? By writing stories around such puzzling questions, science fiction writers explore imaginary social worlds far outside the boundaries erected by social science's normal study of the real world and real history. In this class, we try to discover how such imaginary constructions can help us understand social life and the meanings we attach to it. Each week we pose a \"What if . . . ?\" question, read a classic work of science fiction in which that question looms large, write our own analyses of what we think possible, then discuss the merits of these alternative interpretations. This class aims to develop students' analytical skills, to explore the scientific and philosophical foundations of social issues in a new way, and to offer a special window into the wonders of science fiction.    ROBERT MAX JACKSON , Professor of Sociology , studies the ways that social inequality changes over time, reflecting his enduring puzzlement with the trajectory that took him from his youth as rural poor, white trash in the American Midwest to adulthood as a New York academic. His Destined for Equality: The Inevitable Rise of Women's Status analyzes the social causes of women's rising status in American history, and his The Formation of Craft Labor Markets shows how markets for skilled labor became organized in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During breaks from his scholarly work, he indulges his secret addiction to science fiction and mystery novels, occasionally thinking he should discover some way to portray this fascination as serious work.    New Media Law and Content Creation (V50.0253; call # 72229) Instructor: Karl P. Kilb Monday, 6:20-8:50 p.m. This course explores the legal and journalistic issues surrounding the creation and distribution of content in the \"Electronic Information Age.\" Content is a commodity that is packaged in many forms, known as \"media.\" We are all consumers of content, which is tailored by each media organization to target specific audiences. Consumers base their content choices on the type of information, as well as on the method of delivery. The traditional print and broadcast media have found a powerful, relatively inexpensive new means of distribution: the Internet. The rapid packaging of content by means of new technology has forced content creators and distributors to develop new interpretations of fundamental intellectual property issues, including copyright law. The seminar will promote active research and discussions with leaders in the media and legal professions, and explore how legislation and industry practices are responding to new technology.    KARL P. KILB, ESQ. , is the General Counsel of Bloomberg LP, managing a global Legal/Contracts Department. Before becoming an attorney in 1995, he was a broadcast journalist at FNN, CNBC, 1010 WINS Radio, Bloomberg, and various other networks and stations in New York for twelve years, having graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in broadcast journalism from NYU. He frequently lectures at universities and industry organizations about media and intellectual property law.    School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies (V50.0255; call # 72230) Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The decades of the 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition, through shared background reading, class members will work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics will be self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader.    ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is an Associate Curator in the Bobst Library and has taught in the English Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science. He is currently the librarian for education in the Social Sciences Department. First as a student and then as faculty, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.    Modern Concepts of Matter and the Cosmos (V50.0256; call # 72231) Instructor: Daniel Zwanziger Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. Prerequisite: high school physics    Since the 1970s our understanding of matter has been dominated by a paradigm known as \"the Standard Model\" of elementary particle physics. According to this model, the basic forces of nature are the strong and electro-weak forces that are transmitted by \"gauge\" fields, and the gravitational force that is described by general relativity. Elementary particles are either the quanta of the gauge fields themselves, including gluons and photons, or quarks and leptons that interact and are bound by the exchange of these quanta. This seminar reviews the Standard Model and the evidence for it. The geometric character of gauge and gravitational fields is described. Modern theories of the cosmos are presented, in the light of recent observations. Since the nature of modern physical theories is quite mathematical and geometrical, students taking this course should be intrigued by mathematical concepts.    DANIEL ZWANZIGER is Professor of Physics. His special research interest is quantum field theory applied to elementary particles. His most recent publications deal with the theory of quarks and gluons known as quantum chromodynamics.    Terrorism, Nihilism, and Modernity (V50.0267; call # 72236) Instructor: James Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The past century has witnessed violence the character and scale of which are so unique and unprecedented that we have had to create a new vocabulary to describe it (genocide, terrorism) and the ideologies that underlie it (totalitarianism, fundamentalism). To understand modern violence, we will examine the origin of the modern mind in the 17th century, when science, based on universal doubt, ended the Age of Faith, and the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority lost credibility. Nietzsche called this the \"death of God\" (and the Devil); it could also be called the death of Good and Evil, leading to another set of new words (nihilism, agnosticism, anomie, anarchy). We will study the origins and implications of these developments by reading Shakespeare and John Donne, Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, Beckett and Wittgenstein, Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well as modern mass murderers from Hitler to bin Laden. Finally, we will ask whether the modern human sciences can help us understand how to reverse or at least limit this escalation of violence.    JAMES GILLIGAN headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry. He is now an Adjunct Professor at NYU, Director of the Center for the Study of Violence, a member of President Clinton's National Commission on Youth Violence, and author of Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic and Preventing Violence: An Agenda for the Coming Century. He has been a consultant to the Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention at the World Health Organization, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and numerous other organizations.    The Art of the Enemy (V50.0270; call # 72237) Instructor: Hector Feliciano Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    The destruction of the art of the enemy, or cultural looting, has almost always been one of the staple by-products of international, civil, or religious strife. From ancient or biblical times to the recent wars in the former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, art plunder and the willful destruction of cultural patrimony-from palaces, museums, libraries, churches, mosques, and synagogues to paintings, statues, icons, and books-have been used by the victors as a supplementary means to conquer, annihilate, and humiliate the enemy. By studying some examples of destruction and looting, we will explore the enemies' fascinating political, aesthetic, or religious justifications for these acts. We will also consider why some enemies destroy while others simply take along, sell, or abandon; we will describe the positive and negative role of museums in some of these events, and learn how the \"values of collecting\" and the creation of museums may have helped to preserve art destined to be destroyed or looted by others. Above all, we will constantly be redefining what art is and what it means-to us and to our enemies. There will be guest speakers and field trips to museums.    HECTOR FELICIANO is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Formerly cultural writer for the Paris bureaus of the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, he is the author of The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works (1997); first published in French, this work has since been translated into several other languages. He served on the Panel of Experts of the Presidential Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States. He is the organizer of the First International Symposium on Cultural Property and Patrimony (Columbia University, 1999) and of a panel discussion entitled \"The Art of the Enemy\" (School of Visual Arts in New York City, 2002).    What Makes a Great Leader?: Perspectives from Government, Law, and Business (V50.0275; call # 72238) Instructor: Diane C. Yu Monday, 6:30-9:00 p.m.    Machiavelli wrote in 1532, \"There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.\" This seminar explores some of the ways in which leaders, particularly over the past two centuries, have arisen in a number of settings. How do we define greatness in leadership? Have the standards remained static, or have they changed over time? How have leaders overcome the obstacles in their paths? What, if any, traits do they have in common? Do leaders make the times in which they serve, or do the times dictate the leaders who emerge? Are leadership skills innate, or can they be learned and developed? The seminar will stimulate thinking through readings and discussion about notable figures from politics and government, such as the Founding Fathers, Lincoln, Mandela, Gandhi, and Churchill, while looking at contemporary examples drawn from the business and legal world as well. Readings include selections from biography, Confucius, Shakespeare, analysis and commentary, history, and autobiography. The seminar also features sessions with prominent figures from the business, media, and political worlds who will discuss their views and firsthand observations about leadership.    DIANE C. YU, ESQ. , is Chief of Staff and Deputy to the President of NYU. She has been a high-ranking executive at a Fortune 250 company, California judicial officer, general counsel for a California public corporation, and appointed by the President as a White House Fellow. Her B.A. is from Oberlin and her J.D. from the University of California at Berkeley. A national bar leader, she serves on numerous boards, has won awards for her service to the legal profession, and was the first woman of color to chair the American Bar Association's Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, which accredits American law schools. She currently chairs the ABA's Commission on Women in the Profession.    The Biology of Infectious Diseases (V50.0276; call # 72239) Instructors: Martin Blaser and Joel Ernst Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    Infectious diseases have shaped human biology, genes, culture, and imagination. After the advent of antibiotics, we thought that we could win the \"war\" on infectious diseases. Antibiotic resistance and AIDS, among other events, have taught us that the war is not winnable. Rather, we must understand our place in the microbial world and learn to adapt strategies that minimize infectious disease impact, and maximize our symbiosis with indigenous organisms. After introductory discussions, the course is conducted as a series of seminars by students on topics that provide greater understanding of the underlying biological issues. Topics that may be discussed include genetic susceptibility to diseases such as malaria, problems involved in antibiotic resistance, the evolution of HIV, good microbes vs. bad, and infectious diseases in the postmodern world.    MARTIN BLASER is the Frederick H. King Professor of Internal Medicine and Chairman of the Department of Medicine, and Professor of Microbiology at the NYU School of Medicine. A practicing physician and specialist in Infectious Diseases, he has progressively become a biologist. His research interests have spanned clinical medicine, epidemiology, molecular biology and genetics, evolutionary biology, mathematics, and history. The recipient of numerous honors and awards, he is founder and publisher of the Bellevue Literary Review.    JOEL ERNST is the Jeffrey Bergstein Professor of Medicine, Director of Infectious Diseases, and Professor of Microbiology at the NYU School of Medicine. A clinician and specialist in infectious diseases, he directs his immunology research at discovery of mechanisms used by microbial pathogens to evade the immune system. He is a frequently sought speaker at international meetings on infectious diseases and immunology.    Ethics, Pointillism, Epidemiology, and Epistemology: EPEE Dueling with Scientific Health Information (V50.0278; call # 72241) Instructor: Ralph V. Katz Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    The common citizen is well challenged-if not overly challenged-trying to deal with the flood of scientific health information as presented in the media. \"Scientific\" health findings of this week seem routinely to conflict with the \"scientific\" health findings of last week. As the movie theme song asked so poignantly 35 years ago, \"What's it all about, Alfie?\" This course explores that question as it relates to scientific health information as used both by individuals to make personal life decisions about health behaviors and by society to protect its citizens via court decisions and governmental regulations. Concepts from the fields of ethics, art, and science are central to readings and discussions focused on how to make sense of it all. Beginning with the history and foundation concepts of bioethics and epidemiology, the course provides a framework for understanding this flood of scientific health information, i.e., what are the strengths and limitations (and misuses) of this free flow of scientific health findings in our democratic \"instant, electronic news\" world. Textbooks and videos cover background on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, polar bears, and rubbish. As the major course assignment, each student writes a newspaper-style \"op-ed\" article, backed up by an annotated bibliography.    RALPH V. KATZ is Professor of Epidemiology and Chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion in the NYU College of Dentistry. He is Director of the NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP (Research on Adolescent and Adult Health Promotion) Center and leads a current study investigating whether minorities are less willing to participate in biomedical studies as research subjects and, if so, why. Having served on the National Tuskegee Legacy Committee, he was a Presidential Invitee to the White House for President Clinton's 1997 apology to the African-American community. His epidemiologic research has ranged from oral disease studies to the development of epidemiologic research methods. In addition to his dental degree, he holds a master's degree in public health and a Ph.D. in epidemiology.    W. E. B. Du Bois: The Making of a Radical Scholar-Activist (V50.0279; call # 72242) Instructor: Jeff Goodwin Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    W. E. B. Du Bois (1868-1963) was one of the most remarkable scholars and political activists of the 20th century. The first African-American to earn a doctorate at Harvard, Du Bois wrote perhaps the most trenchant analysis of the African-American condition, The Souls of Black Folk (1903), the first sociological study of a Black community, The Philadelphia Negro (1899), and one of the most influential works of American history, Black Reconstruction in America (1935). Du Bois also founded the Niagara Movement in 1905, breaking decisively with the \"accommodationist\" politics of Booker T. Washington, and was a major figure in the Pan-Africanist movement. This course examines the life, times, and writings of Du Bois, focusing on the years between his birth in 1868 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and 1910, when he left Atlanta University to become editor of The Crisis, the official publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The course tries to understand, among other issues, how such a remarkable and cosmopolitan individual could have emerged from such a humble and seemingly parochial background, a small town in western Massachusetts with a tiny African-American community.    JEFF GOODWIN , Professor of Sociology , is the author of No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991 and coeditor of Passionate Politics: Emotions and Social Movements and The Social Movements Reader. He has taught courses on social movements and revolutions at NYU since 1991. His interests also include social theory and the African-American tradition in sociology, including the works of Du Bois, Charles S. Johnson, E. Franklin Frazier, St. Claire Drake, and Oliver Cromwell Cox.    From the Rise of Christianity to Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on Two Millennia (V50.0282; call # 72245) Instructor: Edward W. Lehman Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The new millennium has dawned with growing disenchantment with traditional left-right cleavages and with the claim that the United States is increasingly a nation of isolated individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is eroding civic virtues and its democratic institutions. Our aim is to assess the trajectory of our culture using the dimensions of autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism. This seminar begins by probing these diagnoses in the broader context of moral and social transformations in the West over the last two thousand years. We examine social-science analyses of pivotal changes that have occurred in that period. We consider the sociologist Rodney Stark's highly acclaimed The Rise of Christianity, which focuses on developments during the first four centuries of the first millennium of the common era. Our final reading is the political scientist Robert Putnam's controversial Bowling Alone, which is currently the most publicized critique of contemporary American civic life.    EDWARD W. LEHMAN is a Professor of Sociology . His research interests include political sociology, cultural sociology, and sociological theory. He is the author of Coordinating Health Care: Explorations in Interorganizational Relations, Political Society: A Macrosociology of Politics, and The Viable Polity. He is coeditor of A Sociological Reader in Complex Organizations. He has edited and published Autonomy and Order: A Communitarian Anthology, a collection of original essays by 15 authors that explores how the fraying of shared moral understandings and the erosion of communal bonds affect our capacity to balance individual rights and collective responsibilities. He is currently book review editor of The Responsive Community.    The Representation of \"the Other\" in the Israeli-Palestinian Cinema (V50.0286; call # 72249) Instructor: Shimon Dotan Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Representation of the Other is a variation of the search for self-identity. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its political cinema exhibit a clear pattern in which the parties attribute to the Other qualities and traits that reflect their own distress and aspirations. This pattern is examined in a series of contemporary films (1980 to the present). Each class consists of a screening followed by a discussion concentrating on representation in the context of the political conflict, variations in the use of film language to achieve a subjective portrayal, and modalities of representation and self-critique. Screenings include Divine Intervention, by Elia Suleiman; Beyond the Walls, by Uri Barabash; Close, Closed, Closure, by Ram Loevi; Wedding in the Galilee, by Michel Khleifi; and The Smile of the Lamb, by Shimon Dotan.    SHIMON DOTAN , a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with ten feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival (The Smile of the Lamb) numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director (Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb) and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival (You Can Thank Me Later). Dotan has taught filmmaking at Tel Aviv University in Israel and Concordia University in Montreal.    Communications and Human Values (V50.0291; call # 72254) Instructor: Richard D. Heffner Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This seminar critically analyzes how much our sense of what it means to be an American at the dawn of the 21st century has been molded by the media, with particular reference to their socializing and value-legitimating content. To deal appropriately and reasonably with such media power, students are asked first to identify their own respective approaches to the power of the state and its proper relationship to the individual through discussion both of such readings as Walter Lippmann's Public Opinion, Robert Merton's Mass Persuasion, J. S. Mill's On Liberty, Herman Melville's Billy Budd, and Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death, and of such films as Birth of a Nation, 12 Angry Men, Hearts and Minds, and JFK. Finally, class emphasis is on such contemporary media issues as a Fairness Doctrine (the real or imagined \"chilling effect\" of a requirement for media fairness and balance); cameras in the courts (do televised trials enhance justice, or instead create a \"mobocracy\" with trial by a new jury of public opinion?); media self-regulation (can there in fact be meaningful voluntary self-discipline in a free market, free speech, mass media-driven society?).    RICHARD D. HEFFNER is Producer/Moderator of the weekly public television series The Open Mind, which he began nearly a half century ago. Earlier a broadcaster and executive at ABC, NBC, and CBS, in 1962 he became the Founding General Manager of New York's pioneering Channel 13. Trained as an American historian, he is the author of A Documentary History of the United States (1952) and the editor of Tocqueville's Democracy in America (1956). His newest books are a collaboration entitled Conversations with Elie Wiesel (2001) and, to be published in November 2004, the paperback edition of As They Saw It . . . A Half Century of Conversations from The Open Mind. From 1974 to 1994 Mr. Heffner served as Chairman of the film industry's voluntary classification and rating system in Hollywood, commuting from Rutgers, where he has been University Professor of Communications and Public Policy since 1964.    Galileo and Hobbes (V50.0295; call # 72258) Instructor: William Klein Friday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    In 1636, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes visited the aged and blind Galileo at his house in Florence, but there is no record of what was said. That leaves us free to speculate as we enter into the works of these two great innovators and critics of the Aristotelian worldview. Using selections from both philosophers (and in those days there was often no difference between philosophers and scientists, except in terms of quality-Hobbes was a very good philosopher but perhaps not such a good scientist), we will try to decide whether Galileo would have approved of Hobbes's radical development of his physics and cosmology into a comprehensive philosophy of nature, human nature, and the state.    WILLIAM KLEIN is Visiting Professor of Humanities at NYU's School of Continuing and Professional Studies, on leave from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he teaches the history of Western social thought. He specializes in early modern European legal and political thought but has also published, under a pen name, several mysteries for young adults.    The Crusades and Their Legacy (V50.0296; call # 72259) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    In the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, the Crusades, which began at the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters, if not the most important chapter. The Crusades began as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. For two hundred years the Crusaders managed to hold on to their possessions, losing more of them with every passing decade, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the East was lost to Western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades themselves, but focuses on the relations among the three great religions and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. We study the differences among the religions as well as their many similarities. Most of all, we address some of the problems that are crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a holy war; the issue of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the legacy of the crusading era. Readings include Muslim, Jewish, and Christian writings of the era, in translation, as well as secondary works.    JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the Crusader era extensively. She served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.    Behind Government: How Politics, Media, and Money Shape Policies (V50.0298; call # 72261) Instructor: Mark Green Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    To read Congressional Records and State of the Union addresses, one might think that all policy emanated from facts, logic, and merit. And when Karl Rove, President Bush's top strategic adviser, said that the President doesn't consider politics when determining policy, it was a pleasant fiction no one was expected to believe. This seminar looks at the hidden aspects that drive government by focusing on five recent public leaders-President Bush (43), President Clinton, Mayor Giuliani, Ralph Nader, and former Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. How did their varying styles, values, intellects, and personalities affect their offices or campaigns? Are there particular approaches that can best accomplish great goals? How do media and money affect the success of these powerful people? How much does the public actually know about those who govern them?    MARK GREEN was the Distinguished Visiting Lecturer at NYU Law School in 2002. The author/editor of 18 books (including Who Runs Congress?), he was the Consumer Affairs Commissioner of New York City (1990-93), the elected Public Advocate of New York City (1994-2001), and the Democratic nominee for Mayor (2001). He appears weekly on NY1's Wiseguys with Ed Koch and Al D'Amato.    Afghanistan and the World (V50.0300; call # 72263) Instructor: Robert D. McChesney Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Since September 11, Afghanistan has emerged as a country whose interests and future are linked in a major way with those of the United States. The United States is not the first country and probably not the last to find itself enmeshed in the politics and society of this small nation in central Asia. The seminar begins with the subject of Afghanistan's geophysical environment and the economic consequences that follow from that. Next it reviews the country's social and cultural features, with an emphasis on tribalism, religion, and the literary and artistic heritage. The geopolitics of Afghanistan are then considered in light of the preceding with emphasis on the country's relations with the nations that immediately surround it today-Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China. Finally, the subject of Afghanistan in a global framework is discussed: Afghanistan's jihad against the Soviet Union, the civil war and the Taliban, and Afghanistan's relations with al-Qa'ida, the United States, and the United Nations.    ROBERT D. MCCHESNEY is Professor of Middle Eastern Studies , with a special interest in the early modern history of Iran and Central Asia. He is the author of Waqf in Central Asia (1991), Central Asia: Foundations of Change (1996), and Kabul under Siege (1999).    Law and Globalization (V50.0302; call # 72265) Instructor: Richard Stewart Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This seminar examines the role of law and legal institutions in fostering global market integration and economic growth and in addressing the discontents of globalization. The globalization of the economy has brought many benefits, but also many problems and criticisms. These discontents include disparities in power and wealth between rich and poor, which many claim have been exacerbated by globalization; lack of participation and transparency in decision-making by the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, and other international organizations; marginalization of developing-country interests; cultural homogenization and displacement of local political and economic self-determination; loosening of social safety nets and regulatory protection; and subordination of environmental, labor, and human rights concerns. These discontents, and the law's response to them, are examined critically. Topics include the role of contract, trade, and financial law in promoting international markets; the role of international treaties and organizations in managing the global economy, its benefits, and its adverse impacts; international environmental, labor, and human rights laws; how law affects the distribution of the burdens and benefits of globalization in areas such as intellectual property and trade/environment controversies; the role of multinational corporations and the global corporate social responsibility movement; the concerns of indigenous peoples; and the role of non-government organizations and the \"democracy deficit\" in global governance.    RICHARD B. STEWART is University Professor and John Edward Sexton Professor of Law. He also directs the Center on Environmental and Land Use Law. His teaching and research focus on domestic and international environmental law, the role of economic incentives in environmental protection, law and globalization, and administrative law and regulation. He serves as a trustee of Environmental Defense and is actively involved in advising international and U.S. government bodies on environmental policy. He previously served as Assistant Attorney General for Environment and Natural Resources of the U.S. Department of Justice and as a faculty member at Harvard Law School and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.    Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos? (V50.0306; call # 72269) Instructor: Jorge G. Casta?eda TBA    This seminar focuses on several aspects of Latin America's problems in the past and their possible solutions today. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and vigor of civil society today. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present.    JORGE G. CASTA?EDA returned to NYU in fall 2003 as Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies . Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth.

He has also written articles for many newspapers and magazines in Mexico, the United States, and other countries.    From the Birth of Tragedy to the Birth of Pleasure (V50.0309; call # 72272) Instructor: Carol Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The Birth of Tragedy symbolized by the story of Oedipus has long been linked with the birth of Western civilization. In this seminar, we will examine this linkage and also a tradition of resistance that extends from Greek tragedy through 19th-century fugitive slave narratives to the liberation movements of the late 20th century and postcolonial fiction. The Birth of Pleasure picks up this tradition of resistance and shows its psychological roots in studies of infancy, research with adolescent girls and young boys, and the findings of neuroscience. Knowing a tragic story, how do we keep from repeating it? Readings will be drawn from psychology and literature, and students will write short weekly reflection papers as well as a final paper.    CAROL GILLIGAN came to NYU as a University Professor in 2002. For the preceding 34 years she was on the faculty of Harvard University, where her award-winning research on gender and human development led to the creation of Harvard's first professorship in gender studies. Her 1982 book, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development, has been translated into 17 languages. Her most recent book, The Birth of Pleasure, was published last year.    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V50.0311; call # 74825) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court's interpretation and application of the Constitution, and the Court's new, self-defined role, have adversely affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \"Imperial Judiciary.\" Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them, and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis, the Court's participation in the debate, and the effect that nine people appointed for life (the justices) have on how we live. Topics include abortion, euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights, gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; affirmative action; college speech codes, including \"hate\" speech, verbal sexual harassment, group liable and symbolic speech; prayer in school and students' right of privacy; and racial and ethnic profiling, government's right to detain accused terrorists, and the USA PATRIOT Act. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the political spectrum.    ALAN J. POMERANTZ, ESQ ., is a practicing lawyer and partner of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, LLP, a major international law firm. A graduate of the NYU School of Law, he also studied in Chile and received an advanced legal degree from the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands).

Mr. Pomerantz and Weil, Gotshal have participated in important and controversial matters affecting individual rights, including death penalty appeals, rights of public artistic expression, political asylum applications, voting rights, right of privacy for acts of consenting adults, equal access laws for disabled persons, and numerous free speech cases.    Memoirs and Diaries in Modern European Jewish History (V50.0312; call # 74826) Instructor: Marion Kaplan Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.    This course analyzes modern Jewish history through the use of memoirs and diaries, which can offer an abundance of detail about the public political, economic, social, and religious worlds and provide valuable, often rare glimpses into the motivations and expectations of Jews regarding the non-Jewish world. Moreover, memoirs and diaries disclose the private aspects of everyday life, revealing crucial concealed thoughts and emotions as well as attitudes and behaviors within the family, friendship networks, and the Jewish community. They allow students to delve into relations between parents and children, spouses, generations, neighbors, and friends. The course begins with the most famous memoir written by a Jewish woman, Glikl of Hameln, in the late 17th century, and continues through the mid-20th century and the Holocaust. It includes the autobiographies of Leon Modena, a 17th-century Venetian rabbi; Solomon Maimon, an 18th-century Jewish philosopher-bohemian-heretic; Pauline Wengeroff, a traditional Jewish woman in 19th-century Russia; and Puah Rakowski, a Polish radical. Readings from the period of the Holocaust include two classics, the diaries of Anne Frank, a young girl, and Victor Klemperer, an elderly Jewish man. Students are responsible for reading the primary sources, and the instructor includes introductory materials to place the memoirs in their historical context in each class.    MARION KAPLAN is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History . She has also taught at Queens College, CUNY. She is the author of The Jewish Feminist Movement in Germany: The Campaigns of the J?discher Frauenbund, 1904-1938 (1979), The Making of the Jewish Middle Class: Women, Family, and Identity in Imperial Germany (1991), and Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany (1998). The last two won the National Jewish Book Award in their respective years. She has edited books on European women's history-When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany and The Marriage Bargain: Dowries in European History-and is currently editing and writing a history of Jewish daily life from the 17th century until 1945.    German Romantic Music, 1815-1850 (V50.0313; call # 74827) Instructor: Robert Bailey Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.    Many artists of this period revolted against prevailing artistic, and even social and political, institutions. They reacted against both the current cult of the virtuoso and the increasingly commercial climate dominated by music publishers. They withdrew into a private artistic world, and the Artist became the typical Romantic hero. The Wanderer in turn became the ideal symbolic projection of an artist alienated from a society uninterested in his work and in his welfare. This withdrawal led artists to participate in a private symbolic system accessible to themselves, but only partly accessible to middle-class audiences. German artists often restructured traditional relationships and affinities among the musical, poetic, and visual arts. Unable to find fulfillment in the troublesome present, they frequently sought vindication for their artistic ideals in the past. Hence, their interest in folksong, which inspired a large body of new poetry appropriate for musical setting. Such poetry provided the foundation for a flowering of song publications, which flourished alongside popular publications of actual folksongs. Opera, the song cycle, and the multi-movement piano cycle are the genres that most fully project the intricate system of interlocking and closely aligned musical, poetic, and visual imagery. The works in these genres by Weber, Schubert, Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Schumann, and Wagner are of central concern to the seminar.    ROBERT BAILEY is the Carroll and Milton Petrie Professor of Music in the Faculty of Arts and Science. As an undergraduate at Dartmouth, he majored in music and German. He then studied piano at the Academy of Music in Munich. He did his graduate work in musicology at Princeton, where his principal mentors were Oliver Strunk and Milton Babbitt. He also continued piano study with Edward Steuermann, who was on the faculty of the Juilliard School. Before joining the faculty of NYU in 1986, he taught at Yale and at the Eastman School of Music.    Opium and China (V50.0314; call # 74828) Instructor: Joanna Waley-Cohen Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar highlights opium's material and symbolic role in China's history before and after the Opium Wars of the 19th century. Using both primary and secondary courses, it explores such issues as opium's economic role within China and in the global market; the nature and extent of addiction in China; global attitudes to opium use; the role of Chinese middlemen and consumers in the extraordinarily rapid spread of opium in China; and ways in which opium both complemented and changed perceptions of gender, in terms of drug use as well as in terms of foreign perceptions of China, since opium came to serve in complicated ways as a symbol for China itself.    JOANNA WALEY-COHEN is the author of The Sextants of Beijing: Global Currents in Chinese History (1999) and Exile in Mid-Qing China: Banishment to Xinjiang, 1759-1820 (1991), as well as numerous articles on Chinese legal history, the military culture of the Qing empire, and the history of Hong Kong. Her current project is on gastronomy and gluttony in early modern China. Since 1992 she has taught a range of undergraduate and graduate courses in Chinese history at NYU, most recently on material culture, on the Silk Roads, on Qing history, and on interactions with Europe and the wider world.    Sport, Race, Ethnicity, and Gender in 20th-Century America (V50.0315; call # 74967) Instructor: Peter Levine Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    Although you may well learn why Nat Holman is in the Basketball Hall of Fame, why Ralph Branca cried in l951, or who Senda Berenson was, this seminar is not concerned with preparing you for sports trivia contests. Rather, its central purpose is to explore how race, ethnicity, gender, and class have influenced the development of organized sport as a major social and cultural institution of American life. During the first part of the semester we will collectively explore readings and films that touch on these themes. Later, we will devote considerable time learning how to write a major research paper, using both secondary and primary sources, including oral histories. Where possible and practical, students will be encouraged to make use of New York as a site for investigation and research.    PETER LEVINE was for many years Professor of American History and Director of American Studies at Michigan State University, before returning to his native Brooklyn in 2000. Whether focusing on ethnic studies or on popular culture, he has been especially attracted to interdisciplinary approaches and to reaching out to both scholarly and popular audiences. Best known for his work in sport and American social history, he is the author of Ellis Island to Ebbets Field: Sport and the American Jewish Experience (1992), A. G. Spalding and the Rise of Baseball (1985), and, with Robert Lipsyte, Idols of the Game (1995).    Latin American Nobel Prize Winners (V50.0316; call # 74966) Instructor: Mary Louise Pratt Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m.    Prerequisite: ability to understand spoken and written Spanish This course is aimed at students who have a strong background in Spanish and enjoy studying literature. We will study the lives and works of the five writers who have won the Nobel Prize in Literature: the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral (1942), the Guatemalan novelist Miguel Angel Asturias (1967), the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (1971), the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garc?a M?rquez (1982), and the Mexican poet Octavio Paz (1990). In addition, we will look at the work of three writer-activists who have won the Nobel Peace Prize: the Costa Rican Oscar Arias (1987), the Argentine Adolfo Perez Esquivel (1980), and the Guatemalan Rigoberta Mench? (1992).We will study these writers in their Latin American context, and consider what it was about them that drew international attention. Reading their acceptance speeches, we will ask how they sought to negotiate the place of Latin America in the international imagination, and how their work was received at home and abroad. At the textual level, especially with poetic texts, we will compare different translations, as a way of exploring the use of language. Class and readings will be mainly in Spanish; class participation and written work may be in Spanish or English. The course will count toward the Spanish or Latin American Studies major.    MARY LOUISE PRATT , Silver Professor of Latin American Literature and Culture , is an eminent scholar in the field of Latin American culture. During the year 2003, she served as President of the Modern Language Association. She is the author of, among many other titles, Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation, \"I Rigoberta Mench? and the Culture Wars,\" and \"Apocalypse in the Andes: Contact Zones and the Struggles for Interpretive Power.\"    From Mycenae to the Acropolis: Greek History and Art (V50.0317; call # 74965) Instructor: Guenter Kopcke Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This class aims at an understanding of the first thousand years of Greece's-and hence Western-political history. By the end of the fifth century B.C. the product (at least in Athens) is the individual familiar to us-the self-aware citizen, knowingly responsible for his or her actions. Greek art begins in the second millennium as a weapon of last resort of the disadvantaged in a lawless social climate. In the first millennium, as strife was progressively resolved by sparring with mental means rather than with physical force, the outline of a rationally controllable world emerges. That, in essence, will be seen as giving meaning to early Greek history and art. Demonstration will rely mostly on the contemporary mind and experience in reading (analyzing) primary evidence.    GUENTER KOPCKE is the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities at NYU's Institute of Fine Arts. Before coming to this country, he served as Assistant Curator in Munich, taught at the University of Zurich, and participated in many excavations in Greece and Israel. In outlook more historian than archaeologist or art historian, he is interested chiefly in understanding the critical role of (visual) art in the image of man in the Western tradition. His fields of concentration are the first thousand years of this tradition, from the middle of the second millennium B.C. to the middle of the first millennium B.C.    The Many Faces of Shahrazad: Arab Women in Culture, Literature, and 20th-Century Film (V50.0318; call # 74957) Instructor: Mona N. Mikhail Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar introduces students to the role and status of women in Arab societies today. Through the examination of selected texts from a variety of sources, be they sacred or profane, students investigate the role of the religious, social, and cultural as well as the political in the formation of the lives and roles of contemporary Arab women. Whether in Qur'anic suras or tales from the Thousand and One Nights, contemporary Arab-American poets or novelists from the Arab world, the course assesses the traditional gender roles versus the rapidly changing status of women. Close readings of selected essays, poems, novels, and short fiction, written by both women and men, as well as the viewing of selected films and documentaries, seek to address some of these timely topics.    MONA N. MIKHAIL , Associate Professor of Middle Eastern Studies , is the author of numerous books, notably Studies in the Short Fiction of Naguib Mahfouz and Yusuf Idris, and has written extensively on the cultural, social, and political context of modern Arabic literature, while also translating several important Arabic works into English. She is currently working on the growing body of women's literature in the Arab world and exploring women's role in popular culture/literature in oral genres such as proverbs, drama, song, and humor. Her latest work, Seen and Heard, was published in spring 2004. She also recently directed and produced a documentary about the theater in Egypt.    Recycling Music: from Classical to Broadway, Film, and Pop (V50.0319; call # 74829) Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    In 1953, the Russian symphonist Alexander Borodin, who had been dead for 66 years, was named co-recipient of a Broadway Tony Award for the use of his compositions in the musical Kismet. Two well-known musical-comedy writers had reworked several movements from Borodin's oeuvre to construct the score. This is one of many instances in which musicians and composers of the 20th century have reached back into the past for inspiration, whether of direct musical content, instrumental forces, or literary material, not only for the Broadway stage or the movie screen but also for dance and the popular idiom. This class examines representative examples of these borrowings in several media: the Broadway stage (Kismet, Anya, Rent, Aida), ballet (Le Spectre de la Rose and any number of Chopin favorites), film (Fantasia, Brief Encounter, Elvira Madigan; Warner Brothers cartoons), and popular music (Eric Carmen, \"All by Myself,\" \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\"). After a brief introduction to the concepts of musical transference and parody in music, classes compare original \"classical\" compositions with their subsequent reinterpretations on Broadway or in popular music, and examine the kinds of changes that went into the transference from the original medium to the later incarnation. Also considered is the cross-over between classical composers/conductors and the popular music scene.    RENA CHARNIN MUELLER is a musicologist specializing in 19th-century music. Her work on Liszt's compositional aesthetic has appeared in various journals. Her most recent publication is an essay on the Liszt lieder in the Cambridge Companion to the Lied (2004). She has published new editions of Les Pr?ludes (1997), Trois ?tudes de Concert (1996) and the two Ballades (1996); and her edition of the newly discovered Liszt Walse was published in 1996. With M?ria Eckhardt, she is the author of the Franz Liszt \"List of Works\" for The New Grove 2000, and they are also co-authoring the new Franz Liszt Thematischer Verzeichnis (forthcoming). In 2003 she was a winner of the College's Outstanding Teaching Award.    Lost and Found in Translation (V50.0320; call # 75132) Instructor: Kathleen Ross Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    Although we are not always aware of it, the process of translation figures prominently in our daily lives. Understanding another person's speech or writing is an act of translation, even when we speak the \"same\" language; according to some linguistic theories, all language is ultimately a translation. Translation, throughout history, has often been portrayed as an inevitable loss, a violence done to one language by another; the translator is characterized as a traitor, an imperialist, a thief, and the translation as only a pale copy of the \"original.\" Yet translation is crucial to the expansion of our sense of self in relation to an \"Other,\" and we cannot live fully without it. This course first examines some basic history and theories of translation, then considers the question of what is \"lost\" and what is \"found\" in the process, taking up examples from various historical moments. Throughout the course we will make use of multiple English translations of texts to spark our thinking. No knowledge of a language besides English is necessary.    KATHLEEN ROSS is Associate Professor of Spanish in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese , where she has served as Director of Undergraduate Studies and as Chair. She is both a scholar of the Latin American colonial period and an active translator of 19- and 20th-century Spanish American essays, poetry, and fiction. She has published translations of works by C?sar Vallejo, Roque Dalton, Julieta Campos, and others. Her translation of Domingo F. Sarmiento's classic 1845 essay Facundo: Civilization and Barbarism was published by the University of California Press in 2004.    Travelers and Travelogues in History (V50.0321; call # 75111) Instructor: Zvi Ben-Dor Benite Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    This seminar uses travelogues-journals and memoirs written by travelers-as historical sources. We will read several travelogues written by different travelers from different periods and learn to devise ways and methods to interrogate them for the purpose of historical inquiry. During the course we will try to answer several questions such as: Who are the authors of the travelogues and what can we learn about them from their texts? How do they describe the societies and landscapes they visit and what can we learn from the travelogues? Most importantly, we will try to come up with a list of many other questions the answers for which can be found in travelogues. The travelogues selected for this seminar stretch over different periods and cover different regions of the world such as Asia, Africa, and Europe and America from the Middle Ages to the Early Modern period. We will read travel stories by, among others, Benjamin of Tudela, Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, and Olaudah Equiano.    ZVI BEN-DOR BENITE is Assistant Professor of History . His specialty is world history, specifically the relations between East Asia, West Asia, and Europe during the Middle Ages and the early modern periods. He is the author of The Dao of Muhammad: A Cultural History of Muslims in Late Imperial China.    Staging Shakespeare's Comedies (V50.0322; call # 75380) Instructor: Peter W. Meineck Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This course examines the comedic work of William Shakespeare, focusing specifically on five major works-The Comedy of Errors, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Twelfth Night, and The Tempest. The course involves a practical element where students discuss staging, performance, interpretation, and the meaning of these works today. Class members are expected to participate in active workshops and dramatic explorations, although they do not need to have any performing experience; these practical workshops are designed to be purely exploratory and not performative. In addition to practical work, this course studies Shakespeare's influences, examining the origin of comedy, the theater of ancient Greece and Rome, including the works of Aristophanes, Menander, Plautus, and Terence, traditional English comedic forms, and Elizabethan satire, culture, and politics. It also considers the influence of Shakespearean comedy on successive dramatic forms, including the theater, film, and television. Students interested in this course should be prepared actively and intelligently to participate in discussions and practical workshops and follow a good amount of reading.    PETER W. MEINECK is Clinical Assistant Professor of Classics and Ancient Studies at NYU and the Artistic Director of the Aquila Theatre Company, a New York and national professional theater group specializing in fresh and innovative productions of classical drama, especially Shakespeare. Recently the Aquila's Othello formed the main focus of the National Endowment for the Arts' Shakespeare in American Communities program. Professor Meineck has published several translations of Greek plays with Hackett Press, his Aeschylus' Oresteia winning the 2000 Louis Galanti?re Award for Outstanding Translation from the American Translators Association. He has been teaching at NYU for the past five years and has also held academic appointments at Princeton and Harvard, among other U.S. universities. He is originally from London, England.    Before Cleopatra: Royal Women of Ancient Egypt (V50.0323; call # 75381) Instructor: Ann Macy Roth Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Long before Cleopatra, the royal women of ancient Egypt often had a great deal of influence on world events. Some even became pharaohs in their own right, and were depicted with a beard and a male body or wearing the ceremonial dress of a king over the modest traditional dress of a woman. Others exercised religious authority in priestly offices or as the ceremonial wife of a god. This course examines the lives and roles of these women, as reflected in the art, archaeology, and texts of their own times, and often in their own words. Questions examined include the assumptions about gender and sex underlying Egyptian culture, the practical and symbolic roles of queens, the character of women's monuments, the destruction of some monuments of powerful women by later generations, and changes in the roles of elite women over almost three millennia of Egyptian history. Through their culturally anomalous position, we come to understand some important principles of gender and power in Egypt, and perhaps elsewhere as well. In addition, we examine the views of these women taken by Western scholars and popular media, and how such understandings of their roles reflect the evolution of our own cultural attitudes.    ANN MACY ROTH is Clinical Associate Professor in the Departments of Hebrew and Judaic Studies and Fine Arts . Her research focuses mainly on the earlier periods of ancient Egyptian culture, particularly mortuary traditions and the roles of gender and sexuality in Egyptian society. She is director of the Giza Cemetery Project, and since 1987 has conducted archaeological research in the officials' tombs to the west of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Her publications include Egyptian Phyles of the Old Kingdom: The Evolution of a System of Social Organization, A Cemetery of Palace Attendants at Giza, and numerous articles. She has been invited to write three essays for Daughter of Re: Hatshepsut, King of Egypt, the catalogue of an exhibition opening in spring 2006 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.    Making Choices in Contemporary America: Dedication, Deception, and Deals (V50.0324; call # 74964) Instructor: Frederick G. More Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    Have you ever done what you thought was the right thing only do find yourself feeling that your right choice left you at a disadvantage? This course uses a case-study approach to reflect on issues in bioethics and contemporary life. Examples include such cases as that of Erin Brockovich, whose routine work in a law office led to the discovery of injustices suffered by citizens in a California city; a family who wanted to remove their daughter from life support, after years in a persistent vegetative state, only to become the focus of a legal controversy that reached the Supreme Court; the research project in which for 40 years U.S. Public Health Service researchers deprived 600 black men with syphilis of their right to health care; the Reagan administration's denial of the HIV epidemic in the U.S.; and the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommendations about nutrition that resulted from an intensely partisan process and deal-making. During the course we use movies, books, articles, and self-study as vehicles for reflection about the personal values that one can employ for decision-making and for exploration of personal and medical ethics.    FREDERICK G. MORE is Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion and the Department of Pediatric Dentistry in the NYU College of Dentistry. While formerly associate dean for academic affairs there, he developed and implemented the present dental curriculum. Prior to his faculty appointment at NYU, he was on the faculty of the University of Michigan.

Dr. More has served on the NYU Committee on the Use of Human Subjects in Research Activities and is currently on the NYU School of Medicine Institutional Review Board Associates.    By Any Means Necessary: Presidential Politics in the Post-Watergate Era (V50.0325; call # 74963) Instructor: Cheryl Mills Wednesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.    Since Watergate, the policy agenda of the presidency has become increasingly defined not just by the ideas of the individual holding office but by the tactical allegations and actions of forces external to the White House. Today, a president's agenda gains support or faces opposition from governmental forces-in the executive branch, Congress, and the judiciary-and nongovernmental forces, including political parties, special-interest groups, think tanks, political action organizations, and the media. It has become commonplace for all parties, including the president and his staff, to seek to accomplish their public policy aims by engaging in the politics of obstruction and personal attack to undermine confidence in the opposition's agenda for America. From election campaigns to presidential appointments to impeachment to the exercise of war powers, the president and his political opposition must be adept at navigating the politics of personal destruction. This class studies presidential politics since Watergate. It examines the presidency in relation to its governmental counterparts, the judiciary and Congress, as well as to the nongovernmental entities. Using media accounts (electronic, print, and televised), congressional and judicial testimony, judicial decisions, historical accounts, and first-person narratives, it assesses the players, the methods, and the impact on the presidency of public policy dissent and disagreement by any means necessary.    CHERYL MILLS, ESQ. , is Senior Vice President and Counselor for Operations and Administration at NYU. She received the J.D. from Stanford Law School, where she was elected to the Stanford Law Review. In the Clinton administration she served as Deputy Counsel to the President at the White House, where she supervised 35 attorneys and staff. She gained national prominence for her defense of President Clinton during the 1999 Senate impeachment trial. From 1999 to 2001, before joining NYU, she was Senior Vice President for Corporate Policy and Public Programming at Oxygen Media. She serves on the boards of numerous foundations, schools, and corporations.    Vienna 1900: The Art and Culture of Viennese Modernism (V50.0326; call # 75378) Instructor: Guy Walton Tuesday and Thursday, 12:30-1:45 p.m.    At the turn of the 20th century, Vienna, the capital of the Austrian Empire, became an important center of \"modern\" architecture, art, applied arts, music, philosophy, and science (particularly medicine/psychiatry). After a brief survey of the geography and history of the Austrian Empire and description of the city of Vienna, the course examines a selection of the major monuments of Vienna, especially those related to European modernism, and five operas. The focus is thus on art, architecture, and music, stressing the relationship of these to the cultural and intellectual milieu of this splendid capital city. Among the artists to be studied are Otto Wagner, Josef Hoffmann, Adolf Loos, Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, and Richard Strauss. New York museums, commercial art galleries, and the new Neue Galerie provide an important resource for the seminar.    GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Fine Arts in the College of Arts and Science. He received his Ph.D. from NYU's Institute of Fine Arts and is well known for his publications on the art of the royal courts of Europe, particularly those of France, Sweden, and Russia. He is also a collector of 20th-century Austrian decorative arts.    The Politics of Judicial Decision-Making (V50.0327; call # 75128) Instructor: Anna Harvey Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    This seminar is about how we can and should understand how U.S. Supreme Court justices decide cases. We begin by posing the problem of the countermajoritarian Court. Given the apparent absence of mechanisms to hold the justices accountable to popular preferences, can we come up with rules of statutory and constitutional interpretation that constrain the justices' decisions in normatively desirable ways? We review several of these theories of interpretation. What do they prescribe? How constraining would they be in practice? Would they in fact lead to better outcomes? We then turn to work that seeks to determine what the justices are actually doing when they decide cases. We first examine the justices' decisions in cases involving statutory interpretation. We then examine their decisions in constitutional cases. What kinds of data are used in these studies? What are their conclusions? How believable are they? Is the Court really countermajoritarian? Finally, we return to the normative theories with which we started. Given what we have learned from the positive work on the Court, do they still have any relevance?    ANNA HARVEY is Associate Professor of Politics . She received her Ph.D. from Princeton University. Having joined the Department of Politics in 1994, she served as its chair from 2000 to 2003. She is the author of Votes without Leverage: Women in American Electoral Politics, 1920-1970, as well as of many scholarly articles. Her research focuses on two areas: the nature of partisanship in the American electorate and the political constraints on judicial decision-making. In the latter project, she and her collaborator at NYU's Law School are investigating the extent to which the Supreme Court is constrained by the political branches in constitutional cases.    Charity, Philanthropy, and the Nonprofit Sector (V50.0328; call # 75379) Instructors: Harvey P. Dale and Jill S. Manny Wednesday, 3:30-5:30 p.m.    This course explores the nonprofit sector and its role in society, from a perspective that touches on legal, economic, policy, and other realms. After a look at the history and scope of the nonprofit sector, we discuss the burdens and benefits of philanthropy and the nonprofit sector. We consider how charities derive resources and how they expend them to further their charitable purposes. We examine the distinction between public charities and private foundations, and invite leaders of both sorts of charities to join us in class for a discussion. We discuss governance of charities, both by federal and state regulators and by officers, directors, and trustees. We focus on the things that the nonprofit sector does well, and some of its performance failures, as we consider recent publicized scandals and abuses within the sector and estimate their impact on the sector. We analyze relevant legal concepts and theories, including the rules for tax exemption and tax deductions, and consider why these benefits are offered to certain organizations. We also consider those who donate their time and resources, examining both donor motivation and donor intent. Finally, we discuss nonprofit speech viewed through the lens of legal restrictions on lobbying and political campaign activities by nonprofits.    HARVEY P. DALE is University Professor of Philanthropy and the Law at NYU. Since 1988 he has been Director of the National Center on Philanthropy and the Law at NYU. The Founding President of The Atlantic Philanthropies, he has also served as board member of or consultant to a wide range of other nonprofit organizations and institutions. He is the author of numerous publications on philanthropy and the law. JILL S. MANNY joined the faculty at NYU School of Law in 1993, where she teaches courses on Nonprofit Law, Tax-Exempt Organizations, and Tax Aspects of Charitable Giving. In 1995 she assumed there the additional position of Executive Director of the National Center on Philanthropy and the Law. She also teaches Nonprofit Law at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service.    Extra-solar Planets and Astrobiology (V50.0329; call # 75382) Instructor: Glennys Farrar Monday, 4:55-7:25    Questions about the existence of other planets and about life on those planets have been with us since the dawn of time. Since the realization that not only the Earth but the other planets of our solar system orbit the Sun and that life on Earth depends on sunlight, mankind has searched for more planets in our own solar system and for planets orbiting other stars. In the last ten years these searches have finally succeeded. The search for and study of other planetary systems is now a major theme of current astrophysics research. This course introduces that work, exploring why searching for planets is so difficult and why it finally succeeded. It presents an overview of cosmology and star formation, to see how stars \"work\" and why planets around other stars would be expected to be common. By contrast, the scientific study of the origin and evolution of life (astrobiology) is an emerging discipline, with quite different ideas on how widespread life may be in the universe. This state of affairs gives students a chance to observe a new scientific discipline in its formative period, and to understand how scientists go about posing and refining questions, even when there are many more questions than answers and it is not yet clear how to formulate the fundamental problems.    GLENNYS FARRAR is Professor of Physics and Director of the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics at NYU. Before coming to NYU in 1998, she was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and on the faculties of the California Institute of Technology and Rutgers University. Her current work focuses mainly on problems at the intersection of astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics, including ultrahigh energy cosmic rays, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the origin of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter.    Departmental Seminars Available for Freshmen       Freshman Colloquium: Borges, the Storyteller (V95.0250, sec. 001; call # 74352) Instructor: Sylvia Molloy Tuesday, 2:00-4:40 p.m. Prerequisite: score of 4 or 5 on Spanish AP examination or permission of the director of undergraduate studies.    This seminar, conducted in Spanish, has two goals: to read the work of the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges and to reflect on narrative, specifically, on storytelling. Why do we tell stories? How do we put them together in order to achieve the desired results? Are stories \"just\" fiction? Is history \"just\" a story? What about autobiography? What power do storytellers have over us and why do we listen to them? Why do we call them fabricators and, at the same time, say that their stories ring true? A master narrator, Borges resorts to storytelling in all the genres he practices-short fiction, principally, but also essays and poetry. A close reading of his work allows us not only to reflect on the question of narrative but also, more importantly, to enjoy the pleasure of the written text. Readings include Borges's Ficciones , El Aleph , El informe de Brodie , and Antologia poetica .    Freshman Colloquium: Nueva York (V95.0250, sec. 002; call # 74353) Instructor: James Fern?ndez Wednesday, 2:00-4:40 p.m. Prerequisite: score of 4 or 5 on Spanish AP examination or permission of the director of undergraduate studies.    Through the analysis of a series of essays, short stories, novels, plays, and films, this course explores (1) New York as an important site of production of Spanish-language culture from the early 19th century to the present and (2) representations of New York in Spanish-language culture during that same period. Readings include Jos? Mart? (Cuba), Cr?nicas de Nueva York ; Federico Garc?a Lorca (Spain), Poeta en Nueva York ; Rene Marqu?s (Puerto Rico), La carreta ; Ernesto Qui?onez (Ecuador), El vendedor de sue?os ; Antonio Mu?oz Molina (Spain), and Ventanas de Manhattan. The course is conducted in Spanish.                        Welcome!
