OART-UT 1916 Acting for the Stage and Screen 8 units Prerequisite: Applicants to the acting program should have a minimum of one year acting training or equivalent.    Acting for Stage and Screen is the Open Arts Studio at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts. It is designed for a select, diverse student body, ready to challenge and stretch the physical and emotional instrument of the actor. The studio is dedicated to developing the actor's entire instrument-the body, the voice, and the imagination. Training frees the actor, so that he/she is able to go with his instincts and impulses; out of the head and into the viscera. In scene study classes the student discovers the importance of text analysis and staying in the moment, and the need for selecting strong objectives, formidable obstacles, varied actions, and meaningful personalizations. The Alexander technique and teachings of Linklater is used in voice production. The movement component includes yoga, circus, and the teachings of Laban.    Angela Pietropinto, actor and teacher, as well as a Tisch alumnae and director of the studio, has assembled a faculty composed of master teachers, dedicated to teaching the creative process an actor must go through in order to become a conduit for a playwright's ideas. The studio's faculty members are working theater professionals as well as experienced teachers. The faculty exposes students to the ideas and philosophies of contemporary and classical playwrights.    The second half of the semester aims to integrate the movement, voice production, games/improvisation, scene study, and film production techniques and apply them to the students' scenes. The director and instructors collaborate to utilize all of the training to bring the dramatic and comic text to life.    Areas of Study:       Movement    Voice Production    Games/Improv    Clowning    Commedia Dell'Arte    Scene Study    Film Production    Students will attend the studio 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. three days a week. The other days are spent taking academic courses. On the last day of class there is an informal presentation of the scenes students have been working on. Movement pieces created under the guidance of the movement teacher are also presented.

Interactive media projects and approaches to the design of new media applications are presented weekly; students are thus exposed to both commercial as well as mission-driven applications by the actual designers and creators of these innovative and experimental projects. By way of this process, all first year students, for the first and only time in their ITP experience, are together in one room at one time, and as a community, encounter, and respond to, the challenges posed by the invited guests. The course at once provides an overview of current developments in this emerging field, and asks students to consider many questions about the state of the art. For example, with the new technologies and applications making their way into almost every phase of the economy and rooting themselves in our day to day lives, what can we learn from both the failures and successes? What are the impacts on our society? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space? Class participation, group presentations, and a final paper are required.                                         Comm Lab: Animation (ITPG-GT.2002) - Marianne Petit, Gabe Barcia-Colombo, Molly Schwartz, Antonius Oktaviano Wiriadjaja, Erica Gorochow            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2013, Fall 2014         This course explores the fundamentals of storytelling through animation. Students will create two short animation pieces over the course of seven weeks. The first part of the course is devoted to the stop motion sing Dragon Stop Motion. The second part of the course is devoted to digital collage animation using After Effects. Drawing skills are not necessary for this class, however, you will keep a sketchbook. Basic video and sound skills are required.       This two-credit course will meet the last seven weeks of the semester.                                                       Comm Lab: Networked Media (ITPG-GT.2003) - Shawn Van Every, Lauren McCarthy, Robyn Overstreet, Daniel Shiffman            Offered: Fall 2014         The network is one of our most fundamental mediums for interactivity. It makes possible our interaction with machines, data, and, most importantly, other people. Though the base interaction it supports is simple, a client sends a request to a server, which replies; an incredible variety of systems can be and have been built on top of it.      In this course, students will utilize JavaScript as both a client and server side programming language to build creative network systems. Additionally, HTML and CSS will be used to define the structure and look.          This two-credit course will meet for the first seven weeks of the semester.                                                         Course Syllabus            Comm Lab: Video and Sound (ITPG-GT.2001) - Gabe Barcia-Colombo, Marianne Petit, Craig Protzel, Crys Moore            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2013, Fall 2014         This course explores the fundamentals of sound and video. Students will learn the basics of both audio and video recording using audio field recorders and a variety of cameras (from the Panasonic Xacti through the Canon 5D D-SLR) as well as editing and exporting in Final Cut Pro. Students will work in teams to produce both an audio soundscape and a three-minute video short.       This two-credit course meets for the first seven weeks of the semester.                                    Course Syllabus            Comm Lab: Visual Language (ITPG-GT.2005) - Katherine Dillon, Nancy Nowacek            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2013, Fall 2014         The goal of this course is to provide students who are new to the principles of visual design with the practical knowledge, critical skills and confidence to effectively express their ideas in a visually pleasing and effective way. Over the course of 7-weeks an overview of the many tools and techniques available to convey an idea, communicate a message and influence an experience will be presented, discussed and applied. Topics covered in the course include: typography, color, composition, branding, logo and information design. This class is intended for students who do not have formal graphic design or visual arts training but recognize the powerful impact of visual decisions in their work.      COURSE OUTLINE   Class 1 \u2013 Principles of Visual Communication   Class 2 \u2013 Signage and Information Systems   Class 3 \u2013 Typography/Composition   Class 4 \u2013 Logo and Brand Design   Class 5 \u2013 Color Theory   Class 6 \u2013 Information Design         Each meeting a new topic will be presented. The format will be a class discussion with a focus on examples of the theme for the week. Each topic will have a related assignment that will done by each student individually and presented and critiqued in the following class. For students new to or with limited skills in Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator there will be a series of informal weekly workshops led by residents to teach the basics and answer questions on use of the software. Completion of the assignments and participation in the class discussion is required. Students must maintain a blog where they post their assignments.       This two-credit course will meet every Tuesday and Thursday throughout the first three weeks of the first summer session.                                                                                           Course Syllabus            Comm Lab: Web (ITPG-GT.2003) - Ioana Staicut, Rune Madsen, Zevensuy Rodriguez, Shawn Van Every, Robyn Overstreet            Offered: Spring 2012, Fall 2012, Spring 2013, Fall 2013, Spring 2014         The web has become one of our most fundamental mediums. It supports rich interaction between people and machines, people and data, and, most importantly, people and other people. Though the core web interaction is simple, a client sends a request to a server, which replies; services of incredible sophistication and scale have been built around it. In this class, students will learn to lay out and make a page responsive to the user; take user input; and work with a server to receive, store, manipulate, and return that input. Students will use HTML, CSS, the markup languages behind page structure and look; and PHP, a server side programming language.       This two-credit course meets for seven weeks.                  Course Syllabus            Introduction to Computational Media (ITPG-GT.2233) - Liesje Hodgson, Daniel Rozin, Daniel O'Sullivan, Daniel Shiffman, Christopher Kairalla, Matt Parker, Mimi Yin, Roopa Vasudevan            Offered: Spring 2012, Fall 2012, Fall 2013, Fall 2014         What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. The course focuses on the fundamentals of programming the computer (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) and then touches on some more advanced techniques such as image processing, computer vision, data parsing and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle for the class. Students with one semester of programming experience, or equivalent, should enroll in Daniel Shiffman's *Tuesday* section (CALL #8552) which will move more quickly through the basics. All other sections will assume no programming experience at all. The end of the semester is spent developing an idea for a final project and implementing it using computer programming.                             Course Syllabus            Introduction to Physical Computing (ITPG-GT.2301) - Scott Fitzgerald, Thomas Igoe, Benedetta Piantella, Dustyn Roberts, Jeffrey Feddersen, Arlene Ducao            Offered: Spring 2012, Fall 2012, Summer1 2012, Fall 2013, Summer2 2013, Fall 2014         This course expands the students' palette for physical interaction design with computational media. We look away from the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface of today's computers, and start instead with the expressive capabilities of the human body. We consider uses of the computer for more than just information retrieval and processing, and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller, a single-chip computer that can fit in your hand. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. Core interaction design concepts include user observation, affordances, and converting physical action into digital information. Students have weekly lab exercises to build skills with the microcontroller and related tools, and longer assignments in which they apply the principles from weekly labs in creative applications. Both individual work and group work is required.                          Course Syllabus         TIER 2             13 Products in Search of an Audience (ITPG-GT.2979) - Kristen Taylor            Offered: Fall 2013         This class is about how to design products, services, and experiences that dignify the user in their implementation and lead to a true measure of success: long-term engagement and repeat interactions. We work through how to establish and continue relationships between users, taking as our inspiration theory, poetry, prose, and thirteen important online products or services. The class assumes a high level of comfort with non-linear thinking and proficiency in social network interactions, applying that knowledge to product design and implementation.                   3D Printing Luxury (ITPG-GT.2619) - Antonius Oktaviano Wiriadjaja, Francis Bitonti            Offered: Fall 2014         This course offers an introduction to using 3D-printing technology to design luxury goods. Using affordable tools and software like the MakerBot Replicator, Processing and Rhino, students will design and create prototypes with the larger goal of producing for the high-end consumer. We will explore what luxury branding means both historically and in a contemporary setting. Emphasis will be put on designing well-polished aesthetic pieces that are also fit to be sold or marketed.            Course Syllabus            3D Sensing and Visualization Seminar (ITPG-GT.2900) - Kyle McDonald            Offered: Fall 2012         This course will explore recent developments in 3d scanning technology and the tools and techniques for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing 3d data. Once relegated to the realm of academic and military research, 3d scanning has recently been made available to amateurs through DIY implementations like DAVID laser scanner, or, in the case of Kinect, through open source reverse engineering of cheap consumer hardware. We will cover different methods of 3d input, including structured light, LIDAR, time of flight, stereo matching, and optical triangulation -- and focus on techniques for organizing and collecting data, creatively visualizing it, and using it in an interactive context. This course will be taught using openframeworks, a C++ toolkit for creative coding. While the class will be highly technical and code-heavy, there will be a strong emphasis the poetic potential of this new form of input.      This two-point course meets for the first seven weeks of the semester.      Course Syllabus            A New Environmentalism (ITPG-GT.2551) - Yasser Ansari            Offered: Spring 2014         The environmental and conservation movements have failed us. Despite massive investments in clean tech, popular support of the public, and aggressive political activism, we are still facing unprecedented rates of species extinction, forest loss, and climate change. Many of the organizations, agencies, and politicians we entrusted to protect the planet are struggling to grasp technology, connect with a new generation of supporters, and modernize their efforts. At a time when we need these organizations the most, some of them are more concerned about saving themselves than saving the planet and that's not acceptable. How many more oil spills will it take? How many more acres of the rainforest will we need to see cleared? How many more coral reef systems must be decimated before we say enough? Can we build a new environmental movement before it's too late? What will this new movement look like and how will it work? What tools and technologies can we harness?      As the co-founder of Project Noah ( www.projectnoah.org ), a joint venture with National Geographic (and my ITP thesis project), I have been working for the past 4 years on mobilizing a new generation of wildlife explorers and environmental activists. Leveraging my experience and a large network of artists, activists, tribal leaders, NGO leaders, business people, and educators I've worked with, this class will 1.) briefly cover the history of the conservation and environmental movements, 2.) assess where they currently stand on a global scale, and 3.) explore the possibilities of building more effective versions (with an emphasis on 3). Assignments will range from readings to short presentations. Students will be asked to focus in on a specific environmental or conservation cause to build out their final projects (for example, fighting for indigenous peoples rights or reforesting). Invited guests will provide insights from their work and feedback on final projects. The goal of this class isn't just to start a conversation, but to design and develop the pieces of a new environmental movement. Those pieces can be illustrations, musical compositions, new mobile apps, sensor networks for trees, or whatever.       This two-credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester.                                                Accessible Making (POLY DM.9103) - John Schimmel            Offered: Spring 2014         The Maker movement and the rise of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) in education have reignited the interest of hands-on-learning, tinkering and making. People with disabilities can directly benefit from participating in STEM activities at school, home and use these skills to find their passion and possibly a career. Currently, few options are available to make STEM accessible, how will a teenager with cerebral palsy use an Arduino if they can not use their hands? Can a student with visual impairments design a 3D model to printed if they can not see the software? How can the Maker movement include the disability community? This course will explore how the disability community can become active participants and become Makers through the use of accessible tools and methods. We will discuss the current state of assistive technology for people with disabilities and how it overlaps with the Maker movement. We will design and build accessible tools for STEM activities for classroom and home use. The ideal outcome of this course is to support the integration of the disability and Maker communities through identifying challenges and proposing accessible tools, ideas that allow accessible making.                   Advanced Animation Studio (ITPG-GT.2923) - Eyal Ohana, Molly Schwartz            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013, Spring 2014         Animation is the magic of giving life to objects through motion. Whether in linear storytelling, or in interactive experiences where another sense of wonder is achieved. Together with visual design, motion can be a powerful tool for storytelling, information visualization as well as for compelling interfaces.      This course is focused on advanced animation techniques and principles, to further add character and expression, to animated objects.      We learn the differences between linear and real-time, or generative animation, and how we can harness both to create a seamless experience. The discussion includes the integration of such animations, across different kinds of platforms, such as, installation based, web, and mobile. The main tool to be used is Adobe After Effects, and experimentation with code generated animation using processing is also demonstrated and encouraged. This is a production class, with short studies, and two main projects at mid and end term, required. Prerequisite: is ITPG-GT 2002 Comm Lab: Animation or equivalent knowledge in basic animation and video production.                       Course Syllabus            Aesthetics of Automation (ITPG-GT.2503) - E Roon Kang            Offered: Fall 2013         From Movable Type to the Internet, our desire to automate the work has been a major driving force behind many technological advancement. Thanks to these technologies, we are living the world that is extremely efficient and scalable, but as a result, we became alienated from the process of making. Often, we find the process humanly impossible to comprehend, due to our lack of sense for such scale or complexity. Yet, many aspects of our life is dictated by these automation processes and as a result, they automate us.      In this fast-paced studio/theory class, we will discuss various concepts that are loosely related to the theme: the duality inherent in the relationship between technology and design, in the world full of automation. Topics will include: abstraction, mass-consumption, data logging, privacy, persistence, default and power structures, synchronization, pervasiveness, etc.      Students are expected to explore the topics given each week and create quick and small projects around the idea. Possible projects including, but not limited to: performance, sculpture, interactive installations, and generative art. Students are encouraged to break boundaries. Basic knowledge in creative computing is assumed, and we will be using various prototyping techniques including Processing, HTML/CSS and Javascript, and/or Adobe Creative Suite.      Weekly lecture will cover relevant readings and works by other artists, followed by casual presentation and discussion. Students will be given opportunity to develop and finalize one of their projects for the final.               Course Syllabus            Affordable 3D Printing and Design \u2013 Ready for Your Studio (ITPG-GT.2505) - Micah Ganske            Offered: Fall 2013         While in school students have access to some of the best 3D-printing technology currently available at a very affordable price. After graduation, however, access to this high-end technology becomes prohibitively expensive. This course aims to prepare students for life without a \"media lab\" and will leave them with all the basic knowledge needed to incorporate affordable 3D-printing into their work after graduation.      Students will become familiar with the hardware and operation of machines like the MakerBot Replicator and learn how to overcome the limitations of these consumer-focused machines. With correct planning, these machines can be used to create and prototype large scale objects which normally would require expensive, commercial equipment. Weekly assignments will have students creating the various parts needed to assemble a \u201c robot\u201d of their own design, complete with moveable articulated joints and sculpted details. The aim of this ongoing, light-hearted project will be to teach students all the necessary design tricks needed to create complex structures and objects of any type with a high-grade of finish. While a familiarity with 3D design will be of help, the course will give students of all disciplines and skill levels, the tools to bring 3D printed objects into their studio practice.        This two-credit course will meet the last seven weeks of the semester.                   Always On, Always Connected (ITPG-GT.2958) - Shawn Van Every            Offered: Spring 2013, Spring 2014         With their always on and always connected nature, mobile devices (phones and tablets) have become the center of our connected self. They offer us the ability to access the network anywhere at anytime, enabling us to share our experiences and share in the experiences of others. They are also starting to emerge as the hub of an emerging set of smart personal accessories such as watches, glasses and jewelry.         In this class, we'll examine the current state-of-the art in mobile technology and smart devices. We\u2019ll focus on developing applications using Cordova, a set of cross-platform APIs for creating mobile applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as various device or accessory SDKs (Google Glass Development Kit).      ICM level programming experience is required.                                       Course Syllabus            Animals, People and Those In Between (ITPG-GT.2936) - Marina Zurkow            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013         This class will use animals, humans, and other creatures as a way to think about art-making and character representation . Claude Levi-Strauss\u2019 observation that \u201cAnimals are Good to Think\u201d is the starting point from which we will make, discuss, and examine the ways in which art works imagine the interrelationships between the human, the animal, and our environment. If we can only perceive these things through mediation (media representations), then how we represent them is the fundamental question, reflecting our ideologies, prejudices, hopes, and fears. Do we speak for animals, and if so what are we saying for them? Are they friends, pets, environmental equals or beasts? How are hybrid monsters (chimera) created and what do they mean? How do we understand our places as subjects in a landscape or a datascape? How can anthropomorphic cuteness be subversive? This class focuses on questions of intention, relation, and subjectivity, through critical engagement with representations of people, animals, monsters, and mutants, in their respective environments. The class is further focused on the use of character in context, via toy design, robotics, animation, video, image generation or data visualization. There will be introductory texts on character development, and generally an emphasis on literary, philosophical and natural history texts.                    Course Syllabus            Appropriating Interaction Technologies (ITPG-GT.2661) - Kyle McDonald, Lauren McCarthy            Offered: Fall 2013, Fall 2014         This course explores the structures and systems of social interactions, identity, and representation as mediated by technology. We will investigate ways that technology can be used to augment, subvert, alter, mediate, and ultimately deepen interaction in a lasting way.      How do the things we build and use limit and expand the way we understand and relate to each other? We'll explore this question by building new tools and creating new situations for breaking us out of existing patterns, and discussing contextual examples from media art, performance art, psychology and pop culture. Technologies explored will include computer vision (face/body/eye tracking with openFrameworks), data representation and glitch, browser extensionsand plugins (in Chrome), computer security, mobile platforms, and social automation and APIs (Facebook, Twitter, Mechanical Turk).      Students will develop projects that alter or disrupt social space in an attempt to reveal existing patterns or truths about our experiences and technologies, and possibilities for richer interactions. Different tactics for intervention and performance will be explored, first through a set of short prompts or experiments, and then through a larger, more thorough intervention.      Technical requirements:      A conviction that creative people can derail society for the best, a deep love for code, and a willingness to explore uncomfortable situations. You should at least have taken Introduction to Computational Media or have similar experience with programming.        This two credit course will meet the last seven weeks of the semester.                                     Appropriating New Technologies (ITPG-GT.2937) - Kyle McDonald            Offered: Spring 2012         Technology is malleable, and our future is undecided. What do you want   your world to look like? This class will focus on creating the future   by creatively appropriating new technologies.      The class will cover the history and social context for new   technologies, and discussions about how we adopt them. The primary   tool we'll be using is openFrameworks: a C++ toolkit designed by a   global community of media artists, with an emphasis on real time   interaction. Because it's C++, it provides an easy bridge to a huge   variety of low level tools like OpenCV and FaceTracker -- which makes   it easier to develop otherwise impossible projects, like the   EyeWriter, or to explore cutting-edge ideas like real time face   substitution. In this class, we'll work with technologies surrounding   face tracking, eye tracking, 3d scanning, computer security, privacy,   and sharing. We'll spend a lot of time understanding the intricacies   of openFrameworks, with the goal of creating seamless, mind-blowing   experiments, installations, and performance pieces that hijack new   technologies to create the future we want to see.      Prerequisites: A conviction that creative people can genuinely derail   society for the best, and the ability to geek out with code when   necessary. You should at least have taken Introduction to   Computational Media or have similar experience with programming.             Automata: Telling Stories with Machines (ITPG-GT.2509) - Nick Yulman            Offered: Fall 2013, Fall 2014         For centuries, people have been fascinated with automatically controlling physical movement, light and sound to imbue inanimate objects with lifelike qualities. This course will explore the concept of automation, its history in the arts and industry and cover techniques for building and controlling automated devices.      We will look at historical and literary examples of automata, discuss their technical execution and cultural context, and examine their roles as precursors to sound recording, cinema and interactive media. Technical topics will include designing mechanisms for automating movement, working with various types of motors, solenoids and relays, programming automated routines using microcontrollers and software, and interfacing with popular automation protocols like MIDI and DMX. Beyond technology, we will explore composition and try to understand what qualities give autonomous machines a sense of character and personality. This course will also provide a grounding in design process and guide students through approaches to prototyping complex physical projects.      In addition to producing midterm and final projects, students will complete a variety of smaller conceptual and technical studies to help build a toolkit for designing and programming automated systems. This course requires previous experience with physical computing or willingness to catch-up on the basics in the early weeks.              Course Syllabus            Basic Analog Circuits (ITPG-GT.2728) - Eric Rosenthal            Offered: Spring 2012, Fall 2012, Spring 2013, Fall 2013, Spring 2014, Fall 2014         Todays mostly digital world also requires a basic knowledge of circuits that do not require computer processing. Analog circuits are simpler, lower cost, smaller and require less power and still perform many of the functions of digital circuits. In this course students will learn about the basic principles of electricity, components such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, audio amplifiers, power supplies and timers and circuits that interface to digital devices. The course includes circuits design and fabrication through lectures and hands on labs. Students will also learn the operation of electronic test equipment such as the digital multimeter, oscilloscope and function generator.        Course Syllabus            Be Here Now: Wares for Sharing (ITPG-GT.2898) - Sonali Sridhar            Offered: Spring 2012         Humans first developed tools for survival, then for personal pleasure and finally for social engagement. These three phases are the topic of this course, in which we will research and design for how natural human impulses shape our current social tools. With a focus on physical activities, functional garments, location tracking, and social media students will create new products or services that aim to embrace the very moment in history we\u2019re living in. The final assignment will be for individuals or groups to present their concept in a convincing manner using proof materials such as sketches, user scenarios, design boards, demo videos and working prototypes as needed.      Course Syllabus            Bicycles for the Mind (ITPG-GT.2511) - David Nolen            Offered: Fall 2013         Steve Jobs in a 1990 video for the Library of Congress famously referred to computers as \"bicycles for our mind\". This statement was uttered in the heyday of personal computing - not the ubiquitously networked state of 2013. But in a culture driven towards app stores, startups, and dubious lumbering towards something called code literacy do these words still ring true? It's difficult to dismiss the accessibility of Apple's iPad but have we come any closer to Alan Kay's DynaBook? In the New York Review of Books article \"The Chess Master and the Computer\", Gary Kasparov wrote \"Weak human + machine + better process was superior ... to a strong human + machine + inferior process.\" This could be interpreted as a darkly pessimistic version of Jobs' uplifting words. Or not. By examining critical texts, contemporary practice in pedagogy, art and business, and some forgotten dreams perhaps we can hope to better navigate the whitewater of technological progress.        This two-credit course will meet every other week of the semester.                    Big Games (ITPG-GT.2454) - Gregory Trefry            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013, Spring 2014         What happens to games when they escape the boundaries of our tabletops, desktops and living rooms? From massively multiplayer online games to mobile games that turn the city into a gigantic game grid, super-sized gaming opens up new spaces in which to play and seeps into the interstices of our days. Whether these games are measured in terms of number of players, geographical dimensions or temporal scope, they represent a new trend in which the \u2018little world\u201d created by a game threatens to swallow up the \"real world\" in which it is situated. This class is a hands-on workshop focused on the particular design problems of large-scale games. In this class students: develop a foundation of basic game design understanding from which to approach the specific issues particular to big games; analyze existing digital and non-digital large-scale games, taking them apart to understand how they work as interactive systems; and work on a series of design exercises that explore the social, technological, and creative possibilities of large-scale games.               Course Syllabus            Big Screens (ITPG-GT.2680) - Daniel Shiffman, Mimi Yin            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2013, Fall 2014         This class is dedicated to experimenting with interactivity on large-scale screens. Students will work in pairs to develop one project over the course of the semester, culminating with a showing at InterActive Corps' 120 X 12-foot video wall at their corporate headquarters on 18th St. and the West Side Highway. A mock-up of the system is available at ITP for testing. Class time is divided between independent project development, critique, technical demonstrations, and field trips to IAC. Registration for this course will happen through a separate lottery which you will enter in pairs.              Course Syllabus            Biomechanics for Interactive Design (ITPG-GT.2924) - Dustyn Roberts            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013         This class is designed to equip students with basic knowledge of biomechanics and human movement, as well as of sensors that can be used to track, visualize, or measure different aspects of it. The study of human movement dates back before the days of da Vinci, and readings covered throughout the class will give students an appreciation of the evolution of this field as an art and a science. Materials covered in class will range from basic anatomy and vocabulary used to talk about motion, limits of human athletic performance, balance, how human joints function and how muscles create movement, human factors in product design, etc. The lectures will serve as a foundation for a midterm project in designing a system to track, measure, or visualize some aspect of gait, and a more open-ended final project that will deal with exploring human motion through a physical system or expressing understanding of biomechanics through other mediums like video, sound, generative artwork, and more. Both individual and small group work will be required. Prerequisite: Intro to Physical Computing        Course Syllabus            Biomimetic Design (ITPG-GT.2513) - Gabriella Levine            Offered: Fall 2013         Biomimetic designs are used both practically and conceptually to provide solutions to a wide range of environmental and technological problems. Designers have developed an assistive arm modeled off of an elephant trunk that moves in three-dimensions to handle things as delicate as eggs; Architects have built houses from organically grown material; And engineers have developed robotic snakes to explore underwater pipelines for leaks and find hidden secrets in the Pyramids of Egypt.      This 7-week course will take a design-based approach to exploring biomimicry as an inspiration for interactive interfaces. Through lectures, workshops, and hands-on prototyping, we will investigate how natural forms and functions can inspire unique technological solutions. We'll address topics such as re-imagining social networks, mapping urban spaces, and redesigning user interfaces. We will think critically about natural systems and use it as the starting point for our own design development and prototyping. We will work collaboratively to build prototypes that combine hardware, software, and fabrication.      We will complete two projects, the final of which will comprise a physical product that integrates bio-inspired design with tangible interfaces. Throughout the course, we will document our work online & offline.Students will be encouraged to use Processing, Arduino, digital fabrication techniques, sensors, and electromechanical actuation.      This two-credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester.                          Course Syllabus            Bodies and Buildings (ITPG-GT.2959) - Jennifer van der Meer            Offered: Spring 2013, Fall 2014         Why is it so hard to care for our planet and ourselves. We seem hungover from a century of prosperity and ingenuity, unable to invent economic models that create jobs, improve health, and restore the earth. Eager ITP students are better equipped than MBAs to envision and hack our way out of this trap, but often lack an understanding of the mega forces of business, regulation, and bad cultural habits that keep us from saving ourselves. But don\u2019t despair! We\u2019ll get busy, and make things again \u2013 but also provide you with conceptual scaffolding upon which to build your worldchanging ideas.      Our tools of understanding include deep design thinking, and systems thinking. By focusing on two systems in particular: human bodies, and the buildings that humans make, we will examine the environmental and social impacts of the economic systems. Bodies are in trouble right now \u2013 despite reaching the peak of productivity the US now leads the world in the rampant growth of chronic diseases that lower life expectancy, and reduce life quality. Buildings are not in enough trouble \u2013 they account for the largest source of both electricity consumption (68% of global use) and greenhouse gas emissions (48% of global emissions) in the world.      In this course we will discover what Dana Meadows calls \u201cleverage points\u201d as places to intervene that would transform the system as a whole.      Areas for investigation include:         Bodies:      \u00b7  Data-driven accountable health care      \u00b7  Behavior as the new wonder drug      \u00b7  Data liquidity and the patient data movement      \u00b7  Mindfulness vs. the quantified self         Buildings:      \u00b7  Spimes - the internet of things      \u00b7  LEED, passive houses, benchmarking      \u00b7  Failures of the cleantech revolution      \u00b7  Generative architecture                          Course Syllabus            Boxes and Lines for Rods and Cones: Video Programming in Max (ITPG-GT.2935) - Scott Fitzgerald            Offered: Spring 2012         Building on the skills learned in \"Intro to Dataflow Programming\" this course will explore the possibilities of real time video compositing and manipulation. Somewhat different from audio and signal manipulation, video control in Jitter is based around matricies. We will discuss how video works in a matrix, issues around optimization of video formats and live feeds, and how to setup patches that are ready for performance and installation. We will also explore some of the related OpenGL and 3D tools. While the \"Intro to Dataflow\" course used Pd, we will be working with the Jitter package in Max/MSP. The concepts we will be covering can be applied to other dataflow environments, like Quartz Composer and Gridflow for Pd, though it is not as directly applicable as Pd to Max. The prerequisite for this two point course, which meets the second seven weeks of the semester, is \"Intro to Dataflow Programming\", which meets the first seven weeks, (or equivalent experience).                        Bridging Worlds: Constructing the Immersive Space (ITPG-GT.2553) - Brian E. Jones            Offered: Spring 2014         Architectural spaces shape our feelings of intimacy, security and privacy. They can be designed to both enhance and confuse our senses. Such experiences were built into the fabric of static spaces such as St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral and The Capitol. The experiences however, are immutable. Technology changes this. Now the artist can create dynamic and context aware narratives for both individuals and groups in a physical space.      This new space offers unique opportunities and constraints. Discovery, Identity, Time, Memory, Networking, Feedback and Control, to name but a few. Using Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Zigbee for the hardware stack; Google App Engine and Google Cloud Services for the backend, students will create narrative driven immersive experiences. Each class consists of a lecture and lab with practical code and hardware examples for creating their own solutions. These efforts will culminate in the production of a final project. At the course\u2019s conclusion students will have a toolkit for storing sensor data, parsing vast datasets, presenting data, and controlling environments on a fully scalable, Enterprise level cloud computing platform.               Course Syllabus            Building for Learning (ITPG-GT.2623) - Aidan Feldman            Offered: Fall 2014         The web has already revolutionized the way that people consume information, but only recently has it been taken seriously as an avenue for teaching. MOOCs, online tutorials, and interactive applications all offer different means of learning, from the highly structured to the exploratory. They raise new questions around evaluation and assessment, while providing new avenues for collaboration and opportunities for students outside of traditional learning environments. In this class, we will examine various educational platforms and tools, and get the opportunity to speak with their creators. What can we offer to teachers to make their lives easier? What features increase and sustain student engagement? The course will be largely project-based, where students will learn frontend web development skills to build new web-based learning experiences and tools.                 Course Syllabus            Cabinets of Wonder (ITPG-GT.2470) - Nancy Hechinger            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2014         If you were inventing a museum today, what would it look like? Who would be there? What would its main purpose be? The first museums were called Cabinets of Wonder. Usually, a viewer with a guide, often the collector, would open doors and drawers to see what was inside--amazing things from different parts of the world, different times. They were windows on the world to places the visitors would probably never be able to go; to see things they would never otherwise be able to see. And now there\u2019s television, movies, the internet and travel. Why do people go to museums now? Will they in the future? Today, most museums seek to educate and to include more and more diverse visitors than they used to. How do people learn in public spaces? How do we know that they do? How can they make use of the new interactive technologies and not lose what\u2019s special about them? The class is an exploration, observation and theory class with some design mixed in. Museum and exhibit visits are your primary assignments for the first half of the course\u2014usually accompanied by a reading. You will also make some record of your visit (including a sketchbook, a dioramas, reviews) There will be guest speakers from Museums and exhibit design firms, and several field trips. In the second half of the course, you begin to imagine how you might reinvent a museum and develop a full-scale presentation of your own Cabinet of Wonder.                                                                  Changing the World (or Just One Person's Behavior), One Data Point at a Time (ITPG-GT.2555) - Sarah Newhall            Offered: Spring 2014         How do you change the world when users are being bombarded by messages and asks on all sides on a regular basis? If you are trying to build a movement, grow an audience, or get people to the polls, how do you know where to find people, and how do you get them to take an action that both you and they care about?      In the digital age, users are increasingly stimulated by different types of media, multiple asks, and requests for their information. Simultaneously, they are providing more information about themselves, about their interests, and about what they don't like. The activity of data collection has skyrocketed to new heights with the advent of the digital age, and the power of the data is manifold: it allows you to understand what a user is likely or unlikely to respond to based on previous actions, it allows you to target individuals in your audience with messages specifically relevant to them, and it enables users to tell you what they actually care about and want more of.      In this seven week course, students will learn about data collection and analysis in the digital age, as well as determine how and why to develop strategies for both online and offline media based upon data. Taught by Blue State Digital's Sarah Newhall (Executive Vice President and former Director of Analytics), this course will explore the increasing importance of digital data, as well as dive into why on earth, in the post-Obama election world, people get so excited about big data, smart data, and fast data.       This two-credit course will meet the first six weeks of the semester.                              Circuit Design and Prototyping (ITPG-GT.2557) - Michelle Temple            Offered: Spring 2014, Fall 2014         This two credit course is designed to teach students the design and fabrication of through-hole and surface mount printed circuit boards. Taking control over the design and fabrication of your circuit can take a project to a whole new level. Students learn to design circuits to optimize the form factor of their projects using EagleCAD, the software used for the mass production of printed circuit boards in engineering standards. The course demonstrates best practices soldering techniques, acid etching, and 3D milling. Students will learn to read and produce schematic diagrams, source components and time manage a prototyping process in order to produce a robust project ready to be reproduced. This course is extremely hands-on and includes weekly assignments, lectures, demos and labs.      This two-credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester.          Citizen Cyberscience (ITPG-GT.2939) - Francois Grey            Offered: Fall 2012         What does it mean to be a scientist? For much of the 20th century, the answer to this question was a man in a white lab coat with a Ph.D. and crazy hair. Amateur scientists existed, but with a few notable exceptions in fields like astronomy and archaeology, they had little chance to make a contribution to cutting-edge research.      In the past decade, the Internet has begun to disrupt this model of professional science. Citizens can now make real contributions to cutting-edge science projects that involve studying everything from pulsars to proteins, using their PCs, laptops or mobile phones. This is a trend called citizen cyberscience.      This course introduces a variety of ways to do citizen cyberscience, including volunteer computing, volunteer thinking and volunteer sensing. It explores the contributions and the motivations of the volunteers who participate in such projects, as well as the sort of scientific and social impact that these projects are having. During the course, the goal for the students is to design and implement a citizen cyberscience project, in collaboration with scientists in several departments at NYU.        NYU has just announced plans to create a Centre for Urban Science and Progress \u2013 the sort of science that impacts every citizen. To highlight this, the course will feature a number of guest speakers and offer a set of projects on the theme of 'urban science meets citizen science'. Topics will range from analyzing the city's traffic data to monitoring the demographics of local elections to studying the genetic makeup of bugs in your own home.                       Course Syllabus            Cloudcommuting: Rethinking Point-to-point Urban Mobility Systems (ITPG-GT.2621) - Dimitris Papanikolaou            Offered: Fall 2014         This course introduces the theory, underlying technologies, and operational challenges of intelligent mobility on demand (MoD) systems, using NYC City Bike sharing program as a living laboratory.      MoD systems utilize networks of parking stations and shared fleets of vehicles (bikes, scooters, automobiles) allowing users to make point-to-point trips on demand. Today, more than 650 bike sharing systems around the world mobilize 3 million trips every day while at least 200 additional systems are planned. Despite their seeming convenience and advanced technology, asymmetric trip patterns cause many stations to temporarily deplete from bikes while others from parking spaces decreasing reliability and level of service in the system. Operators spend their entire usage revenues paying gas, trucks, and workers to manually move bikes from full to empty stations. Yet, level of service is often low. In Paris 48% of users find no bikes and 58% of users find no parking spaces available. In Barcelona, 50% of the stations are either empty or full during 30% of the time.      In this course we will explore how information technology, social mechanism design, and game theory can be used to design the next generation of intelligent self-organizing MoD systems that motivate their own users to rebalance the fleet using price incentives. The course will combine lectures, readings, technical skill workshops, and a hands-on experimental project in a collaborative studio environment.            The course will consist of two parts / thematic areas:      In the first half of the course, students will learn how to use real-time web scraping, data visualization, and advanced simulation methods (system dynamics and multi-agent models) to study NYC City Bike program in real time. Working with Processing and D3 programming languages as well as with Vensim and NetLogo simulation packages, students will explore how trip patterns and truck redistribution methods affect sustainability and performance of the system. During mid-term reviews, student teams will present a comprehensive analysis of NYC City Bike and present proposals for their final projects.      In the second half of the course, students will learn how social mechanism design, game theory, information technology, and interaction design can be used to develop crowd-intelligence, self-organization and sustainability in resource allocation networks. For their final projects, students will design and study an intelligent self-organizing vehicle sharing system in which rebalancing is done by self-interested opportunistic users rather than operators. Suggested directions for final projects include:      1) Life game experiment using NYC City Bike as a living laboratory. For this option, students will design and conduct a controlled urban life experiment using mobile devices and the Internet to test how price incentives, time constraints, and substitute transportation options in NYC, affect decision-making of commuters.      2) Interactive strategic game. For this option, students will collaboratively design and prototype an interactive strategic game/installation using sensors, Arduino microcontrollers, and communication networks, and interaction design to study decision-making of players and equilibrium of the game.      In both options, students will develop computer simulation models that replicate the idealized behavior of their game experiments and compare the results from simulation and reality.         Course topics, structure, and learning outcomes   The course will combine lectures, guest talks from industry and academia experts, readings, and weekly assignments that aim to complement final projects. Students will study topics on information and communication technology, interaction design, data visualization, game theory, behavioral economics, social mechanism design (reverse game theory), ecology, social networks, and systems theory. By the end of the course students will have a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in urban intelligence. Furthermore, they will understand how intelligent mobility on demand systems can be designed and engineered, both from their technical and from their operational aspects.                               Coding for Emotional Impact (ITPG-GT.2559) - Mimi Yin            Offered: Spring 2014         Coming out of nowhere. Monotonous drone. Running out of steam. Pregnant pause. Unbearable build up in tension. Gratifying resolution. We use these phrases all the time to describe music and film, animation and dialogue. What are we actually talking about? Narrative and emotional arc and its more abstract cousin, composition.      In this class, we will look at how to use simple computational strategies to compose patterns of events capable of producing emotional impact. To compose computationally is to abstract emotion into numbers and ratios so that we can figure out, for instance, that in order to achieve \"shock\", a pattern needs to be established for a certain number of seconds before it can be interrupted, and that interruption needs to be 3 times as \"big\" as what came before.      The class is agnostic to medium. You can work with graphics, sound, kinetic sculpture or stories.      The course is as much an exercise in cultivating personal sensitivity to the emotional power of patterns as it is a class in how to write code to generate such patterns. We will devote as much time to collecting and analyzing compelling examples of narrative and composition from visual art and music to storytelling as we do to writing coding. Projects will alternate between structured programming exercises and more creative assignments applying newly learned techniques to the medium of your choice.      Prerequisites: ICM or equivalent.           Course Syllabus            Collective Narrative (ITPG-GT.2960) - Marianne Petit            Offered: Spring 2013         This two-point workshop is centered on the examination and creation of collective storytelling environments. We will examine a wide-range of storytelling spaces including participatory and user-generated environments, site-specific works, community based arts practices, and transmedia storytelling. Weekly assignments, field trips, and student presentations. This course will meet for the first seven weeks of the semester.                      Course Syllabus            Collective Storytelling (ITPG-GT.2706) - Marianne Petit            Offered: Spring 2012         This two-point workshop is centered on the examination and creation of collective storytelling environments. We will examine a wide-range of storytelling spaces including participatory and user-generated environments, site-specific works, community based arts practices, and transmedia storytelling. Weekly assignments, field trips, and student presentations. This course will meet for the first seven weeks of the semester.        Course Syllabus            Comics (ITPG-GT.2925) - Tracy White            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013, Spring 2014         Comics are more than a narrative form they are a communication medium. Using words and images to tell a story is a skill that is applicable to almost everything we do. In this class you will learn the language of traditional comics so you can hone your storytelling ability, and clarity of thought. We will breakdown the sequential narrative process into the techniques necessary to develop a compelling tale and look at how the audience and the medium help to shape the final presentation of our ideas. Students work on several projects to build up their skills that will culminate in the creation of a short feature comic written/drawn/programmed by each student that can be based on a previous assignment. This class does not teach specific programs or programming rather this class provides an opportunity for students to thoughtfully and creatively apply their skills toward specific assignments. You do not need to be a trained artist to take this class you do need to be willing to take chances with your work.       This two-credit course will meet in the first seven weeks of the semester.                                                  Course Syllabus            Computation and Fashion (ITPG-GT.2961) - Mary Huang            Offered: Spring 2013         This class is about the intersection of computation, software, and fashion design.   We will explore clothing design and production with digital tools like laser cutting, 3D printing, and scanning as well as traditional clothing construction techniques. The course will investigate unique approaches in materials, user interface, data, and process from Issey Miyake to Nike. Involving concepts from art, manufacturing, and product, the field of fashion and technology presents exciting possibilities for expanding on centuries of craft.   Class structure will be small workshop assignments culminating to a final project.   (Skills in Processing, web development, sewing, or 3D modeling are handy but not required.)              Course Syllabus            Computational Cameras (ITPG-GT.2546) - Daniel O'Sullivan            Offered: Spring 2012         Computers should see. We depend most heavily on light to sense the world. As our experience is increasingly mediated through networked computers, it is not surprising that cameras have become an integral part of them. These camera/computer combinations have become small, cheap and ubiquitous in laptops, cellphones and microcontrollers and have gained coverage of every corner of life. This class looks at the possibilities and the computer software for getting a hold of the signals coming in from these cameras. Unfortunately what is trivial for our vision system is really hard in software. This class attempts to side step these very difficult problem of computer vision by working in fairly contrived environments such as art installations, eye tracking rigs, and ant farms. First the class will cover programming required to process or analyze each pixel of the incoming image for such things as background removal, finding edges, or tracking objects. As a sensor, the video camera is appealing; delivering up to 36 million bytes every second compared to maybe 3 bytes from a keyboard but this volumen of data also presents a nice coding challenge for students. After covering the basics of pixel manipulation, the class will turn to higher level libraries for things like face tracking, multitouch, Wii, Kinect and augmented reality. The course uses Java in the Eclipse environment which is a good next step from the Processing environment. We look at implementing these techniques across platforms, including the desktop, the cellphone and even on a microcontroller. The class requires ICM or similar programming background.            Course Syllabus            Computational Portraiture (ITPG-GT.2625) - James George            Offered: Fall 2014         Ten percent of all photographs ever taken were created in just the last year. How has the ubiquity of cameras changed our culture's relationship to images and altered photography as an artistic medium?   By combining digital imaging, new sensing technology, algorithms, and metadata like geolocation, scientists and artists are discovering ways to synthesize new forms of vision out of vast data sets. Have these processes revealed new ways of seeing? What possibilities await in the near future?      During this 2-point course we will survey recent artworks made with techniques such as photogrammetry, 3D scanning, and computer vision, and research the tools used to create them. Students will have one week to conduct a portrait study using one of the techniques explored.        Spring 2015: This two-credit course will meet on Saturday, March 28, Sunday, March 29, and Friday, April 10 from 12 noon to 5 p.m., and Saturday, April 11 from 12 noon to 2:30 p.m.      Fall 2015: This two-credit course will meet on Saturday, October 3, Sunday, October 4, and Saturday, October 17 from 12 noon to 5 p.m., and Sunday, October 18 from 12 noon to 2:30 p.m.                      Computer Vision with OpenFrameworks (ITPG-GT.2561) - Kyle McDonald            Offered: Spring 2014         \u201cComputer Vision\u201d refers to a broad collection of techniques that allow computers to make intelligent assertions about what's going on in digital images and video. Sometimes this means understanding the difference between an image of someone smiling and frowning, or something as low level as whether there is motion in front of a camera. Participants will be introduced to a brief history of computer vision and its relationship to media arts, but most of the time will be spent learning how to work with computer vision addons for openFrameworks: ofxCv for direct access to OpenCV, ofxKinect and ofxOpenNI for skeleton and depth sensing, and ofxFaceTracker for understanding faces.      Prerequisite: ICM or equivalent. Those students new to openFrameworks should attend an \"Intro to OF\" session with ITP residents in the beginning of the semester.       This one-credit course will meet on Saturday,February 28 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday, March 1 from 12:00 noon to 1:45 p.m.                           Connected Devices and Networked Interaction (ITPG-GT.2565) - Thomas Igoe            Offered: Spring 2014         The World Wide Web no longer stops at the edge of your screen. When it comes to products, if it powers up, it talks to another device. There's an increasing number of appliances coming on the market that feature web interfaces, but do they work well? This class take a hands-on critical look at the emerging market for connected devices, and will present an overview of methods for connecting the physical world to web-based applications. We don't interact with connected appliances in the same way as we do when they're not connected. It's not enough just to bolt a touchscreen on an appliance and call it networked. In this course we'll consider what the emerging interaction patterns are, if any, and we'll develop some of our own as needed.      This class can be seen as a narrower and more interaction design-based complement to Understanding Networks. The latter class provides a broader overview of the dynamics of data networks, while this class focuses specifically on the challenges of connecting embedded devices to web-based services. Neither class is a prerequisite for the other, however.      The class will begin with a review of some existing connected devices on the market, in which we'll critique them as products of interaction design. Then we'll have several short exercises to introduce different tools, and a final hardware and software production project in which students develop a more fully realized networked device.      Prerequisites: Intro to Physical Computing, Comm Lab: Web, and Intro to Computational Media, or equivalent experience with the topics covered in those three classes.                      Connected Documentary (ITPG-GT.2926) - Ben Moskowitz            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013         The term \"documentary\" was coined by John Grierson, father of the documentary film, as the \"creative treatment of actuality.\" The web opens up massive potential for completely new kinds of documentaries: films that constantly update themselves with breaking information, are shaped by users, or are made more persuasive through personalization.      In this course, you'll conceive, shoot, and code a short-form, connected documentary of your own. We'll be using the popcorn.js web video library to link and incorporate data from open APis, Facebook, and the wider web. You don't need to be a filmmaker or a developer, strictly speaking\u2014just creative, bold, and interested in formal innovation.         This two credit course meets for the first seven weeks of the semester.                       Course Syllabus            Constructing Generative Systems (ITPG-GT.2534) - Todd Holoubek            Offered: Spring 2012         Generative Art creates a process of evolution, where most art imitates life, generative art has a life of it\u2019s own. Artists, designers, architects have use generative methods for creating many times without knowing. How is it that we can create something that resonates with the user on a level that cannot be quanti\ufb01ed. It is by providing the work with the means to have a life of it own. These are the generative methods. Techniques that are subtle, yet have the greatest effect: simple rules that dictate the shape or function of a work adding to it an inherent complexity that is both beautiful and intelligent. In this class we will cover the generative methods and use them as tools for creating.     Course Syllabus            Conversation, Cooperation, Collaboration (ITPG-GT.2515) - Clay Shirky            Offered: Fall 2013         People work and play in groups, so anything that changes the way groups form or interact will change the way people work and play. In the last decade, the social aspects of networked devices have moved from being regarded as an interesting side-effect to being one of the core design issues of the present era. The importance of shared online effort, from github and StackOverflow to Google Hangout and 4chan, is allowing us to re-think how and when people converse, cooperate, and collaborate.      In this seminar, we will study what makes the design of software for group use special, and hard. The work of the class is a series of readings about social design problems generally (Prisoner's Dilemma, Tragedy of the Commons), alongside class discussion of interesting social spaces (github, Omegle, Branch, Discourse, Weird Twitter). You will examine existing social spaces and present your findings to the class, imagining how you might improve or degrade the social aspects of those sites. The final project will be a design proposal for a novel social space or service, or for a significant alteration of an existing one.                Cooking With Sound (ITPG-GT.2940) - T3db0t Hayes            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2013         What is it about the propagation of compressed air waves that gives rise to such a vast panoply of history, culture, ideas and artworks? What exactly does sound consist of, and how can we use (and abuse) it? Utilizing sound in our projects is a lot like cooking: we find and make ingredients, manipulate them, mix them together, bake at 400\u00ba, serve. Cooking With Sound explores the phenomenon of sound from the ground up, investigates its history, practice and potential as a medium for art, communication, and pleasure, and provides students the skills and knowledge for forming and shaping these potentials. Topics include acoustics and the physics of sound (and how a single vibrating string gives rise to music theories around the world), the digitization of sound (and how you can do it yourself with a handful of resistors), sound as art medium and its interpretation and criticism, and the many various tools and techniques for wielding this ephemeral yet eternal wonder.                       Course Syllabus            Crafting Mindful Experience (ITPG-GT.2627) - Frederick Muench            Offered: Fall 2014         Over the last 10 years our sustained attention and gratitude have decreased while perceived stress, social and material comparison and entitlement have increased. There have been numerous attempts to build technologies that enhance our mindful awareness and wellbeing but few have gained the traction expected based on the scope of the problem.   The goals of this course are to understand underpinnings of stress and wellbeing, methods used to improve wellbeing, and ingredients of affective computing systems and behavior change paradigms. Based on this foundation, we will perform in-depth reviews of existing services, products and applications, practice various forms of meditation, and you will design systems that foster positive experiences, mindful awareness, meditative and embodied states, physiological balance, etc. The projects you develop will be based on your personal goals and needs and you can use any medium of delivery (e.g. device, application, video, performance). The emphasis in this class is on theory and creatively tackling new methods to foster a higher state of internal harmony and wellbeing.   The class will meet for the first 7 weeks of the semester.   Week 1 - What is the problem? Practice: Universality   Week 2 - What is meditation and mindfulness? What are the physiological & neurological mechanisms of the different forms of practice? Practice: Mindfulness Meditation.   Week 3 \u2013Review: Traditional and Alternative methods of practice. Week 3 Practice: Cognitive Reframing.   Week 4 \u2013Review: Technology based solutions. Week 4 Practice: Breath Retraining.   Week 5 \u2013What are the ingredients of happiness and successful behavior change? Practice: Compassion and Gratitude.   Week 6 \u2013How can we engineer our external world to foster internal wellbeing? Practice: Reshaping our Environment.   Week 7 \u2013Present Final Projects. Practice: Class Guided        This two credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester.                      Creative Computing/Interactions Lab (ITPG-GT.1000) - Daniel O'Sullivan            Offered: Spring 2014         What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your computational project ideas whether they be in the domain of art, design, humanities, sciences or engineering will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This course will begin with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we experience our physical environment. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard & monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions & objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision. The Java-based \u2018Processing\u2019 programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor & actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and make lots of friends by helping the other students.          Note: Undergraduate students should register for either of the combined sections ITPG-UT 1000-001 (7746) or ITPG-UT 1000-002 (7747).                                                                                                                                           Course Syllabus            Creative Javascript (ITPG-GT.2567) - Lauren McCarthy, Daniel Shiffman            Offered: Spring 2014, Fall 2014         How do the tools and platforms we work with shape the things we create? How do creative and computational ideas transform across media, and what does it mean to create for the internet? Using a new Processing library for the web, students will learn the basics of the JavaScript language and explore interactive media online.      In addition to canvas graphics, the course will also cover HTML5 and DOM manipulation, working with APIs, data and JSON, interactivity across a range of devices, and the integration and use of other JS libraries. Strategies for code organization and structure, sharing and documentation, and version control (github) will also be discussed.      This is a beginner level class, though students should have taken Introduction to Computational Media or have similar experience.                   This two-credit course will meet the last seven weeks of the semester.                   Creative Writing Workshop (ITPG-GT.2613) - Nancy Hechinger            Offered: Spring 2014         This class is for students working on a story for a project in another class or who just want to write playfully each week. Each week there will be in-class writing exercises, group readings and critique.       This one-credit course will meet for 1.25 hours a week in the first seven weeks of the semester.              Culinary Physics (ITPG-GT.2569) - Staff            Offered: Spring 2014         This studio and seminar course explores the basic principles of food biochemistry, enzymology and food processing and how they relate to memory, the senses and the processing of information. Students will also learn basic principles of molecular gastronomy and modernist cuisine as framing devices for understanding how food also functions in the context of bodily health, environmental health as well as cultural and political narratives. Our food system consists of more than food production and consumption and this class will address how science and food science plays a more integral role in this system and how this knowledge can be mined for work that creatively and functionally contributes to this emerging field. Assignments for the class will be based on the incorporation of food science into design and technology projects that uses food as a substrate to explore and illuminate information within the food system. Workshops involve using liquid nitrogen + hydrocolloids as well as creating performative food objects and a Futurist meal.       Note: This course will meet in the Education Building, 35 West 4th Street, 10th Floor, Room 1080 (Kitchen).                    Course Syllabus            Data (ITPG-GT.2927) - Mark Hansen            Offered: Spring 2012         Far from virtual, inert quantities, data exert real forces in the physical world -- They are incendiaries wielding the power of once-secret diplomatic cables, mores initiated with the flip of a privacy setting, and physical laws shaping urban structures with the quiet, persistent action of zoning regulations. Data are bribes, calls to action, and objects of coordination. Data build. Data destroy. Data renew. Data rarely act in isolation, gaining power through combination, \"join\"ing forces and moving into new terrain. Their presence is thought to guarantee transparency, their absence is seen as suspicious, and restrictions on their movement appear to be temporary, at best. This course will deal in data, its collection, processing and interpretation. It is not meant to be a study in data visualization, per se, although we will spend a lot of time looking at data. We will examine a mix of techniques from the \"data arts and sciences,\" crossing, for example, statistics, computer science and media art. Work for this course might not have a visual component at all, but could instead represent a new way to organize, search or publish data. It might be a novel data collection strategy, a joining mechanism that crosses databases, or even a new statistical model and formal learning procedure. In short, we will examine the idea of data as \"material\" supporiting creative practices. Prerequisites: Introduction to Computational Media or equivalent programming experience. Prior knowledge of statistics or experience with data analysis is not required. Lessons will emphasize R and Python. Note: This two-point class will meet for the last seven weeks of the semester.             Data Art (ITPG-GT.2571) - Jer Thorp            Offered: Spring 2014, Fall 2014         Fascinating and terrifying things are happening at the intersection of data and culture. Our lives are being constantly measured, and information about us is being surveilled, stolen, and commodified. Dialogue around this data revolution has been dominated by corporations, governments, and industry - but what about the arts? In this class, we\u2019ll investigate the means by which artists can engage (and are engaging) in the collection, processing, and representation of data. Using a research-focused, prototype-based approach, we\u2019ll build a series of collective and individual projects to interrogate the \u2018new data reality\u2019. Students will use Processing, along with a variety of open-source data tools (such as D3.js, Miso, OpenRefine, MapBox & CartoDB).                Data Representation (ITPG-GT.2888) - Jer Thorp            Offered: Spring 2012, Fall 2012, Spring 2013, Fall 2013         The world is awash with data. In the last few years, a collision of technologies has allowed us to record massive amounts of information. The question that we are faced with now is: How can we make sense of it? In this course, we explore traditional analysis and visualization techniques, alongside novel strategies and exploratory methods. We build tools to navigate through huge data sets, and will learn how to represent data in visual, audial, and physical form. Students work in Processing to design and build their own unique data representation projects.     Course Syllabus            Data Science Storytelling (ITPG-GT.2517) - Hilary Mason            Offered: Fall 2013         We have access to more data and better and more powerful tools than ever before, and yet high-quality analysis is still largely the domain of professional data scientists. This course will cover those techniques for exploring data, cleaning it, and uncovering and communicating meaningful stories, while understanding concepts like error metrics, bias, and data product development. We'll primarily focus on technical and algorithmic techniques for practically navigating through data to draw interesting conclusions. While data visualization is a tool used in the service of data science, this is not a data visualization design class. Students will work through analyzing a few data sets as a group before selecting a final project where they complete an analysis and   present the resulting story to the class. Students will become familiar with the Python programming language (specifically iPython notebook).      This two-credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester.                                     Data Without Borders: Data Science in the Service of Humanity (ITPG-GT.2941) - Jake Porway            Offered: Fall 2012         We are living in the dawn of the big data era, a time in which the vast digitization of our world has created incalculable amounts of information that is now being used to drive our every decision, from what movie we decide to watch this weekend to how we navigate the globe next year. Though data can be immensely transformative, much of the efforts in data science are still focused on first-world gains, such as optimizing ad networks or recommending restaurants. As designers, developers, and scientists, it is not only incumbent upon us to understand how to analyze, understand, and tell stories with data, but also to think about its use in meaningful and socially conscious ways. This class will train students in the basic tools and trade of data science through exploration of a socially conscious data project. Students will learn to scrape, merge, and clean data with Python, perform statistical analysis and use machine learning algorithms in R, and visualize and explore data with R and D3. In addition to training students as junior data scientists, we will discuss the important social issues around data provenance, privacy, and the responsibility that comes with making claims from data.                                Design Expo (ITPG-GT.2274) - Clay Shirky, Liesje Hodgson            Offered: Spring 2013, Spring 2014         Design Expo is a collaborative design class. Students work in groups to understand and then respond to a design challenge, posed by Microsoft Research (MSR), and then present their work for feedback and iteration. Past design challenges have included imagining tools or services for new infrastructure, such as ubiquitous connectivity or highly available data. Other challenges have involved particular design domains, such as health care. This year's theme will be announced in late November.      Students work in a small group (3-5 people) to research the proposed challenge, propose possible innovations or solutions, then iterate those proposals. A successful proposal can be a demo (\"We've imagined a new possibility, and this is what it would look like\") or a prototype (\"We've imagined a new possibility, and we built a small version of it.\") At the end of the course, one group will be selected by outside reviewers to travel to Redmond, WA in July to present their proposal at MSR's Faculty Research Summit.             Design for Climate Change (ITPG-GT.2629) - Yasser Ansari            Offered: Fall 2014          Earth's average temperature will continue to increase, and will dramatically change your daily life. Not only will this lead to more frequent and intense extreme heat events, but rising temperatures will also influence patterns and amounts of precipitation, reduce ice and snow cover, raise sea levels, and increase the acidity of the oceans. These changes will impact our food supply, water resources, infrastructure, ecosystems, and our health.      What can we design and invent to prepare ourselves for the future we are marching towards? How will we adjust our lifestyles and our communities to deal with climate change? Will our ideas be only responsive, or also preemptive? How do economics and the specifics of locale factor in? What instances of these changes are we already dealing with today?      In the first few weeks of the semester, we will imagine a future based on realistic climate scenarios. Over the next few weeks, we will live in that future and attempt to experience it together. The second half of the semester will be focused entirely on designing for that future. Students will work in small groups during each phase of the class and final projects are expected to be delivered as detailed design concepts or functioning prototypes.                          Design for Editions (ITPG-GT.2519) - Thomas Gerhardt            Offered: Fall 2013         How do you take a project made at ITP and turn it into a product? From electronics projects on Kickstarter to bespoke leather goods and bike hardware, all successful products have one thing in common, they can be made reliably over and over again at high quality. In this class, 'Design for Editions' we will explore issues surrounding creating art and design objects so that they can be made more than once, by someone other than their creator; be that a limited edition of 10 or a full production run of 10,000.      In two week segments we will look at: what is repeatability, designing for repeatability, creating process, specification/quotes, and quality control. In each segment students will produce a mini project focused on the current topic, look at examples of real world creators, and present their work to outside critics. The class will host guest lecturers and go on studio/factory visits in the NYC/Brooklyn area.      The last six weeks of the class will be devoted to a final project whose outcome will be a fully specified product ready for production. Possible final projects could run the gamut from high-end design objects to art installations or custom electronics modules. Students are encouraged to bring in-process or past projects to develop further over the corse of the class.                Design for the Real World: Women in Haiti (ITPG-GT.2962) - Despina Papadopoulos            Offered: Spring 2013         Design For the Real World: Principled Design for We Advance University      This class give students an opportunity to work as a design and development team on a real project to develop an online community to bring information and resources to women in Haiti. Design principles and methodology will be learned within the context of this work. The project, already underway, is an online portal that seeks to address the needs of Haitian women and create a platform for empowerment and knowledge sharing.      Students will develop innovative prototypes around:   Content: educational and entertainment, listing of resources, emergency alerts, marketplace   Delivery: best practices for open source platforms, text messaging, online radio, mobile theater, scalable model that can be applied to other countries   Engagement: strategies for attracting users, creating partnerships, spreading the word      The project is in an early stage and students will have the opportunity to significantly contribute and shape its direction and overall structure.      By the end of the term students will present solutions to the 'client', that is the primary stakeholders of We Advance University: led by the NGO We Advance (http://weadvance.org/) and Femme en Democratie (http://fed.org.ht/) with support from the State Department.                          Course Syllabus            Design for UNICEF (ITPG-GT.2758) - Jorge Just            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2013         UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund; http://unicef.org) takes on issues affecting the health, well-being, and opportunities of children and youth around the world. UNICEF's reach is wide -- it is the #1 purchaser of pencils, procures a billion dollars of vaccine a year and, in 2010, responded to emergencies in half of all nations. An increasingly important part of its mission is finding creative ways to address issues that negatively affect young lives. Design for UNICEF will focus on a relevant topic, such as disaster relief, nutrition, or the lives of adolescent girls. You will work in groups to research and design new tools and innovative extensions to existing efforts related to the topic. Your projects can use high or low/no technology and take the form of mock-ups/design proposals, or working prototypes. At the end of the semester, you'll present your work at UNICEF HQ to staff and invited guests. This class is all about rapid iteration and refinement, proposing and rejecting ideas, lots of collaboration, and coming to terms with the difficult and frustrating challenges of designing for people who are far away, facing problems that are very big.                             Course Syllabus            Designing Conversational Spaces (ITPG-GT.2889) - Clay Shirky            Offered: Spring 2012, Fall 2012         The Design of Conversational Spaces starts with the observation that conversation is everywhere online, but that its quality ranges from excellent to execrable. The negative end of that scale is astonishingly bad \u2013 moronic rants, off-topic rambles, vitriolic attacks. (\u201cdude just stfu nobody watches ur videos just gtfo out of you tube oh no were hurting his little feelings i feel soo bad\u201d.) It's enough to make you wish for the enforced public silence of 20th century media. Yet not all online speech suffers this fate; many sites manage to host not just civil but productive conversations, from the talk pages on Wikipedia to the design conversations on github to political debate on Comment is Free. Programmers have contentious but respectful conversations on StackOverflow and #winprog; crafters on Etsy and Ravelry; mathematicians on Polymath; pop artists on DeviantArt. This class is about the design of environments that support or encourage good conversation. We explore what makes comments on YouTube so bad, and on Ravelry so good, a bundle of differences that includes the scale of the audience, the commitment of the participants to each other and to shared enterprise, and the willingness and ability of the participants police violations. The class is designed to explore three forces that affect online conversation: Forces that set conversational context (scale, homophily, identity) Forces that guide conversations (visual and verbal cues, social rules) Forces that restrict conversations (membership, karma, moderation) These will be your toolkit for thinking about conversational design. The goal of the course is to sketch out a \"pattern language\" for the kinds of choices designers make when creating conversational or interactive interfaces or tools, and to understand the inevitable tradeoffs involved.              Course Syllabus            Designing for Digital Fabrication (ITPG-GT.2890) - Daniel Rozin, Benjamin Light            Offered: Spring 2012, Fall 2012, Spring 2013, Fall 2014         The ability to digitally fabricate parts and whole pieces directly from our computers or design files used to be an exotic and expensive option not really suitable for student or designer projects, but changes in this field in the past 5 years have brought these capabilities much closer to our means, especially as ITP students. ITP and NYU now offer us access to laser cutting, CNC routing, and 3D stereolithography. In this class we will learn how to design for and operate these machines. Emphasis will be put on designing functional parts that can fit into a larger project or support other components as well as being successful on a conceptual and aesthetic level. In this class we will discover methods to design projects on CAD applications for total control of the result, and we will develop algorithmic ways to create designs from software (Processing) to take advantage of the ability to make parts and projects that are unique, customizable, dependent on external data or random. The class will include 3 assignments to create projects using the three machines (laser, router, 3D) and the opportunity to work on a final project.                    Course Syllabus            Designing for Live Performance (ITPG-GT.2521) - Andrew Lazarow            Offered: Fall 2013, Fall 2014         For centuries, great works of music, theater, and dance, have combined art and science to make integrated performances that move audiences. Today, we are seeing exciting changes as artists experiment with video and real-time interactivity to draw audiences even deeper into the performance, and enhance the shared experience of the moment. This class explores conceptual approaches to design, industry-standard software, prototyping frameworks, and data flow programming to provide student designers with the cutting-edge tools necessary to confidently collaborate with writers, directors, and performers. Structured as a studio course, students will make designs for contemporary performance pieces, and collaborate with working artists to design original projects.              Course Syllabus            Designing Meaningful Interactions (ITPG-GT.2275) - Katherine Dillon            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013, Spring 2014         This class will focus on how to create interfaces that get people to take the action you intended them to take and how to make that interaction a compelling experience. We will look at a wide range of examples of interaction design and explore different approaches to solving user experience problems across a number of platforms and at a wide range of scales. The class format will include lecture, student presentations, class discussion in-class design exercises and some guest lectures. The class will be very hands-on with assignments each week that focus on a particular aspect of user experience design including research, wire-framing, rapid prototyping, critique and user testing. Tools will include pen and paper, models and digital tools. Students will be active participants in the class and all assignments will be discussed and reviewed in class. Students should come to every class with a computer and sketchbook.                                       Course Syllabus            Designing Social Platforms (ITPG-GT.2922) - John Kuiphoff            Offered: Summer2 2012, Summer1 2013, Summer2 2014         Most social media platforms follow a similar recipe. A user signs up, creates a profile, contributes / shares content, posts comments, builds a reputation, etc. What makes each social media platform unique is the object of conversation, the intended purpose and the participatory culture that arises from its use. In this course, we will learn how to design and develop a fully functional social media platform using HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP and MySQL. An emphasis will be placed on creating applications that operate both on desktop computers and mobile devices. In addition, topics related to information architecture, interface design, cloud computing and leveraging existing web services will be discussed. Previous programming experience is helpful, but not required.               Course Syllabus            Developing Assistive Technology (in Steinhardt) (ITPG-GT.2900) - Anita Perr, Christina Leece            Offered: Spring 2014         This multi-disciplinary course allows students from a variety of backgrounds to work together to learn about and develop assistive technology. Partnering with outside organizations, students will work in teams to identify a clinical need relevant to a certain clinical site or client population, and learn the process of developing an idea and following that through to the development of a prototype product.      Prerequisites (for ITP students): Intro to Computational Media and Intro to Physical Computing.      Note: this is a 3.0 credit course in the Steinhardt School of Education.                                                                                      Digital Imaging: Reset (ITPG-GT.2550) - Eric Rosenthal            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2013, Fall 2014         Digital cameras and printers are making photography more ubiquitous and more useful than ever. This course is a workshop that looks at changing the rules for capturing and printing digital imagery. By gaining a better understanding of the engineering fundamentals and limitations of digital photography, students can produce breathtaking images with all the benefits of digital media but with an image quality that rivals film. Students experiment using low cost, hands-on tips and tricks in software and hardware to capture high dynamic range, expanded color, night color, 3D, time lapse, and stop motion images using a digital camera and printer. While using mostly off-the-shelf tools, these experiments require students to dig down to see the nitty-gritty of today's and tomorrow's technologies for digitally sensing, encoding, compressing, transmitting and displaying images.                                            Course Syllabus            Digital Spaces: Imagining Worlds in Realtime 3D (ITPG-GT.2963) - Tabor Robak, Aaron Meyers            Offered: Spring 2013         In this course we\u2019ll explore Realtime 3D as a medium for artistic expression and develop our own interactive experiences that take place in virtual spaces. We\u2019ll critically survey a broad selection of Realtime 3D works, from traditional video games to more experimental interactive experiences. To create our own worlds, we\u2019ll be using Unity3D, a free full-featured 3D game engine.   For the first half of class, a series of weekly exercises will introduce different topics in Unity including 3D models, textures, shaders, lighting and animation. We\u2019ll be writing code in C#, Unity\u2019s preferred language, but students may choose to use JavaScript as well. For the second half, students will work on a larger final project that conveys some kind of narrative through interactions in a virtual space. Group collaborations are encouraged.   Students are encouraged to adapt source material from a broad range of sources. We\u2019ll look at off-the-shelf motion capture animation from sites light Mixamo, creating models using 3D scanning with a Kinect and middleware solutions from the Unity Asset Store.              Course Syllabus            Disruption and the Maker Movement (ITPG-GT.2971) - Art Kleiner, Thomas Igoe            Offered: Spring 2013         In the past few years, hands-on learning and do-it-yourself making have taken off in electronics and fabrication of soft and hard goods. This represents a new case of a perennial enterprise dynamic: Disruption. That's what happens when an established industry is confronted by a new technological way of doing things, and all habits, business models, and attitudes must change.      In this case, the established industry that is being disrupted is.... industry itself. The driving forces behind this sweeping change include increasing sophistication, ease-of-use, and accessibility of digital fabrication software and hardware tools; the lowering of costs of components and raw materials; the rise of wages around the world, making outsourcing a less viable alternative; affordable overnight and short-term shipping; information sharing on the internet; and an ecological imperative that encourages a more effective use of materials and energy.      Advocates of the maker movement are bullish on its potential for changing the way all industry operates -- including the way we design, make, sell, and distribute things, and even the way we learn about industrial production. On one level, this disruption seems inevitable and predetermined. However, the speed, breadth, and impact of this change are all uncertain. We have seen many highly viable technologies have little or no impact; and some have changed every aspect of the world. Will digital fabrication be the next search engine, or the next Segway?      The aim of this class is to examine the potential size and impact of the maker movement and to consider the unexamined consequences of it. In assignments and discussion, students will articulate what the movement means to individuals, where it may lead industry and institutions, and how it could affect the fabric of industry. In the process, we will study existing knowledge about the dynamics of disruption, the cultural changes involved with changing technology, and the relationship between dynamic manufacturing and conventional manufacturing processes. Then we'll check our assumptions with research about the current reality of the movement.      This will be a discussion and research class. In-class discussions will be fed by assigned readings, students' research and interviews, and possibly invited guests. Final projects can include in-depth reports explaining the subjects at hand; well-researched scenarios about the possible directions this might take; or designs for methods, or practices or tools related to the subject at hand.                                   Course Syllabus            DIY Health (ITPG-GT.2908) - Steven Dean            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2013         Traditional medical care focuses on fixing sickness but doesn't do a very good job of helping prevent it. Self-care solutions that help us take better care of ourselves have the potential to improve our health and well-being, and may keep us from experiencing the consequences of chronic disease, or even reversing it. The sensor and self-tracking revolution is changing our understanding of data and ourselves. We need new systems that collect, understand and interpret this data to help us know ourselves better and make better choices in light of that knowledge. How might we design a self-care system that engages us in our own monitoring, goal setting, experimenting, reflecting and understanding as it relates to our bodies, minds, emotions, relationships and environment? Since self-care applies to all of us, you will focus inwardly on your own needs and situations. The goal of the course is to design a self-care system that helps us take stock of ourselves by exploring ways to measure, reflect and act upon our health and lifestyle. We make interactive interfaces, visualizations and feedback systems that use existing technologies and methods to support our health and well-being. Students employ design techniques to develop problem statements, generate concepts, prototype, and then test and refine your solutions to evolve them into high-fidelity prototypes that use sketches, scenarios, videos and user journeys to convey the complete user experience. The emphasis is on the lightest weight prototype, which works through the solution over actual implementations in software and hardware. Significant portions of class time are set aside for teamwork, designing and critique.                                Course Syllabus            DNA, Genes and Genomes (ITPG-GT.2919) - Yasser Ansari            Offered: Fall 2012         Beginning with Gregor Mendel's masterful study of inheritable traits in pea plants and the groundbreaking discovery of the three-dimensional structure of DNA, this class sets out to uncover the biological mechanisms at play and the specialized equipment and protocols being used in today's laboratories, studios, and garages. The emerging biohacking and DIY Bio movements of today are heavily built on scientific breakthroughs that have occurred only recently. Over the course of the semester, we will study the principles underlying many of these key breakthroughs like the development of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), the generation of the first recombinant DNA molecules (genetic engineering), and the rise of shotgun genome sequencing (DNA sequencing) all in an effort to better understand modern biology -- from DNA to genes to genomes. Class work will include individual exercises, in-class labs (Bacterial transformations using E. Coli and Green Fluorescent Protein for example), assigned readings, and group presentations. Additionally, students will be asked to develop their own projects inspired by the concepts covered. The ultimate goal of this class is to equip students with enough knowledge and skill to explore biologically driven concepts and projects with confidence. Although topics from molecular biology will be covered, no previous knowledge is required.      Course Syllabus            Drawing on Everything (ITPG-GT.2964) - Shantell Martin            Offered: Spring 2013, Spring 2014         The objective of this course is to explore analog and digital drawing not only as a static exercise, but also as a tool for performance installation and collaboration. The course will explore different methods for expression and capturing output. Examples include drawing under camcorders, digital projection, digital drawing software, and simple code platforms. Students will gain the skill and confidence to draw in real time using a variety of different mediums, improve their improvising skills, and learn to perform without delay.                                       Course Syllabus            Drawing without Ego (ITPG-GT.2406) - William Sullivan            Offered: Spring 2012, Fall 2012         Drawing is often the beginning of relaying an idea. It constitutes the most intimate form of making and is the testing ground for new thoughts. \u201cDrawing without ego\u201d means letting go of fears of what you think drawing should be, and just letting it happen \u2013 feeling comfortable enough to use drawing as an alphabet to build thoughts visually, like language is built from letters. The course encourages the student to experiment and develop a visual idea, more than to create finished work. Assignments include sketching out proposals for new work \u2013 storyboarding, etc. \u2013 building a visual vocabulary through various forms of improvisation, as well as the more conventional practice of drawing from the model and still life. Students bring their knowledge of interactive telecommunications to drawing and find ways to let drawing enter into their design work. In this introductory drawing class students are urged to draw anything they want, exploring the freedom of expression that comes from playing with one's imagination and memory and creating convincing imagery with or without references. The class will have informal critiques, and will visit galleries to look at contemporary art. Weekly assignments are required.      This two-credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester.                                          Course Syllabus            Dynamic Web (Server) (ITPG-GT.2577) - Cory Forsyth, Michael Dory            Offered: Spring 2014         This 7-week, 2 point course will provide a framework for learning how to develop and program web applications. It will focus on server side development using JavaScript, Node.js with the Express framework, and the MongoDB database on cloud based infrastructure. Additional topics will include login and session management, web services and APIs, and will lightly touch on front-end web development. The course will be a mixture of lecture and in-class collaborative coding, with weekly programming and reading homework.      Prerequisites include Comm Lab Web or Comm Lab Networked Media and Introduction to Computational Media.         This two-credit course will meet in the last seven weeks of the semester.              Dynamic Web - Mobile (ITPG-GT.2575) - Colleen Higgins            Offered: Spring 2014         This experimental 7-week, 2 point course will provide a framework for learning how to develop and program web applications and will focus on mobile web development. Rather than the traditional model of in-class lectures, assignments, projects, and office hours, this course will heavily leverage existing online and offline resources (videos, articles, interactive tutorials, online courses, books, and more) with class time fully devoted to group and individual help sessions.      This course will be focused on developing and deploying front-end mobile web applications using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Additional focus will be on capabilities suited to the mobile device such as the geolocation, touch interfaces, responsive design, sensor data (gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer), and media capture. Finally, the course will cover using PhoneGap to deploy as a mobile application that can be distributed via Google Play and/or the Apple App Store.      Prerequisites include Comm Lab Web and Introduction to Computational Media.        This two-credit course will meet in the last seven weeks of the semester.                             Dynamic Web Development (ITPG-GT.2296) - John Schimmel            Offered: Spring 2012, Fall 2012, Spring 2013, Fall 2013         If you ever had a need to collect information from users on the web or use external data in your project, understanding web development will make your life much easier. The class will explore interaction between server-side and client-side of web development using Python and JavaScript. On the client-side, we will cover traditional JavaScript and the jQuery library to manipulate browser content, create and trigger page events and make AJAX data requests. Developing with Python on the server-side, we will explore receiving input from a user then querying and saving that data to a database, and finally, returning the appropriate content to the client, i.e. HTML or JSON. The websites we use today are rarely on a single database, we will focus on consuming data APIs from websites like Foursquare (for location information), Facebook (for social graph). Going further, we will create custom data APIs for use at ITP and open to the public. Students must have prior HTML & CSS experience or be willing to learn it outside of class. Introduction to Computational Media or prior object oriented programming knowledge is required.        Course Syllabus            Embodied Play (ITPG-GT.2942) - Phoenix Perry            Offered: Fall 2012         Overview:   How does interactive design create powerful emotional experiences? What are keys to engaging the mind at the affective stage of awareness? As computing becomes more physical, creators have an opportunity to connect with audiences in new ways. Using the body as the canvas for play, we explore tactics for unlocking affective experiences. Delving into the basics of embodied design, students will develop, prototype and test experiences with the primary aim of creating a profound emotional state. Any software/hardware is acceptable for this class as the design principles covered are universal. However, we will be using Processing, Unity, and C# with a wide range of controllers for the example lessons in class. Upon completing the class, students will present a finished piece of work with the aim of creating a specific emotion.      Topics include:   Affective Computing, 3rd Wave HCI, Affective Design, Unity Basics, C#, Gesture Design, Machine Learning & Gesture Training, Kinect, Wii, OpenNI      Technical Experience:   Take this class with a basic understanding of Object Oriented Programming to get the most out of it. However, if you do not have any programming skills, you are welcome to take the class and hand in design prototypes made with paper or other craft supplies until we finish the unity section of the course.                       Course Syllabus            Embodying the Other: Human Beings, Speech, Gesture (ITPG-GT.2730) - Anna Deavere Smith, Nancy Hechinger            Offered: Fall 2012         As humans we know each other through speech and gesture, time spent with each other, shared histories and geographies. But how can we really know another person.It's hard with someone we know well... much less someone who is not at all like us, who is a stranger, whose worldview may be totally different from our own, who may be our enemy. This is a studio class/workshop to engage these questions which have such urgency in the world today. It's about politics, society and art, how we-- as performers, storytellers, interaction designers-- can explore with our conversation, our intelligence, our whole bodies, and creative spirit might work to discover how to embody and feel with the other. This class is a joint offering with Performance Studies and ITP. Eight students from each.      The class is a studio/workshop class. It will meet for 7 sessions on Sundays, 12-6. Dates and place to be determined.                                    Emerging Processes in Video Art (ITPG-GT.2977) - James George            Offered: Spring 2013         Emerging Processes in Video Art is a four point course exploring the application of new technology to video art. The theme \u2018video as data\u2019 will underpin the curriculum - beginning with pixel level video processing and advancing to shaders, computer vision, mobile video, and depth-camera filmmaking. Complimenting the technical curriculum, students will be exposed to history and ongoing dialogue surrounding algorithmic processes in video art and cinema. The course will be taught in openFrameworks, a C++ creative coding platform with extensive video processing capabilities.   During the course students will produce new artistic works, each based on a conceptual prompts and technical constraints.      Course Syllabus            Energy (ITPG-GT.2466) - Jeffrey Feddersen            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013, Spring 2014         \"Energy has been called the \"universal currency\" (Vaclav Smil) but also \"a very subtle concept\u2026 very, very difficult to get right\" (Richard Feynman). Building on skills developed in physical computing, we will, through generating and measuring electricity, gain a more nuanced and quantitative understanding of energy in various forms. We will turn kinetic and solar energy into electrical energy, store that in batteries and capacitors, and use it to power small projects. Several sessions will include hands-on labs. We will develop skills useful in a variety of undertakings, from citizen science to art installations, and address a range of topics through the lens of energy. Students will build a final project using skills learned in the class.\"           Course Syllabus            Evolution as a Creative Tool (ITPG-GT.2523) - Patrick Hebron            Offered: Fall 2013         The natural world demonstrates that the evolutionary process provides an unparalleled mechanism for the design of complex systems. This course will investigate how evolutionary design tools can be incorporated into software without ceding the artist's creative role to pure probability.      This course will look at genetic algorithms, genetic programming and self-organizing systems from two interrelated perspectives: software architecture and user-interface design. On the programming side, we will study key design patterns, data structures and serialization techniques used in implementing these systems. For the design component, the class will function as a collaborative project development studio, working to innovate novel interfaces that harness the power and temper the unpredictability of emergent systems.      This course is intended for experienced programmers. Examples and collaborative work will be written in C++ with Cinder as a supporting application framework.                 Experiments in Digital Economics (ITPG-GT.2579) - Douglas Rushkoff            Offered: Spring 2014         This six-week course will explore and prototype digital money systems, game points, social currency, transactional models, and investing platforms. We will consider the future of work, financial activism, even startup mechanics in our quest to determine if and how the West would move from a growth-based industrial age economy to a sustainable digital economic. What would that even look like?      Does digital technology offer new approaches to economic activity, or will it merely reify those put in place centuries ago for the printing press era? What are the values inherent but generally unrecognized in the economic operating system we use, and who or what do these values foster? What mechanisms for transaction - either in-game or real-world - can we build, and how can we embed them with the biases we choose?      The course will involve lecture, seminar, and readings, followed by prototyping and development of transactional mechanisms by individuals and groups. Readings will vary according to student interest and projects, but will focus on works by Rushkoff, David Graeber, Jaron Lanier, Bernard Lietaer, Adam Smith, Hayek, Charles Eisenstein, Eric Schmidt, and Art Brock.      Students should come to the first class having read Rushkoff's \"Monopoly Moneys,\" available in PDF here: http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/dissertations/2012-0712-200619/rushkoff.pdf - or at least Chapter Four to the end.        This two-credit course will meet six times over the course of the semester on this schedule .                                    Course Syllabus            Face It (ITPG-GT.2525) - Daniel Shiffman            Offered: Fall 2013         In this all day workshop, we will examine the human face. We'll look at the differences between face detection and face recognition as well as demonstrate examples that implement blink detection, smile detection, and tracking the contours of the face. In addition, we'll look at some image processing techniques for face morphing. Examples will be demonstrated in Processing.      This one point course will meet twice. The first day will be an all day workshop looking at code examples that will be held on Saturday, September 28 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Students will then work on a mini-project which they will present the following week on Friday, October 4 from 3:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.                    Fandom (ITPG-GT.2965) - Zoe Fraade-Blanar            Offered: Spring 2013, Spring 2014         Fandom is the study of the communities that form around popular culture, whether based on a shared love of Harley Davidson bikes, PBR Beer, Miley Cyrus, or 3D printing. In design, proper fan management can mean the life or death of a project; well-thought-out interactions can lead to hoards of adoring, evangelical users, and bad interaction can spell shame and embarrassment. From Air Jordans to World of Warcraft, this class explores the influences and motivations that separate fans from mere users. We chart the evolution of fan culture as an important social and economic force, from early 16th century religious manias to its recent rebirth as modern-day geek and nerd culture. Along the way we'll discuss fangroup commercialization, appropriation, monetization, and other techniques available to us as creators to get the most out of them.          Course Syllabus            Farming: Ancient Art Meets Modern World (ITPG-GT.2631) - Britta Riley            Offered: Fall 2014         Connoisseurs of food and wine often ascribe the distinctive flavours of a cheese, fruit, or wine to its terroir. Beyond the chef's touch, they taste traces of the geography, geology, and microclimate of the land where their mouthful first grew.      The landscape of flavor is changing. Each year, the rolling hills of iconic country farms contribute an ever smaller portion to the global food supply. Instead, the plants and animals we eat are moving in with us, into a man-made environment. More than half of tomatoes purchased in North American grocery stores grew on vines under glass, pollinated by indoor bees. Our food is cropping up in the vast tracks of robotically operated equipment, rooftop greenhouses, parking lots, cubicles, and in the very kitchens where we prepare our daily meals.      As we welcome food growing into our modern lives, let's not recoil in fear or lose ourselves in longing for a simpler time, but celebrate the re-emergence of an ancient human art.      Let's evolve the built environment to keep the richness of nature thriving with us. Let's surround ourselves and our crops in a vibrant, lush terroir, that will nurture us in return.      This class will bring students face to face with the fertile design challenges and constraints of urban and indoor agriculture.      Readings, visiting experts, video footage I've recorded at farms around the world, and field trips will introduce students to design factors ranging from the biology of taste, to farm economics, to the psychology of biophilia. Small scale experiments will help students hone the powers of observation essential to innovation in this sweeping cultural movement and emerging field.       This two credit course will meet every other week throughout the semester.                       Field Testing (ITPG-GT.2581) - Kio Stark            Offered: Spring 2014         Crash course in ethnographic field testing      Field testing is the art of finding out how actual humans in a real context use, comprehend, and make meaning out of what you\u2019re developing. The aim is to understand how your project does or doesn\u2019t do and mean what you think it should, to find the things it does and means that you didn\u2019t expect, and adapt it based on these insights. This course gives students an introduction to ethnographic methods, prototyping, and experience developing the observational skills required to do useful, rigorous, holistic field testing. Coursework includes reading, discussion, project testing and writeups of test results. Students are expected to test projects they\u2019re making in other courses, rather than produce new work for the course.       This two-credit course will meet in the last seven weeks of the semester.                                 Flying Robotic Journalism (ITPG-GT.2667) - Ben Moskowitz            Offered: Fall 2014         It used to be that only the wealthy and powerful could put eyes in the sky. Dramatic   aerial images of riots and other uprisings\u2013captured by guerrilla drone journalists,   activists and protestors\u2014suggest a politically transformative leveling of the playing field.   Yet even the cheapest quadcopter can threaten evisceration or fatality, and unmanned   flight is a legal minefield. With all this uncertainty, what are the prospects for drone   journalism in the US and globally?   In this class, learn about the law, technology, and practice of drone journalism. You\u2019ll   meet pioneers of the field, develop conceptual understanding by programming toy   drones, and finally conceive & pilot a modest drone journalism mission.       This two-credit course will meet from the 7th to 12th week of the semester.                          Course Syllabus            Flying Robotic Journalism (4pt) (ITPG-GT.2585) - Ben Moskowitz            Offered: Spring 2014         It used to be that only the rich could put eyes in the sky. But dramatic aerial images of riots, natural disasters and pollution events \u2013captured by citizen journalists using low-cost hardware suggest a politically transformative leveling of the playing field.      Even so, the cheapest quadcopter can still carry the threat of evisceration and fatality. And at least in the U.S., drone journalism is technically illegal\u2014 for now.      Let\u2019s explore the future prospects for drone journalism. In this class, you\u2019ll learn about the law, technology, and practice of drone journalism. You\u2019ll meet the pioneers of the field, gain a conceptual understanding of the space through programming toy drones, and finally conceive and participate in a drone journalism mission.                       Course Syllabus            Flying Robots (ITPG-GT.2966) - Paul Bartlett            Offered: Spring 2013         Flying robots, aka Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones, are growing in number and influence in military use. In parallel, the hobbyist community is developing DIY methods, making flying robots more accessible to more people. What is yet to become common is for these DIY aircraft to carry out visions rather than simply take pictures. This course aims to provide the conceptual and technical foundation for using flying robots for visionary purposes. Here, technology is the tool. The air vehicle is the paintbrush, the poster, the camera; visible to some degree but not the purpose. The first step is to strip down the employment of a flying robot to its essence, as a means to gather information or take action at a distance, using an autonomous agent. The group will discuss and expand the current thinking on feasible, worthy objectives for flying robots, from art to science, from observation to communication, from performance to activism. Throughout the course, these conceptual topics will be a backdrop for hands-on projects using accessible technology.      The projects will investigate:      \u2022 Performing a task with a flying robot   \u2022 Moving information and decision-making   \u2022 Making a craft fly autonomously      The projects will be performed in small teams and will require conceptualization, system design, and mechanical, electrical and coding work. The types of small aircraft could include quadcopters, blimps, planes, or less conventional platforms. Flight controls will be done using the Arduino-based ArduPlane and ArduCopter, or other embedded computing platforms. The online DIY/hobbyist community will be used as a resource. Each week, class will include a brief lecture and discussion followed by demonstration and debugging of projects.     Course Syllabus            From Pixels to Polygons: Coding 3D Worlds (ITPG-GT.2928) - James George            Offered: Spring 2012         This course introduces programming 3D geometry to create images interaction between physical and virtual space. We'll learn how to generate geometry with code, import and control animated models, shader and lighting design, interfacing with hardware and networks, and projection mapping onto physical objects. Emphasis will be placed on the narrative potential of imagining virtual environments and their interaction with physical space. The course will be taught in Unity3d, a powerful, free and industry-standard game production environment. All coding will be done in Javascript. This two-point course will meet in the first seven weeks of the semester.      Course Syllabus            Frugal Innovation (ITPG-GT.2633) - Cate Muther            Offered: Fall 2014         This course gives students conceptual and practical experience in developing ideas, tools, products and processes to augment and improve the lives of the global poor. We will use a variety of resources and methods to explore the emerging field of Frugal Innovation, beginning with an understanding of the context and constraints of living on less than $2.00 a day. Students will learn to identify key principles and challenges of designing for the Bottom of the Pyramid; for example, relentless pursuit of affordability. What are innovative models of using communications technologies to serve an illiterate market?      We will use Case Studies that address real life problems in emerging markets, particularly in healthcare and financial inclusion, where the use and potential of communications technologies is proliferating. Classes will feature cases of actual products or processes developed to solve a problem or meet a perceived need\u2013 some successful and others not. Why? How do we know what success looks like? We will look at metrics, methods and markets to explore the question of measuring impact. Entrepreneurs and field leaders will come to ITP as guests to share their knowledge and experience, and engage with students. Student teams will work on a project to create a frugal innovation for a critical challenge in the lives of the global poor.                 Course Syllabus            Fun Theory (ITPG-GT.2943) - Katherine Dillon            Offered: Fall 2012         This seven-week course will test the premise that making an experience fun will influence positive behavior. This class is inspired by (but not tethered to) thefuntheory.com, an initiative of Volkswagon. We will look at the research related to the psychology of behavior and try to answer the question - is incentive-based design effective? After researching theories on behavior motivation each student will identify a problem or issue that they hope to influence. Students will document the problem, develop a concept to influence the behavior associated with that problem and prototype (or build) their solution. They will test their solution and draw conclusions from the experiment. Projects can attempt to influence social change at a large, social scale or at a personal level. The unifying theme behind the projects will be that they intend to inspire positive change. We will look at examples of persuasive technology and the research of BJ Fogg, Dan Lockton and others.       This two-credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester.                          Future of New Media (ITPG-GT.2297) - Art Kleiner            Offered: Spring 2014         This course explores the next few years in the development of media and related technologies, culture, and geopolitics. It uses scenario planning, a technique for making sense of complex future possibilities. The class works as a large project team, looking ahead 5-10 years. We distinguish predetermined elements from critical uncertainties, identify the underlying patterns that influence events, and come up with a few compelling, plausible stories about possible futures. We present the futures - and the strategies they suggest - to a public audience. The goal of the course is to enable you to make more robust decisions in the face of uncertainty. This is valuable for dealing with technological change, starting a business, plotting a career or making major life decisions. This class has developed a longstanding following at ITP because it helps make sense of the complex world that shapes (and is shaped by) new media.         Course Syllabus            Games and Play in Education (ITPG-GTT-GE 2500) - Frank Migliorelli            Offered: Spring 2012         Introduces theories of learning, learning through play, & the role of technology in education. Students will encounter a wide variety of game genres through critiquing & playtesting current & historic video games. Students will do preliminary game design with history, theory, learning outcomes & learner characteristics in mind. This special edition of this course will focus on designing playful learning exhibits for the New York Hall of Science and is jointly offered by ITP and the Digital Media Design for Learning Program. Introduces theories of learning, learning through play, & the role of technology in education. The course will be co-taught by Frank Migliorelli, ITP alum and DMDL adjunct faculty, and Dr. David Kanter, Director of the Sara Lee Schupf Family Center for Play, Science, and Technology Learning at the New York Hall of Science.      ITP students who wish to take the course for 4 units should contact the Steinhardt School Educational Communication and Technology (EDCT) program at ectdmdl@nyu.edu to add a 1 point independent study (EDCT-GE 2300 section 4).                         Germline: DIY IGM Arts (ITPG-GT.2967) - Adam Zaretsky            Offered: Spring 2013         DIY GERMLINE IGM ARTs encourages students to begin to practice re-design of human heredity through transgenic methods. Intentional Genetically Modified Human Genome Arts questions style and innovation in our genepool through a critical hands-on examination. The class begins by redefining where and how we interface with life, through some of the following hands-on wet laboratories --      1: Bioinformatics :: Literary Studies      2: Bacteriology :: Tranformed Painting      3: Ethology :: Art for All Phylla      4: Body Art :: Developmental Biology      5: Food Science :: Gastronomic Arts      6: Ecology :: Ecoart      In combination, the bioart labs will approximate a Do-It-yourself (DIY) protocol towards artistic Intentional Genetic Modification of the Human Genome (IGM.)      Readings and discussions are directed towards cultural issues such as gene patenting, population diversity, new reproductive technologies and nature/culture boundary issues as they pertain to IGM. The analysis is directed towards the state of present day and near future Post/Trans-Human Engineering. The exploration of the issues and techniques of the study of life will aid and inform our expressive productions. In particular, the ethics of living transgenic humans as art and/or science production will be approached.      Creative bioresearch is a personal expression of explorative experience. This class is for the production of living arts addressing the future of genetically modified humans. The combination of in-depth study and living art commentary should make this an intriguing class for anyone who is generally curious about life in particular. Artists from all mediums, those of the medical arts, sciences and social sciences are all encouraged attend.      On successful completion of this course, you will have had:      \u2022 Conducted independent and original research that uses the tool of life for self expression.      \u2022 Critically evaluated your work and the works of others through non-normative bioethics.      \u2022 Gained an ability to discuss biotechnological issues from first hand non-scientific experience.                Getting Good at Change: Systemic Thinking and Practice (ITPG-GT.2671) - Howard Silverman            Offered: Fall 2014         The promises of innovation, creativity, and design are the promises of change. But how can you know if the promises are real? What does it mean to \u201cget good at change\u201d? In this workshop, we will critically examine theories and practices for purposeful change. We will pay particular attention to relationships between personal and social change, models and methods for evaluating the success of social innovations, and the development of a shared workbook for systemic thinking and practice. No advance preparations are required for this weekend workshop of collaborative learning. Participants must be willing to share experiences and support each other in exploring socially controversial and personally challenging issues. Together, we will consider what it means to be effective.       This one-credit course meets on Saturday, November 8 from 12 noon to 6 p.m. and Sunday, November 9 from 12 noon to 2:45 p.m.                  Course Syllabus            Giant Stories/Tiny Screens (ITPG-GT.2830) - Daniel Liss            Offered: Spring 2012         What kinds of video narratives does the Internet allow or encourage? How does the intimacy of millions of viewers sitting alone at home change the possibilities for public story-telling? What thrives? What fails? And why? And maybe most importantly: what kinds of stories get told, when the financial pressure of needing a vast audience is removed? We explore existing work (including talks with some of the leading makers in the field) and create our own - with a goal of challenging traditional media and crafting the kinds of stories we ourselves would like to see. Part production (a brief overview of camera/editing technique) part studio, this class explores the ways technology can enhance and inspire the creative act. Prerequisite: H79.2004 Communications Lab or equivalent                 Course Syllabus            Glitch (ITPG-GT.2944) - Kyle McDonald, Jeremiah Johnson            Offered: Fall 2012         \"\u2026our control of technology is an illusion, and \u2026 digital tools [are] only as perfect, precise, and efficient as the humans who build them.\" - Kim Cascone      \"If it works, it's obsolete.\" - Marshall McLuhan      How do the tools and media we use affect the work we create? What biases are embedded in the software and data formats we take for granted? In this class we will reverse, invert, and deconstruct prescribed workflows. We'll empower ourselves by digging into the intricacies of different formats. We'll explore the limitations of our tools, and exploit the strange behavior at those limits. We'll also spend a significant amount of time understand the history and theory behind glitch and noise, through enlightening readings, discussion, and exercises.      While this class will cover a variety of low level, technical topics, there are no prerequisites, and there is no single tool, environment, or language that we will focus on. We will instead aim for a more process-oriented approach, and students will be challenged at every level of technical expertise.      This two-credit will meet the first seven weeks of the semester.                                  Governing Dynamics of Software: The Design and Implementation of Programming Languages (ITPG-GT.2587) - Ramsey Nasser            Offered: Spring 2014         \"You won't reach the moon by improving the ladder\" - Brett Victor      To be pragmatic, people build new tools on top of whatever happens to be available at the moment. Processing was built on Java, openFrameworks and Arduino were build on C++ and it all works well enough.      But to be truly expressive with code, we have to discard pragmatism and think very seriously about the tools we use, and the tools our tools are built on. The perspective of this course is that in order for technology to make serious, non-incremental progress, we need more artists thinking about the governing dynamics of it all. We cannot get to where we want by taking what we have for granted and layering on top of it.      This course will guide students through the art and science of designing a programming language. This will include writing parsers, compilers and interpreters as well as discussing and exploring different ways of structuring thought on a machine. Students will also explore the history of code, with particular focus on languages no longer in common use that presented radically different ways of thinking about code. These languages will be discussed, used, and dissected as a source of inspiration and study for the new languages that will be developed in the class.                         Government 3.0: Rethinking Governance and Re-Imagining Democracy for the 21st Century (PADM-GP 2425) - Beth Noveck            Offered: Fall 2013         Joint with Wagner      We live in an era of unprecedented technological innovation with ingenious new advances for achieving clean energy, eradicating disease and providing greater wellness, more equitably and effectively delivering education, and improving the quality of human existence and expression. At the same time, we are experiencing clear deficits within centralized institutions of government and civil society: deficits of agility, innovation and capacity.      These traditional institutions are failing to tap into the diversity of expertise and experience of individuals and communities, rendering us less able to quickly discover, recognize, implement and scale innovative approaches to pressing problems and making it impossible to translate technological innovation into social progress.      Our current system of centralized government institutions is designed for an earlier age of limited, one-way communication. Consider:      Our 18th century model of voting for representatives doesn\u2019t maximize the flow of personal or community preferences from people to government.      Our19th century addition of professional bureaucracy doesn't maximize the flow of expertise, widely distributed in society.   Put another way, we can\u2019t make the best decisions in government on how to improve people\u2019s lives if we limit public participation and feedback to voting every few years. And we can\u2019t adequately take advantage of people\u2019s talents, abilities and desire to play a role in governing if we relegate their service to civic engagement disconnected from the real power, money and decision-making.      Governments appropriate plenty for innovation in society. They fund research grants; invest in broadband infrastructure; support science education. But they spend next to nothing on reinventing government institutions by informing and empowering citizen to participate. There is no other industry, and not one as big as the public sector, that doesn\u2019t regularly improve on its core business model.      New technology has the potential to transform governance and produce a more open and participatory political culture with effective institutions that engender trust.      New technology makes collaborative problem solving possible. In this course, we explore how we might use technology -- from big data to social media -- to redesign our systems of governance to devolve power from centralized, hierarchical institutions and evolve more robust collaboration among individuals, groups and institutions including government and the media.      Through blogging assignments, discussions and a final design project, participants will apply what we learn about innovation to the issues about which they are the most passionate.                               Course Syllabus            Graphics with OpenFrameworks (ITPG-GT.2563) - James George            Offered: Spring 2014         This crash course in computer graphics with openFrameworks will cover everything from pixels to polygons: how to draw with openFrameworks and OpenGL. We will start with simple shapes and colors, move swiftly on to loading and displaying images and pixel manipulation, then end with an introduction to meshes And even get a taste of basic shaders in GLSL.      Prerequisite: ICM or equivalent. Those students new to openFrameworks should attend an \"Intro to OF\" session with ITP residents in the beginning of the semester.       This one-credit course will meet on Saturday, February 15 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday, February 16 from 12:00 noon to 1:45 p.m.                                    Hacking Higher Ed (ITPG-GT.2968) - Daniel O'Sullivan, Clay Shirky            Offered: Spring 2013, Spring 2014         New communications tools offer the opportunity to improve the accessibility, measurability, convenience, and cost of higher education. Doing so, however, means deciding which goals to design for -- Skills transfer? Experiential learning? Personal re-invention? Networking? Certification? -- and how those competing goals should be bundled or unbundled.      This class will ask students to look at ways to reinvent higher education to increase its accessibility and exceed the current quality of the experience. Students will survey current experiments such as University of the People, Khan Academy, Codecademy, Meetups, TED Talks, General Assembly, and hackerspaces. Guest speakers working in this space will join the class discussions.      Students will work individually and in groups to imagine re-designed lectures, discussions, student collaboration, assessment, and certification. The final project will be an education module, of the student's own design and construction, launched to the public for feedback.                 Course Syllabus            Haunted House (ITPG-GT.2635) - Gabe Barcia-Colombo            Offered: Fall 2014         This is a production class in which students work collaboratively to design an immersive interactive haunted house based on one chosen storyline or theme. The overall theme to the event will be decided by students in the first two weeks of the course. Students will then work in pairs to design individual rooms within the house that come to life to scare, bewilder or interact with a viewer. Topics covered include phantasmagoric effects, peppers ghost illusions, microcontroller controlled lighting and sound design, as well as immersive storytelling and interactive theater studies. The final presentation will take place on October 31st as an actual one night immersive performance event. Students are expected to have a basic knowledge of physical computing and audio/video techniques.             HTML5 (ITPG-GT.2892) - Daniel Kantor            Offered: Spring 2012         HTML5, the next generation of the web's programming language, will transform the web from a document-based medium to a fully interactive one. This course will cover everything from the new HTML elements available to new Javascript APIs, as well as new ways to style and display content using CSS3, Canvas and SVG. Each week we will cover a new set of APIs with weekly assignments set to reinforce the concepts learned in class. Later in the semester, we will cover building for the mobile web as well as building browser extensions. Students are encouraged to iteratively build towards a midterm and final project of their choosing. Introduction to Computational Media or equivalent programming experience is required. Students are also expected to have fluency in HTML with prior experience in Javascript and CSS.     Course Syllabus            Ideas Taking Shape: Product Design (ITPG-GT.2945) - Patricia Adler            Offered: Fall 2012         Ideas Taking Shape will explore the language of physical things - how form, materiality, symbolism, and context, express an object\u2019s message.   Henry Ford said, \u201cevery object tells a story, if you know how to read it\u201d.   This course will expand students\u2019 design vocabulary and sensitivity. By raising awareness of design choices made in existing objects, we start to understand their language. Enabling students to express physical computing ideas with more intention and personality. Going beyond simply putting electronic components into a box.      Each class focuses on a different aspect of product design, through lectures, hands-on workshops, and weekly assignments.   Design is an iterative process, we will explore all stages involved in the evolution of expressing a concept as an object. Look at historical and contemporary design practices for style and fabrication context. Study human behaviour and ergonomics, to make informed interaction decisions - for example, how should something you talk into look different from something you touch. We will learn to sketch and prototype for design ideation. Ultimately unifying all learned design semantics into a final project, that engages and clearly communicates its story to an audience.                    Interpretive Exhibition Design: Creating Experience in the Museum Space (ITPG-GT.2894) - David Harvey            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013         Interpretive Exhibition Design is the creative process by which spaces become designed environments in which the visitor is engaged in an orchestrated experience\u2014one which inherently and explicitly imparts meaning and perspective, engages the emotions, may offer contemplation, encourage curiosity and afford discovery and learning. The creation of exhibition experiences in the museum, and alternative spaces, is a growing and fascinating field; one which increasingly draws upon new interactive technologies, and seeks to encourage social dynamics. Understanding the interpretive role of design as a mediator between content and the audience, is helpful in both planning and deciphering underlying messaging and values embedded in any exhibition experience. The interpretive exhibition design process is important in developing a deeper appreciation for and understanding of expression in art, science and the natural world, time and history, society and of ourselves. This course is a hands-on introduction to this kind of exhibit design: the interpretive process of creating experience in the museum space. Professionals from a range of institutions will come to the class to speak or take us on field trips in their institutions to expose the class to a range of experiences within their exhibition environments; relating how and why they are conceived and created. We will take a critical look at how effectively they realized their design intent and imagine other alternative possibilities. The class will form an understanding of the range of the museum-based exhibition experiences, and a deeper understanding of the underlying interpretive exhibition design process. We will bracket this range of experience design with a visit to a commercial exhibition venue and a commercial art gallery. Students will keep a diary of their experiences and observations, and notes on the design process based on each visit, and this will be used as a basis for a midterm presentation. For the final project\u2014deconstructing an exhibition experience\u2014 an exhibition will be chosen as a case study, giving consideration to all the design elements and their role in creating a potentially powerful and unique experience in the museum space. Students will present to a group of guest museum professionals at the American Museum of Natural History .                              Course Syllabus            Interspecies (ITPG-GT.2583) - Marina Zurkow            Offered: Spring 2014         This class mines the many relationships between human and non-human animals, in order to depict, redefine or examine these relations through art and design. Using Donna Haraway's \u201cWhen Species Meet\u201d as a source text, this class explores human/animal connections through art and design works. Students will make two projects that take on animal consciousness, interspecies interactions, and critical areas of concern around species' coexistence. No technical skills are covered in this class, however students are asked to engage with technology in the creation of projects.This work will be accompanied by a survey of media, science and design works made in the context of \"animal critical studies.\"          This two-credit course will meet the last seven weeks of the semester.                                         Course Syllabus            Intro to Dataflow Programming (ITPG-GT.2929) - Hans Steiner            Offered: Spring 2012         Graphical dataflow programming languages like the Max family (Pd, Max/MSP, jMax, etc.) provide an intuitive approach to media programming and manipulation. This paradigm is based on mapping out the flow of the data, which more closely mirrors the experience of realtime media. This course introduces dataflow programming in Pure Data aka Pd: it starts with the basics of the language itself, core control structures and math, storing data and getting it in and out, working with various media formats, and ends with how to organize large projects. The Max paradigm is compared to text-based languages like Processing to develop an idea of their differences and similarities, as well as respective strengths and weaknesses. This course is structured around learning by doing, so students have regular assignments to explore the ideas covered in class, as well as a small final project. This course uses Pd, but it covers core concepts of the Max family, so the knowledge is directly applicable to Max/MSP. This two point course which runs the first seven weeks is designed to be paired with either \"Programmatic Audio\" or \"Boxes And Lines For Rods And Cones\", both offered in the second seven weeks of the semester. This two-point course will meet for the first seven weeks of the semester.                             Course Syllabus            Intro to Fabrication (ITPG-GT.2637) - Benjamin Light            Offered: Fall 2014         Time to get your hands dirty. Prototypes need to be created, motors have to be mounted, enclosures must be built. Understanding how things are fabricated makes you a better maker.      But hardware is hard. You can\u2019t simply copy and paste an object or working device (not yet anyway), fabrication skills and techniques need to be developed and practiced in order to create quality work. You learn to make by doing.      In this class you will become familiar and comfortable with all the ITP shop has to offer. We will cover everything from basic hand tools to the beginnings of digital fabrication. You will learn to use the right tool for the job.      There will be weekly assignments created to develop your fabrication techniques. There will be in class lectures, demos, and building assignments. Emphasis will be put on good design practices, material choice, and craftsmanship.         Section 3 of this two-credit course will meet in the first seven weeks of the semester; section 4 will meet in the last seven weeks of the semester.                                  Introduction to Assistive Technology (ITPG-GT.2969) - Marianne Petit            Offered: Spring 2013         Assistive technology is a general term that includes a wide variety of technologies for people with disabilities. This two-point survey course is designed to provide students with an overview of the field of assistive technology. Field trips, readings, and guest speakers will provide students with an understanding of current research and development as well as processes used in determining appropriate technologies. Weekly assignments and a final research project. This course will meet for the first seven weeks of the semester.                 Course Syllabus            Introduction to Interactive Media (ITPG-GT.1000) - Scott Fitzgerald            Offered: Summer1 2014         What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your computational project ideas will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This six week course is divided in two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body & how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard & monitor interface & at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere & sense & actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog & serial input & output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions & objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision & 3D graphics. The Java-based \u2018Processing\u2019 programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor & actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and make lots of friends by helping the other students.       Undergraduates interested in this course should enrolled in the cross-listed Open Arts section OART-UT 20-001 using the call number 7817 .                           Kinetic Design Workshop-507 Movements (ITPG-GT.2549) - Adi Marom            Offered: Spring 2014         145 years since the publication of one of the ultimate treatises about mechanical movements - Five Hundred and Seven Mechanical Movements by Henry T. Brown, we are going to revisit some of those 507 mechanical movements again, build physical motion models, and explore potential kinetic design implementations. This one point course will meet two times. The first class will be an all day workshop. We will begin by looking at selected movements from the rich pool of 507 movements and exploring their operation. We will then look at models of some of the movements and explore both simple prototyping techniques (using assorted model making materials & Lego kits) and more advanced prototyping techniques (laser-cutting or 3D printing of mechanical components). Next we will have a hands-on workshop in which each student selects a mechanism to prototype.      In the second class students will present their final mechanism prototypes actuated by a motor. We will conclude with a creative brainstorm generating ideas for potential future design implementations of the prototyped mechanisms.                                            Course Syllabus            Kinetic Sculpture Workshop (ITPG-GT.2970) - Daniel Rozin            Offered: Spring 2013         It has been exactly 100 years since Marcel Duchamp created what is considered the first kinetic sculpture (Bicycle Wheel). Over these 100 years artists from all over the world have used almost every conceivable material and technology to create kinetic sculptures that are powered by wind, sun, water, electricity and human power. In the past 25 years digital technology has been added to the chest of tools at the disposal of artists, and kinetic sculptures can now be smart and respond to their surroundings and interact with their viewers or even with people on the internet. Indeed kinetic sculptures can even visualize ever changing datasets on the net. Our way of thinking at ITP as well as the tools we use (physical computing, programming, rapid prototyping, design development, networks) position us at a very interesting intersection, very suitable for creating new forms of kinetic sculpture.      In this workshop students will have an opportunity to work on a few short term projects as well as develop and fabricate a final kinetic sculpture.      The workshop will include readings and research as well as guest presentations.                                 Lean Launchpad (ITPG-GT.2589) - Jennifer van der Meer, Joshua Knowles            Offered: Spring 2014          Lean Launchpad, the experiential course in entrepreneurship, will be offered for credit this Spring at NYU ITP. Based on the Steve Blank\u2019s Lean Launchpad and the NYU Summer Launchpad Accelerator, we are applying the curriculum developed at Stanford and Berkeley for the NYU community. This course has been developed with support from the NYU Entrepreneurship Initiative, and aims at mixing the best of the methods from the Lean Launchpad methodology with the best of ITP's methods.      Over the spring semester, student teams participate in an iterative approach to startup development, a combination of business model design + customer development + agile development. Participants from the New York Venture Capital community and leading successful startup entrepreneurs will serve as mentors and advisors to selected teams.   Who can apply: Students apply in teams, 3-4 people, with an initial concept that can be fully developed into a working prototype over the course of the semester (web, mobile, or physical product).      Enrollment to this class will be selected by the instructor, by application through the pitch session. Students must apply in teams, and come with a project idea in advance. For more information, or to get ideas or meet teammates, come to the scheduled info sessions.

Students will learn about LED, LCD and other more architectural displays as well as look at a variety of software and content creation tools that are used to drive such displays. The class will be focused on creating a project to be presented at the LED Lab in Tribeca (website is in the process of being updated). There will be an initial quick structured project that students will use to test their content and better understand issues such as resolution, scale, speed of motion and color. Students will then develop an idea for their final project that they will develop and test out at the LED Lab 2-3 times before the final presentation/event.      The LED Lab contains a variety of different LED Products, LCD arrays, media servers, lighting implements and features the UVA designed D3 software that can build and control media displays as well as lighting in 3D.       This two-credit course will meet the last six weeks of the semester.                                             Course Syllabus            Live Image Processing and Performance (ITPG-GT.2422) - R. Luke DuBois            Offered: Summer2 2012, Spring 2013, Spring 2014         This course teaches the ins and outs of using imagery in real-time, whether in a performance or installation context. The class will use a variety of software manipulate visual media (time-based, still, vector, and rendered) in real-time to allow students to develop interesting real-time systems. While the focus of this class is on using imagery for visual work (mainly a software package called Jitter), it also looks at how to integrate interactive elements (sound, physical interfaces, etc.) into an integrated practice. Class time is spent on interface design and software development issues as well. The class explores some interesting capabilities of the software in terms of real-time computer vision, projection mapping, generative graphics systems, and media transcoding. Throughout the class students develop and share ideas on live performance and interactive installation as a medium for visual expression, and learn the software tools necessary to put these ideas into practice in the form of idiosyncratic performance systems. A final presentation in the form of a group performance will be arranged. Students should have some working knowledge of Max/MSP before taking this class, although class projects can be executed on a variety of platforms.                                    Course Syllabus            Live Web (ITPG-GT.2734) - Shawn Van Every            Offered: Fall 2013, Fall 2014         The World Wide Web has grown up to be a great platform for asynchronous communication such as email and message boards which has extended into media posting and sharing. Recently, with the rise of broadband, more powerful computers and the prevalence of networked media devices, synchronous communications have become more viable. Streaming media, audio and video conference rooms and text based chat give us the ability to create new forms of interactive content for live participants.      In this course, we\u2019ll focus on the types of content and interaction that can be supported through web based and live interactive technologies as well as explore new concepts around participation. Specifically, we\u2019ll look at new and emerging platforms on the web such as HTML5, WebSockets and WebRTC using JavaScript and Node.js.      Experience with web technologies are (HTML and JavaScript) are helpful but not required. ICM level programming experience is required. ( Social Software, Internet, Video )            Course Syllabus            Makematics: Turning Computer Science Research into Creative Work (ITPG-GT.2947) - Gregory Borenstein            Offered: Fall 2012         Artists build on top of science. Today's cutting edge math and computer science research becomes tomorrow's breakthrough creative projects.      Computer vision algorithms, machine learning techniques, and 3D topology are becoming vital prerequisites to doing daily work in creative fields from interactive art to generative graphics, data visualization, and digital fabrication. If they don't grapple with these subjects themselves, artists are forced to wait for others to digest this new knowledge before they can work with it. Their creative options shrink to those parts of this research selected by Adobe for inclusion in prepackaged tools.      This class is designed to help you start seizing the results of this research for your own creative work. You'll learn how to explore the published academic literature for techniques that will help you build your dream projects. And you'll learn how to use those techniques to make those projects a reality.      Each week we'll explore a technique from one of these research fields. We'll learn to understand the original research and see how to implement it in code that you can use in your projects. You'll learn to use the marching squares algorithm to detect fingers or make 3D models into something you can laser cut. You'll learn how to use support vector machines to train your own object detector or analyze a body of text. We'll cover a series of such topics, each of which has a wide range of applications in different creative media.      This class will be taught in Processing and assumes ICM-level familiarity with programming.       This two-credit course will meet every other week.

Course Syllabus            Maps, Lies and Storytelling (ITPG-GT.2639) - Andrew Hill            Offered: Fall 2014         Maps have an incredible potential to do good and evil. Throughout history access to a map has been synonymous with power. In this course we will look at why that has been true, how it has changed through the digital revolution, and how we can harness mapping to gain power. The course will take a critical approach to maps and mapmaking, trying to pick apart all the ways they can be evil and be used to do evil. Through that critical approach, we will learn how to use maps effectively to communicate data, create knowledge, and tell stories. Students will also learn how maps are changing. We will try to find innovative new maps to create, both unassuming and controversial, and share those with a broader mapping community to create a public dialog. Students will learn the fundamentals of mapmaking, using tools from a pencil to Javascript, to create original maps from original data. We will create interactive maps with tools such as Leaflet and CartoDB to make maps from our imagination. We will also look at collecting or creating new geospatial data to make original maps never seen before.         This two credit course will meet the first six weeks of the semester.                              Mashups - Creating With Web APIs (ITPG-GT.2611) - Craig Protzel            Offered: Spring 2014, Summer2 2014         Much data and many services are now accessible through public APIs - Application Programming Interfaces - from sites such as YouTube, Google Maps, Twitter, and Xively. But how can we access these datasets and services? How can we transfer, store, initialize, and display this data on our own pages? And how might we use the data to create unique and creative web experiences of our own?      This class is about building interactive single-page web applications that leverage public data from a range of existing web services. The overall goal of the class will be for each student to have 3 functional well-designed single-page web applications by end of semester. Much of class time will be spent reviewing and writing code, mostly Javascript, for front-end (in-browser) web development. We will use a number of frameworks, including JQuery, Underscore, PaperJs, and D3. Where backend work is required, we will use Node-Express. Students should have some programming experience (ICM) as well as a basic understanding of web development (Comm Lab Web). Experience with Javascript is a plus.                            Materials and Making Things by Hand (ITPG-GT.2025) - Peter Menderson            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2013, Fall 2014         This class helps you to break out of 2-d screen and keyboard thinking and take advantage of the discoveries that inevitably occur when you\u2019re thinking in 3-d by manipulating materials with your hands, observing the results, and refining successive iterations of your idea. From techniques for prototyping and making small objects to fabrication methods for kiosks, you\u2019ll get hands-on experience with a variety of materials and methods. You have an idea for a wearable device? Mock it up with the sewing machine. You\u2019re thinking about a squeezable children\u2019s toy with sensors? Make a mold and cast some sensors inside soft rubber. You want to build an installation? Make a foam core model of the space and get a valuable preview of your project installed. During the course you\u2019ll be introduced to building in a variety of materials. You\u2019ll make objects of wood, foam, plastic, metal, clay, plaster, rubber, paper and fabric. You\u2019ll move a project from sketch to prototype to presentation and learn to incorporate the lessons of the process into your final product. By taking notice of the unexpected your original concept will evolve, and amplified by those revelations it will surprise you and delight your audience.     Course Syllabus            Math for Artists (ITPG-GT.2593) - Jen Lowe            Offered: Spring 2014         This course revisits the math you wish you'd paid attention to in high school. It starts with a review of basic mathematical concepts, then introduces aspects of trigonometry, linear algebra, physics, and statistics. We will also go beyond the fundamentals to break down mathematics commonly used by artists and introduce algorithms other than the usual suspects. You'll practice your new skills while completing two small code-based exploratory projects and one final project. We will work with command line programming, and the languages Processing, Python, and (maybe) R.

This two point course will meet in the first seven weeks of the semester.                     Course Syllabus            Narrative Lab (ITPG-GT.2261) - Douglas Rushkoff            Offered: Fall 2012         This seminar and laboratory considers the impact of interactivity and technology on traditional narrative structure, and explores new methods for conveying the essential narrative elements in non-linear and interactive forms of art, entertainment, and communications. Throughout, we will be formulating approaches to traditional narrative in interactive contexts, as well as piloting new narrative constructs developed for non-linear media. Each class meeting is broken up into two parts. The first is a seminar discussion examining an aspect of traditional narrative, and the way it is threatened or rendered obsolete in an interactive context. The second takes the form of workshop exercises and short projects through which alternative narrative forms specifically suited for an interactive environment are conceived, prototyped and evaluated. Students also work on longer-term experiments in interactive narrative, developing rule sets through which emergent narratives may form. These    may take forms ranging from augmented theater, interactive comics, and video games to robots, installations, software, amusement rides, or prototypes for as-yet undefined media. Readings will include Aristotle, McKee, Ibsen, Brecht, Marie Ryan, Scott Mcloud, Rushkoff, Carse, Huizinga, Burroughs, and a few current game theorists.                                                        Course Syllabus            New Interfaces for Musical Expression (ITPG-GT.2227) - Greg Shakar            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2013, Fall 2014         The course focus is on the design and creation of digital musical instruments. Music in performance is the primary subject of this class. We approach questions such as \"What is performance?\" \"What makes a musical interface intuitive and emotionally immediate?\" and \"How do we create meaningful correlations between performance gestures and their musical consequences?\" Over the semester, we look at many examples of current work by creators of musical interfaces, and discuss a wide range of issues facing technology-enabled performance - such as novice versus virtuoso performers, discrete versus continuous data control, the importance of haptic responsiveness as well as the relationship between musical performance and visual display. Extensive readings and case studies provide background for class discussions on the theory and practice of designing gestural controllers for musical performance. Students design and prototype a musical instrument - a complete system encompassing musical controller, algorithm for mapping input to sound, and the sound output itself. A technical framework for prototyping performance controllers is made available. Students focus on musical composition and improvisation techniques as they prepare their prototypes for live performance. The class culminates in a musical performance where students (or invited musicians) will demonstrate their instruments. Prerequisites: H79.2233 (Introduction to Computational Media) and H79.2301 (Physical Computing).                                                          Course Syllabus            Noticing (ITPG-GT.2973) - Robert Faludi            Offered: Spring 2013         Artists, designers, inventors and scientist all need to see things that are new\u2014often that no person has ever seen before. Yet our brains are designed to direct our attention to a thin stream of operational tasks. We screen out the shoes of the person across the subway and the leaves on the trees above our heads. We don't pay much attention to the interplay of shadows or consciously hear the soft squeaking of distant doors. In conversations we rarely attend to what goes unsaid, though vital information often lurks in the omissions. The seeds of a brilliant work might lie in detecting a simple gesture. We only need to notice it. This class is a workshop that teaches techniques and tools for noticing\u2014seeing, hearing and comprehending what might otherwise pass us by. In a series of focused classes we explore the observation process in an abundant array of domains, from cognitive psychology to ethnography, drawing to data collection, user research to police work. Projects include sketching, user studies, experimental research, ideation, observational exercises and techniques for reaching that moment we all crave when something unexpected and terrific bursts forward into our consciousness. The class culminates in a final work inspired by one of your brand-new discoveries and honed with the help of the observational techniques and tools learned in class. Students should leave with their eyes and minds opened to the inspirations that surround us all.      This two-credit course meets for the first six weeks of the semester.                       Course Syllabus            Open Source Animation: 3D Done Wrong (ITPG-GT.2643) - Nick Fox-Gieg            Offered: Fall 2014         Open Source Animation: 3D Done Wrong      This class uses open source software to solve interesting problems in animation. We\u2019ll be focusing on 3D CG, with the goal of knocking it off its pedestal as the intimidating \u201cmost advanced\u201d form of animation around\u2014instead of having to memorize and stick to an often-tedious workflow, recent advances in technology mean we can freely sculpt, draw, and puppeteer our creations in ways that weren\u2019t practical for independent artists until now. We\u2019ll learn how to work with 3D scanning, motion capture, and other kinds of live performance data too. Our core tools will be Processing, Unity, and Maya, but we can explore many other options depending on student interests; you can create anything from pure visual music to narrative character puppetry. You\u2019ll need either some prior animation or coding experience to get off to a good start in the class\u2014but you don\u2019t necessarily need to know anything specifically about 3D CG animation yet to do cool stuff with it.                   Open Source Animation: DIY Motion Capture (ITPG-GT.2948) - Nick Fox-Gieg            Offered: Fall 2012         This class will use open-source software to solve interesting problems in animation, with a focus on integrating depth, motion-capture, and other kinds of live performance data into traditional film production workflows. We\u2019ll pay special attention to the Kinect, which (among other things) is the first motion capture system ever sold at Best Buy--but in order to fully realize its promise for our purposes, we\u2019ll have to get it talking to mature commercial animation software like After Effects and Maya. If the tools we need don\u2019t already exist, then we\u2019ll need to write our own. The end product of the class will be a complete animated short film and the software tools that help realize it--you can explore anything from pure visual music to narrative character puppetry. Our initial exercises will use AfterEffects, JavaScript, and Processing, but we can explore many other   options depending on student interests. It\u2019d be helpful to start the class with either some prior filmmaking or programming experience--but you don\u2019t necessarily need to know anything about 3D CG to do cool stuff with motion capture.                                  Parametric Design for Digital Fabrication (ITPG-GT.2921) - Marius Watz            Offered: Fall 2013         Recent developments in digital fabrication have shifted the focus from conventional manufacturing processes to a new model based on scripted parametric forms. By modeling objects and structures as generative software processes rather than as static models, it becomes possible to produce highly complex forms for customized on-demand fabrication. In this course we explore strategies for parametric modeling including generative systems, data-driven form processes and user interaction. The focus is on creating structures that can be manufactured as physical objects using 3D printing, CNC milling laser cutting. Our main tool is Processing, supported by other CAD tools to aid in preparing models for fabrication.              Course Syllabus            Performance Composition: - Performed Identities (Studio) (ITPG-GT.2730) - Nancy Hechinger, Anna Deavere Smith            Offered: Fall 2013         With Performance Studies      Acting for Non-Actors... A practice class in which acting techniques will be used to explore fictional and real performed identities. Students do not have to have acting experience. Class will end in a performance for an invited audience.      This class is offered out of Performance Studies but is also open to ITP students. The goal is to have at least half of the students be from ITP. Acting techniques will be used to explore fictional and real performed identities. Students do not have to have acting experience. Class will end in a performance for an invited audience. This class will be very useful if you are interested in narrative of any kind--interactive or linear storytelling, games or invented worlds. Be Aware: the class will take place on weekends (saturday or sunday TBD). Each class will be about 4 hours long, so it will only be 9 classes. If you sign on, you are expected to come to every class--that's a commitment. Not easy. But on the other hand: you get a unique experience--to work intensely and deeply with a world-reknowned artist and performer.                               Persuasive Design (ITPG-GT.2531) - Katherine Dillon            Offered: Fall 2013, Fall 2014         In subtle and not-so-subtle ways technology is influencing our behavior \u2013 from buying more books on Amazon than we intended to, to helping us change bad personal habits to leveraging the voices of many\u2013 technology presents an opportunity to be an agent of change. This 2 pt course will explore how technology can be used to influence behavior. We will look at a number of behavioral theories including incentive\u2013based design, gamification and social influence. We will review case studies on how these techniques have been used to effectively affect behavior.   After researching theories on behavior motivation each student will identify a problem or issue that they hope to influence. Students will document the problem, develop a concept to influence the behavior associated with that problem and prototype (or build) their solution. They will test their solution and draw conclusions from the experiment. Projects can attempt to influence social change at a large, social scale or at a personal level. The unifying theme behind the projects will be that they intend to inspire positive change.      This two-credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester. The goal of the course is to provide students with a sold understanding of the potential technology provides to motivate and affect change in behavior. Students will develop projects that aim to influence behavior.      Week 1: The power of persuasion   Week 2: Social persuasion   Week 3: Incentive-based motivation   Week 4: Subtle persuasion   Week 5: Gamification   Week 6: Final Presentations             Piecing it Together (ITPG-GT.2533) - Eric Hagan            Offered: Fall 2013         Designing and building physical objects can feel like putting together a puzzle without the box top. Even if you have all the pieces, an extra challenge lies in figuring out how they fit together. Digital fabrication tools make it possible to newly imagine and produce pieces that allow us to recreate or modify the \"puzzle\" as we see fit. Utilizing historic mechanical equipment (e.g. windmills, clocks, speed governors) as design inspiration, we will explore the possibilities of digital fabrication tools to solve issues of fastening, synchronicity, replaceable parts, repeatability, and modification of existing designs. A central goal of this class is to come to terms, and work productively, with the limitations of these otherwise revolutionary digital fabrication tools\u2014particularly in regards to materials, scale, and aesthetics. By the end of the semester, students will be familiar with Adobe Illustrator, 2D and 3D CAD software, laser cutting, CNC routing, and 3D printing. No prior fabrication or design background is required for this course.        Course Syllabus            Playful Communication of Serious Research (ITPG-GT.2974) - Helene Alonso            Offered: Spring 2013         Exhibition design is the art of marrying experience and information. The best do so seamlessly; the very best surprise and delight you along the way. In this class you will explore the craft of interactive exhibition design through practice. Working in small groups, you will select an NYU researcher whose work is of interest to you and create an interactive experience that presents this research to a broader, public audience. In the process, you will learn to interrogate content and form, audience and environment, medium and message to create a meaningful and playful exhibit experience.        This class is taught by Lillian Preston, Senior Producer at RAAMedia, the world renown exhibit design firm.                            Course Syllabus            Poetry Everywhere (ITPG-GT.2535) - Gabe Barcia-Colombo            Offered: Fall 2013         Poetry Everywhere is an immersive production class which seeks to put poetry in unexpected New York City public spaces. The class will partner with the New York State Poet Laureate Marie Howe to stage a series of poetic interventions in public space in the form of augmented reality, interactive installation and large scale projections. Over the course of the semester, students will work alongside poets to create installations and animations for city streets, subway tunnels and building fa\u00e7ades. Students will create three projects, at three different scales, each inspired by a different poem or poet. Possible projects include animation, mobile applications and text visualization with the final being a one night large scale projection onto a public building in New York City. Class time is devoted to lectures, guest readings, field trips and critique.                  Political Uses of Social Media (ITPG-GT.2930) - Clay Shirky            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013         The relationship between politics and media has always been complex --the rise of newspapers accompanied the rise of democracy; radio and TV have always been tools of propaganda, and so on. This course asks the question \"What difference does it make that citizens have access to social media?\", which is to say media tools that let them synchronize their opinions, coordinate their actions, and document the results. Though there will be background readings in the relationship between media and politics (Habermas, Rossanvallon, Galloway), most of the course will focus on discussions of political events of the last decade where the insurgents (and, increasingly, the governments) used social media to attempt to alter the outcome. These will include the ouster of Estrada in the Philippines, the Belarussian 'flash mob' protests, the South Korean 'Mad Cow' protests, the Tea Party, the Arab Spring, and the Occupy movement. There will be weekly readings on the topic of political uses of social media, and a mid-term and final paper. You will also work in groups to observe and discuss the operations of a contemporary group seeking political change, and using these tools.                  Pop Up Window Displays (ITPG-GT.2956) - Gabe Barcia-Colombo            Offered: Fall 2012, Spring 2014         In New York City, every storefront window has the possibility to tell a story, spark a conversation or inspire an interaction. This workshop will focus on creating innovative interactive pop up installations designed for public window displays. A successful window is one that clearly delivers a message directly to the public. How do we create interactive displays that engage the public with a distinctive voice or style? Over seven weeks, students will concept, prototype and build an interactive experience meant to be installed in a storefront or commercial display. This course will explore lighting, design, and budgeting of durable interactive window installations. Previous fabrication or programming experience is encouraged.          This two-credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester.                                    Practical Writing Workshop for Non-Native English Speakers (ITPG-GT.2615) - Nancy Hechinger            Offered: Spring 2014         This class is intended to help non-native English speaking students improve their ability to communicate their ideas in writing. We will go over basic elements of grammar, specific differences from other languages, common usage and expressions, etc. Students will bring in assignments from other classes for review and group editing. There will also be in-class writing exercises.       Section 1 of this one-credit course will meet for 1.25 hours a week in the first seven weeks of the semester; section 2 of this one-credit course will meet for 1.25 hours a week in the last seven weeks of the semester.                             Printing Code (ITPG-GT.2949) - Rune Madsen            Offered: Fall 2012, Spring 2013, Spring 2014         In this course students explore the use of computational techniques to produce physical prints, focusing on the intersection between graphic design and creative coding. Class time will be divided between exploring design topics like colors, grids and typefaces, and applying these towards computational topics like randomization, repetition and generative form.      Weekly readings include relevant writings from the history of graphic design (Josef Muller-Brockmann, Paul Rand), articles from the history of computation (Vannevar Bush, Douglas Englebart, Martin Krampen) and everything in between (Sol Lewitt, Edward Tufte, etc).      Weekly homework can be produced using the digital printers at NYU\u2019s Advanced Media Studio, however students are encouraged to utilize whatever physical printing techniques they prefer, that being stencils, letter press, silk screen, weaving or home-made printers.      The class aims not only to teach the students how to create physical prints via code, but also to have something interesting to say about it.      The class requires ICM or similar programming background.                                      Course Syllabus            Procedural Design in Abstract Gameplay (ITPG-GT.2537) - Phoenix Perry            Offered: Fall 2013         How do games tell stories? Can traditional narratives work well in games? Or is there a more holistic approach that embeds the story deeply into the interaction model? Ian Bogost created a framework for such games - procedural games, or art games. In these games, the structure itself becomes a storytelling device. How does it feel to live day to day in a situation? What are the play mechanics we use the advance the narrative of our own lives? The goal of the procedural designer is to cause the player to stop and reflect about a given situation during or after play, without concern for resolution or effect. Procedural games share more in common with art house movies than mainstream games and are finely tuned experiences flying in the face of traditional game design. In this class, students will study a range of these kinds of games and be expected to create a reflective game experience by the end of the term.      Topics Include: Unity, Unity\u2019s 2D toolkit, sprite sheet creation.   Coding Experience: Ideally, students will have taken at least one class in Processing or Open Frameworks. We will learn c# within the Unity engine to create our games. If you have a basic understanding of programming in any language, including javascript, you are also welcome.                                            Product Poetry: Designing Inter-experience (ITPG-GT.2914) - Silas Warren, Gary Natsume            Offered: Fall 2012         In this class, students will question the meaning and values that inform existing consumer products and examine the ways users perceive them, interact with them, and assimilate them into their daily lives. The class emphasizes ethnographic research, conceptual and technical exploration, and interaction programming. Using methods of direct and indirect communication between object and user, students will deliver a new layer of meaning or value to a specific consumer object of their choice.   The objective of the class is to consider the following:   -Why do I need a new product?   -What does it mean to me?   - What type of value does it bring to the world?   The class is a design-oriented, hands-on creative program. Participating students will work on one theme over the course of the semester and are expected to produce an interactive prototype of their concept by semester's end. The final deliverable should demonstrate the physical and digital aspects of the user experience.   There are two aspects to the class, one is to form a conceptual story around the experience, and the other is technical implementation to deliver the experience. Quick and rough iterative prototyping is encouraged to help inform concept ideation and possible design decisions from early stage of the class.   The process of the class is divided into three stages:   1. User study and research   2. Design concept ideation   3. Implementation and refinement   The class instructors will support and lead the students by introducing industrial design methodology, rapid interaction prototyping techniques and examples from their professional practice while encouraging exploratory creative freedom.                 Course Syllabus            Programmatic Audio (ITPG-GT.2931) - Hans Steiner            Offered: Spring 2012         Digital audio has a vast array of possibilities far beyond music playback. Data sonification reinforces visualization. Processing sound can give you data like a sensor. Foley sounds to make a video sound alive. A soundtrack generated from the same data as the video tightly links the two. Extract data from music and make algorithmic responses. Realtime digital audio processing lets you synthesize a huge array of sounds, create your own sampler, and build your own musical instrument. All completely open ended, you define how it works. Sound provides an alternate channel of communication to other sense, with its own strengths and weaknesses. Humans are able to hear minute differences in time, its the most time sensitive sense. Huge amounts of audio processing happen in the background of our brains, we will hear our name mentioned in a crowded room with no effort. This class will introduce how sound works in the computer, our brain, and the physical world. In parallel, it will introduce how to shape, analyze and control sound. The aim is to provide a basic knowledge of principles and practices of digital audio from a creative perspective. While digital audio involves heavy math, this course presents a working knowledge over the normal detailed math approach to digital signal processing for audio. Pd has its roots in realtime audio programming and that is the core of the class. You will end up with a launching point for further learning, especially in interactive, non-narrative sound. The final project is an interactive or generated piece that uses or makes sound. This course uses Pd, but much of this knowledge is applicable to Max/MSP as well. The prerequisite for this 2 point course, which meets the second seven weeks of the semester, is the two-point course \"Intro to Dataflow Programming\", which meets in the first seven weeks, (or equivalent experience). This two-point course meets for the second seven weeks of the semester.

Course Syllabus            Prototyping Interactive Spaces with Spacebrew (ITPG-GT.2595) - Brett Renfer            Offered: Spring 2014          Spacebrew is an open-source tool for building and experimenting with interactive spaces. It facilitates rapid prototyping of interactive and responsive environments by enabling designers and developers to easily and quickly connect real-time interactive applications across microcontrollers, computers and the cloud.      This workshop will introduce Spacebrew from a technical perspective and explore ways to prototype large scale interactive installations with Spacebrew. On the technical side, we will cover: a high-level introduction to Spacebrew; an overview of how to connect to Spacebrew with Processing, openFrameworks, Arduino, and Javascript; and demonstrations on how to use Spacebrew to connect all of the above together. Students will then be split into small groups and will be tasked with creating prototypes around a specific interactive scenario. Finally, we will explore narratives that can be created when these individual prototypes are networked together.       This one-credit course will meet on Saturday, February 21 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday, February 22 from 12:00 noon to 1:45 p.m.                             Puppets and Performing Objects (ITPG-GT.2950) - Ithai Benjamin            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2013         While grocery shopping, have you ever wanted to talk to a cucumber? Make out with a red radish or pet a pizza? You can. Following the idea that puppets are \u201cany performing object\u201d and that objects can be useful as stand-ins for human beings, this class explores anthropomorphism, character development, narrative and performance. Through weekly assignments and a final project, we will bring life to objects that we create, transform or find. Drawing inspiration from different styles of mainstream and experimental art, entertainment and puppetry we will develop original concepts of our own. Exercises explore a range of technologies and materials, from simple sock puppets to body puppets, mechanisms, robots and animatronics. We\u2019ll spend time looking at how to successfully integrate interactive elements from other realms such as music, physical interfaces, etc. into our performances. This is a hands on class with a mix of individual and collaborative projects. Performance or puppetry skills are not required. You must bring your imagination and willingness to experiment and come up with creative solutions to class assignments. Students will showcase their best work in the annual Halloween puppet show (aka PAPOWEEN) and a final public performance.         Course Syllabus            Puppets and Performing Objects (2 credits) (ITPG-GT.2915) - Ithai Benjamin            Offered: Fall 2014         While grocery shopping, have you ever wanted to talk to a cucumber?

You must bring your imagination and willingness to experiment and come up with creative solutions to class assignments. Students will showcase their best work in the annual Halloween puppet show aka PAPOWEEN.       This two-credit course will meet the first six weeks of the semester.                         Reading and Writing Electronic Text (ITPG-GT.2778) - Allison Parrish            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013, Spring 2014         This course introduces the Python programming language as a tool for reading and writing digital text. This course is specifically geared to serve as a general-purpose introduction to programming in Python, but will be of special interest to students interested in poetics, language, creative writing and text analysis. Weekly programming exercises work toward a midterm project and culminate in a final project. Poetics/text analysis topics covered include: character encodings (and other technical issues); cut-up and appropriated text; the algorithmic nature of poetic form (proposing poetic forms, generating text that conforms to poetic forms); transcoding/transcription (from/to text); n-gram analysis and Markov chain generation; performing digital writing. Programming topics covered include: data structures (lists, sets, dictionaries); strategies for making code reusable (functions and modules); functional programming (list comprehensions, recursion); getting data from the web; simple web applications; and parsing data formats (e.g., markup languages). Prerequisites: Introduction to Computational Media or equivalent programming experience.                        Course Syllabus            Recurring Concepts in Art (ITPG-GT.2586) - Georgia Krantz            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2014         As a response to developing technologies, artists working in areas of new/digital media are continually inventing new concepts for self-expression - interactivity, the passage of time and resolution, just to name a few. Yet these concepts are new only in the sense that they are being adapted to new media. For example, the notion of interactivity, frequently observed as original and specific to the user-interaction component of computer-mediated works, was equally, if differently, specific to Gianlorenzo Bernini's 17th-century Baroque sculpture and architecture. Indeed the very concept of new media, and the concomitant implication of critically significant artistic development, applies throughout history. Oil revolutionized painting in the Renaissance, as did house-paint (on canvas) in the 1950s; in the 1910s, the found object indelibly altered definitions of art, the importance of the object being subsumed by that of the concept in the 1960s. This course examines how artists working before the boom of digital technology utilized other media, techniques and approaches to effect formal, conceptual and experiential dynamics comparable to those being investigated by new media artists today. The objective of the course is to provide students with not only knowledge of the immensely rich history of artistic creativity, but also a platform through which that knowledge might be utilized to reconsider new media strategies of artistic expression. It is the goal that through observation, discussion, reading and projects (both written and hands-on), students acquire mental tools to approach their own work with an expanded understanding of artistic possibility. Organized thematically, each class focuses on a different concept derived from the field of new media production and examined with regard to artistic precedents. The course focus primarily, though not exclusively, is on 20th/21st-century art. It is conducted as a combination lecture/discussion class. Critical theory is incorporated into the readings and discussions, but this is not strictly a theory course. The course has been conceptualized and designed to enhance understanding through a variety of means, from basic observation, to exploratory conversations, to more rigorous thinking informed by lectures, readings and focused discussions.                                                       Course Syllabus            Redial: Interactive Telephony (ITPG-GT.2574) - Christopher Kairalla            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013, Fall 2014         New technologies such as Voice over IP, and open source telephony applications such as Asterisk, have opened the door for the development of interactive applications that use telephony for its traditional purpose -- voice communications. This course explores the use of the telephone in interactive art, performance, social networking, and multimedia applications. Asterisk and low cost VoIP service are used to develop applications that can work over both telephone networks and the internet. Topics include: history of telephony, plain old telephone service (POTS), voice over IP (VoIP), interactive voice response systems (IVR), audio user interfaces, voice messaging systems (voicemail), text to speech, phreaking (telephone hacking), VoIP to Web integration, conferencing and more. In addition to interactive telephony, the class will also cover basic Linux commands and Linux sys-admin. This course will primarily use Ruby for scripting, but students who are comfortable with another scripting language like PHP, JavaScript/Node.js, or Perl may opt to use those languages instead. No prior knowledge of Ruby is required, although all students should be comfortable with tackling new and unique programming challenges.              Course Syllabus            ReNatured (ITPG-GT.2951) - Marina Zurkow            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2013, Fall 2014         \"Nature\" is a construct that needs to be reexamined. Making work about \"nature\" can take place anywhere; the entire world is \"natural,\" while none of it is. \"Nature\" contains animals, plants, the weather, pollution, people, airplanes, computers, microbes, stars, asphalt, and even unicorns - the agents that comprise our world-view.            Students will create public art interventions that focus on urban nature, making new poetics about the natural world and our place within it. We will use the NYU area as our field study station, and make guerrilla (unsanctioned) public art experiments that challenge the dominant assertions about \"nature.\u201d Examples of public projects could include protests, street theater, poster campaigns, agit-prop pranks, temporary sculptures and interactive works, and other forms of social practice.         The course mixes reading, writing responses, and public projects. You are expected to iterate and field test your projects every week for several weeks. Selected readings include Epicurus, Bruno Latour, Timothy Morton, Jane Bennett, Kate Soper, and current event writings on climate change, animal consciousness, environmental art, etc.         The first part of the course covers new writings in ecology, science studies, and ecocriticism, followed by two areas of focus, each with a public project \u2013   Interagents: humans and climate change.   Interagents: humans, plants, fungi, and non-human animals         This is a studio class in critical creativity. Technologies are up to the students' discretion, but might include computers, paper, or dirt. You are encouraged to work in teams.         \"Renatured\" takes this idea as an organizing construct:      \"Life,\" the theoretical biologist Lynn Margulis wrote in 1995, \"is a network of cross-kingdom alliances.\"                    Course Syllabus            Research Studio: Algorithms (ITPG-GT.2932) - Heather Dewey-Hagborg            Offered: Spring 2012         In this research-based studio class students will choose an advanced computational topic to explore in depth. Work will be self-directed and monitored by weekly writing and bi-weekly class presentations with extensive feedback sessions. Students will be expected to exhibit a high degree of motivation in choosing and pursuing their research topic. Students will choose a narrowly defined topic within their chosen subject area to research in depth, implementing examples in code, explaining the fundamentals in class and summarizing relevant research papers.      Sample research topics include:   \"the use of Hopfield neural networks for image recognition\"   \"evolving self organized maps\"   \"simulating realistic plantlike growth\"   \"the use of grammar in machine generated text\".      Students will begin by preparing a broad survey and literature review of their chosen subject. They will then craft plans for how to accomplish specific goals in the semester timeframe, culminating in final project presentations which will include implementations in code for demonstration. This class is platform independent but requires advanced knowledge of one or more programming languages. Students should come to the first day of class with a research topic in mind. Research topics may or may not be tied to specific student projects like thesis.                            Course Syllabus            Rest of You (ITPG-GT.2975) - Daniel O'Sullivan            Offered: Spring 2013, Spring 2014         We build computers around an illusory image of ourselves. In particular the illusion that our consciousness is the full extent of our experience limits how we might use computers to augment the fuller expression of our lives. This class looks at how we can use computational media to connect with the rest of your existence. The class begins by examining some of the illusions that we operate under and how revisiting those can be helpful. Then we will use sensors to give voice the less represented parts of your body. This class will also serve as a gentle rejoinder to Physical Computing and ICM. Exercises will use bio sensors, cameras, logging, mobile tech, data analysis and visualization.               This two-credit course meets the first seven weeks of the semester.                     Course Syllabus            Science and the City (ITPG-GT.2599) - Francois Grey            Offered: Spring 2014         This course focuses on developing tools for the citizens of New York to generate and analyze data that is both meaningful for them as individuals and valuable for the city as a whole. Using smart phones, low-cost open source hardware and crowdsourcing software, citizens can now make real contributions to cutting-edge urban science projects in a wide range of fields.      Specifically, the course introduces Crowdcrafting as an open source tool for rapid prototyping of citizen data gathering and analysis, and explores ways to combine this with various sensors and phone apps. Students will study and critique existing urban science projects, design their own project and use Crowdcrafting to implement it.      The course will feature a number of guest speakers on the theme of 'urban science meets citizen science' such as tracking where New York trash goes, measuring air and noise pollution, classifying the city's trees and studying the genetic makeup of bugs in the sewers.      This course is in collaboration with CUSP, NYU's new Centre for Urban Science and Progress.       This two-credit course will meet in the first six weeks of the semester.                       Course Syllabus            Sculpting Data into Everyday Objects (ITPG-GT.2933) - Esther Cheung            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013, Spring 2014         This course challenges students to combine Processing, Rhino 3D modeling and digital fabrication towards making an everyday data object. Some examples of everyday data objects might include: an ashtray shaped from lung-cancer statistics, a drinking glass based on clean water depletion, a lipstick case showing the growing number of women in parliament. While the first half of the course will focus on creating 3D data visualizations in Processing and Rhino 3D modeling, the second half will concentrate on integrating Processing and Rhino, as well as fabrication using the laser-cutter and 3D printer.                                          Course Syllabus            Sensitive Buildings (ITPG-GT.2916) - Robert Faludi            Offered: Fall 2012         This is a class is about creating smart habitats for city dwellers. Students will conceive and prototype large scale device networks to benefit the tenants of a 28-story, 325-unit landmark apartment building on Central Park South in Manhattan. The high-rise owners have once again invited ITP to develop a variety of prototypes that enhance the livability, ecology and community of their apartment building. The class has been newly restructured into three parts: We'll start by touring the building to learn about its infrastructure, inhabitants and context. This begins our Observation and Design phase in which students will employ behavioral studies, user-centered design and ethnography; paired with tenant interviews and other techniques that inspire first-rate innovations. Next we will quickly cover deploying Wireless Technology to connect interactive devices. Finally, we\u2019ll return to the site with prototypes that explore project possibilities, installing these proof-of-concepts and observing the real-world results. We'll take what we\u2019ve learned into Final Projects that have the potential to be deployed at scale and considered for long-term sponsorship. This 1939 building\u2019s recent renovation created lower-level green roofs, various upgrades for energy efficiency and a historically restored facade. It has been described as, \u201cstate-of-the-art green architecture before the term was coined.\" The building\u2019s motto is \u201cWhere The Park is Part of the Plan.\u201d Our class is provided with access to unoccupied units, and opportunities to connect with current residents. The owners generously allow full supervised access to building infrastructure from roof to basement including ventilation, plumbing, heating, elevator and energy systems. Students get an extraordinary chance to invent and deliver big benefits for residents using active observation techniques as they develop interactive networks on a towering scale.     Course Syllabus            Sensor Workshop (ITPG-GT.2522) - Thomas Igoe            Offered: Spring 2012         Good physical interaction design relies on listening to physical action well. In this class, students will focus on the input side of physical computing by researching various sensors and sensing methods and developing examples for their use. Conceptually, this class sits in between the physical interaction design focus of Intro to Physical Computing, and the electronics focus of Analog Circuits.       Topics include:       how to interface sensors to digital systems    calibration    how to convert the electrical output of a sensor into the terms of the energy it senses    computational techniques for interpreting a sensor's datastream    datalogging techniques    environmental sensing         The class will assemble a library of sensor applications for interactive applications, and apply this research to applications in their classes at ITP.      There will be a number of one-week exercises that students will complete to demonstrate sensor techniques discussed in class. In addition, students will be responsible for a major sensor research project in which they will explain the operating principles of a given sensor and present a working example of the sensor in use. These research projects will be presented throughout the second half of the semester, and collected into an online reference site. There is no final application project, but students will be evaluated on the application of their research (or that of other students) in production projects developed for other classes.              Course Syllabus            Site-specific: The History and Process of Making Temporary Public Art Projects (ITPG-GT.2620) - Marina Zurkow            Offered: Fall 2012         Site suggests contexts that are spatial, temporal, narrative, and populated. Site-specific works require a frame for participants, a set of stories and a point of entry. More than art within \"the framework\" of an art institution, site-specific, interactive and community-based works require rigorous levels of observation, interrogation, and participation. Whether in the physical or the virtual public, frame and context are primary considerations in the work you produce. This class is part studio and part refection, using contemporary art examples and writings that engage and critique the local and the global, invert locale and involve the everyday as well as traditional urban studies of observation. The studio portion of the class will either utilize an existent space in New York, or work towards the development of proposals for a fictional grant for lower Manhattan.           Course Syllabus            Small Is Beautiful (ITPG-GT.2976) - Francois Grey            Offered: Spring 2013         Proteins are poetry   Atoms are art   If you didn't know that   Here's where to start      This course aims to introduce the aesthetics of the nano-world as revealed by scanning probe microscopes. These instruments are used to study and manipulate objects on the atomic and molecular scale. They do not \"see\" objects using photons, like their optical microscope cousins, but rather \"feel\" them, with exquisitely sensitive nanoscale probes. This works in much the same way that an old-fashioned gramophone needle senses a vinyl disc. This form of microscopy was invented in the 1980s, and catalyzed the booming field of nanotechnology. A specific hands-on goal of this project is for students to work alongside scientists to record scanning probe microscope images and share them on the internet, so that citizen scientists can enjoy the beauty of the nano-world as well as help analyze scientific data. An example of the sort of practical outcome the course aims at is the project Feynman's Flowers.      An underlying objective of the course is to help promote within nanotechnology the same spirit of \"open science\" that has enabled astronomers to engage the public in the analysis of all sorts of telescope imagery, from measuring craters on Mars to classifying images of distant galaxies. This two point class meets every other week.                                                                Course Syllabus            Social Data Analysis (ITPG-GT.2649) - Gilad Lotan            Offered: Fall 2014         Data are created and collected all around us, trails left from our interactions in social networks, accessible through streams, feeds, APIs and data-stores. A useful way to make sense of these tangle of connections, posts and interactions is by looking at it through the lens of networks. Network graphs are mathematical structures used to model relations between objects, and are incredibly helpful when working with social data. In this class we will get familiar with tools, methods and data-streams that come in handy when analyzing information from social networks. We will be using python scripts to access data from APIs of services such as Twitter and Instagram, learn about various types of data-bases which we will come in handy when aggregating our data, and finally work on ways to make sense of it. We will touch on topics such as natural language processing, classification, authority ranking and clustering, and will use a number of open source tools, including Gephi. Throughout the semester there will be a mix of individual and group projects. We will predominantly be using the Python programming language to access, index and manipulate data. A number of Code Academy Python tutorials will be assigned as a pre-requisite for those with little to no python experience.                            Soil as Medium: Engaging the Urban Commons from the Ground Up (ITPG-GT.2601) - Brooke Singer            Offered: Spring 2014         In this course students will brainstorm, prototype and deploy DIY technologies and systems to support urban farming, permaculture and community gardening with a special focus on soil. Typically agricultural technologies are proprietary and expensive. How can do-it-yourself approaches and electronic hacks provide urban farmers and community gardeners access to similar tools at lower costs?      Soil is a neglected resource in our cities. Paved over, compacted and contaminated, urban soil is rendered nonconductive and even life threatening. It is no longer a conduit for life but rather a dead end. With the rise of urban farming and the local food movement, as well as extreme weather events in the age of climate change, reevaluating our relationship to soil has become urgent. In this course we will remake urban soil as a productive medium, teeming with billions of microbes and rich in healing potential. Towards this end, we will work with worms, microscopes, decomposing matter and inocula. This exploration will take us out of the classroom and into sites like a soil lab, urban farm, food rescue center, nutritionist's office, former landfill and river bank to understand the systems at work in the broader soil food web. The projects in this class will take form as proposals and prototypes that promote soil rehabilitation and fertility within urban centers. Students will have the opportunity to deploy select prototypes in a NYC community garden to test efficacy over the longer term.        This two-credit course will meet in the last seven weeks of the semester.                Solving Public Problems with Technology (ITPG-GT.2669) - Beth Noveck            Offered: Fall 2014         Passionate about civic tech? Are you\u2026      A professional student in computer science, engineering, design, public policy,   law, or business who wants to expand your toolkit for change?   A public servant who want to bring innovation to your job?   Someone with a really important idea for how to make the world better but who   lacks key skills or resources to realize the vision?      Solving Public Problems with Technology is a hands-on learning and mentoring program designed to help you design and implement solutions to public interest problems using civic technology. The course enables you to take advantage of the latest innovations in open and participatory problem-solving, including the application of open data, crowdsourcing, expert networks and systems, game mechanics, and prizes. Geared to the purpose-driven participant (both individuals and teams) passionate about a problem, Solving Public Problems helps you develop a project from idea to implementation. The program focuses exclusively on the public interest and on projects that work with real world institutions and partners, such as agencies and NGOs, to develop more effective and scalable initiatives.      Through coaching, rapid prototyping, collaboration and repeated presentation, you will develop project-related skills such as how to sharply define a problem, design for citizens, overcome legal barriers and pitch projects to risk-averse officials and politicians. In the process you will be joining a growing network of likeminded peers who also working with civic tech to address hard public problems. During the final demo day, you will pitch to friends and civic funders, including the Knight Foundation.        In addition to registering, participants please complete the Course Questionnaire (click here)              Course Syllabus            Spatial Media (ITPG-GT.2756) - Jared Schiffman, Jeff Crouse, Brett Renfer            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013, Spring 2014         Spatial Media explores both the design and technical issues involved in the creation of interac- tive spaces. Students will examine several specific spaces as sets of interactions and reactions (inputs/output) that can be molded, enhanced, and subverted to create focused narratives. The class will be built around an iterative design process, with an emphasis on building and docu- menting technical and nontechnical prototypes. Technical topics include vision-based sensing systems, display integration techniques, and interactive graphics programming. Students work in groups to complete two large projects over the course of the semester. Projects are evaluated on both the quality of the design and the success of implementation. Additionally, there are weekly assignments that challenge students to consider a wide variety of spaces that are ripe for transformation through the integration of interactive media. Since this class involves pro- gramming on an intermediate level, a working knowledge of Processing or C is a prerequisite.              Course Syllabus            Surveillance Documentary (ITPG-GT.2603) - Shawn Van Every            Offered: Spring 2014            The loss of privacy is a fact of modern life. Technology, specifically surveillance technology, now both powerful and ubiquitous is partially responsible. We are surrounded by networked surveillance cameras, small or easily concealed recording devices are easily obtained, even our own mobile phones and desktop computers can be used to watch and track our behavior or even unwittingly capture our images.      In this course, along with students from Tisch\u2019s Grad Film department, we\u2019ll explore surveillance tools in the context of film production. Surveillance and the technology of surveillance will be explored as both the topic of films produced as well as the means of production.      This course will be co-taught by ITP faculty member Shawn Van Every and Carol Dysinger from Grad Film. Enrollment will be limited to 8 students from each department working together in pairs or small teams.      It will run on a modified schedule at ITP for 12 weeks during the semester. Specifically, it will meet on weeks 1 through 9 and 12 through 14 with a \u201cproduction break\u201d during week\u2019s 10 and 11. (The \u201cproduction break\u201d is when the Grad Film students go into production on their directing class assignments and may be when the filming for this class will occur as well.)        Course Syllabus            Talking Fabrics (ITPG-GT.2605) - Antonius Oktaviano Wiriadjaja            Offered: Spring 2014         We communicate with fabric every day. Our choice of clothing speaks volumes about our identities. An upholstered chair invites different interaction than an uncushioned seat. And carrying a reusable canvas bag has become both an environmental and a fashion statement. The technology of creating textiles entered human culture so early that we often use it for important metaphors. We weave tales to create our social fabric. This seven week course will explore the history of textiles and the possibilities of communication through the medium of fabric. Basic sewing will be covered along with techniques on integrating synthetic materials and circuits to commonly found fabric. Prerequisites: Physical Computing and Comm Lab 2D design.       This two-credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester.            Course Syllabus            Tech Crafts (ITPG-GT.2952) - Sofia Catarina Mota            Offered: Fall 2012         Combining high and low tech, in this course we'll explore the combination of smart materials and circuitry with traditional materials and crafts. We will cover embedding electronics in paper projects like books, pop-ups, and sculptures. We'll explore several soft circuits techniques for integrating electronics in textile creations. And we'll play with our food, giving it unusual properties such as touch sensing and illumination. All the while approaching circuitry as a craft in itself and using smart materials, electronics and conductive traces as aesthetic components.      Topics and techniques covered in this course include: laying out circuits on paper or fabric, handling folds and bends, making connections between hardware and other softer components, painting circuits with conductive ink, using mundane materials as tech components, adding illumination to delicate constructions, and using fruits, vegetables and drinks as sensors. And we'll work with a vast assortment of materials such as electrotextiles, different conductive tapes, EL wire/tape/panels, UV and heat reactive materials, conductive acetate, heating elements, luminescent materials, and conductive paints and glues.           Course Syllabus            The Art of Graphics Programming (ITPG-GT.2901) - Patrick Hebron            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2014         In this course, we will study graphics programming as a medium for artistic expression. !   We will look at the technical capabilities and limitations of the OpenGL and GLSL   platforms so that we can apply these technologies to our creative work with greater   freedom and clarity.      OpenGL topics will include: drawing primitives, complex geometries and point clouds;   transformations and matrices; perspective and orthographic cameras; lighting and   textures. We will also study the GLSL shader language and its application to 2D image   processing as well as to the manipulation and stylization of 3D geometries.      The course will be taught in C++ and Cinder. There will be weekly programming exercises   and a \ufb01nal assignment. Prior experience with C++ and Cinder is not strictly necessary.   However, students without prior C++ experience should expect to spend some extra time   acclimating to the environment.       This two credit course will meet the first six weeks of the semester.              Course Syllabus            The Code of Music (ITPG-GT.2653) - Luisa Pereira Hors            Offered: Fall 2014         This course explores how music works through the lenses of computation and interaction design.      Students will develop generative sequencers and create interfaces to play with their rules. These sequencers can take the form of physical devices, digital applications, or spatial installations.      We will start by looking into the elements of music \u2013rhythm, melody, and harmony in particular\u2013 and into features music theorists have found in music from past and present. We\u2019ll investigate computational techniques such as repetition, randomization, and transformation, and study and play with existing generative algorithms.      Special attention will be given to interaction and interface design. Assignments will range from weekly directed exercises to the more open ended midterm and final projects. ICM or equivalent programming experience is required.                                   Course Syllabus            The Da Vinci Code (ITPG-GT.2934) - Yael Kanarek            Offered: Spring 2012         What\u2019s between Leonardo Da Vinci and code? In this seminar-studio course we tap into the polymath mind of the genius artist-engineer. His 7000 pages organized in codices serve as a creative framework for surveying contemporary digital art. We will built the syllabus collaboratively mining topics from Da Vinci's notebooks. We\u2019ll compare the universe Da Vinci lived in with the universe we live in to consider a deeper insight into how the technologies we develop change how we know and experience the world. As an \"unlearnt\u201d man, Da Vinci\u2019s ravenous interests grew out of methods of observation, experimentation and invention. As we review digital art practices in the areas of his study and inventions warfare, flight, anatomy, robotic, geometry, architecture, painting and more, we will focus on exercising our own capacity to invent. Every week we will conceive a new object or approach, from the practical to the outrageous. These inventions will be drawn in the style of Da Vinci\u2019s manuscripts.                  Course Syllabus            The Fungus Among Us (ITPG-GT.2607) - Marina Zurkow            Offered: Spring 2014         We live among the vast and relatively unknown Kingdom of Fungi. Mycelial networks have been likened to social and communications networks. What do we have in common with mushrooms? What can we learn from them? Fungi communicate, remediate, and decompose. They are used as food, medicine, spiritual guides, and material building blocks. Some are crucial to the soil food web; others will kill you. Fungi are closer to Animalia than to Plantae, and only 5% of the Fungi have been classified.      Students will explore fungi through reading, writing and interacting with fungi, and making two projects that explore the physical and conceptual material covered in class. Readings that span the biological, theoretical, social and creative will include Paul Stamets, Dale Pendell, Anna Tsing, and Gilles Deleuze. No technical skills are covered in this class, however students are asked to use \"technologies\" in the creation of projects, which might include digital media, cooking, mycotecture, or working with existent fungal communities.                                            This two-credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester.                                       Course Syllabus            The Nature of Code (ITPG-GT.2480) - Daniel Shiffman            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013, Spring 2014         Can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software? Can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world world help us to create digital worlds? This class focuses on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems. We explore topics ranging from basic mathematics and physics concepts to more advanced simulations of complex systems. Subjects covered include physics simulation, trigonometry, fractals, cellular automata, self-organization, and genetic algorithms. Examples are demonstrated using the Processing ( http://www.processing.org ) environment with a focus on object oriented programming. We will also look at how to implement the examples in native JavaScript using a new framework p5.js . Much of the class time will be dedicated to in-class exercises and self-study as the course is available online through a video series and textbook .      Prerequisite: H79.2233 Introduction to Computational Media or equivalent programming experience.                                                     Course Syllabus            The Nature of Code: Cosmos Edition (ITPG-GT.2545) - Daniel Shiffman            Offered: Fall 2013         In this all day workshop, we will investigate strategies and techniques for visualizing and simulating the universe. We'll look at data sets related to stellar cartography for as well investigate shaders and other advanced graphics techniques for creating the visual look and feel of outer space. Examples will be demonstrated in Processing but students can use any environment they like.      This one point course will meet twice. The first day will be an all day workshop looking at code examples, and will be held on Saturday, October 26 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Students will then work on a mini-project which they will present the following week on Friday, November 1 from 3:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. .                                     The Quantified Self on Location (ITPG-GT.2069) - Arlene Ducao            Offered: Spring 2014         The Quantified Self About Town       How can we take advantage of the connected technologies transforming individual data to massively larger scales in time and space? From smartphones to wearables, from social media to quantified self, the aggregation and geo-location of data is becoming a major part of how our spaces, cities, and regions are assessed and planned.    In this class, we'll look at how we can design and deploy with some of the most commonly hackable instruments-- microcontrollers, sensors, and phones-- that collect environmental, social, biological, and personal data. Students will learn to access the computing and geo-visualization resources they need to deploy their own data collection instruments in the urban environment.    The class will kick off with findings from a January 2015 workshop at MIT called \"Physical Computing and Urban Studies,\" in which students will consider the political, historical, and social underpinnings of how sensors are used in urban studies and planning. MIT and NYU students will be encouraged to advise each other on issues around collection and analysis of geo-located bio-data.     Course Syllabus            The Temporary Expert: Research-based Art and Design Practice (ITPG-GT.2547) - Marina Zurkow            Offered: Fall 2013, Fall 2014         Cultivating a \u201cResearch-based Practice\u201d requires an artist/designer to be a pioneer, a detective and a mystic all in one.         What does it look like to make work in, through and as research? How do you follow a hunch? Engage experts and passersby to explore both legitimate AND preposterous leads? Be expansive? How do you leave your own trail of documentation that can contribute to a body of knowledge beyond the products of your own art? These forms of research may mix a variety of scientific and intuitive methods. The artist/designer is free to employ speculation, open-endedness, and irony; to use design as a way to probe or even provoke the chosen fields of inquiry.      The class is devoted to the question of how to initiate and investigate research and incorporate it intelligently and sensitively into your work. This class is about developing your own idiosyncratic and well-documented means of pulling threads, following leads, and becoming fearless about asking for help and others\u2019 expertise. You become a temporary expert.         Through hands-on practice, case studies, guest speakers from both art and science, and readings on ethnography, research, and the idea of a public, we will explore method, documentation and presentation of your research, and the merits of both success and failure.         Student work is divided into two 3-week research areas and one final 5-week research project. All topics will have historical, technological and social components to explore. Research includes ethnography, interviews, published papers, media, video, drawing, visiting archives, and at least three face-to-face meetings with strangers for each of the assignments. We will look at artist and designers whose work is based on research, and ones whose work IS the research (art in the form of lecture, field notes, tours, experiments, etc).                                   Course Syllabus            The Tool and the Truth (ITPG-GT.2673) - Carol Dysinger            Offered: Fall 2014         The Tool and the Truth: a collaborative discussion between grad film and ITP on creative rigor and technology      This class is about the dialogue between the imagination and the tool. We will look at how new tools change what is possible and new ideas create the necessity for previously unimagined tools. Specifically we will look at the tools of doc filmmaking, and how the tool changed what audiences believed to be real or true.      First, in each class we will look at a case study \u2013 of an invention that changed the nature of documentary in it\u2019s time. We will observe and discuss how each tool shifted what the eye and the brain will accept. From the invention of the silent film camera, the addition of sound to the acquisition of mobility. From black and white to color, from live to replay, from video to digital to web based interactive, data mapping, surveillance and immersive technology. This will take us looking at the work and creative process of Lumiere/ Vertov/ Wiseman/Varda/Morris/Herzog/Retel/Oppenheimer/ and on into the present/future of Sam Greene and Jonathan Harris.      Second, we will look at how those apply to the students own evolving ideas: be it a story idea, an interactive idea, an idea for a tool or a process. If you an idea that is a feeling and not ready to write or build, this is a class where we learn how to do the work before the work, by observing how those that have been on the cutting edge in their own time had to think.      There will be works to view outside of class, as well as a few readings. Idea required -- not necessarily a documentary idea, but one where \u201ctruth\u201d of some kind is the goal. Virtual or physical projects welcome but not required.      This class will be graded on attendance and participation.     http://gradfilm.tisch.nyu.edu/object/DysingerC.html         This two-credit course will meet in the last seven weeks of the semester                 Thesis (ITPG-GT.2102) - Nancy Hechinger, Kathleen Wilson, Despina Papadopoulos, Katherine Dillon, Heather Greer, Eric Rosenthal, Gabe Barcia-Colombo, Georgia Krantz            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013, Spring 2014         This course is designed to help students define and execute their final thesis project in a setting that is both collegial and critical. It is structured as a series of critique and presentation sessions in which various aspects of individual projects are discussed: the project concept, the elaboration, the presentation, the process and time-table, the resources needed to accomplish it, and the documentation. Critique sessions are e a combination of internal sessions (i.e., the class only) and reviews by external guest critics. Students are expected to complete a fully articulated thesis project description and related documentation. Final project prototypes are displayed both on the web and in a public showcase either in May or the following semester.                                                                                                                                                     Thesis 2015 Candidates (ITPG-GT.2111) - Nancy Hechinger            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2014                                           To Remember and Forget: Memory and Machine (ITPG-GT.2657) - Taeyoon Choi            Offered: Fall 2014         What happens in our brain when we remember and when we forget something? How is our sense of memory transforming living with computational technology in daily life? How do we rely on the mobile devices to assist our short term memory and to create permanent storage?      Memory has always been interest to artists and scientists. Writers such as Marcel Proust and Walter Benjamin explored memory mechanism through narrative and metaphor. Freud, originally trained as a neurologist, developed foundation for modern psychoanalysis.      Neuroplasticity means brain's ability to change and adapat as a result of experience. Placticity in synapses is the core mechanism that enable human memory. We become conscious by remembering things past and anticipating things to come.      Revolutionary developments in computer science and neuroscience around the 1960s occurred simultaneously. Recognition of Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence, and sometimes its misunderstanding, continues to inspire the notions of thinking and feeling machines in popular culture. Progress in neuroscience and understanding of human memory had less apparent effect in the realm of art and culture until recently.      This class is an artistic exploration of the connection between neural plasticity and computability. Each class will begin with a lecture on memory and technical inventions, as well as history of disciplines and work of art and literature. The class will explore low level and high level approach to plasticity and computability through reading and demonstration. In class activity will include group discussion and student presentation.      Over seven weeks period, students will create two prototypes accompanied by short writing about human memory and technology, first one will be a system to help them remember and the second one will be a device to help them forget. Students are expected to bring in their skills in programming and physical computing to realize their projects.         This two credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester.                                Course Syllabus            Towers of Power (1 credit) (ITPG-GT.2617) - Benedetta Piantella, Nicholas Johnson            Offered: Spring 2014         In this two-credit course we will learn how the GSM network works and will explore cellphone technologies and how to get your projects communicating with a cell carrier. This course will mainly be structured in two parts, the first will be dedicated to learning about the current GSM infrastructure and how the communication between cell phones and the network happens; we will be introducing open source alternatives, both hardware and software, for setting up and deploying your own GSM network as a way to better understand the different components of the system. The second part will focus on getting a hands on experience with off the shelf GSM modules, modems and mobile hardware (possibly to build your own cellphone!) and on getting those devices communicating with cellphone networks via text message (SMS) and via data transfer (GPRS). We will have open workshop sessions for further developing your mini-project and presenting it to the rest of the class as well as guest speakers. Pcomp and basic programming skills are required.       This two-credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester.                     Course Syllabus            Understanding Networks (ITPG-GT.2808) - Thomas Igoe            Offered: Fall 2012, Fall 2013, Fall 2014         Interactive technologies seldom stand alone. They exist in networks, and they facilitate networked connections between people. Designing technologies for communications requires an understanding of networks. This course is a foundation in how networks work. Through weekly readings and class discussions and a series of short hands-on projects, students gain an understanding of network topologies, how the elements of a network are connected and addressed, what protocols hold them together, and what dynamics arise in networked environments. This class is intended to supplement the many network-centric classes at ITP. It is broad survey, both of contemporary thinking about networks, and of current technologies and methods used in creating them. Prerequisites: Students should have an understanding of basic programming (Intro to Computational Media or equivalent). Familiarity with physical computing (Intro to Physical Computing or equivalent) is helpful, but not essential. Some, though not all, production work in the class requires programming and possibly physical and electronic construction. There is a significant reading component to this class as well.      Possible topics include:      * topologies: how to think about them (nodes and links), how few workable ones there are, and how there's no topology so stupid it isn't in use some place.   * addressing and routing: what a namespace is, three ways to generate a name (nesting, serial uniqueness, random pseudo- uniqueness), the difference between smart and dumb networks, why the phone network and the internet differ even though they use the same wires   * protocols: envelopes and contents, the stack and the reference lie, end-to-end principles, reliability vs. speed tradeoffs   * scale: more is different, scale breaks otherwise workable systems, makes redundancy and degeneracy critical, tends to push systems   * a discussion of security and its effects      Possible exercises include:   * Basic socket communication, both software and embedded hardware versions   * Client-server programming   * A group protocol/messaging exercise   * An HTTP/RESTian model exercise                           Course Syllabus            Video for New Media (ITPG-GT.2256) - Gabe Barcia-Colombo            Offered: Summer1 2012         In 1967 the Sony Portapak became the first portable video system available to the public. Suddenly motion pictures became accessible to artists, experimenters and social activists, not simply Hollywood production companies. The introduction of the Portapak had a great influence not only on the development of ITP but also on the way we create, consume and distribute media today. How do we create video that is non-linear yet compelling, interactive yet engaging? The goal of this class is to provide an overview of both the history of video, and its relevance to present day new media. Topics covered include aesthetics and concepts, camera usage, editing, lighting, as well as an introduction to interactive video software such as Jitter and Isadora. Through a series of weekly experiments and assignments, students gain experience with video blogging, short format documentary style, post linear narrative, interactive video installations as well as theatrical video design. Previous video experience is not required and experimentation is highly encouraged!                                                             Video For The Web (ITPG-GT.2256) - Craig Protzel            Offered: Summer2 2013         Whether shot with an iphone and pieced together through a $.99 app or filmed on a Canon 5D DSLR and meticulously arranged through high-end editing software, video of all shapes and sizes exist throughout the web. Given the accessibility of tools, how do we create video that is non-linear yet compelling, interactive yet engaging? The goal of this class is to introduce students to the fundamentals of video production and storytelling through the context of short form content intended for the web. Specific genres covered will include trailers, promos, educational videos, documentaries, journalistic pieces, and web series. In the first three weeks of the class, students will learn the basics of both audio and video recording using a variety of cameras and audio recorders. Specific topics covered will include scripts and storyboards, camera usage, editing, lighting, and sound. Students will develop, produce, and finish 3 separate short form pieces of content based on conceptual prompts and technical constraints. The second half of the class will focus specifically on interactive applications of video on the web. A variety of use cases will be covered and students will be encouraged to concept and develop their own final web-based video project. Some web development will be covered but this is not a web development course. Guest speakers from companies/organizations including HBO, Vimeo, and the Boston Globe will join us to share first-hand industry experiences. Overall, course work will include reading assignments and 4 short-form video projects. No prior technical skills are required.                                                     Course Syllabus            Video Sculpture (ITPG-GT.2722) - Gabe Barcia-Colombo            Offered: Spring 2012, Spring 2013, Summer1 2013         Video is the new marble. In this class we breathe new life into video as a medium for creating engaging interactive physical sculpture. Video is no longer a flat screen based medium. How do we create video sculptures that move, emote and react to our presence? The course takes video off the screen and into the world of three-dimensional space in the form of site-specific and or physical installations. Through a series of weekly experiments and assignments, students work with projection, tiny LCD screens, physical sensors and interactive software to hack video into interactive sculptures in the tradition of Nam Jun Paik, Tony Oursler and Camille Utterback. Class is divided between lectures, guest speakers and critical discussion/presentation of work. Previous knowledge of video production / editing is not required, but a mad scientist-like lust to bring video to life is highly encouraged.                                   Course Syllabus            Visualizing JS (ITPG-GT.2953) - Stewart Smith            Offered: Fall 2012         JavaScript is increasingly used to generate visuals in the browser and beyond\u2014and it has some very interesting, but often misunderstood properties. How is prototypal inheritance different than classical inheritance? What's more object-oriented, Java or JavaScript? How can we build visuals that take advantage of lambdas and code-as-data? Our course will focus on three things: 1. JavaScript's unique and exciting properties, 2. Generating visuals (both printed and screen-based / animated) using contemporary JS and HTML5 frameworks (like Paper.js, Scriptographer, Three.js, ProtoViz, etc.), and 3. Design as critical visual thinking\u2014rather than simply a veneer. Assignments will range from thought experiments, to printed posters, to interactive animations. Guest critics from both code and design backgrounds will frequently drop by to challenge and inspire students.     Course Syllabus            Wasteland Fiction (ITPG-GT.2659) - Jon Cohrs            Offered: Fall 2014         Wasteland Fiction is a workshop that looks at future possibilities for urban wilderness and wastelands in areas such as the New Jersey Meadowlands, Freshkills Park and Newtown creek. We will look at these landscapes through the lens of the anthropocene, a new geologic era created by humans. Instead of focusing on the dark side of this discussion, the course will use a combination of storytelling(design fiction) and rapid prototyping to envision alternate scenarios for such landscapes in the near future.    Week 1. The course will begin with a workshop on story telling, design fiction and a discussion on the anthropocene. Using critique, humor and possibly a touch of idealism the students will write stories that look at landscapes such as the New Jersey Meadowlands 10-15 years into the future.   Week 2. We will focus on creating a rapid prototype of an object that helps to elaborate and bring their story to life. Working in small groups, they will prototype an aspect of one of their stories. An example might be boots with built in hydrocarbon sensors so kids can safely play in brownfields or a wildlife cam to coordinate a mixed-use shopping center; humans by day, animals by night.   Week 3. On the final day, the workshop will take a seven-minute train ride into the New Jersey Meadowlands. This will be an opportunity the field test everyone\u2019s prototypes and provide a context for people\u2019s projects on top of an overgrown abandoned garbage dump. Bring your rubber boots.       This one-credit course will meet on Friday, September 5, Saturday, September 13, and Saturday, September 20 from 12:10 p.m. to 3:05.                             Waving at the Machines (ITPG-GT.2954) - James Bridle            Offered: Fall 2012         We are living in a world that has not fully absorbed the societal and individual implications of networks and new technologies, but is already saturated with the vernacular implementations of these things. These seminars will focus on examples of these technologies and their effects, and on how we may group and communicate them, using the example of the New Aesthetic, a project of recognition and classification. In this class students will explore the many variations of technologically mediated and co-produced artworks, artefacts and experiences, and build individual practices of categorisation and communication. The goal of the course is to enable and advance critical thinking around new technologies in all their manifestations, and develop the tools of practice, visualisation and communication required to perform this thinking. Students will be expected to develop their own methods of communicating this experience in the form of their choice, through writing, speaking, making or curation, with a view to informing their own work in the future.           When Strangers Meet (ITPG-GT.2762) - Kio Stark            Offered: Spring 2012         Even the simplest exchange among strangers can contain a tangled accumulation of meanings: what transpires may have physical, emotional, social, political, technological and historical dimensions. This class takes an analytical approach to unraveling and understanding these charged moments. In the process of the studying how and why strangers interact in public, we address some of the abiding themes at ITP\u2014urban behavior, spontaneous interaction, the pleasure of the unexpected, how technology can mediate and/or enable human experience\u2014and we make a close and thorough examination of how they play out in this narrow slice of human experience. This approach is designed to bring students to a more concrete understanding of these larger abstract ideas. Classwork consists of readings, class discussions, field assignments (a series of assigned interactions with strangers that the students will document and discuss) and an analytical final paper. Students learn how the interactions of strangers have changed historically (and why), what the experience of interaction with strangers means to the participants, how strangers 'read' each other, how they initiate interactions, how they avoid interactions, how they trust each other and how they fool each other. Readings range from seminal works on urban sociology and public behavior (Georg Simmel, Stanley Milgram, Erving Goffman, Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte, Elijah Anderson) to more lyrical examinations of strangers in cities (Tim Etchells, Italo Calvino, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Edgar Allan Poe) to recent neuropsychiatric discoveries about trust, mimicry, and flash judgments. Because stranger interactions are at heart a means to interrupt the expected narrative of the everyday, we consider the works of artists and thinkers who show how such disruption, surprise, spontaneity, and play are fundamental to the pleasure and substance of urban life, for example: the Situationists and their descendents, Sophie Calle, Marina Abramovic, Francis Alys, Graffiti Research Lab, Robert Rauschenberg, Survival Research Labs. We also explore recent art/technology projects that specifically engage strangers, such as Familiar Strangers, the Listening Station, PostSecret, Oddible, Loca: Set to Discoverable, Following/the Man in the Crowd, Mobile Feelings, and others.                               Course Syllabus            Wildlife Observation Tools: Interaction in the Wild (ITPG-GT.2824) - Thomas Igoe            Offered: Spring 2012         Wildlife tracking and observation presents a number of technological challenges.These challenges are related to common interaction design problems with humans, so understanding and mastering them is valuable experience for interaction designers. For zoologists, anthropologists, and veterinary researchers, understanding the technologies behind their tracking equipment, and the methods that technology designers use to develop these tools can benefit their research.      The goal of this class is to give students an introduction to the technological challenges associated with observing and tracking wildlife in remote environments. As a focal case study, students are presented with the practical problems faced by professorAnthony Di Fiore's primate research group, which is involved in studying several nonhuman primate species in the Amazon region of Ecuador. Students will discuss the research group's workflow, survey the state of the art in animal tracking, and work in groups to develop interactive prototypes to address one or more specific challenges facing tropical wildlife biologists.      In order to realize the goals of this class, students will be introduced to current tracking tools and remote observation tools, including radiocollars, camera traps, GPS receivers and other emerging technologies. This semester, we will place a greater focus on radio communications and tracking technologies and on understanding mapping technologies, to help focus projects on tracking applications. This class is part introduction and part interaction design lab with real-world end users. The goal is not only to understand the challenges, but to help develop solutions that could be used in the field in Ecuador and other places.
