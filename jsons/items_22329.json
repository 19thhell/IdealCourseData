The degree also features a concentration, in either public relations management or corporate and organizational communication; a practicum project in which you prepare, present, and potentially launch a communication plan that meets a real need for a real organization; and a capstone project, which is a publication-ready thesis paper that makes an original contribution to the field.   The program is designed to meet the needs of both working professionals and full-time students, allowing opportunities for either part-time or full-time study in any semester. It can be completed in two years of full-time study, or in up to five years of part-time study.   The program, though mainly classroom-based, also is making important strides with distance learning, especially with respect to the pedagogical methodologies that will work best in what has been called &quot;The Age of the Conversation.&quot;           Expand All   Collapse All          Core Curriculum        The core curriculum is designed to provide you with a deep and broad foundation that supports concentration coursework and serves you throughout your career. Students are required to take all of the following courses.     Students enrolled prior to fall 2009 may use Social Media: Objectives, Strategies, Tactics as a concentration elective course requirement.

The degree also features a concentration, in either public relations management or corporate and organizational communication; a practicum project in which you prepare, present, and potentially launch a communication plan that meets a real need for a real organization; and a capstone project, which is a publication-ready thesis paper that makes an original contribution to the field.   The program is designed to meet the needs of both working professionals and full-time students, allowing opportunities for either part-time or full-time study in any semester. It can be completed in two years of full-time study, or in up to five years of part-time study.   The program, though mainly classroom-based, also is making important strides with distance learning, especially with respect to the pedagogical methodologies that will work best in what has been called &quot;The Age of the Conversation.&quot;           Expand All   Collapse All          Core Curriculum        The core curriculum is designed to provide you with a deep and broad foundation that supports concentration coursework and serves you throughout your career.
