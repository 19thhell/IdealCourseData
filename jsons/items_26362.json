If prerequisite coursework is required, these credits must be taken in addition to those required for the M.S. degree. Students who need to fulfill prerequisites do not need to complete them before enrolling in the graduate program. Instead, the Department enrolls students in the Foods and Nutrition master's program to permit registration in undergraduate prerequisite courses. The Prerequisite Sequence Map should help in planning course sequencing.    Prerequisites include the following NYU courses (or their equivalents taken elsewhere with the prior approval of a HOND program advisor). At least two chemistry courses, with their respective laboratory sessions, must be taken.
