E. Peters     From the Preface  Muhammad stands at the Islamic center, of course, as he has from the  beginning; and those who have sought to stand beside him, or even  perhaps within him, have essayed biographies of the Prophet of  Islam....The present work is biographical, but it is at the same time  something broader. It is an inquiry --or perhaps a joint inquiry since  the reader will be provided with the same sources available to the  historian-- into the religious environment of the person Muslims hail as  the \"Envoy of God\" and an attempt to trace his progress along the path  from paganism to that distintive form of monotheism called Islam .  The Arabic word islam means \"submission,\" and though we may never  come to any firm conviction as to why this man first \"submitted\" to the  Almighty God in Western Arabia in the seventh Christian century, then  persistently and persuasively convinced others to do likewise, we do  have at hand a large body of evidence to enable us to try, as well as a  long tradition of scholarship from Muslims and non-Muslims who have  gone before along this way.
