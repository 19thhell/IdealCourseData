These courses are required by the   professional schools, not by the undergraduate colleges. Fortunately,   the requirements for the four-year doctoral programs in most of the   healthcare professions are similar.    You should plan on taking the following courses:             Course No.    Course Title    Prerequisites       CHEM-UA 125    General Chemistry I &amp; Lab    MATH-UA 9 (or calculus ready)       CHEM-UA 126    General Chemistry II &amp; Lab    CHEM-UA 125       BIOL-UA 11    Principles of Biology I    CHEM-UA 125 (pre- or co-requisite)       BIOL-UA 12    Principles of Biology II    BIOL-UA 11 or permission, CHEM-UA 126 (pre- or co-requisite)    BIOL-UA 123 Principles of Biology Lab BIOL-UA 11 or permission    CHEM-UA 225    Organic Chemistry I &amp; Lab    CHEM-UA 126       CHEM-UA 226    Organic Chemistry II &amp; Lab    CHEM-UA 225    *CHEM-UA 881 (or equivalent) Biochemistry I CHEM-UA 226     PHYS-UA 11    General Physics I    MATH-UA 121       PHYS-UA 12    General Physics II    PHYS-UA 11       MATH-UA 121    Calculus I (or AP Calculus)    http://www.math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/calculus.html       EXPOS-UA 1    Writing the Essay          ENGL-UA/EXPOS-UA    English Elective     *1-2 Social/Behavioral science courses  Varied (consult with your adivsor)   *These courses are strongly recommended for all students preparing to take the MCAT2015 exam in the spring of 2015 and beyond    These courses are the minimum requirements. Some schools may   require additional courses, particularly in mathematics and/or   biochemistry. You should familiarize yourself with the requirements for   those schools to which you think you may apply. The best source for this   information is the AAMC publication \"Medical Schools Admissions   Requirements.\"    The specific prehealth requirements outlined above must be completed   before you matriculate into medical school. Since the MCAT is based upon   the assumption that you have completed these courses, the normal   procedure is to complete them before sitting for this examination.    You are probably most concerned about the science requirements and we   will certainly address that below. For the moment, begin by noting the non-science requirements: Writing the Essay and English. Take them and all   your liberal arts courses, even Core requirements, seriously; medical   and other health professional schools want and value applicants who can   write well and conduct research. A word to the wise: the English course   really should be taken in the English Department, as this is what   medical and other schools expect and as it may avoid any confusion. Do not take a course on literature in   translation and hope that the schools will accept it; some may, but   others may challenge it and require you to send them your course   description and syllabus.    As a general rule of thumb, all prehealth students will take General   Chemistry (plus labs), Calculus (if no AP credit), and Writing the Essay   as freshmen, regardless of their intended major. Potential Biology,   Biochemistry, and Neural Science majors should take Biology during the   first year in addition to General Chemistry. Students must take General   Chemistry either before or with Biology.    Physics majors must take the \"majors only\" Physics I-II-III (PHYS-UA   91, PHYS-UA 93, PHYS-UA 95) and Labs I-II-III (PHYS-UA 92, PHYS-UA 94,   PHYS-UA 96) - not General Physics I and II (PHYS-UA 11-12). Biology majors are not required to take Principles of Biology Lab (BIOL-UA 123). After the first year, non-science majors traditionally take Biology   as sophomores, along with either Organic Chemistry (plus labs) or   General Physics, because medical and other schools prefer applicants who   take at least one year of \u201cdouble science.\u201d This leaves one science   sequence for non-science majors to take in their junior year. They are   strongly advised to take additional science courses as seniors.    In addition to these prehealth courses, you will also need to complete all the requirements for your Bachelor's degree.    NOTE: PREMED, PREDENTAL, PREVET STUDENTS SHOULD NOT TAKE COURSES IN   NURSING, NUTRITION, OR THE OT DEPARTMENT TO IMPROVE THEIR MATH/SCIENCE   GPA\u2014THESE COURSES ARE DESIGNATED BY AMCAS AS ALLIED HEALTH COURSES.    ALSO, MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY IS NOW A PREREQUISITE TO ALMOST   EVERY BIOLOGY COURSE AFTER PRINCIPLES. THE BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT WILL NOT   WAIVE THIS REQUIREMENT.             Advanced placement credit, previous college credit, and foreign credit   One question that frequently arises is, \u201cHow do colleges and medical   schools view students who have earned Advanced Placement credit, foreign   transfer credit, and/or college credit while in high school?\u201d These   situations may sound very similar, and undergraduate colleges treat them   all in the same way. However, most medical schools do not treat these   credits the same way a four-year college does. Upon admission to the   freshman class, NYU will grant credit towards the bachelor's degree for   most Advanced Placement test scores of 4 or 5, and for courses from an   accredited Foreign or U.S. College. For full details, consult the   current College of Arts and Science Bulletin.    How medical schools view these credits Here, the situation is   different: although some medical schools do accept Advanced Placement   credit to satisfy prehealth admissions requirements, many do not. Nor   are the individual schools entirely clear or consistent on this matter.   Even if a certain medical or health professional school does accept AP   credit, you will be a much stronger candidate for admission if you take   all of your science courses in college (rather than resting on your high   school laurels). A good rule of thumb is: If you can present an   official transcript from a four-year U.S. college with a grade for   these subjects, you are safe; if not, you may have difficulties. With   most U.S. college credit, therefore, you have no problems, although   students are warned that science courses taken at a local college while   in high school may not be as rigorous as NYU's science classes, and   therefore may not prepare you well for the MCAT or for upper-level   science if you choose to take it. Students in this situation may need to   repeat science courses here. With Advanced Placement credit and   foreign transfer credit, you may experience difficulty with medical   schools, and it is therefore necessary to approach the topic with some   caution. Each subject has its own peculiarities and we will consider   each separately. For all of these situations, please keep in   mind that skipping over an introductory-level science class has led to   poor grades in the more advanced courses for more than one student in   the past\u2014even for those who were A students in high school science   classes and had AP credit. That is why you are often advised to forfeit   your AP credit or previous college credit in the sciences and begin with   introductory courses.    AP Biology AP credit in biology is considered preparation for   Principles of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11-12) at NYU. The vast majority   of students forfeit their AP credit and take Principles here. This is a   good thing, because all medical schools require one year of biology taken in college. Only a tiny number of students are   allowed, based on their score, to use their AP credit to skip Principles   of Biology altogether. They place into Molecular and Cellular Biology,   which they are not allowed to take until sophomore year. This is the case for two reasons: 1)   Principles of Biology will give you a superb foundation for the   Biological Sciences section of the MCAT, much better than your AP course   ever could. 2) Medical schools require one year of biology with   labs. If   during and after taking the Molecular and Cell Biology sequence, a   student elects not to continue with the biology major, he or she will   still need one year of biology coursework with lab.    AP Chemistry Prehealth students with Advanced Placement credit in   chemistry must forfeit their AP credit and take the subject here. Advanced General Chemistry is a heavily   Calculus and Physics based course. To enroll in Advanced General Chemistry you must provide evidence of earning a 4 or better on the AP Calculus exam, have completed one year of high school physics and, and have completed one year of high   school chemistry (AP chemistry preferred). Students must also pass the placement exam which is held during CAS orientation.    AP Physics The only way to satisfy the two-semester physics   requirement with AP credit is to score a 5 on the Physics B exam, or to   score a 4 or 5 on both of the Physics C exams. Even if you can meet   this high standard, you will be a much stronger candidate for medical   school if you take physics at NYU. Many medical schools prefer that you   take physics in college, and some have been known not to accept AP   credit. The safest thing for non-physics majors to do is to forfeit   their AP credit and take General Physics I and II (PHYS-UA 11-12) at   NYU. Using your AP credit to skip over General Physics and go into a   more advanced course is not advisable for non-majors. Note that   the Physics I-II-III sequence, with accompanying labs (PHYS-UA 91,   PHYS-UA 93, PHYS-UA 95, and PHYS-UA 92, PHYS-UA 94, PHYS-UA 96) is only   recommended for physics majors. If you start this three-course sequence,   you must finish it, to ensure that you have the requisite labs that   some medical schools require and the background you will need for the   MCAT. The physics sequence at NYU is very challenging and   markedly different from AP Physics courses taken in high school. You   should always consult with a department advisor to determine course   sequencing.    AP Mathematics Some medical schools require one or two semesters   of college math, and most of these schools will accept AP credit.    Foreign college credit If you have foreign college credit in   the sciences and do not want to retake the corresponding course or take   one of the higher-level alternatives, please reconsider. Medical schools   strongly advise or require that all of the required prehealth science   courses be taken at an American institution. However, you may   opt to have your foreign transcript evaluated by a reputable evaluation   agency. You would be well-advised to call early to several medical   schools to which you plan to apply to obtain a consensus on \"acceptable\"   evaluation agencies. Do this early as many agencies have to get   information from the foreign schools you attended, and these schools may   take months (even years) to respond.
