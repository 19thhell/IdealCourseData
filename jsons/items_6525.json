There&rsquo;s also the basketball shooting contests and football theme park  set up for movies premiering on TriBeCa/ESPN Sports Day. Since it was launched from the  ashes of 9/11&mdash;in just 120 days&mdash;more than two million visitors have flocked  to the festival, and it has screened over 1,100 films from more than 80 countries.

Festival Co-Founders Robert de Niro and Jane Rosenthal, who has produced many of the actor&rsquo;s films,  including Meet the Parents .

In 2007, she created a year-round industry department to put  those who acquire films directly in touch with the artists who make them. That same year,  34 films that premiered at TriBeCa were acquired for distribution&mdash;almost double the  number from the previous year. Documentaries have found the most success, with Taxi to the  Dark Side taking home the 2008 Oscar and Pray the Devil Back to Hell landing on the short  list this year after both premiered at TriBeCa. &ldquo;Our birth was about what we could do  for our community, so that will always be our roots,&rdquo; Rosenthal says. But the festival  is making its name by striking an unusual balance among the fun, art, and business of film.       Each Spring, Tribeca takes over the streets outside the festival&rsquo;s film screenings with (counterclockwise)  Performers, Games, and a drive-in on the Hudson.    Seven years old, TriBeCa is still the new guy amidst a sea of well-established film  festivals: Cannes began back in 1946, the New York Film Festival is approaching its 50th run,  and even the hip indie-fest Sundance started out as the United States Film Festival in 1978,  before Robert Redford transformed it years later.

Right away, though, TriBeCa was able to separate itself from its uptown neighbor.  The New York Film Festival, which The New York Times has described as &ldquo;elitist,&rdquo;  selects just 28 features each year with no competitive categories or prizes. In contrast,  TriBeCa recognizes outstanding films with an array of awards for features, shorts, and  documentaries, and a handful of prizes for films made in or about New York.   For viewers, the NYFF feels like a private Upper West Side cocktail soiree to  TriBeCa&rsquo;s raucous downtown block party, where the box office hit   Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones premiered alongside the chick-flick Divine  Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood , just blocks from the Oscar-nominated Norwegian film   Elling during the inaugural festival. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s New York and there&rsquo;s not  just one type of filmgoer here,&rdquo; director of programming David Kwok explains.  &ldquo;You have your cinephiles, but you also have the recreational filmgoer, so our  hope is to be able to cross those audiences.&rdquo;       Michael Jackson&rsquo;s Thriller comes to life with a zombie dance disco.    &ldquo;The key is to have as many voices as you can and especially voices that are not often explored or exposed,&rdquo; adds Sharon Badal (TSOA &rsquo;80, GAL &rsquo;92), who programs short films for the festival in addition to her role as associate teacher at the Tisch School of the Arts. Those voices come from all over the world, in foreign films that would otherwise have a difficult time reaching U.S. audiences, but also from the festival&rsquo;s own backyard with community-based cinema like those discovered through the TriBeCa All Access program, which connects filmmakers from underrepresented groups with industry professionals.  As they&rsquo;ve found their equilibrium over the years, Rosenthal says, the festival  has refocused its program by cutting down the number of features it screens to 85 from as many  as 174 in 2006.
