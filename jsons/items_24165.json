Commission activities support critical inquiry into hierarchies of power affecting the interweaving social locations of gender, race, class, sexual orientation, age, ability, culture, nationality, religion, and related areas. In this spirit, the commission seeks to promote inter-change among faculty concerned with social justice and to work toward the following goals.  To create arenas in which to address issues pertaining to gender, race, and social justice  and, in particular, to encourage the professions represented in the Steinhardt School of Education  to become more responsive to these issues.  To foster and integrate feminist and other critical scholarship that focuses on hierarchies  of privilege as they affect individuals and groups in diverse social locations.  To encourage teaching that addresses social justice issues in the various disciplines and professions,  as these issues impact on both individuals and communities.  To provide a supportive and collegial context for faculty interested in issues of gender, race,  and social justice within the school, the University, and the broader community.

At its core, the undergraduate Program encourages students to question the meanings of \"male\" and \"female,\" as well as of sexual norms, in both Western and non-Western societies. Courses seek to unravel the ways in which ideas about gender and sexuality shape social roles and identities, in addition to the ways in which race, class, and ethnicity function in the experience of gender and sexuality within a culture. Gender and Sexuality Studies challenges the privileging of some categories (i.e., male or heterosexual) over others, along with the social and political implications of such hierarchies.
