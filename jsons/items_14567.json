This book is available in the NYU Bookstore.          Assessment Components     The grade will be based on the two exams and the homework assignments. The weights are 40% for each exam and 20% for the homework assignments.                Group Projects     There will be no group projects, all homework assignments will be required to contain only individual work.          Grading      At NYU Stern we seek to teach challenging courses that allow students to demonstrate their mastery of the subject matter. Assigning grades that reward excellence and reflect differences in performance is important to ensuring the integrity of our curriculum.       In general, students in this elective course can expect a grading distribution where about 50% of students will receive A&rsquo;s for excellent work and the remainder will receive B&rsquo;s for good or very good work. In the event that a student performs only adequately or below, he or she can expect to receive a C or lower.       Note that the actual distribution for this course and your own grade will depend upon how well each of you actually performs in this course.         Re-Grading      The process of assigning grades is intended to be one of unbiased evaluation. Students are encouraged to respect the integrity and authority of the professor&rsquo;s grading system and are discouraged from pursuing arbitrary challenges to it.       If you believe an inadvertent error has been made in the grading of an individual assignment or in assessing an overall course grade, a request to have the grade re-evaluated may be submitted. You must submit such requests in writing to me within 7 days of receiving the grade, including a brief written statement of why you believe that an error in grading has been made.         Professional Responsibilities For This Course      Attendance            Class attendance is essential to your success in this course and is part of your grade. An excused absence can be granted in cases of illness, grave family emergencies, religious observance, or other important reasons.       Students are responsible for the course materials, including lectures, from the first day of this class, forward. It is the student&#39;s obligation to bring oneself up to date on any missed coursework .             Participation        In-class contribution is a significant part of your grade and an important part of our shared learning experience. Your active participation helps me to evaluate your overall performance.   You can excel in this area if you come to class on time and contribute to the course by:         Providing strong evidence of having thought through the material.       Advancing the discussion by contributing insightful comments and questions.       Listening attentively in class.       Demonstrating interest in your peers&#39; comments, questions, and presentations.       Giving constructive feedback to your peers when appropriate.             Assignments            Late assignments will either not be accepted or will incur a grade penalty unless due to serious illness or family emergency. Exceptions to this policy for reasons of religious observance or civic obligation will only be made available when the assignment cannot reasonably be completed prior to the due date and you make arrangements for late submission in advance.             Classroom Norms            Arrive to class on time and stay to the end of the class period. Chronically arriving late or leaving class early is unprofessional and disruptive to the entire class. Repeated tardiness will have an impact on your grade.       Turn off all electronic devices prior to the start of class. Laptops, cell phones and other electronic devices are a distraction to everyone.            Stern Policies       General Behavior    The School expects that students will conduct themselves with respect and professionalism toward faculty, students, and others present in class and will follow the rules laid down by the instructor for classroom behavior. Students who fail to do so may be asked to leave the classroom.        Collaboration on Graded Assignments    Students may not work together on graded assignment unless the instructor gives express permission.        Course Evaluations    Course evaluations are important to us and to students who come after you. Please complete them thoughtfully.         Academic Integrity      Integrity is critical to the learning process and to all that we do here at NYU Stern. As members of our community, all students agree to abide by the NYU Stern Student Code of Conduct, which includes a commitment to:              Exercise integrity in all aspects of one&#39;s academic work including, but not limited to, the preparation and completion of exams, papers and all other course requirements by not engaging in any method or means that provides an unfair advantage.         Clearly acknowledge the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as one&rsquo;s own. Ideas, data, direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), paraphrasing, creative expression, or any other incorporation of the work of others should be fully referenced.         Refrain from behaving in ways that knowingly support, assist, or in any way attempt to enable another person to engage in any violation of the Code of Conduct. Our support also includes reporting any observed violations of this Code of Conduct or other School and University policies that are deemed to adversely affect the NYU Stern community.            The entire Stern Student Code of Conduct applies to all students enrolled in Stern courses and can be found here:       Undergraduate College: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/uc/codeofconduct     Graduate Programs: http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/studentactivities/involved.cfm?doc_id=102505       To help ensure the integrity of our learning community, prose assignments you submit to Blackboard will be submitted to Turnitin. Turnitin will compare your submission to a database of prior submissions to Turnitin, current and archived Web pages, periodicals, journals, and publications. Additionally, your document will become part of the Turnitin database.         Recording of Classes      Your class may be recorded for educational purposes           Students with Disabilities      If you have a qualified disability and will require academic accommodation of any kind during this course, you must notify me at the beginning of the course and provide a letter from the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD, 998-4980, www.nyu.edu/csd ) verifying your registration and outlining the accommodations they recommend. If you will need to take an exam at the CSD, you must submit a completed Exam Accommodations Form to them at least one week prior to the scheduled exam time to be guaranteed accommodation."}]},
