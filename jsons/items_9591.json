The approach will be stylistic, including the development of narrative, various cinematic modernisms, and technological advances such as the introduction of sound; industrial, including the formation of the studio system and the creation of national film cultures in response; and social, including propaganda and political (leftist) films and documentaries. Whenever possible, this course emphasizes the cross-pollination of film styles across national cultures such as the mutual influence of 1920's avant-garde movements, the concentration of political filmmaking in the 1930's, or the influence of neorealism on post-war cinema.

Students will have the   opportunity to draw on these artistic wellsprings, while benefiting from   the peace and inspiration offered by NYU\u2019s Villa La Pietra, surrounded   by 57 acres of gardens and olive groves, where they will live and work. Students enroll in both courses for a total of 8 units. These courses are   designed to complement each other, enabling students to be inspired and   integrate knowledge and firsthand experience of Florence in their   writing. Program Curriculum Students must take the following two courses for a total of 8 units.  Developing the Dramatic Script for Film or Theatre IDWPG-UT 1410.001 4 units Instructor: Len Jenkin In this script development tutorial and writing retreat students will develop, write and revise a full-length stage play or feature-length screenplay through a series of lectures and one-on-one consultations with the instructor, rigorous writing exercises, and sustained writing time. The course focuses on the basic techniques of dramatic writing, including developing the dramatic idea, characterization, plot, dialogue, them and the revision process in film and theatre. The class includes lectures, discussion, analysis, writing exercises, workshop and individual conferences. The summer session culminates in table readings at La Pietra of scenes from the completed work. Additionally, students will be offered a series of retreat experiences. These experiences might include a day of silence; a day of total absorption in a painting, a building, a sculpture; working with drawing and music. While the exercises will vary, the purpose of each will be the same-- to unlock and engage the student\u2019s natural creativity. Students will complete a first draft of a script by the end of the session. Emphasis will be on honing the creative process to enable students to think critically and creatively about a work in progress, incorporating feedback, and completing a project in a limited time frame. Introduction to Italian Cinema ICINE-UT 1103.001 4 units Instructor: Vito Zagarrio The  course is an historical overview of the Italian Film, from the origins up to  today, through the debate on some crucial moments. There is a large re-vision  of Italian Cinema, concerning some Italian history periods which are being  re-discussed, such as the Fascist era and the so called Boom (the economic  growth). The scholars are changing some judgments and the spectators are  changing their taste. As matter of fact, the course will analyze some \u201ccrossing  points\u201d of the Italian film history and investigate the major debates on some crucial  moments of Italian society.   The  Italian Cinema is a good way to study the whole Italian history, society,  ideology and behaviours. The students will have the opportunity to know such  authors as Rossellini, De Sica, Fellini, Antonioni, Visconti, Pasolini, and Bertolucci,  who are well known even in the US. They will deal with the national mode of  production, the notion of \u201cauteur film\u201d.   The main  historical periods are the following: the shift between Fascism and the  Post-war period, the so called \u201cNeorealism\u201d, the economic growth, the sixties  and seventies, and the contemporary time. Main areas of interest will be film  history, the relationship between cinema and the social-political context, and  the different theoretical approaches to film.
