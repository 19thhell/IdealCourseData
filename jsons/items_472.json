This was notably true from the American perspective, since America was so closely associated with Western Europe during the Cold War, in military, economic, political, and cultural alliance against the Soviet bloc that constituted Eastern Europe. The image of the Iron Curtain from Churchill\u2019s famous Fulton, Missouri, speech of 1946 provided the mental architecture for an entire postwar generation thinking about the nature of Europe divided, and led to a mental mapping in which Western Europe was presumed to be the better half (and of course it was \u201cour\u201d half in the Cold War) and Eastern Europe was understood to be lesser, less interesting, less welcoming, more alien, and more backward\u2014 the other and secondary component of the continent. At the same time the countries of Eastern Europe, with their dramatically different national traditions, were presumed to be homogenously all alike\u2014 colored communist grey on Western mental maps of Europe during the Cold War. It was Western Europe that was much more likely to be visited by Americans as vacation air travel became part of middle class life in the 1950s and 1960s, and the glorious sights of London, Paris, and Rome were much more likely to be part of an American\u2019s actual touristic experience of Europe.    One of the consequences of this world political ordering, which lasted for almost half a century from the end of World War II until the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, was a subtly partisan revision of the history of Europe, as it appeared especially in the synthetic textbooks of the second half of the twentieth century. Often focused on the \u201cHistory of the West\u201d or the \u201cHistory of Western Civilization,\u201d these synthetic histories did not synthesize evenly but with a strong western bias. The Italian Renaissance, the German Reformation, the French Revolution, the British Industrial Revolution: these all came clearly into focus. The Russian path was singled out for special contrasting attention. But a whole huge swath of Europe almost disappeared from the narrative of European history, with merely general references to issues of social and political backwardness. In high schools this was even more likely to be true than in colleges, in colleges than in graduate schools, but at every level Eastern Europe was neglected in general histories of the continent, while specialized studies, when they occurred, were grouped together under the general Cold War rubric of \u201cEastern Europe\u201d and often framed and supported with reference to the exigencies of Cold War national security.    Of course, the division of Europe into two geopolitical camps during the Cold War was real and meaningful, but it distorted perspectives on European history in two basic ways: first, by suggesting that Eastern Europe and Western Europe had entirely divergent histories even before the Cold War, and, second, by suggesting that all the lands and peoples of Eastern Europe were related by resemblance to one another in their past histories. This summer seminar will address these distortions head on, attempting to analyze the problems inherent in the historical categories \u201cWestern Europe\u201d and \u201cEastern Europe,\u201d considering different historical frameworks for rethinking the way that different parts of Europe have been related to each other in past centuries, and also exploring alternative political frameworks for rethinking what Europe looks like today in the post-Cold War twenty-first century.    For school teachers, these issues come up whenever European history is taught and discussed at every grade level. In fact, they also come up as an issue of American history when the subject of immigration is taught and discussed with reference to the diversity of national groups who have entered American society from Europe. The cultures of Eastern Europe have too often been represented as \u201cexotic\u201d and \u201cfolkloric\u201d\u2014 emphasizing costumes and dances\u2014 without any real attempt to think through the extremely complex diversity of national histories that have shaped the emigrant communities arriving in the United States. The most recent historical, political, and cultural writing about Eastern Europe has seriously attempted to challenge, analyze, revise, and reconstruct assumptions about Eastern Europe that were taken for granted during the Cold War period, and we hope to make these scholarly issues intellectually meaningful and pedagogically useful for school teachers. Pedagogically we will consider especially negotiating the historical gap that separates teachers who grew up during the Cold War from students who have no memory of the Cold War.    While there will be some lecturing both from the director and the visiting faculty speakers, the substance of the seminar will involve participant discussion concerning the central issues of the seminar. Each participant will be encouraged to choose some particular subject to focus on for individual research, and will use that subject, over the course of the three weeks, as a basis for thinking about how East and West might be integrated into one historical European experience. The final product of the seminar will be either the presentation of a short piece of academic research on some aspect of Eastern Europe or the presentation of a pedagogical proposal for studying some aspect of the subject in school. Participants will have the opportunity to report regularly on the progress that they are making with their subjects. The director will be present for all seminar sessions and available to participants just after the formal sessions for informal research guidance. He will hold formal meetings with each of the participants during the course of the session and will schedule blocks of office hours.    The three weeks of the seminar will be divided into two parts, according to the two basic perspectives, West looking East, and then East looking West. The first part will focus on how Western Europe has historically regarded Eastern Europe, dating from what may be called the \u201cinvention\u201d of Eastern Europe in the eighteenth century. The introductory session will explore how the word \u201ccivilization,\u201d coined as a neologism in the eighteenth century, became associated with a westerly direction so as to produce, eventually, the concept of \u201cWestern civilization.\u201d It will consider further how Eastern Europe could appear as a kind of Oriental, or demi-Oriental, space of exoticism and backwardness, when seen from the perspective of \u201cWestern civilization.\u201d Furthermore, both of those concepts\u2014exoticism and backwardness\u2014 will be critically examined for their role in defining the relation between different parts of the globe. Both eyewitness travel literature about Eastern Europe and purely imaginative literature will be considered, dating from the Enlightenment, and we\u2019ll study how such writers as Voltaire and Rousseau, who never set foot in Eastern Europe, nevertheless played powerful roles in imagining and defining its character and its relation to Western Europe. Participants will sample short readings, for instance, from Voltaire\u2019s letters to Catherine the Great and from Rousseau\u2019s \u201cConsiderations Concerning the Government of Poland,\u201d and think about the basic assumptions that informed the perspectives of Western intellectuals concerning Eastern Europe. What did Westerners see when they looked to the east in Europe?    The subsequent sessions will pursue these themes into the nineteenth century, the age of nationalism, and will consider the kind of patronage that Eastern Europe received from Western political and cultural figures, from Lord Byron in Albania to Bram Stoker\u2019s creation of Dracula in Transylvania. This will be followed by the study of Woodrow Wilson and the Paris Peace Conference and the complete redrawing of the map of Eastern Europe, considering what it meant for western statesmen to make themselves the arbiters of eastern borders, and how the twentieth-century map of Eastern Europe emerged from the Baltic states to Bulgaria and Albania. Most important will be the theme of nationalism in Eastern Europe and how it was alternatively encouraged and stigmatized, checked and patronized, ignored and publicized in the West. We will place these issues in the context of the political settlements of the nineteenth century at which Western statesmen redefined Eastern borders, from the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to the Congress of Berlin in 1878 to the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.    Finally, the first half of the seminar will conclude, in the middle of the second week, by addressing the Cold War and the post-Cold War world of the twenty-first century, bringing the seminar right up to the present moment through the recent decades of NATO expansion and EU enlargement that completely overturned conventional understandings about the division of Europe into East and West. This will be particularly important material for the seminar, inasmuch as the Cold War so powerfully shaped the perspective which most of us still have regarding Eastern Europe. While before 1945 we can speak of culturally constructed continental division, more a matter of mental mapping than geopolitical fact, after 1945 the geopolitics of continental division were undeniable, with communism creating a \u201cbloc\u201d out of the lands and peoples of Eastern Europe, while NATO and the European Common Market effectively created an alternative \u201cbloc\u201d out of the lands and peoples of Western Europe. It will be important both to acknowledge the powerful impact of economic and political division during the Cold War, while also recognizing that the Iron Curtain was mapped onto an earlier idea of the continent envisioned as the conjunction of a backward East and a civilized West. The seamlessness with which the Cold War mentality built upon the foundation of this earlier stigmatic distinction concerning Eastern Europe offers some explanation for why the Cold War perspective has persisted into the post-communist era, and why Eastern Europe is still sometimes stigmatized in relation to Western Europe. Why did the Cold War leave a particularly powerful mark on the way we all think about Europe today?    Important readings for this first half of the course will include chapters from Larry Wolff\u2019s Inventing Eastern Europe as well as Maria Todorova\u2019s Imagining the Balkans and Vesna Goldsworthy\u2019s Inventing Ruritania . We will look at some of the work of our late NYU colleague Tony Judt on French intellectuals and Eastern Europe, and some of the essays of Timothy Garton Ash who reported on the revolutions of 1989. Judt\u2019s classic study of French intellectuals and communism, Past Imperfect , suggests some of the ways that intellectuals like Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir replicated in the twentieth century the perspective of intellectuals like Voltaire and Diderot in the eighteenth century, placing an enormous value on the Russian experience while neglecting the oppressive impact of Russian power on the rest of Eastern Europe. We will read such classic Western accounts, documents, and fantasies as excerpts from Rebecca West\u2019s Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (about interwar Yugoslavia), Winston Churchill\u2019s Iron Curtain Speech, and even King Ottokar\u2019s Scepter , the story of Tintin\u2019s adventures in the invented East European country of Syldavia. While Rebecca West\u2019s writings, for instance, reflect the importance of elite intellectual perspectives on Eastern Europe in the 1930s, the Tintin comics, originating also in the 1930s but continuing with huge success into the postwar period, offer the opportunity for a discussion of the popular culture of the Cold War; they suggest the kind of widespread imagery that gave ordinary people, indeed children, their most basic impressions of Eastern Europe as both a comical and sinister space in the twentieth century.    The second part of the seminar will reverse the perspective and consider Eastern perspectives on Western Europe and Eastern Europe\u2019s place in European history as a whole. We will begin by looking at some fundamental moments for thinking in an integral way about European history: Bohemian Hussitism and German Protestantism building to the Defenestration of Prague and the outbreak of the Thirty Years War; the European-Ottoman encounter in Southeastern Europe culminating in the siege of Vienna in 1683; the drama of Polish Romanticism in Paris in the nineteenth century with the fervent nationalist expressions in the poetry of Adam Mickiewicz and the music of Frederic Chopin; the nationalities question within the Habsburg monarchy leading to the outbreak of World War I with the assassination in Sarajevo in 1914. All of these topics, beginning with the heretical proto-Protestantism of Jan Hus in Bohemia, a full century before Luther in Germany, and concluding with the Bosnian political crisis that brought all of Europe into World War I, consider historical moments when the interlocking aspects of history in Eastern Europe and Western Europe point toward a broader way of considering the continental whole. We will address these subjects both from the point of view of current academic research and also from the point of view of pedagogical opportunities for teaching European history. How would it be possible to teach a better-integrated history of Europe?    The larger part of the second half of the seminar will be focused on the twentieth century, with particular attention to the terrible experience of Eastern Europe during World War II such that one historian has recently characterized the whole region as the \u201cBloodlands,\u201d caught between Hitler and Stalin; the coming of communism to Eastern Europe after the war with the formation of the Soviet Bloc; the ways in which the image of a \u201cbloc\u201d failed to do justice to the complex diversity of experience within the region under communist governments; and the revolutions of 1989 which appeared to many East Europeans as a rejoining of Europe from which they had been violently separated for half a century. We will talk about how certain crisis moments in the history of Eastern Europe were understood by their protagonists as part of a broader European history, social movements and political uprisings in the East carried out in the name of European values and with the expectation of European solidarity. Such crisis moments would include the Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis in 1944, the Hungarian Revolution against Soviet communism in 1956, the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and the Polish Solidarity trade union movement in 1980-1981, culminating in the political upheavals that brought down communist governments across Eastern Europe in 1989. How did the extreme experiences of Nazi occupation and Soviet-style communism transform the region in the twentieth century?    Important readings for the second half of the seminar will include excerpts from the nineteenth-century Polish Romantic poet Mickiewicz and the great twentieth-century poets Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz and Wis\u0142awa Szymborska, the letters of Jan Hus and the speeches of Pope John Paul II, Vaclav Havel\u2019s famous essay on \u201cThe Power of the Powerless\u201d and Milan Kundera\u2019s landmark essay on \u201cThe Tragedy of Central Europe,\u201d the brilliant Croatian essays of Slavenka Drakuli\u0107 (collected as \u201cHow We Survived Communism and Even Laughed\u201d) and Dubravka Ugre\u0161i\u0107 (collected as \u201cThe Culture of Lies\u201d), and accounts from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. Among secondary sources we will discuss selections from Mark Mazower\u2019s Hitler\u2019s Empire , Timothy Snyder\u2019s Bloodlands , Jan Gross\u2019s Neighbors , Tony Judt\u2019s Postwar , and Timothy Garton Ash\u2019s The Magic Lantern .    Kundera\u2019s essay is particularly relevant for our concerns as he completely transformed discussion of the region by insisting that it was not Eastern Europe at all, but \u201cCentral Europe\u201d that had been \u201ckidnapped\u201d by the Soviets coming from the East, and forcibly made over into \u201cEastern Europe.\u201d As \u201cCentral Europe\u201d such lands as Poland, Hungary, and Kundera\u2019s native Czechoslovakia demanded the attention of the West and claimed the right to return to the European whole from which they had been violently detached after World War II. This became a particularly potent way of reframing the geopolitical circumstances of the 1980s, during the last decade of communism in Europe, and in the 1990s the idea of Central Europe formed part of the ideological basis for advocating a European Union expansion to include the formerly communist countries.

This became a particularly potent way of reframing the geopolitical circumstances of the 1980s, during the last decade of communism in Europe, and in the 1990s the idea of Central Europe formed part of the ideological basis for advocating a European Union expansion to include the formerly communist countries.

This was notably true from the American perspective, since America was so closely associated with Western Europe during the Cold War, in military, economic, political, and cultural alliance against the Soviet bloc that constituted Eastern Europe. The image of the Iron Curtain from Churchill\u2019s famous Fulton, Missouri, speech of 1946 provided the mental architecture for an entire postwar generation thinking about the nature of Europe divided, and led to a mental mapping in which Western Europe was presumed to be the better half (and of course it was \u201cour\u201d half in the Cold War) and Eastern Europe was understood to be lesser, less interesting, less welcoming, more alien, and more backward\u2014 the other and secondary component of the continent. At the same time the countries of Eastern Europe, with their dramatically different national traditions, were presumed to be homogenously all alike\u2014 colored communist grey on Western mental maps of Europe during the Cold War. It was Western Europe that was much more likely to be visited by Americans as vacation air travel became part of middle class life in the 1950s and 1960s, and the glorious sights of London, Paris, and Rome were much more likely to be part of an American\u2019s actual touristic experience of Europe.    One of the consequences of this world political ordering, which lasted for almost half a century from the end of World War II until the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, was a subtly partisan revision of the history of Europe, as it appeared especially in the synthetic textbooks of the second half of the twentieth century. Often focused on the \u201cHistory of the West\u201d or the \u201cHistory of Western Civilization,\u201d these synthetic histories did not synthesize evenly but with a strong western bias. The Italian Renaissance, the German Reformation, the French Revolution, the British Industrial Revolution: these all came clearly into focus. The Russian path was singled out for special contrasting attention. But a whole huge swath of Europe almost disappeared from the narrative of European history, with merely general references to issues of social and political backwardness. In high schools this was even more likely to be true than in colleges, in colleges than in graduate schools, but at every level Eastern Europe was neglected in general histories of the continent, while specialized studies, when they occurred, were grouped together under the general Cold War rubric of \u201cEastern Europe\u201d and often framed and supported with reference to the exigencies of Cold War national security.    Of course, the division of Europe into two geopolitical camps during the Cold War was real and meaningful, but it distorted perspectives on European history in two basic ways: first, by suggesting that Eastern Europe and Western Europe had entirely divergent histories even before the Cold War, and, second, by suggesting that all the lands and peoples of Eastern Europe were related by resemblance to one another in their past histories. This summer seminar will address these distortions head on, attempting to analyze the problems inherent in the historical categories \u201cWestern Europe\u201d and \u201cEastern Europe,\u201d considering different historical frameworks for rethinking the way that different parts of Europe have been related to each other in past centuries, and also exploring alternative political frameworks for rethinking what Europe looks like today in the post-Cold War twenty-first century.    For school teachers, these issues come up whenever European history is taught and discussed at every grade level. In fact, they also come up as an issue of American history when the subject of immigration is taught and discussed with reference to the diversity of national groups who have entered American society from Europe. The cultures of Eastern Europe have too often been represented as \u201cexotic\u201d and \u201cfolkloric\u201d\u2014 emphasizing costumes and dances\u2014 without any real attempt to think through the extremely complex diversity of national histories that have shaped the emigrant communities arriving in the United States. The most recent historical, political, and cultural writing about Eastern Europe has seriously attempted to challenge, analyze, revise, and reconstruct assumptions about Eastern Europe that were taken for granted during the Cold War period, and we hope to make these scholarly issues intellectually meaningful and pedagogically useful for school teachers. Pedagogically we will consider especially negotiating the historical gap that separates teachers who grew up during the Cold War from students who have no memory of the Cold War.    While there will be some lecturing both from the director and the visiting faculty speakers, the substance of the seminar will involve participant discussion concerning the central issues of the seminar. Each participant will be encouraged to choose some particular subject to focus on for individual research, and will use that subject, over the course of the three weeks, as a basis for thinking about how East and West might be integrated into one historical European experience. The final product of the seminar will be either the presentation of a short piece of academic research on some aspect of Eastern Europe or the presentation of a pedagogical proposal for studying some aspect of the subject in school. Participants will have the opportunity to report regularly on the progress that they are making with their subjects. The director will be present for all seminar sessions and available to participants just after the formal sessions for informal research guidance. He will hold formal meetings with each of the participants during the course of the session and will schedule blocks of office hours.    The three weeks of the seminar will be divided into two parts, according to the two basic perspectives, West looking East, and then East looking West. The first part will focus on how Western Europe has historically regarded Eastern Europe, dating from what may be called the \u201cinvention\u201d of Eastern Europe in the eighteenth century. The introductory session will explore how the word \u201ccivilization,\u201d coined as a neologism in the eighteenth century, became associated with a westerly direction so as to produce, eventually, the concept of \u201cWestern civilization.\u201d It will consider further how Eastern Europe could appear as a kind of Oriental, or demi-Oriental, space of exoticism and backwardness, when seen from the perspective of \u201cWestern civilization.\u201d Furthermore, both of those concepts\u2014exoticism and backwardness\u2014 will be critically examined for their role in defining the relation between different parts of the globe. Both eyewitness travel literature about Eastern Europe and purely imaginative literature will be considered, dating from the Enlightenment, and we\u2019ll study how such writers as Voltaire and Rousseau, who never set foot in Eastern Europe, nevertheless played powerful roles in imagining and defining its character and its relation to Western Europe. Participants will sample short readings, for instance, from Voltaire\u2019s letters to Catherine the Great and from Rousseau\u2019s \u201cConsiderations Concerning the Government of Poland,\u201d and think about the basic assumptions that informed the perspectives of Western intellectuals concerning Eastern Europe. What did Westerners see when they looked to the east in Europe?    The subsequent sessions will pursue these themes into the nineteenth century, the age of nationalism, and will consider the kind of patronage that Eastern Europe received from Western political and cultural figures, from Lord Byron in Albania to Bram Stoker\u2019s creation of Dracula in Transylvania. This will be followed by the study of Woodrow Wilson and the Paris Peace Conference and the complete redrawing of the map of Eastern Europe, considering what it meant for western statesmen to make themselves the arbiters of eastern borders, and how the twentieth-century map of Eastern Europe emerged from the Baltic states to Bulgaria and Albania. Most important will be the theme of nationalism in Eastern Europe and how it was alternatively encouraged and stigmatized, checked and patronized, ignored and publicized in the West. We will place these issues in the context of the political settlements of the nineteenth century at which Western statesmen redefined Eastern borders, from the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to the Congress of Berlin in 1878 to the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.    Finally, the first half of the seminar will conclude, in the middle of the second week, by addressing the Cold War and the post-Cold War world of the twenty-first century, bringing the seminar right up to the present moment through the recent decades of NATO expansion and EU enlargement that completely overturned conventional understandings about the division of Europe into East and West. This will be particularly important material for the seminar, inasmuch as the Cold War so powerfully shaped the perspective which most of us still have regarding Eastern Europe. While before 1945 we can speak of culturally constructed continental division, more a matter of mental mapping than geopolitical fact, after 1945 the geopolitics of continental division were undeniable, with communism creating a \u201cbloc\u201d out of the lands and peoples of Eastern Europe, while NATO and the European Common Market effectively created an alternative \u201cbloc\u201d out of the lands and peoples of Western Europe. It will be important both to acknowledge the powerful impact of economic and political division during the Cold War, while also recognizing that the Iron Curtain was mapped onto an earlier idea of the continent envisioned as the conjunction of a backward East and a civilized West. The seamlessness with which the Cold War mentality built upon the foundation of this earlier stigmatic distinction concerning Eastern Europe offers some explanation for why the Cold War perspective has persisted into the post-communist era, and why Eastern Europe is still sometimes stigmatized in relation to Western Europe. Why did the Cold War leave a particularly powerful mark on the way we all think about Europe today?    Important readings for this first half of the course will include chapters from Larry Wolff\u2019s Inventing Eastern Europe as well as Maria Todorova\u2019s Imagining the Balkans and Vesna Goldsworthy\u2019s Inventing Ruritania . We will look at some of the work of our late NYU colleague Tony Judt on French intellectuals and Eastern Europe, and some of the essays of Timothy Garton Ash who reported on the revolutions of 1989. Judt\u2019s classic study of French intellectuals and communism, Past Imperfect , suggests some of the ways that intellectuals like Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir replicated in the twentieth century the perspective of intellectuals like Voltaire and Diderot in the eighteenth century, placing an enormous value on the Russian experience while neglecting the oppressive impact of Russian power on the rest of Eastern Europe. We will read such classic Western accounts, documents, and fantasies as excerpts from Rebecca West\u2019s Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (about interwar Yugoslavia), Winston Churchill\u2019s Iron Curtain Speech, and even King Ottokar\u2019s Scepter , the story of Tintin\u2019s adventures in the invented East European country of Syldavia. While Rebecca West\u2019s writings, for instance, reflect the importance of elite intellectual perspectives on Eastern Europe in the 1930s, the Tintin comics, originating also in the 1930s but continuing with huge success into the postwar period, offer the opportunity for a discussion of the popular culture of the Cold War; they suggest the kind of widespread imagery that gave ordinary people, indeed children, their most basic impressions of Eastern Europe as both a comical and sinister space in the twentieth century.    The second part of the seminar will reverse the perspective and consider Eastern perspectives on Western Europe and Eastern Europe\u2019s place in European history as a whole. We will begin by looking at some fundamental moments for thinking in an integral way about European history: Bohemian Hussitism and German Protestantism building to the Defenestration of Prague and the outbreak of the Thirty Years War; the European-Ottoman encounter in Southeastern Europe culminating in the siege of Vienna in 1683; the drama of Polish Romanticism in Paris in the nineteenth century with the fervent nationalist expressions in the poetry of Adam Mickiewicz and the music of Frederic Chopin; the nationalities question within the Habsburg monarchy leading to the outbreak of World War I with the assassination in Sarajevo in 1914. All of these topics, beginning with the heretical proto-Protestantism of Jan Hus in Bohemia, a full century before Luther in Germany, and concluding with the Bosnian political crisis that brought all of Europe into World War I, consider historical moments when the interlocking aspects of history in Eastern Europe and Western Europe point toward a broader way of considering the continental whole. We will address these subjects both from the point of view of current academic research and also from the point of view of pedagogical opportunities for teaching European history. How would it be possible to teach a better-integrated history of Europe?    The larger part of the second half of the seminar will be focused on the twentieth century, with particular attention to the terrible experience of Eastern Europe during World War II such that one historian has recently characterized the whole region as the \u201cBloodlands,\u201d caught between Hitler and Stalin; the coming of communism to Eastern Europe after the war with the formation of the Soviet Bloc; the ways in which the image of a \u201cbloc\u201d failed to do justice to the complex diversity of experience within the region under communist governments; and the revolutions of 1989 which appeared to many East Europeans as a rejoining of Europe from which they had been violently separated for half a century. We will talk about how certain crisis moments in the history of Eastern Europe were understood by their protagonists as part of a broader European history, social movements and political uprisings in the East carried out in the name of European values and with the expectation of European solidarity. Such crisis moments would include the Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis in 1944, the Hungarian Revolution against Soviet communism in 1956, the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and the Polish Solidarity trade union movement in 1980-1981, culminating in the political upheavals that brought down communist governments across Eastern Europe in 1989. How did the extreme experiences of Nazi occupation and Soviet-style communism transform the region in the twentieth century?    Important readings for the second half of the seminar will include excerpts from the nineteenth-century Polish Romantic poet Mickiewicz and the great twentieth-century poets Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz and Wis\u0142awa Szymborska, the letters of Jan Hus and the speeches of Pope John Paul II, Vaclav Havel\u2019s famous essay on \u201cThe Power of the Powerless\u201d and Milan Kundera\u2019s landmark essay on \u201cThe Tragedy of Central Europe,\u201d the brilliant Croatian essays of Slavenka Drakuli\u0107 (collected as \u201cHow We Survived Communism and Even Laughed\u201d) and Dubravka Ugre\u0161i\u0107 (collected as \u201cThe Culture of Lies\u201d), and accounts from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. Among secondary sources we will discuss selections from Mark Mazower\u2019s Hitler\u2019s Empire , Timothy Snyder\u2019s Bloodlands , Jan Gross\u2019s Neighbors , Tony Judt\u2019s Postwar , and Timothy Garton Ash\u2019s The Magic Lantern .    Kundera\u2019s essay is particularly relevant for our concerns as he completely transformed discussion of the region by insisting that it was not Eastern Europe at all, but \u201cCentral Europe\u201d that had been \u201ckidnapped\u201d by the Soviets coming from the East, and forcibly made over into \u201cEastern Europe.\u201d As \u201cCentral Europe\u201d such lands as Poland, Hungary, and Kundera\u2019s native Czechoslovakia demanded the attention of the West and claimed the right to return to the European whole from which they had been violently detached after World War II. This became a particularly potent way of reframing the geopolitical circumstances of the 1980s, during the last decade of communism in Europe, and in the 1990s the idea of Central Europe formed part of the ideological basis for advocating a European Union expansion to include the formerly communist countries.

Introduction In   the fall 2007 semester, the College of Arts and Science launched its   new Collegiate Seminar Program for entering freshmen. These Collegiate   Seminars have several distinctive features. Offered only to freshmen in   the College of Arts and Science, they are taught exclusively by   distinguished senior Arts and Science faculty whose excellence as   scholars and teachers has been recognized by their appointment as   Collegiate Professors. These faculty not only teach these courses but   also serve as the students\u2019 mentors throughout their entire   undergraduate careers at NYU. During the semester in which the seminar   is offered and in subsequent semesters, the faculty work with their   students to create special enrichment and reunion activities, which   might include a visit with a renowned scholar; a museum, theater,   concert, or film outing; a dinner discussion on a book or poem; or just a   purely social evening. Like other seminars, these small classes   are meant to introduce students to important subjects and to challenge   them intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and   written argumentation. To that end, they stress demanding readings and   writing assignments that introduce students to an essential research   skill\u2014such as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use   of primary sources, the identification of a research problem, critical   analysis of texts, or confrontations with works of art. In addition to   participating actively in class discussions, students are expected to   give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though   not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised   with the benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may   be on individual or group projects. In applying and registering   for one of these seminars, students are expected to commit themselves to   doing honors-level academic work and to participating actively in   co-curricular and mentoring activities beyond the semester-long course.  Course Descriptions  The Cultural Nature of Language (COSEM-UA 101; class # 10416) Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m. From   accents, pronouns, swearing, and spelling, how one uses language is   never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a social   practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated   and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how   children learn to talk, or don\u2019t (e.g., feral children), we examine   speech and silence across a range of societies. We look at popular   attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its   use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and   educational institutions (e.g., \u201cEnglish Only\u201d), and in multilingual   cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas   about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such as   who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural   nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity   and authority. Bambi SchieffeliN, Collegiate Professor and   Professor of Anthropology, is a linguistic anthropologist who has   studied speech practices among Haitians (Queens, N.Y.), lawyers and   litigants in lower Manhattan\u2019s Small Claims Court, college students and   their use of IM, and Bosavi people (Papua New Guinea). She is the author   of The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children . She is coeditor of, among other books, The Acquisition of Literacy: Ethnographic\u2028Perspectives, Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory and Consequences of Contact . She has also published articles in preeminent journals of her field, including Current Anthropology and Annual Review of Anthropology .   She is completing a book on the impact of Christianity on the language   and social life of Bosavi people over the past 25 years, and continues   research on linguistic creativity and change as evidenced in   computer-mediated communication. Professor Schieffelin also received the   College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2010. Terrorism, Nihilism, and Modernity (COSEM-UA 102; class # 10417) Instructor: James Gilligan Thursday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. The   past century has witnessed violence the character and scale of which   are so unique and unprecedented that we have had to create a new   vocabulary to describe it (genocide, terrorism) and the ideologies that   underlie it (totalitarianism, fundamentalism). To understand modern   violence, we will examine the origin of the modern mind in the 17th   century, when science, based on universal doubt, ended the Age of Faith,   and the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority   lost credibility. Nietzsche called this the \u201cdeath of God\u201d (and the   Devil); it could also be called the death of Good and Evil, leading to   another set of new words\u2028(nihilism, agnosticism, anomie, anarchy). We   will study the origins and implications of these developments by reading   Shakespeare and John Donne, Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, Beckett and   Wittgenstein, Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well as modern mass   murderers from Hitler to bin Laden. Finally, we will ask whether the   modern human sciences can help us understand how to reverse or at least   limit this escalation of violence. JAMES GILLIGAN is a Collegiate   Professor in the College of Arts and Science, Clinical Professor of   Psychiatry in the School of Medicine, and Adjunct Professor in the   School of Law. He headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and   directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system   while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of   Psychiatry. He has also served as President of the International   Association for Forensic Psychotherapy, and as Chair of the Committee on   Prevention in President Clinton\u2019s National Campaign Against Youth   Violence. His books include Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic and Preventing Violence: An Agenda for the Coming Century .   He has been a consultant on violence prevention to the World Health   Organization\u2019s Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention, the World   Court\u2019s International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the   World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Agenda on Negotiation and Conflict   Resolution, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and other   governmental and non-governmental organizations and officials. In Search of Lost Time (COSEM-UA 104; class # 10419) Instructor: Marcelle Clements Thursday, 2:15\u20134:45 p.m. We   will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read:   hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A   prodigious novel of more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time    is one of modern literature\u2019s most challenging and deeply pleasurable   reads. The richest of the themes it explores is desire\u2014its remembrance,   transformation, perversion, defeat, and final resurgence in the form of   art. Often said to be the first modern fiction, In Search of Lost Time    is still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw   emotion, self-examination with social history, profound psychological   acuity with a dazzling portrait of the French beau monde at the outset   of modernity, how it merges an audacious explosion of literary form with   explorations of memory, attachment, deception, lust, jealousy,   ambition, and disappointment. Although Marcel Proust (1871\u20131922) is   often cited as France\u2019s greatest novelist (and the novelist\u2019s novelist),   his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers   begin at the beginning and never move past the first fifty pages,   reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while In Search of Lost Time\u2019s    prose style may have been its most radical contribution to the art of   fiction, its vast, thrilling architecture cannot be understood until it   has been read once in its entirety. In this intensive class, we will   move at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on   our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading   the final volume, when we begin to understand the extraordinarily   intimate relationship Proust creates with his reader. In-class creative   writing exercises are designed to help with the reading and to expand   an expressive, personal response. Reading assignments average 350 pages   per week. MARCELLE CLEMENTS is Collegiate Professor and a Fellow   of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. She is the author   of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations , a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman , and of two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer . Her prizewinning articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications. American Wars, Past and Present: Vietnam, Iraq (I and II),\u2028 Afghanistan (COSEM-UA 106; class # 10420) Instructor: Marilyn B. Young Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The   course will consider the last two major wars of the 20th century and   the first two wars of the 21st century. It will begin with the history,   memory, and subsequent political uses of the Vietnam War. We will then   move on to examine the Gulf War I (Operation Desert Storm), which was   shaped by the way the administration of President George H.W. Bush   understood the Vietnam War. The subsequent war in Iraq (Operation Iraqi   Freedom) can be understood in part in terms of what some policymakers   believed to be the unfinished business of Gulf War I. Yet it too was   fought in the shadow of Vietnam analogies. Finally, the war in   Afghanistan, launched in response to 9/11, in terms of tactics and   goals, has been shaped by all three of the preceding wars. We shall   examine these wars through primary documents and secondary sources as   well as the abundance of documentary and fiction film in which they have   all been represented. The overarching concern of the seminar is the   ongoing haunting of American politics\u2014military and civilian\u2014by a war   fought over three decades ago. There are two connected questions: Can   history teach? What does it teach? MARILYN B YOUNG, Collegiate   Professor and Professor of History, is a former Chair of the History   Department. Her teaching and her writing focus on U.S. foreign policy.   Her books include The Vietnam Wars,   1945\u20131990; The Rhetoric of Empire: American China Policy, 1895\u20131901;   Transforming Russia and China: Revolutionary Struggle in the 20th   Century , with William Rosenberg; and Human Rights and Revolutions ,   with Lynn Hunt and Jeffrey Wasserstrom. She has also edited several   collections of essays on the recent wars in Iraq and, most recently, Bombing Civilians: A 20th-Century History .   She was Director of the Project on the Cold War as a Global Conflict at   NYU\u2019s International Center for Advanced Study in 2001\u20132004. She has   been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and of an American Council   of Learned Societies Fellowship. Twice she has won the College\u2019s Golden   Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, and she is currently co-director   of the Tamiment Center on the Cold War. She is currently president-elect   of the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations. Zoo\u00ebsis: Animal Acts for Changing Times (COSEM-UA 107; class # 10421) Instructor: Una Chaudhuri Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The   emerging field of animal studies has already generated neologisms in   various disciplines: \u201canthrozoology\u201d (culture studies), \u201czoopolis\u201d   (urban social theory), and \u201czoontology\u201d (philosophy). To these the   fields of literature and performance studies propose an   addition\u2014\u201czoo\u00ebsis,\u201d to refer to the history of animal representation   that stretches, in the Western literary tradition, from Aesop\u2019s Fables   to Will Self\u2019s Great Apes; in the Western dramatic tradition, from   Aristophanes\u2019 The Frogs to Albee\u2019s The Goat; in film, from Muybridge\u2019s   \u201czoogyroscope\u201d to Herzog\u2019s Grizzly Man; in popular culture, from Mickey   Mouse to Animal Planet; and in popular performance, from gladiatorial   contests to Siegfried and Roy. To speak of zoo\u00ebsis is also to   acknowledge the manifold performances engendered by cultural animal   practices such as pet-keeping, dog shows, equitation, rodeo,   bull-fighting, animal sacrifice, scientific experimentation, taxidermy,   hunting, fur-wearing, meat-eating\u2014each with its own archive and   repertory, its own performers and spectators. In this course we will   study recent films, novels, plays, and cultural events that reveal how   our\u2028interaction with animals shapes our understanding of the human, our   approach to the \u201cOther\u201d (including the racial and ethnic Other), and our   attitude toward the world. UNA CHANDHURI, Collegiate Professor   and Professor of English, of Drama, and of Environmental Studies, has   served as Chair of both the Department of English in the Faculty of Arts   and Science and of the Department of Drama at the Tisch School of the   Arts. She is the author of No Man\u2019s Stage: A Semiotic Study of Jean Genet\u2019s Plays and Staging Place: The Geography of Modern Drama , editor of Rachel\u2019s Brain and Other Storms: The Performance Scripts of Rachel Rosenthal , and co-editor, with Elinor Fuchs, of the critical anthology Land/Scape/Theater. Her   current work explores the intersections of performance studies and the   emerging field of animal studies, on which she just guest-edited a   special issue of TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies . She has won both the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence and the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Award. Matter, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy (COSEM-UA 108; class # 10422) Instructor: Glennys Farrar Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m. The   past several decades have seen tremendous advances in observational   cosmology. As a result we understand in remarkable detail many aspects   of the evolution and the contents of the universe. This course will   focus on three of the most puzzling facts about the universe: Why was   there a slight excess of matter over antimatter after the Big Bang?   (Otherwise, after matter\u2013antimatter annihilation was complete, no matter   would have been left.) What is dark matter? (Although on average in the   universe it is five times more abundant than normal matter, we know   that it is something not found on Earth or, so far, observed in our   laboratories.) What is the so-called dark energy? (The expansion rate of   the universe is actually accelerating, rather than slowing down as was   expected, a finding that is attributed to some new component of the   universe known as dark energy.) Students enrolling in the seminar should   either have had AP Physics, be enrolled in Physics I (PHYS-UA 91), or   have permission of the instructor. GLENNYS FARRAR, Collegiate   Professor and Professor of Physics, founded NYU\u2019s Center for Cosmology   and Particle Physics. Before coming to NYU in 1998 as Chair of the   Physics Department, she was on the faculties of the California Institute   of Technology and Rutgers University, and a member of the Institute for   Advanced Study in Princeton. Her current work focuses mainly on   problems at the intersection of astrophysics, cosmology, and particle   physics, including ultra-high energy cosmic rays, the nature of dark   matter and dark energy, and the origin of the asymmetry between matter   and antimatter. Her research is supported by the National Science   Foundation and NASA and includes both fundamental theoretical research   and observations using the Chandra X-ray telescope and the Pierre Auger   Observatory. She is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and of the   American Association for the Advancement of Science, and is a recipient   of Alfred P. Sloan and Guggenheim Fellowships, among other honors. How We See (COSEM-UA 109; class # 10423) Instructor: Marisa Carrasco Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. Do   we see the world the way we do because we are the way we are or because   the world is the way it is? The ease with which we comprehend the   visual world and recognize objects and events makes it tempting to think   that the world is just the way we see it and to take our perceptual   capabilities for granted. But when we comprehend that we cannot process   all the information available in the environment, when we try to build   machines that can see, or when we encounter people who have lost some   specific visual capability\u2014for example, persons who can no longer   recognize faces\u2014we realize how extraordinary and intricate are the   machinery and mechanisms of sight. This course looks at what we know   about vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual   psychology tells us about the process of seeing, and provides important   insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows   us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction;   neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural   systems. We will also discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry   from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What   kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new   neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field? MARISA   CARRASCO is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Psychology and Neural   Science, as well as a former Chair of the Psychology Department. Born   and raised in Mexico City, she received her licentiate in psychology   from the National University of Mexico and her Ph.D. in psychology   (cognition and perception) from Princeton University. She conducts   research in cognitive neuroscience, exploring the relation between the   psychological and neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and   attention. She has published many papers in the most prominent   scientific journals in perception, in particular, and in science, in   general. Her accomplishments have been recognized by prestigious awards   and fellowships throughout her career, such as an American Association   of University Women Fellowship, a National Young Investigator Award from   the National Science Foundation, a Cattell Fellowship, and a Guggenheim   Fellowship. Great Science, Fabulous Science, and Voodoo Science (COSEM-UA 111; class # 10424) Instructor: Allen Mincer Monday and Wednesday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m. Prerequisites: high school chemistry, physics, and calculus. Science   is often portrayed as following a very clearly defined set of   procedures: start with a hypothesis, do an experiment, and, based on the   results, reject the hypothesis or adopt it as a working assumption. The   actual process, however, is rarely so straightforward. In addition, the   stories as usually told or recorded may differ from what really   happened. We will study some famous and infamous experiments, mainly in   the physical sciences, selected to illustrate intellectual tours de   force, cases of error, cases of fraud, and the murky boundaries between   them. Along the way, issues such as the discarding of \u201cfaulty data,\u201d   theoretical bias, and probabilistic tools for hypothesis acceptance and   rejection will be discussed. ALLEN MINCER, Collegiate Professor   and Professor of Physics at NYU, specializes in experimental particle   physics and particle astrophysics. He is currently also a member of the   ATLAS collaboration, which is studying the nature of the   elementary\u2028building blocks of matter at the CERN Large Hadron Collider   in Geneva, Switzerland. His research at NYU has a long, continuous   history of generous support by grants from the National Science   Foundation. He is co-author of approximately 200 scientific   publications, including the discovery of the top quark with the D-Zero   collaboration. His interests include education, and in addition to   teaching in the Physics Department, he has taught in the Steinhardt   School\u2019s Department of Teaching and Learning, been involved in research   in physics education, and has twice been awarded the College\u2019s Golden   Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. Finding New York City (COSEM-UA 114; class # 10427) Instructor: William Serrin Thursday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Note: Please reserve the first two Sundays of the semester for walking tours of New York City. In   this seminar students explore, read and write about, and develop a deep   understanding of New York City, from diverse perspectives and by means   of various media. They will venture into different neighborhoods, ethnic   areas, all five boroughs, out on the Hudson and East River,   restaurants, parks, and the like. They will examine New York history,   and how the city has changed over the decades, writing several pieces on   what they see, what they read, and what people tell them. In the end   all should have an understanding of how New York City began, how it has   changed over time, what remains from the old days, what new things are   happening, and what the future might be. It is, in short, a course in   urban America that takes New York City as its laboratory. The seminar   will turn to reading the splendid books or sections from the splendid   books that deal with important aspects of the history and life of New   York City, among them The Island at   the Center of the World; Divided Loyalties; Forgotten Patriots; The   Devil\u2019s Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots and the Fight to Reconstruct   America; Five Points; Positively 4th Street; and A Freewheelin\u2019 Time: A   Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties. It will also consider how the image of New York City in the movies has changed over the decades, drawing, in part, on the book Celluloid Skyline .   In addition, it will use parts of the Ken Burns PBS documentary series   New York City. Students will write two major pieces, one in the first   half of the semester and one in the second: A research project on a NYC   subject approved by the professor, and a personal essay on New York City   and what the student has seen and heard and learned in his or her   travels about the city. Also, one reading assignment will be on fiction   of New York City. WILLIAM SERRIN is Collegiate Professor and   Associate Professor of Journalism. Before joining NYU, he was for eight   years the labor and workplace correspondent for the New York Times. He   has written for numerous magazines, including Newsweek,\u2028 Atlantic Monthly, American Heritage , and the Nation , as well as the Columbia Journalism Review and the Village Voice . He is the author of Homestead:   The Glory and Tragedy of an American Steel Town; The Company; and The   Union: The \u201cCivilized Relationship\u201d of the General Motors Corporation   and the United Automobile Workers. He is the editor of The Business of Journalism: 10 Leading Reporters and Editors on the Perils and Pitfalls of the Press and co-editor, with Judith Bruhn Serrin, of Muckraking!: The Journalism That Changed America.    He was a recipient of the Alicia Patterson Award, for study of American   farm and food policies. He also won the Sidney Hillman Foundation Award   for outstanding labor coverage, and he was a member the Detroit Free   Press team of reporters who won a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the   1967 Detroit riots. In addition, he was a recipient of the George Polk   Award for reporting on the Kent State killings in 1970. He is currently   working on two new books: one a memoir of growing up in his hometown, an   industrial town (Saginaw, Michigan), the other an examination of how,   as industries emerge and grow in America, communities grow up and expand   around them, then when the industries move or collapse, the communities   that have served its citizens and country so well are often left to   collapse and die. Russia\u2019s Multicultural Empire (COSEM-UA 116; class # 15836) Instructor: Jane Burbank Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. From   the 16th century to the present, \u201cRussia\u201d has been an empire\u2014a state   that spread its power over different peoples, with different religious   commitments, different laws and customs, different histories. This   seminar will explore the qualities of Russia\u2019s kind of empire. What held   the vast territories and populations ruled by tsars and later by   communists together? Why has Russia not disintegrated or been torn   apart by multiple wars among its many ethnic groups since 1991?   (Chechnya is an exception to the quite peaceful breakup of the USSR into   fifteen states, all of them multiethnic.) We will take a historical   look at these questions, examining both how Russian leaders ruled their   many populations and how people living on the terrain of a succession of   Russian empires\u2014the Grand Princedom of Muscovy, Imperial Russia, the   Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation\u2014have imagined their relations   with each other and with these states. Our sources will include   historians\u2019 studies, literature, and documents of many types: games,   maps, laws, and films. Each student will have the chance to investigate a   particular imperial situation, and we will work together to understand   the origins, habits, and effects of Russia\u2019s empires of difference. JANE   BURBANK, Collegiate Professor and Professor of History and Russian and   Slavic Studies, is a historian of Russia, of empire, and of law. Her   early work focused on Russian intellectuals\u2019 interpretations of the   revolution of 1917; this was the topic of her monograph entitled Intelligentsia and Revolution: Russian Views of Bolshevism , 1917\u20131922. Later she turned to Russian law and to how ordinary people used it. Her book Russian Peasants Go to Court: Legal Culture in the Countryside ,   1905\u20131917 reveals that rural people, contrary to received opinion, were   avid litigators. For a glimpse at this study, see her NYU website:   http://www.nyu.edu/projects/burbank/. She is the co-editor of Russian Empire: Space, People, Power , 1730\u20131930, a collective and international study of Russian empire. Her latest book, written with Frederick Cooper, is Empires in World History: Power and the Politics of Difference .   This study examines the different ways that empires have shaped   political possibilities, from ancient times (Rome and China) until the   present. Impossible Writing (COSEM-UA 118; class # 10428) Instructor: Jonathan Safran Foer \u2028Monday, 4:00\u20136:30 p.m. As   with any art, literature\u2019s form determines what is possible. In this   class, we will challenge the boundaries of the form through a series of   \u201cimpossible\u201d exercises\u2014that is, pieces of writing that are asked to do   what writing cannot do. For example, one assignment challenges   literature\u2019s unique portability by generating \u201csite-specific\u201d stories   around campus. Another assignment focuses on the lack of explicit   tonality and atmosphere in writing by generating oral stories. In our   discussions about the work produced, we will explore the ways that these   radical techniques can be brought into more traditional writing. This   class will focus on the production of work, and students will be   expected to produce a piece of writing every week, usually between two   paragraphs and four pages. JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER is a Collegiate   Professor who joined NYU in 2008. He received the B.A. degree from   Princeton University, where the adviser for his creative writing thesis   was Joyce Carol Oates.

His second   novel, Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close ,   appeared in 2005 and won the Literature for Life Award, the Victoria   and Albert Museum Award, and was shortlisted for the International IMPAC   Award. In 2009 he published Eating Animals ,   a non-fiction exploration of the meat industry, and in 2010, Tree of   Codes, a book made by die-cutting Bruno Schulz\u2019s Street of Crocodiles.   He is the editor of A Convergence of Birds: Original Fiction and Poetry Inspired by Joseph Cornell (2004) and co-editor of The Future Dictionary of America ( 2006). His short stories have appeared in the Paris Review, the New Yorker , and other publications. He also teaches in the Creative Writing Program at NYU,\u2028having previously taught at Yale. Facing Fascism: The Spanish Civil War and U.S. Culture (COSEM-UA 119; class # 10429) Instructor: James D. Fern\u00e1ndez Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m. The   Great Depression. Liberal democracy in crisis. On the rise: a spectrum   of ideologies ranging from anarchism to fascism, offering solutions to   the afflictions of people all over the planet. July 1936: a right-wing   military coup attempts to overthrow a democratically elected left-wing   coalition government. All eyes turn toward Spain. This seminar will be   centered on NYU\u2019s Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA), a vast   collection of materials that chronicle the lives of the 2,800 Americans   who, between 1936 and 1939, volunteered to fight fascism in Spain. We   will explore the place occupied by Spain and the Spanish Civil War in   American culture from the 1930s forward, how journalists, writers,   artists, and citizens reacted to the war in Spain, and how the legacy of   the war has affected U.S. culture over the last seventy years. Each   student will complete a major research project based on the holdings of   ALBA. JAMES D. FERN\u00c1NDEZ is Associate Professor in the Department   of Spanish and Portuguese. His research interests include the   literature, history, and culture of modern Spain; autobiography;   cultural relations between Spain and Latin America; and visions of Spain   in the United States. He served as the inaugural director of NYU\u2019s King   Juan Carlos I of Spain Center from 1995 to 2007, and as Chair of his   department from 2003 to 2007. He is the Vice-Chair of the Board of   Governors of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives, and co-editor of the   collection of essays Facing Fascism: New York and the Spanish Civil War . He is the author of Apology to Apostrophe: Autobiography and the Rhetoric of Self-Representation in Spain.  Utopia and Apocalypse (COSEM-UA 120; class # 10430) Instructor: Eliot Borenstein Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. The   utopian impulse is the drive to create the perfect world; the   apocalypse is the global cataclysm that is often considered utopia\u2019s   prerequisite. In this seminar, we will examine the development of the   utopian tradition, as both literary genre and philosophical thought   experiment. Among the questions to be considered: What is the   relationship between utopia and the novel? How do we get from \u201chere\u201d   (the imperfect world) to \u201cthere\u201d (the perfect one), and how is this   journey enacted in fiction? Why are the family, gender, and sexuality so   central to the utopian tradition? What is the utopian conception of   pleasure? Utopia is often seen as the\u2028culmination of historical   progress, the goal toward which humanity has been striving. Later   utopian (and anti-utopian) fictions often place their \u201cperfect\u201d   societies in a post-apocalyptic framework, adding particular moral and   temporal dimensions to utopia: not only does utopia become the endpoint   of history, but the perfection of the coming world can be invoked to   justify the cataclysm that precedes it. Course materials will consist of   fiction, scripture, philosophy, film, and graphic novels, including the   works of Bacon, Campanella, Dostoevsky, LeGuin, Marx and Engels, More,   Moore and Gibbons, and Plato. ELIOT BORENSTEIN, Collegiate   Professor and Professor of Russian and Slavic Studies, has served as   Chair of Russian and Slavic Studies and as Director of the Morse   Academic Plan. Before coming to NYU in 1995, he directed the Fulbright   Program in the Russian Federation and taught at the University of   Virginia. His first book, Men without Women: Masculinity and Revolution in Russian Fiction, 1917\u20131919 , won the AATSEEL award for best work in literary scholarship in 2000. In 2007, he published Overkill: Sex and Violence in Contemporary Russian Popular Culture ,   which received the AWSS award for best book in Slavic Gender Studies in   2008. Recently, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to finish the   companion volume, Catastrophe of the Week: Apocalyptic Entertainment in Post-Soviet Russia . He is a two-time recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. Exploring the Mysteries of Behavior (COSEM-UA 122; class # 10432) Instructor: Lynne Kiorpes Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. Did   you ever wonder how whales navigate flawlessly over thousands of miles?   Why songbirds sing? This course provides an in-depth look at a variety   of organisms that have evolved particular, special behavioral   adaptations as solutions to environmental challenges. Each neural system   to be studied highlights a unique combination of behavioral skill and   environmental problem to be solved. For example, echolocation in bats is   a navigation device and an adaptive hunting system that allows them   to\u2028successfully hunt on the wing; infrared sensing in snakes is an   effective prey localization and defense mechanism, enhancing their   survival in the absence of limbs. Students will learn basic principles   of sensory, motor, and cognitive neuroscience and will study the   mechanisms underlying the natural behavior of organisms. Students will   independently identify unique, species-specific behavioral adaptations   and explore the neural mechanisms related to those adaptations. The   resulting investigation will form the basis for a term paper and an oral   presentation to the class. A high degree of student participation is   expected. A textbook as well as primary research articles will comprise   the readings. Students should have a strong background in biology,   animal behavior or psychology. LYNNE KIORPES, Collegiate   Professor and Professor of Neural Science and Psychology, completed her   Ph.D. in Physiological Psychology at the University of Washington and   has been on the NYU faculty since 1985. Her research is focused on the   development of vision and cognition and has been supported by grants   from the National Institutes of Health, the James S. McDonnell   Foundation, and the National Science Foundation. Her numerous scientific   articles have appeared in the Journal of Neuroscience, Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Visual Neuroscience, Vision Research, and Science ,   among other publications, and as book chapters. She currently directs   the College\u2019s Women in Science program. She has served both as Director   of Undergraduate Studies and as Director of Graduate Studies in NYU\u2019s   distinguished Center for Neural Science. She is one of only a very few   faculty who have received both the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for   Excellence in Teaching and the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching   Award. The Mysteries of Paris: Detective Fiction in France (COSEM-UA 125; class # 16885) Instructor: Judith G. Miller Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. While   critics debate the origins of detective fiction, no one questions the   central place this literary genre holds in contemporary arts   production\u2014not only in novels but also in television, computer games and   film. In France, alone, detective (or mystery) fiction accounts for 20%   of all novels purchased during the year. The French have in fact   inflected the genre in very particular ways: For example, thanks to the   fascination of the great nineteenth-century writers Balzac and Hugo with   the\u2028real-life police detective Vidocq, the \u201cambiguous and obsessed\u201d   fictional investigator has become a staple of both French and American   detective fiction. The Franco-American connection also inspired author   Edgar Allen Poe to situate his mysteries on Paris\u2019s rue Morgue. In   turn, his stories prompted a major output of detective fiction during   France\u2019s Second Empire, many located in \u201cthe City of Lights.\u201d From   Gaston Leroux\u2019s and Eug\u00e8ne Sue\u2019s urban thrillers of the late 19th   century to Daniel Pennac\u2019s hilarious multi-cultural adventures in   Belleville, the hippest neighborhood of the 21st century, Paris has thus   become a site to be decoded and observed, the crucible for\u2028questions   basic to detective fiction the world over: Why do people commit   crimes? What are the consequences for the individual and for society?   What is the nature of evil? And what kind of human being dedicates him-   or herself to finding out the answers? In this seminar, we will analyze   what constitutes a detective or mystery novel (and discuss the   potential differences between \u201cdetective\u201d and \u201cmystery\u201d), trace the   development of the genre in France, and examine why it is that reading   such works is so compelling. We will focus primarily on novels in which   Paris plays a major role, studying how the city has been used to give   shape to the underlying questions of the novel. We will see, perhaps   unsurprisingly, that French-language detective fiction has been as   involved in imagining a mysterious Paris as in solving Paris\u2019s   mysteries. JUDITH G. MILLER, Collegiate Professor and Professor   of French, is a former Chair of NYU\u2019s French Department. Before coming   to New York in 2003, she ran NYU\u2019s center in Paris. She was also for   many years on the faculty of the Department of French and Italian at the   University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she was awarded the university\u2019s   Distinguished Teaching Award. Her books include Theater   and Revolution in France Since 1968, Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, Plays by French   and Francophone Women Writers: A Critical Anthology, and Ariane Mnouchkine . She was also responsible for bringing out the French edition of a collection of works by African women: Des femmes \u00e9crivent l\u2019Afrique: L\u2019Afrique de l\u2019Ouest et le Sahel .   She has translated over a dozen plays and for her work on promoting   French theater in the United States has received awards from the French   Ministry of Culture. In 2004, she was named a Chevalier dans l\u2019ordre des   Palmes Acad\u00e9miques. Music in the Bloodlands (COSEM-UA 126; class# 16886) Instructor: Michael Beckerman\u2028 Thursday, 1:00\u20134:00 p.m. In   2010, Timothy Snyder, a professor in the History Department at Yale   University, published Bloodlands, a study that looks at Europe from the   Baltics to Western Russia, including Poland and Ukraine, during the   period from 1932\u20131947. Instead of taking a \u201cHolocaust\u201d centered   approach, Snyder focuses on the 14 million deaths resulting from the   policies of Stalin, Hitler, and their minions, and presents a powerful   and terrifying view of the various pressures brought to bear on   traumatized populations. While scholars and historians are familiar   with much of this material, it has never before been put together in   such a compelling manner. For this year\u2019s Collegiate Seminar we will   explore the role of music in this region during the period in question.    From the \u201cLeningrad\u201d Symphony of Shostakovich to the songs of   Buchenwald, and from the chamber music in Theresienstadt to partisan   songs in the forests of Belarus, this course engages and tests the   implications of Snyder\u2019s model for an understanding of the relationship   between history and music. As part of our mandate, we shall also try to   re-imagine the lost music of the era. Course lectures will offer a   broad overview of the questions involved, and invtited guests from New   York City, the Holocaust Memorial and elsewhere will provide specialist   contexts and raise topics for discussion. Each student will prepare a   project, either a performance, an artwork, or a lecture, and the course   will culminate with a conference and concert to take place on Friday,   December 9, 2011.

Consuming China, Past and Present COSEM-UA 127; class # 16893) Instructor: Joanna Waley-Cohen Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. Material   culture and consumption in China from imperial times to the present.   This course explores some of the ways in which commerce and consumerism   have flourished in China despite various potentially countervailing   factors, including Confucians\u2019 presumed aversion to trade, Buddhist and   Daoist renunciations of material things, wartime deprivations under the   Republic, rising egalitarianism, and Communist Party denunciations of   bourgeois ideals of consumption. We will investigate such aspects as   clothing and cosmetics; houses and gardens; art collecting and   connoisseurship; books and publishing; food and narcotics; opera and   theater. While illuminating Chinese social and cultural life, including   aspects of continuity or change over several centuries, the course also   introduces students to theoretical concepts about modernity\u2019s   relationship to the world of goods and consumption, and considers   whether and to what extent those concepts, formulated in a largely   western context, may or may not be applicable to China. JOANNA   WALEY-COHEN, Collegiate Professor and Professor of History, has taught   the history of China at NYU since 1992. She received her B.A. and M.A.   degrees in Chinese studies from Cambridge University and her Ph.D.   degree in history from Yale University. Her books include The Sextants of Beijing: Global Currents in Chinese History and The Culture of War: Empire and the Military under the Qing Dynasty .   Currently she is working on two related projects. The first is a   history of food and consumption in early modern China; the second is a   study of daily life in China around 1800. Understanding 9/11 (COSEM-UA 128; class # 17027) Instructor: Tom Gerety Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. This   seminar will examine the 9/11 attacks from an interdisciplinary   perspective, seeking to reach a better understanding of the attack   itself, the motivations and backgrounds of the attackers, the failures   in the United States intelligence community\u2019s defenses--and, above all,   the nature and scope of America\u2019s response, at home and abroad. We will   read studies of terrorism and counter-terrorism, including moral and   legal arguments about torture, detention and targeted killings. We will   visit various sites in New York City and meet with people with direct   experience of the attack and its aftermath, including representatives of   both the police and the immigrant communities who have suffered   profiling and mistrust from the suspicions aroused by the attack.   Looking towards the future, we will examine local, national and   international strategies to prevent such attacks and to halt the   radicalization that brings fresh recruits to terrorist movements.
