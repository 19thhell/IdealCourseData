Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare.

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.
