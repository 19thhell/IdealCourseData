  \u00a0   About the Program   Journalism schools produce good reporters; MFA programs train beautiful writers. In the Literary Reportage concentration, we combine the best of both. Our students pursue their own long form projects, mentored by veteran writers in reporting classes, literature seminars, writing workshops and master classes taught by working editors .   Reporting is at the center of everything Literary Reportage students do. Whether you want to write a memoir, an expose, a portrait of a person or place, an extended consideration on the subject of your passion, it all starts with reporting. We\u2019ll teach you how to do what Tom Wolfe once termed \u201cstylish reporting.\u201d Many writing programs teach memoir, and that's something you can do in Literary Reportage, as well. The difference here is that we stress reporting \u2013 adding value to personal experience by collecting relevant information from the world outside one's head. Did your sister join a cult? Part of your mission would be to learn about the cult, past and present. Are there acquaintances from days gone by who could help set a remembered story in context? Part of your job might be to find them. That way, when you sit down to fashion your narrative, you'll have a richer set of materials to work with.You will then channel that reporting into well-researched, compelling narratives, which you will publish in professional venues while at NYU and, of course, beyond.   How do you apply? Like an aspiring novelist who submits short stories to an MFA program in the hopes of writing a novel, you submit a sample of your existing work (articles, blogs, videos, podcasts, essays--published or not), and a description of what you want to do while at NYU, whether a specific project or a kind of project. Think big, but also think concretely: What particular works or authors have inspired you and your project? What journalistic forms could you imagine it taking? What models do you have in mind?   Projects can be local, national, or international in scope. But since much of your reporting will be done while in residence at NYU, your project should have an NYC dimension. Some students divide their time between their final international or national project and its local iterations. In addition, access is important. You can\u2019t report on a subject if your subject won\u2019t talk to you. We\u2019ll help you as much as we can, but there are some worlds, like Hollywood, that simply can\u2019t be covered by NYC-based reporters. We don\u2019t care if you change your mind later \u2013 experimentation is part of the idea. That goes for form, as well: Some Literary Reportage students want to write books, others want to write articles. Some want to combine podcasts, video, books and articles. We will teach you how to work in all of these forms. We\u2019ll teach you how to use the technology (come visit and see our high tech facilities), whether in semester-long classes or intensive, week-long workshops. (All Literary Reportage students take a month-long, non-credit introductory multimedia course covering video, audio, slideshow and web skills.) But the most important thing we teach is how think in terms of \u201cstories.\u201d Rigorously reported, well-researched, imaginative, artfully written stories.   \u00a0   How does Literary Reportage work?   The courses are divided between journalism seminars and writing workshops. The first semester leans toward the former, while the remaining semesters leans toward the latter. For an overview of the curriculum click here . Literary Reportage became a full-fledged concentration in 2009, growing out of the Portfolio honors track , in which students learned how to build a coherent body of work over the course of two semesters. It worked well, and we suspected it would work even better if students applied with projects already in mind and had more time to complete their work. How does Literary Reportage differ from other the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s other concentrations and programs? Our applicants must apply with a project in mind and, like the Global program, Literary Reportage students produce a master\u2019s project in their fourth and final semester, during which you need not be in residence.   \u00a0   Final Projects   Here are some of the final projects Literary Reportage students have produced in our first three years:   \"We Were All Going To Be Queens,\" a reported memoir about the Catholic cult Regnum Christi   \"Ballerina 2.0,\" about dancer Drew Jacoby's use of new media for self-promotion   \"Mother of Invention,\u201d a reported memoir about a single woman's decision to have a child   \u201cOn Trails,\u201d a meditation on the twists and turns of human navigation   \u201cAlone in America,\u201d a report on Korean students studying abroad   \u201cSikhing for God,\u201d a report on a New Mexican yoga cult   \u201cWrecking the House that Ruth Built,\u201d a proposal, sample chapter and outline for a book about corruption and Yankee Stadium   \u201cChristianity 2.0,\u201d a report on home worship and the reaction against the mega-church phenomenon   \u201cWhen the Facts of Life Aren\u2019t Facts,\u201d a report on sex education for students with special needs   \u00a0   Literary Reportage Master Class   The Fall 2014 Literary Reportage Master Class was taught by Sasha Weiss, the literary editor of\u00a0 Newyorker.com . Before \u00a0Before coming to\u00a0 The New Yorker , she was an editor at\u00a0 The New York Review of Books .\u00a0 Her writing has appeared on the\u00a0 Newyorker.com ,\u00a0 The Paris Review , Tablet, and elsewhere.   \u00a0     \u00a0       Upcoming Events         Program News   Congratulations to:   Laura Smith , Literary Reportage Kristian Jebsen , Magazine   Kristian Jebsen and Laura Smith, graduate students at New York University\u2019s Arthur L.

Carter Journalism Institute are pleased to announce a fully funded fellowship for students in, and alumni of, the Literary Reportage concentration.\u00a0 The fellowship offers an opportunity to develop a major essay, memoir, or feature piece during a month-long residency. Writers will work on their manuscript during weekly consultations with faculty editors, and round-table discussions with the other participants. By placing writers in a situation designed to challenge and stimulate their creativity, the program encourages the exploration of new ideas in journalism and experimentation with writing a piece that might otherwise be difficult to complete. The fellowship covers round trip airfare to Banff, and food and lodging during the month at the Banff Centre for the Arts.

This fellowship provided me with the necessary structure, freedom, and support to create a piece that I might not have completed otherwise\u00ad\u2014in my case, a piece of challenging, personal writing. Besides room and board, the Centre gives each writer a private cabin in the forested Leighton Artists\u2019 Colony, and plenty of time to write... I did not want to leave.

  \u00a0   About the Program   Journalism schools produce good reporters; MFA programs train beautiful writers. In the Literary Reportage concentration, we combine the best of both. Our students pursue their own long form projects, mentored by veteran writers in reporting classes, literature seminars, writing workshops and master classes taught by working editors .   Reporting is at the center of everything Literary Reportage students do. Whether you want to write a memoir, an expose, a portrait of a person or place, an extended consideration on the subject of your passion, it all starts with reporting. We\u2019ll teach you how to do what Tom Wolfe once termed \u201cstylish reporting.\u201d Many writing programs teach memoir, and that's something you can do in Literary Reportage, as well. The difference here is that we stress reporting \u2013 adding value to personal experience by collecting relevant information from the world outside one's head. Did your sister join a cult? Part of your mission would be to learn about the cult, past and present. Are there acquaintances from days gone by who could help set a remembered story in context? Part of your job might be to find them. That way, when you sit down to fashion your narrative, you'll have a richer set of materials to work with.You will then channel that reporting into well-researched, compelling narratives, which you will publish in professional venues while at NYU and, of course, beyond.   How do you apply? Like an aspiring novelist who submits short stories to an MFA program in the hopes of writing a novel, you submit a sample of your existing work (articles, blogs, videos, podcasts, essays--published or not), and a description of what you want to do while at NYU, whether a specific project or a kind of project. Think big, but also think concretely: What particular works or authors have inspired you and your project? What journalistic forms could you imagine it taking? What models do you have in mind?   Projects can be local, national, or international in scope. But since much of your reporting will be done while in residence at NYU, your project should have an NYC dimension. Some students divide their time between their final international or national project and its local iterations. In addition, access is important. You can\u2019t report on a subject if your subject won\u2019t talk to you. We\u2019ll help you as much as we can, but there are some worlds, like Hollywood, that simply can\u2019t be covered by NYC-based reporters. We don\u2019t care if you change your mind later \u2013 experimentation is part of the idea. That goes for form, as well: Some Literary Reportage students want to write books, others want to write articles. Some want to combine podcasts, video, books and articles. We will teach you how to work in all of these forms. We\u2019ll teach you how to use the technology (come visit and see our high tech facilities), whether in semester-long classes or intensive, week-long workshops. (All Literary Reportage students take a month-long, non-credit introductory multimedia course covering video, audio, slideshow and web skills.) But the most important thing we teach is how think in terms of \u201cstories.\u201d Rigorously reported, well-researched, imaginative, artfully written stories.   \u00a0   How does Literary Reportage work?   The courses are divided between journalism seminars and writing workshops. The first semester leans toward the former, while the remaining semesters leans toward the latter. For an overview of the curriculum click here . Literary Reportage became a full-fledged concentration in 2009, growing out of the Portfolio honors track , in which students learned how to build a coherent body of work over the course of two semesters. It worked well, and we suspected it would work even better if students applied with projects already in mind and had more time to complete their work. How does Literary Reportage differ from other the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s other concentrations and programs? Our applicants must apply with a project in mind and, like the Global program, Literary Reportage students produce a master\u2019s project in their fourth and final semester, during which you need not be in residence.   \u00a0   Final Projects   Here are some of the final projects Literary Reportage students have produced in our first three years:   \"We Were All Going To Be Queens,\" a reported memoir about the Catholic cult Regnum Christi   \"Ballerina 2.0,\" about dancer Drew Jacoby's use of new media for self-promotion   \"Mother of Invention,\u201d a reported memoir about a single woman's decision to have a child   \u201cOn Trails,\u201d a meditation on the twists and turns of human navigation   \u201cAlone in America,\u201d a report on Korean students studying abroad   \u201cSikhing for God,\u201d a report on a New Mexican yoga cult   \u201cWrecking the House that Ruth Built,\u201d a proposal, sample chapter and outline for a book about corruption and Yankee Stadium   \u201cChristianity 2.0,\u201d a report on home worship and the reaction against the mega-church phenomenon   \u201cWhen the Facts of Life Aren\u2019t Facts,\u201d a report on sex education for students with special needs   \u00a0   Literary Reportage Master Class   The Fall 2014 Literary Reportage Master Class was taught by Sasha Weiss, the literary editor of\u00a0 Newyorker.com .

Writers will work on their manuscript during weekly consultations with faculty editors, and round-table discussions with the other participants. By placing writers in a situation designed to challenge and stimulate their creativity, the program encourages the exploration of new ideas in journalism and experimentation with writing a piece that might otherwise be difficult to complete. The fellowship covers round trip airfare to Banff, and food and lodging during the month at the Banff Centre for the Arts.

Teachers talked to students and students responded with questions and comments. This content-?focused conversation has been the basis of almost all subsequent teaching and learning approaches. More recently, technology has permitted the recording of the human voice, and both live and recorded audio has been used for instruction.   Research has demonstrated that audio can be a very effective tool for student learning under the right conditions (Moreno, & Mayer, 2000; Mayer, Sobko, & Mautone, 2003; Mayer, 2005, Prion & Mitchell, 2008). Recorded audio files have been used as historical records of a live event, class or discussion, and to provide rich feedback to students about projects such as term papers. A more recent use of audio files is to offer just-in-time instructional support to students as they master difficult and complex content, or to provide remedial or enrichment content outside of the classroom (Prion & Mitchell, 2007a and 2007b).   The effectiveness of audio for learning is explained by the Dual Coding Theory (Paivio, 1985) and Mayers Theory of Multimedia Learning (2001). Paivios theory of dual processing proposed that humans collect instructionally-?related sensory input via two distinct but interrelated systems: a visual system for processing still and moving picture, diagrams, illustrations and written text, and an audio system for spoken word, music and other types of sound input. Subsequent research on working memory (Badderly, 1992) and cognitive load (Sweller, 1994) identified the importance of planned sensory input through both channels and cautioned about the problems caused by cognitive overload. Mayers theory (2001) integrated working memory and cognitive load with the advances in instructional technology to describe ways to maximize learning through the thoughtful use of the wide variety of technological adjuncts available (Mayer & Moreno, 2003). Mayers theory predicts that audio explanations will be more effective than text because text-?based explanations compete for limited cognitive processing space with the visual information because both used the same image coding system.   Just-in-time audio   This term is borrowed from business colleagues to describe relatively short audio files (typically under 10 minutes) that address specific student learning issues at the moment that these issues arise. Instructionally significant is that these audio files are created in response to a clear learning need identified by the instructor through student questions in the classroom, student email or online discussion board questions, or conceptual difficulties experience by previous students in the same type of class. These audio files provide timely and targeted conceptual scaffolding for students that can be easily downloaded from the course website and referenced as often as the student needs to master the content or concept.   Three types of audio narratives have been used to facilitate student learning:        Audio for known conceptual difficulties     Audio for unexpected conceptual difficulties     Audio for enrichment and supplementation       Audio narrative for known conceptual difficulties   In this instructional situation, audio narratives were developed in advance of the classroom discussion to address an especially difficult or confusing concept of which the instructor was aware from previous semesters. These were known challenging topics and it was expected that the students would have difficulty mastering the information after only one exposure. The file was made available on the course management site immediately after the class discussion was completed. Students first participated in the classroom explanation and then had unlimited access to an additional resource to review and reinforce their understanding. These files are formatted in MP3 or MP4 files so they can be played on any computer or mobile computing device. There is often one visual, usually a flowchart or a color-coded image or diagram that accompanies this audio file. An example of this type of audio narrative content would be the differences between statistical and practical significance calculations.   Audio narratives for emerging conceptual difficulties   The second type of just-in-time audio was used in situations when students unexpectedly struggled with a concept during class. Although the idea was explained it during class, it was very clear from student questions and demeanors that there was continued confusion about the content. The audio narrative provided at least one alternate explanation and directed students towards potentially useful resources that could be used to master the content. This type of audio reinforced the classroom content but also allowed the student to review the material at his or her own pace. This is very helpful when the classroom discussion flows too quickly for a students understanding. These audio files were recorded and edited within 24 hours of the class conclusion and uploaded to the course management site as MP4 files for maximum student accessibility. There was often one visual, usually a flowchart or a color-?coded image or diagram that accompanied this audio file. An example of this type of audio narrative content would be a review of research reliability and validity threats for entering doctoral students.  Audio narratives for conceptual enrichment and supplementation   Often, students demonstrate an interest in a topic that is not directly relevant to the course or does not justify a time-consuming classroom explanation. In this situation, a just-in-time audio narrative can serve as a fulfilling cognitive enrichment that supplements the classroom content but does not take extra classroom time. Like the other audio files, these narratives are made available on the course management website within two-three days of the classroom discussion and are formatted as MP3 or MP4 files for maximum accessibility. There is usually a resource list that accompanies these types of supplementary audio files. Examples of this type of audio narrative content include information about different types of effect size calculations, and a detailed description of post hoc statistical comparison techniques.   Identification of student learning needs   To maximize the effectiveness of these just-in-time audio files, the identification of student learning needs should be quick, precise and ongoing. The professors teaching diary from previous iterations of the course was useful in identifying difficult topics that might require an audio narrative. Review of student performance on test items, coupled with student questions from individual emails, class discussion boards, and office hours, all provided rich information for the creation of audio files. Student behavior during class, including the content and pattern of questions, also provide good information about the content for possible audio files.   Creation of the audio narratives   The instructor has an important opportunity for a teachable moment in response to these learning situations. Just-in-time audio narratives can provide key instructional support at the precise time that the student requires additional assistance in mastering the concept. Just-in-time audio narratives need to be prompt in responding to an identified learning need; precise in addressing the specific content for review; concise and complete but not overwhelming with too much information; professional quality because students listening to these files through high fidelity equipment will be annoyed by poor audio and distracting vocal habits; and personal, meaning that the students know that the audio narrative was made by their instructor in response to their identified learning needs.   Student feedback   Student reaction has been extremely positive to the instructional use of just-in-time audio narratives. A summative survey of student perceptions about the course collected affirmative comments (extremely helpful and helpful) from over 95% of the students enrolled in the class over five semesters (n = 92). Students reported relief knowing that an audio narrative would be available for difficult topics.   Students also reported that the audio files increased and enhanced their learning of the specific content. They rated the topics for the audio narratives as well-chosen. The audio quality was judged high or extremely high by respondents. The rapid availability of a high-quality audio narrative in response to an identified learning need was also rated highly.   Summary   Just-in-time audio files offer personalized study opportunities as students self-select which materials to review and how often to use the audio files. Audio narratives provide the instructor with alternate methods to encourage review of prerequisite knowledge and to offer enrichment with information that extends the textbook and course assignments. The human voice remains an effective teaching tool, both inside and beyond the classroom.   References   Baddeley, A. D. (1992). Working memory. Science, 255 (5044), 556-559.   Mayer, R. E. (2001).
