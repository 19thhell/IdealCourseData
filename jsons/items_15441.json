The program can also be useful training for students who are preparing for admission to doctoral programs in skeletal biology, molecular anthropology, and human evolution.         An integral part of the program is hands-on, semester long professional     internships developed according to student interest. These opportunities     range from those in genetics (in departmental labs and the ME&#8217;s     office), osteology and odontology (in departmental labs, NYU School     of Dentistry, the AMNH, and ME&#8217;s office), and field recovery training     (departmental or other field schools). Ideally, student research projects     will evolve from these internships into M.A. theses (see below). Yearly     skeletal biology colloquia bring visiting     scientists for talks and workshops.         The program is expected to take two years to complete, but can be somewhat     longer for those working full-time.                  Facilities     at NYU:     Skeletal     Morphology Laboratories          The Comparative Morphology Laboratory houses a comprehensive     series of comparative mammalian skeletons and cadavers, including a     large collection of non-human primates. The laboratory collections also     include an excellent cast collection of Paleogene to Pleistocene nonhuman     primate fossils. The lab is equipped with computer workstations, dissection,     and casting facilities, and an extensive research library.         The Faunal Analysis Laboratory houses comparative mammalian and     nonmammalian skeletal series critical to faunal identification in recent,     and particularly North American, sites. The laboratory collections include     domestic avian and mammalian faunas as well as examples of taphonomic     and human modifications of bone.         The Human Osteology Laboratory houses a comprehensive series     of whole and fragmentary medical teaching skeletons and instructional     sets for assessment of skeletal age and sex, dental anatomy and variation.     The laboratory is further equipped with a three-dimensional digitizer     (Microscribe 3DX), standard osteometric and anthropometric equipment,     light boxes for radiograph interpretation and a computer workstation     for viewing and measuring CT scans.         The Paleoanthropology Laboratory contains an excellent collection     of casts of hominin fossils from Pliocene to Late Pleistocene which     are used for both teaching and research purposes. The laboratory is     also equipped with a three-dimensional digitizer, as well as computers     with the necessary software for collection, processing and statistical     analysis of two- and three-dimensional coordinate data (i.e., Inscribe,     GRF-ND, Morpheus, tps, and Morphometrika), and general statistical packages     (i.e., SAS, Systat, Statistica and NT-SYS).      Population     Genetics and Molecular Anthropology Laboratory     The     Population Genetics and Molecular Anthropology Laboratory is one of     the best equipped molecular primatology laboratories in the country.     Over 2000 square feet provide support for all aspects of molecular primatological     research. The laboratory has bench space for up to 12 researchers at     a time. The laboratory is equipped with 10 thermocyclers for DNA amplification     (PCR), a Real-Time Quantitative PCR system, and an ABI 3730 automated DNA analysis system. All of the ancillary equipment required     for DNA extraction, typing, sequencing, quantification and other types     of analysis are available. An ancient DNA extraction facility is also     located within the anthropology building.                  Course     Requirements:     Formal     requirements are the satisfactory completion of 36 points and a written     master&#8217;s thesis.

The program can also be useful training for students who are preparing for admission to doctoral programs in skeletal biology, molecular anthropology, and human evolution.         An integral part of the program is hands-on, semester long professional     internships developed according to student interest. These opportunities     range from those in genetics (in departmental labs and the ME&#8217;s     office), osteology and odontology (in departmental labs, NYU School     of Dentistry, the AMNH, and ME&#8217;s office), and field recovery training     (departmental or other field schools). Ideally, student research projects     will evolve from these internships into M.A. theses (see below). Yearly     skeletal biology colloquia bring visiting     scientists for talks and workshops.         The program is expected to take two years to complete, but can be somewhat     longer for those working full-time.                  Facilities     at NYU:     Skeletal     Morphology Laboratories          The Comparative Morphology Laboratory houses a comprehensive     series of comparative mammalian skeletons and cadavers, including a     large collection of non-human primates. The laboratory collections also     include an excellent cast collection of Paleogene to Pleistocene nonhuman     primate fossils. The lab is equipped with computer workstations, dissection,     and casting facilities, and an extensive research library.         The Faunal Analysis Laboratory houses comparative mammalian and     nonmammalian skeletal series critical to faunal identification in recent,     and particularly North American, sites. The laboratory collections include     domestic avian and mammalian faunas as well as examples of taphonomic     and human modifications of bone.         The Human Osteology Laboratory houses a comprehensive series     of whole and fragmentary medical teaching skeletons and instructional     sets for assessment of skeletal age and sex, dental anatomy and variation.     The laboratory is further equipped with a three-dimensional digitizer     (Microscribe 3DX), standard osteometric and anthropometric equipment,     light boxes for radiograph interpretation and a computer workstation     for viewing and measuring CT scans.         The Paleoanthropology Laboratory contains an excellent collection     of casts of hominin fossils from Pliocene to Late Pleistocene which     are used for both teaching and research purposes. The laboratory is     also equipped with a three-dimensional digitizer, as well as computers     with the necessary software for collection, processing and statistical     analysis of two- and three-dimensional coordinate data (i.e., Inscribe,     GRF-ND, Morpheus, tps, and Morphometrika), and general statistical packages     (i.e., SAS, Systat, Statistica and NT-SYS).      Population     Genetics and Molecular Anthropology Laboratory     The     Population Genetics and Molecular Anthropology Laboratory is one of     the best equipped molecular primatology laboratories in the country.     Over 2000 square feet provide support for all aspects of molecular primatological     research. The laboratory has bench space for up to 12 researchers at     a time. The laboratory is equipped with 10 thermocyclers for DNA amplification     (PCR), a Real-Time Quantitative PCR system, and an ABI 3730 automated DNA analysis system. All of the ancillary equipment required     for DNA extraction, typing, sequencing, quantification and other types     of analysis are available. An ancient DNA extraction facility is also     located within the anthropology building.                  Course     Requirements:     Formal     requirements are the satisfactory completion of 36 points and a written     master&#8217;s thesis.

The department considers its greatest assets to be the various individual areas of faculty expertise: archaeological specialties such as medieval archaeology and European, Near Eastern, and South Asian prehistory; biological anthropology areas such as molecular primatology, primate behavioral ecology, evolutionary morphology, and paleoanthropology; linguistic anthropology foci such as discourse analysis and language socialization; and sociocultural anthropology specialties such as the ethnography of North America, Africa, India, China, the Near and Middle East, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe, Australia, and the South Pacific. Major theoretical emphasis is on the systems of thought and symbolic representation of the self and society; the relation between female and male domains of interaction; changing patterns of social organization and hierarchy within small-scale societies, urban settings, and bureaucratic institutions; medical anthropology; religion; art; science studies; race and ethnicity; and the problem of ethnographic representation in film and other media.    Departmental resources include an extensive film and video collection, as well as teaching and research labs for archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and biological anthropology, which can be used for research by advanced undergraduates. A departmental colloquium series and an undergraduate student association welcome undergraduate participation. Formal and informal cooperative arrangements with museums, zoos, and other academic institutions in the greater New York area place at students\u2019 disposal a group of anthropological scholars, materials, and resources unparalleled in this country.
