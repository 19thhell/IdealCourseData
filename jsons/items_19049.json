It is strongly recommended that you enroll in Post-Production Colloquium, FMTV-UT 60, 1 credit, in the same semester that you are enrolled in any intermediate-level core production course. This intermediate level class builds on skills acquired in both Sight &amp; Sound: Studio and Intermediate Television as well as introduces students to the collaboration process, which is the heart of Advanced Television and the industry. Students will collaborate as writers and producers to write and then produce a television show, 15-30 minutes long, aimed at a specific age group such as pre-school or \u201ctweens.\u201d They will participate in every aspect of creating a show from the bottom up \u2013 writing, producing, directing, sound design, music, graphics, casting, and editing. Once the show is written students will work in groups to produce segments of the show, taking on such roles as producers, directors, sound mixers and designers, videographers, and editors. Besides being able to use the 12th Floor studios, students will have equipment and facilities for location shooting and post-production, which offers them the opportunity to draw on and hone skills required in Sight &amp; Sound: Film and other craft and intermediate level courses. Each student will be expected to participate both where he/she thinks the best contribution to the class can be made, as well as be willing to pitch in where and when necessary. Students will be encouraged to wear as many hats as they like, and to gain experience in areas they may not have worked in prior to this class. As a result, they will learn what it\u2019s like to put together a television show. The course is also an excellent transition to Advanced Television and for seeking work in the industry.
