The Head of Dance at the New Studio on Broadway, which houses our music theatre program, will review and evaluate all candidates. In order for him to do this, we are providing a couple of different opportunities for candidates to be evaluated for dance. Freshperson music theatre candidates attending artistic reviews in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and transfer music theatre candidates in New York, will participate in a dance call, wherein they will be taught a combination incorporating elements of ballet and contemporary dance. Freshperson candidates attending artistic reviews in San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, and Miami, and transfer candidates attending in Chicago and Los Angeles, along with those submitting digital artistic reviews, will be required to submit a dance video. Both forms of submission will provide the necessary information for a proper evaluation. Brief descriptions of each can be found below. Detailed guidelines for submitting your dance video can be found in the PDFs to the right. DANCE CALL (Freshpeople in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and Transfers in New York Only) \u2028In small groups, candidates will be taught one combination that includes elements of ballet and some sort of contemporary dance (modern, jazz, Afro-centric, etc.). The purpose of the dance call is to assess your relationship to movement and your responsiveness to choreography.  \u2022 Please wear comfortable, fitted clothes that provide ease of movement  \u2022 You may wear ballet slippers, jazz shoes or no shoes (but no high-heeled character shoes) \u2022 You will have time to change into another outfit for your acting and singing evaluations \u2028DIGITAL DANCE SUBMISSION (Freshpeople in San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Miami, Transfers in Chicago and Los Angeles , and all Digitals ) If your audition city does not provide a dance call, you will be required to share with us a video of a one- to two-minute prepared dance solo to musical accompaniment. Choose your own music, which may include Broadway, hip-hop, classical or pop music, for example. Design your own choreography \u2014 by yourself or with help from a teacher or a dancer friend \u2014 and incorporate elements of dance that inspire you, like ballet, jazz, folk dance, tap or hip-hop. If you can think of it, you can use it. Include anything that showcases your use of the body as a creative instrument, demonstrating full body expressiveness and love of movement. The video must be created specifically for this artistic review. A clip from a previous performance is not acceptable. Please follow the more specific guidelines for submitting your dance video in the PDFs to the right.  Dance video deadlines apply only to candidates with in-person artistic reviews in cities which did not provide a dance call. Digital submission candidates have an earlier deadline for all five of their videos to be uploaded.

ETW\u2019s training covers a wide range of approaches to acting, dance, self-scripting, and vocal performance. Rather than imposing a single aesthetic frame, the ETW curriculum provides students with fundamental performance skills, while helping them discover and shape their own unique artistic visions. ETW curriculum is divided into primary training for first- and second-year students, who follow a prescribed course of study, and an upper level for third- and fourth-year students, who choose from a variety of advanced courses in voice, movement, and acting.

THEA-UT 480 \u2022 Experimental Theatre Workshop \u2022 4 points    The Experimental Theatre Wing is a unique, physically based acting program with an international reputation for developing creative artists, courageous actors at ease in their bodies, who are alive to new ideas. The professional training program combines the physical impulse-based acting techniques of Jerzy Grotowski with the psychological character work of Stanislavsky. In addition, the primary curriculum emphasizes movement and includes Viewpoints (a method for separating, examining, and experimenting with the elements of acting), contact improvisation, extended vocal technique, singing, and various approaches to creating original work. ETW is dedicated to providing students with a comprehensive training program that enables them to shape their own artistic visions and to perform in a wide range of theatrical styles. ETW faculty members are vibrant professionals in the forefront of creating contemporary theatre, dance, and music.    Summer studio training consists of physically based acting, character-based scene work, improvisation, speech and vocal performance (focusing on freeing the voice and finding each student\u2019s unique quality), movement (heightening body awareness with training in contact improvisation, Viewpoints, and hip-hop), and self-scripting classes where students have the opportunity to create original work.
