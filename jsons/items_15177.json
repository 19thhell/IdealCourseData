The finance chart lists the advanced electives by the subfield to which they belong and the associated prerequisites. Note that the material in several courses overlaps both subfields.    If you are not concentrating in Finance, but would like to be have some exposure to corporate finance and investment/capital markets, Foundations of Finance (FINC-UB 2) followed by Corporate Finance (FINC-UB 7) provides an excellent overview of these two areas in finance.    No more than six finance courses beyond FINC-UB 2 should be taken as part of a student\u2019s program of study.

The finance chart lists the advanced electives by the subfield to which they belong and the associated prerequisites. Note that the material in several courses overlaps both subfields.    If you are not concentrating in Finance, but would like to be have some exposure to corporate finance and investment/capital markets, Foundations of Finance (FINC-UB 2) followed by Corporate Finance (FINC-UB 7) provides an excellent overview of these two areas in finance.    No more than six finance courses beyond FINC-UB 2 should be taken as part of a student\u2019s program of study.

Corporate finance focuses primarily on financial issues at the firm level, such as how new companies raise capital, how companies decide on a capital structure of equity versus short-term and long-term debt, and the governance structure of firms. These issues hold relevance for students who want to understand the broad financial issues and choices facing firms and how these choices influence performance, valuation and risk. A corporate finance specialization is useful for students who will work in corporate financial operations and in other finance assignments, such as fundamental company analysis, private equity, mergers and acquisitions, etc.     Academic Advisor: Professor Yakov Amihud , 212-998-0720      Course List  Take 9 credits from the following list:                 ACCT-GB.2305      Taxes and Business Strategy              FINC-GB.2302      Corporate Finance              FINC-GB.2304      Restructuring Firms and Industries              FINC-GB.2310      Managing Financial Businesses              FINC-GB.2329      Real Estate Primary Markets              FINC-GB.2334      Investment Banking              FINC-GB.3125      Corporate Strategy and Finance in Entertainment and Media              FINC-GB.3126      Financial Analysis-Entertainment and Media              FINC-GB.3128      Business Development in Media and Entertainment              FINC-GB.3129      Behavioral and Experimental Finance              FINC-GB.3143      Digital Music Business              FINC-GB.3145      Investment Banking and Private Equity in Media and Entertainment              FINC-GB.3148      Social Venture Capital              FINC-GB.3160      Topics in Corporate Finance              FINC-GB.3161      Cases in Corporate Finance              FINC-GB.3165      Topics in Private Equity Finance              FINC-GB.3173      Venture Capital Financing              FINC-GB.3186      Project Finance and Infrastructure Investment              FINC-GB.3196      Mergers and Acquisitions              FINC-GB.3198      Bankruptcy and Reorganization              FINC-GB.3199      Case Studies in Bankruptcy &amp; Reorganization              FINC-GB.3329      Behavioral Finance              FINC-GB.3331      Valuation              FINC-GB.3343      Business of Music and Film              FINC-GB.3345      Law and Business of Corporate Transactions              FINC-GB.3348      Investing for Environmental and Social Impact              FINC-GB.3353      Law and Management of Financial Services Businesses              FINC-GB.3361      Entrepreneurial Finance              FINC-GB.3365      Private Equity Finance              FINC-GB.3373      New Venture Financing              FINC-GB.3388      International Financial Management              FINC-GB.3399      Law &amp; Business of Bankruptcy and Reorganization              INTA-GB.3143      Digital Music Business              INTA-GB.3150      Corporate Transformation and Leadership              MGMT-GB.2328      Managing Family Businesses and Privately Held Firms             For course descriptions, please see the Office of Records &amp; Registration website .
