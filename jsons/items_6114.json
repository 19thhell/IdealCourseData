Corequisite(s):                 NURSE-GN 2X11.           The leadership role of the family nurse practitioner (FNP) in the primary care setting is analyzed as a framework for managing the healthcare needs of individuals and families across the lifespan with complex health problems. Acute and chronic health care needs of individuals, families and communities are assessed, diagnosed, managed and evaluated using evidence-based best practices. Emphasis is placed on the leadership role of the FNP in providing ethical, culturally competent and collaborative health care, yielding quality and cost-effective outcomes. The clinical component allows the student to apply theoretical foundations of advanced nursing practice to clinical settings.
