Description       In this seminar we will focus on the political force of photography: how do photographic images shape our understanding of citizenship, freedom, and what comes to count as war, or terror, or revolution? Under what political, legal or cultural conditions is it possible to see and to show the suffering of others, and in what ways can photographs change not only what becomes visible as violence, but what kinds of suffering--and what modes of resistance--move us affectively, ethically, politically? At its core, our work will be to better understand the complex linkages between perception and understanding, and how photographs, as the modern visual form par excellence, shape our sense of the political world and our place in it. The seminar will introduce students to key theoretical works on photography (including Sontag, Barthes, and Benjamin) and more recent critical interventions that focus on the colonial context (Hall, Alloula, Chaudhary, Enwezor). Together we will work toward an understanding of the power relations that sustain and enable photographic meaning, what Ariela Azoulay refers to as \u201cthe civil contract of photography.\u201d The course presumes an interest not only in photography, but in political and aesthetic theory.

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

Description       In this seminar we will focus on the political force of photography: how do photographic images shape our understanding of citizenship, freedom, and what comes to count as war, or terror, or revolution? Under what political, legal or cultural conditions is it possible to see and to show the suffering of others, and in what ways can photographs change not only what becomes visible as violence, but what kinds of suffering--and what modes of resistance--move us affectively, ethically, politically? At its core, our work will be to better understand the complex linkages between perception and understanding, and how photographs, as the modern visual form par excellence, shape our sense of the political world and our place in it. The seminar will introduce students to key theoretical works on photography (including Sontag, Barthes, and Benjamin) and more recent critical interventions that focus on the colonial context (Hall, Alloula, Chaudhary, Enwezor). Together we will work toward an understanding of the power relations that sustain and enable photographic meaning, what Ariela Azoulay refers to as \u201cthe civil contract of photography.\u201d The course presumes an interest not only in photography, but in political and aesthetic theory.

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

B. Huber's teaching and research interests include critical theory, aesthetics and politics, and the literature and visual culture of modernity. Much of her work current work is focused on the force and form of critique in times of war. She has an essay entitled &quot;The Claims of the Dead: Human Rights and Civilian Casualties in Pakistan&quot;\u00a0 \u00a0forthcoming in the volume\u00a0 Human Rights: New Possibilities/New Problems \u00a0, and at present she is revising a manuscript that focuses on archival materials from the Strategic Bombing Survey of 1945. This project considers how the American tactical and political use of terror against civilians in Japan and Germany--where Shock &amp; Awe was first named and tested--raises a number of timely questions about fear and the rhetorical deployment of &quot;security&quot; in U.S. politics and policies. She is also at work on a commissioned piece on violence and the visual with the artist Mary Walling Blackburn: &quot;Thinking Through Images&quot; will appear in\u00a0 triplecanopy \u00a0. Huber taught and took part in the Radical Citizenship Tutorials on Angel Island in San Francisco and Governors Island in New York in the Summer of 2010. In Fall 2010 she was at the University of California Berkeley on a Mellon Fellowship in Critical Theory.                                     top of page                                     Contact Information     A.B.
