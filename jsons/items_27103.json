Vi has a command mode and an insert (or &quot;editing&quot;) mode. You are, initially, always in command mode. The a and i commands (see below) will put you in editing mode.

From June 26th until 30th 2015 , we will celebrate our 10th anniversary in Opatija, Croatia . We welcome you to join us, reflect on the road that we have travelled, celebrate, and reflect on where the future lies for a continued &#8216;critical turn&#8217; in tourism studies.                                                                                                                    by                                                                    How to get there                February 1, 2015 April 28, 2015  Lynn                      Hello to all CTS\u2019ers !     We are hoping you are counting down to the June conference as much as we are.   A few delegates have asked us about transport arrangements to Opatija, so we thought we would put this blog post together with the best flight options.     The closest airport to Opatija is Rijeka . There are direct flights from BERLIN \u2013 BERN \u2013 BRUSSELS (CHARLEROI)- COPENHAGEN \u2013 DUBROVNIK \u2013 DUSSELDORF \u2013 FRANKFURT \u2013 HAMBURG \u2013 HELSINKI \u2013 INNSBRUCK \u2013 KOLN \u2013 KO\u0160ICE \u2013 LONDON (HEATHROW, STANSTED) \u2013 MALTA \u2013 MOSCOW \u2013 MUNICH \u2013 OSIJEK \u2013 OSLO \u2013OSLO (RYGGE) \u2013 RIGA \u2013 SPLIT -STOCKHOLM (SKAVSKA)- STUTTGART \u2013 VILNIUS \u2013 TALINN \u2013 ZAGREB.\u00a0   We recommend this airport to our delegates, because there is a fast and very affordable bus service to Opatija (\u20ac10 per person). The bus stop is 2 minutes from the hotel.   Other options are the airports of Pula (1 hour), Trieste (Italy, 1.5 hours), Ljubljana (Slovenia, 1 hour 45 minutes) and Zagreb (2 hours).   We will be offering transfers from these airports to the Ambasador Hotel, to be paid in cash on site. The prices are listed below:         \u00a0Airport   \u00a0Car 1-3 places   Mini-van 3-8 places       \u00a0PULA   \u00a085,00 \u20ac   \u00a0160,00 \u20ac       \u00a0ZAGREB   \u00a0120,00 \u20ac   \u00a0144,00 \u20ac       \u00a0LJUBLJANA   \u00a0140,00 \u20ac   \u00a0186,00 \u20ac       \u00a0TRIESTE   \u00a0120,00 \u20ac   \u00a0156,00 \u20ac           We have larger buses available too for groups over 8 people \u2013 those can bring the price per person down even further.   To get the best value, we will try to group delegates arriving at the same airport into one transfer. If you would like to make use of this service, please complete the form below:   https://nyu.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_5yUcz14OOjh4Map   A bus service is also available from Zagreb airport to Rijeka and tickets can be bought here:   http://www.plesoprijevoz.hr/   The bus departs at 3.30 pm, and from Rijeka it is an easy taxi ride to Opatija or you can take bus number 32.   If you have any questions we can help with, just let us know!
