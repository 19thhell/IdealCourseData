This course surveys representations of sexual and gender difference in literary and cultural production, focusing especially on texts authored by women. Students consider theories of gender and sexuality that enable us to consider how literature depicts and engages social relations and, conversely, how our reading practices enact (or transform) social conventions regarding gender difference.
