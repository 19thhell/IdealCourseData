Description       Beyond Picture Perfect explores the many choices available to today\u2019s image makers. New technology combined with traditional photographic techniques will be addressed, enabling the students to realize their distinctive image-making vocabulary. Weekly discussions include understanding hardware mechanics, choosing a personal color palette, and recognizing \u201cyour\u201d unique composition key. We will debate the many analog and digital tools available to photographers vital to their artistic expression. These concepts will be supported by weekly assignments and class critiques culminating in a final project portfolio. Students with interest in analog or digital formats will be encouraged to develop an understanding of their medium and form an original visual strategy. Museum/ gallery visits and field trips for on-location photographing will inspire students to create their own way of seeing.
