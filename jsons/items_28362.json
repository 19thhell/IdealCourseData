We are concerned with the overall well-being of SSSW doctoral students and with their participation in the social, academic and professional life of the school. We function as a unifying body for all SSSW doctoral cohorts. We also collaborate with doctoral students from other academic departments, within and outside of NYU, especially with PhD students at other schools of social work in the region. Towards the accomplishment of these goals, the DSA serves as a liaison among SSSW faculty, university administrators and students.

The GSA also plans several events for the student body throughout the academic year, such as student-to-student forums, student faculty meets, informal networking events for social work students, mentoring programs, coffee workshops, end-of-semester celebrations, career panels, and a graduation party.

SAASH seeks to develop an atmosphere of mutual aid and support among members and, at the same time, promote discussion on how our professional values as social workers are often connected to our positive moral and ethical values as non-theists and humanists. SAASH is also committed to exploring the ways in which the social, political, and historical foundations of the social work profession were, in many ways, influenced by humanist and non-theistic thinking, and how modern practitioners can revisit and reclaim the secular legacy of social work. Finally, SAASH wishes to promote dialogue between social work students and practitioners who identify as atheist, agnostic, and/or Secular Humanist, those who identify as religious or theist, and those who aren\u2019t sure where they stand, in hopes of enriching the intellectual and academic environment here at Silver.

We also collaborate with doctoral students from other academic departments, within and outside of NYU, especially with PhD students at other schools of social work in the region. Towards the accomplishment of these goals, the DSA serves as a liaison among SSSW faculty, university administrators and students.

SAASH is also committed to exploring the ways in which the social, political, and historical foundations of the social work profession were, in many ways, influenced by humanist and non-theistic thinking, and how modern practitioners can revisit and reclaim the secular legacy of social work. Finally, SAASH wishes to promote dialogue between social work students and practitioners who identify as atheist, agnostic, and/or Secular Humanist, those who identify as religious or theist, and those who aren\u2019t sure where they stand, in hopes of enriching the intellectual and academic environment here at Silver.

Transnational Everyday Life     This research group on \u2018everyday life\u2019 intends to refocus on the material and cultural dimensions of the everyday. A crucial impulse behind this project is to de-mystify an obsessive focus on extraordinary events of violence and catastrophe in a global context. While exploring everyday life in the Euro-American context, a considerable part of the project will be devoted to the study of everyday life in the Muslim world.

Archival Practice Workshop     During the 2013-2014 school year, the Workshop in Archival Practice will be exploring the intersections between book history, broadly defined, and the archive. As in many other fields, the contribution of archival research to scholarship in the history of the book is not often discussed, and we hope to generate interesting questions and avenues for research through our readings and conversations. Below are the questions that form the basis of this inquiry and that can and likely will change as we explore the topic in more depth:         What does interesting and excellent book history look like? How is archival research integrated into this work?   What can we learn from this work that can be applied in our own?   How do we, as scholars interested in the book history and/or archives, make responsible use of previous research done in these field in our own work (which may or may not necessarily be related)?   What are the archives of book history? Where are they located (perhaps with a specific focus on finding/visiting collections in New York City)?   What are ways in which scholarship, whether our own or that of others, effectively connects these two fields with a larger concept of media history?

Digital Experiments     Digital Experiments is a graduate-faculty working group in the Department of English at New York University. Our group explores and develops tools for digital research in the humanities. The group pursues a broad understanding of the intersection between digital tools and humanistic inquiry by engaging in collaborative practices of research, writing, and discussion. Taking a cue from Samuel Johnson\u2019s definition of \u201cexperiment\u201d\u2014\u201cThe Trial of anything; something done in order to discover an uncertain or unknown effect\u201d\u2014we view our work as an investigation into how digital tools and practices can reshape  literary studies today.     Our work is driven as much by process as by product. While members of the group have varied research interests\u2014ranging from early modern knowledge systems to contemporary social media platforms\u2014we share and foster investigative practices that query the division between making and critiquing. As we acquire new skills in digital textual analysis, we reflect on the conceptual underpinnings of these methods. To this end, we have adopted a variety of reflexive critical strategies for our meetings, including the \u201ccharette model\u201d of production, which entails short-term solutions to long-term conceptual and methodological problems.

Modern and Contemporary Culture (MACC)     The \u201cModern and Contemporary Colloquium (MACC)\u201d will continue to provide a forum for students and faculty whose intellectual interests converge on modern and contemporary topics, social movements, and cultural products. Given the flexibility of its frame, MACC aims to foster conversations that cut across cultural, linguistic, national and geographic specializations, as well as period and disciplinary divisions. To this effect, MACC will organize presentations, round tables, and discussion groups that explore a range of topics pertaining to modernization, modernisms, (post)modernity, and contemporary literatures and cultures. In general, our sessions will fall into the following categories:         Discussions of key texts in modern literature, culture, and theory   Panel presentations by MA and Doctoral students' work with faculty and student respondents (possibly organized as a conference).   Presentations and discussion of longer papers by graduate students, NYU faculty, and visiting speakers.       In the 2012-13 academic year, MACC plans to organize its events around a general theme, though sessions will remain open to refashioning and redirection\u2014or, to the particular, timely needs and interests of our intellectual community. The upcoming year's theme will be \u201cMemory Strategies.\u201d      Faculty advisors for 2013\u201314: Peter Nicholls , Patrick Deer    Contact information: David Hobbs , Caitlin Hurst           5. NewYorkScapes     NewYorkScapes is dedicated to exploring the textual productions that emerge from and are based in New York City along with their relationships to local, national, and global cultures and spaces. Part of a Humanities Initiative working group and departmental Digital Commons project, NYScapes focuses on combining the methods and concepts of the spatial humanities, a developing branch of the digital humanities, with traditional literary inquiry. Applying the analytical tools of geographic information systems (GIS) technology\u2014the driving force behind the spatial humanities\u2014will enable the group to examine links between literary New York and its physical and imaginative streets and structures, offering exciting insights into the spatial and temporal dimensions of cultural materials.

Done Dissertation     \u201cThe Done Dissertation: A Forum for Writers\u201d is intended to provide a public forum for every dissertation writer. A student who has recently defended will present a section of the completed project and field questions from the NYU community. In addition to recognizing a successful defense and completion of the PhD, the forum recognizes students who are in the midst of writing because it provides them with an opportunity to learn from colleagues as well as to voice their own experiences as writers. The English department event space at Greene St. would be the preferred venue. These events will  be held shortly after a student defends. We plan to schedule our first event in early September.      Contact information: Bridget McFarland , Veronica Goosey           7. Pope and/in Media     We are planning to hold an event focusing on the work of Alexander Pope, his poetics, his politics, his peers, and the media ecology of the eighteenth century. This event will combine elements of a conference and a workshop, emphasizing collaborative work before, during and after the meeting. Late spring or early fall 2014 at NYU (exact building TBD).      Contact information: Pat Abatiell , Rob Koehler , Laura Yoder           8. Pun Pilgrimage     This is a one-off evening event, scheduled as October's First Wednesday event (October 2, 7 pm, 300 Silver Center), followed by a reception in the Event Space at 244 Greene Street. Introduced by Jo Livingstone (Graduate Student, NYU English Department) and presented in conjunction with NYU Professor John Archer's undergraduate Shakespeare course, London-based performance artist Hannah Catherine Jones, aka Foxy Moron, asks: What does it mean to perform a pun? To become a pun? This interdisciplinary event explores the art and science of the pun as a marriage of language and action through a performative artist talk, including selected works from Jones' repertoire and a question and answer session.

Post-colonial     The Postcolonial Seminar provides a forum for the discussion of current issues in postcolonial theory by inviting prominent figures in the field to discuss their recent work. In addition to providing a means for students and faculty in the English department to further pursue interests in postcolonial studies beyond the classroom, the Postcolonial Seminar also serves as a vital forum to create dialogues between other departments and institutions.

Romanticist Research Group     Group organizers will be presenting in the Art and Scholarship special session of the M/MLA Conference (Nov. 2013) on last year\u2019s event, the production of the staged reading of Sardanapalus and its implications for literary scholarship. This presentation will be followed by a co-produced staged reading of Percy Shelley\u2019s Prometheus Unbound with Red Bull Theater, scheduled for November 18, 2013. In addition to maintaining our blog (nyurrg.org), we will make use of new digital opportunities to document our experience through video interviews with directors and other Red Bull affiliates. The organizers will be be using both performances as case studies for a collaborative article.      Group co-ordinators for the event 2013\u201314: Omar F. Miranda , Veronica Goosey , Randall Sessler           11. Medieval Forum     The Medieval Forum is an arena in which faculty and graduate students from the New York metropolitan area can engage in the lively exchange of a thriving center of medieval scholarship. We intend to host one public event each semester, likely in conjunction with the Medieval and Renaissance Center, and meet once or twice a semester for an informal reading group to practice reading aloud (specifically not translating) medieval languages, especially Old, Early Middle, and Late Middle English. We anticipate inviting a medieval professor from NYU and/or from the New York metropolitan area to participate in the reading group and then ending with a dinner, to which all attendees would be invited. We have already begun planning the 3rd Annual Medieval Manuscripts Workshop with Martha Rust for the Fall (late September and early October).

Organism for Poetic Research (OCR)     The Organism for Poetic Research (OPR) organizes and initiates events that open a collaborative field for experimentation and research performed in the humanities, the natural sciences, the visual arts and poetry. The OPR produces the annual magazine PELT (available in distinct manifestations in print and on the web) which features work by artists and academics connected with OPR activities and events. The OPR website advertises calls for work and OPR events, publishes proceedings from events (in the form of text, image, audio, and video files), hosts web residencies held by artists and academics, and publishes webPELT, an online magazine that reproduces materials from the printed PELT (thereby allowing it a wider circulation) and contributes materials better suited to a digital medium.

Politics of the Contemporary Novel Reading Group     This group focuses on the politics of the contemporary novel, particularly in relation to \"global\" paradigms of literary and critical practice. We ask what the novel does to organize narrative worlds, as well as how it might be said to critique or re-imagine existing frameworks for understanding the political realities of the contemporary moment. In doing so, we also address the dynamics by which novels circulate throughout the globe, and seek to interrogate and expand current critical methods for reading this complex set of literary phenomena.     Our group, then, also seeks to ask questions of the discipline itself - to dig deeper into some of the commonplaces of our practice and to refine our understanding of the political potentialities of both literature and literary criticism. We ask, for instance, what might it really mean for a novel to act politically? In what ways can it be said that the novel intervenes in politics? And how can critique itself function best as a political practice in the contemporary moment? We will select readings according to group interest, but in general each meeting will pair a work of contemporary fiction with relevant selections from recent scholarly work.      Contact information: Pat Abatiell           14. The Victorian Reading Group     We will ruminate over primary texts (both fictional and non-fictional) written in the post-Romantic 19th century. We will concern ourselves with readings that deal with the prominent social issues of the Victorian era: the \u2018woman question\u2019 (marriage, suffrage, bodily autonomy, etc.), industrialization and its effects (slums, the urban poor, changed conditions of labour, etc.), colony and Empire. As opposed to focusing solely on long novels and poetry\u2014as is often the temptation with Victorian literature\u2014the group will read shorter texts that were widely distributed and widely read at the time of publication, with a particular focus on the short story as an emergent literary genre. We will read works that appeared in publications such as Household Words, Blackwoods, The Morning Chronicle, and Graham\u2019s Magazine , among others. We will, in other words, look to the popular instead of exclusively the canonical and examine how contemporary texts reflected and shaped the dialogue around the issues of the day.

We are concerned with the overall well-being of SSSW doctoral students and with their participation in the social, academic and professional life of the school. We function as a unifying body for all SSSW doctoral cohorts. We also collaborate with doctoral students from other academic departments, within and outside of NYU, especially with PhD students at other schools of social work in the region. Towards the accomplishment of these goals, the DSA serves as a liaison among SSSW faculty, university administrators and students.

SAASH seeks to develop an atmosphere of mutual aid and support among members and, at the same time, promote discussion on how our professional values as social workers are often connected to our positive moral and ethical values as non-theists and humanists. SAASH is also committed to exploring the ways in which the social, political, and historical foundations of the social work profession were, in many ways, influenced by humanist and non-theistic thinking, and how modern practitioners can revisit and reclaim the secular legacy of social work. Finally, SAASH wishes to promote dialogue between social work students and practitioners who identify as atheist, agnostic, and/or Secular Humanist, those who identify as religious or theist, and those who aren\u2019t sure where they stand, in hopes of enriching the intellectual and academic environment here at Silver.

Transnational Everyday Life     This research group on \u2018everyday life\u2019 intends to refocus on the material and cultural dimensions of the everyday. A crucial impulse behind this project is to de-mystify an obsessive focus on extraordinary events of violence and catastrophe in a global context. While exploring everyday life in the Euro-American context, a considerable part of the project will be devoted to the study of everyday life in the Muslim world.

Archival Practice Workshop     During the 2013-2014 school year, the Workshop in Archival Practice will be exploring the intersections between book history, broadly defined, and the archive. As in many other fields, the contribution of archival research to scholarship in the history of the book is not often discussed, and we hope to generate interesting questions and avenues for research through our readings and conversations. Below are the questions that form the basis of this inquiry and that can and likely will change as we explore the topic in more depth:         What does interesting and excellent book history look like? How is archival research integrated into this work?   What can we learn from this work that can be applied in our own?   How do we, as scholars interested in the book history and/or archives, make responsible use of previous research done in these field in our own work (which may or may not necessarily be related)?   What are the archives of book history? Where are they located (perhaps with a specific focus on finding/visiting collections in New York City)?   What are ways in which scholarship, whether our own or that of others, effectively connects these two fields with a larger concept of media history?

Digital Experiments     Digital Experiments is a graduate-faculty working group in the Department of English at New York University. Our group explores and develops tools for digital research in the humanities. The group pursues a broad understanding of the intersection between digital tools and humanistic inquiry by engaging in collaborative practices of research, writing, and discussion. Taking a cue from Samuel Johnson\u2019s definition of \u201cexperiment\u201d\u2014\u201cThe Trial of anything; something done in order to discover an uncertain or unknown effect\u201d\u2014we view our work as an investigation into how digital tools and practices can reshape  literary studies today.     Our work is driven as much by process as by product. While members of the group have varied research interests\u2014ranging from early modern knowledge systems to contemporary social media platforms\u2014we share and foster investigative practices that query the division between making and critiquing. As we acquire new skills in digital textual analysis, we reflect on the conceptual underpinnings of these methods. To this end, we have adopted a variety of reflexive critical strategies for our meetings, including the \u201ccharette model\u201d of production, which entails short-term solutions to long-term conceptual and methodological problems.

Modern and Contemporary Culture (MACC)     The \u201cModern and Contemporary Colloquium (MACC)\u201d will continue to provide a forum for students and faculty whose intellectual interests converge on modern and contemporary topics, social movements, and cultural products. Given the flexibility of its frame, MACC aims to foster conversations that cut across cultural, linguistic, national and geographic specializations, as well as period and disciplinary divisions. To this effect, MACC will organize presentations, round tables, and discussion groups that explore a range of topics pertaining to modernization, modernisms, (post)modernity, and contemporary literatures and cultures. In general, our sessions will fall into the following categories:         Discussions of key texts in modern literature, culture, and theory   Panel presentations by MA and Doctoral students' work with faculty and student respondents (possibly organized as a conference).   Presentations and discussion of longer papers by graduate students, NYU faculty, and visiting speakers.       In the 2012-13 academic year, MACC plans to organize its events around a general theme, though sessions will remain open to refashioning and redirection\u2014or, to the particular, timely needs and interests of our intellectual community. The upcoming year's theme will be \u201cMemory Strategies.\u201d      Faculty advisors for 2013\u201314: Peter Nicholls , Patrick Deer    Contact information: David Hobbs , Caitlin Hurst           5. NewYorkScapes     NewYorkScapes is dedicated to exploring the textual productions that emerge from and are based in New York City along with their relationships to local, national, and global cultures and spaces. Part of a Humanities Initiative working group and departmental Digital Commons project, NYScapes focuses on combining the methods and concepts of the spatial humanities, a developing branch of the digital humanities, with traditional literary inquiry. Applying the analytical tools of geographic information systems (GIS) technology\u2014the driving force behind the spatial humanities\u2014will enable the group to examine links between literary New York and its physical and imaginative streets and structures, offering exciting insights into the spatial and temporal dimensions of cultural materials.

Done Dissertation     \u201cThe Done Dissertation: A Forum for Writers\u201d is intended to provide a public forum for every dissertation writer. A student who has recently defended will present a section of the completed project and field questions from the NYU community. In addition to recognizing a successful defense and completion of the PhD, the forum recognizes students who are in the midst of writing because it provides them with an opportunity to learn from colleagues as well as to voice their own experiences as writers. The English department event space at Greene St. would be the preferred venue. These events will  be held shortly after a student defends. We plan to schedule our first event in early September.      Contact information: Bridget McFarland , Veronica Goosey           7. Pope and/in Media     We are planning to hold an event focusing on the work of Alexander Pope, his poetics, his politics, his peers, and the media ecology of the eighteenth century. This event will combine elements of a conference and a workshop, emphasizing collaborative work before, during and after the meeting. Late spring or early fall 2014 at NYU (exact building TBD).      Contact information: Pat Abatiell , Rob Koehler , Laura Yoder           8. Pun Pilgrimage     This is a one-off evening event, scheduled as October's First Wednesday event (October 2, 7 pm, 300 Silver Center), followed by a reception in the Event Space at 244 Greene Street. Introduced by Jo Livingstone (Graduate Student, NYU English Department) and presented in conjunction with NYU Professor John Archer's undergraduate Shakespeare course, London-based performance artist Hannah Catherine Jones, aka Foxy Moron, asks: What does it mean to perform a pun? To become a pun? This interdisciplinary event explores the art and science of the pun as a marriage of language and action through a performative artist talk, including selected works from Jones' repertoire and a question and answer session.

Post-colonial     The Postcolonial Seminar provides a forum for the discussion of current issues in postcolonial theory by inviting prominent figures in the field to discuss their recent work. In addition to providing a means for students and faculty in the English department to further pursue interests in postcolonial studies beyond the classroom, the Postcolonial Seminar also serves as a vital forum to create dialogues between other departments and institutions.

Romanticist Research Group     Group organizers will be presenting in the Art and Scholarship special session of the M/MLA Conference (Nov. 2013) on last year\u2019s event, the production of the staged reading of Sardanapalus and its implications for literary scholarship. This presentation will be followed by a co-produced staged reading of Percy Shelley\u2019s Prometheus Unbound with Red Bull Theater, scheduled for November 18, 2013. In addition to maintaining our blog (nyurrg.org), we will make use of new digital opportunities to document our experience through video interviews with directors and other Red Bull affiliates. The organizers will be be using both performances as case studies for a collaborative article.      Group co-ordinators for the event 2013\u201314: Omar F. Miranda , Veronica Goosey , Randall Sessler           11. Medieval Forum     The Medieval Forum is an arena in which faculty and graduate students from the New York metropolitan area can engage in the lively exchange of a thriving center of medieval scholarship. We intend to host one public event each semester, likely in conjunction with the Medieval and Renaissance Center, and meet once or twice a semester for an informal reading group to practice reading aloud (specifically not translating) medieval languages, especially Old, Early Middle, and Late Middle English. We anticipate inviting a medieval professor from NYU and/or from the New York metropolitan area to participate in the reading group and then ending with a dinner, to which all attendees would be invited. We have already begun planning the 3rd Annual Medieval Manuscripts Workshop with Martha Rust for the Fall (late September and early October).      Faculty advisors: Hal Momma , Martha Rust    Contact information: Angie Bennett Segler , Carla Mar\u00eda Thomas           12. Organism for Poetic Research (OCR)     The Organism for Poetic Research (OPR) organizes and initiates events that open a collaborative field for experimentation and research performed in the humanities, the natural sciences, the visual arts and poetry. The OPR produces the annual magazine PELT (available in distinct manifestations in print and on the web) which features work by artists and academics connected with OPR activities and events. The OPR website advertises calls for work and OPR events, publishes proceedings from events (in the form of text, image, audio, and video files), hosts web residencies held by artists and academics, and publishes webPELT, an online magazine that reproduces materials from the printed PELT (thereby allowing it a wider circulation) and contributes materials better suited to a digital medium.      Faculty advisors for 2013\u201314: Lytle Shaw , Una Chaudhuri    Contact information: Rachael Wilson , Ada Smailbegovic           13. Politics of the Contemporary Novel Reading Group     This group focuses on the politics of the contemporary novel, particularly in relation to \"global\" paradigms of literary and critical practice. We ask what the novel does to organize narrative worlds, as well as how it might be said to critique or re-imagine existing frameworks for understanding the political realities of the contemporary moment. In doing so, we also address the dynamics by which novels circulate throughout the globe, and seek to interrogate and expand current critical methods for reading this complex set of literary phenomena.     Our group, then, also seeks to ask questions of the discipline itself - to dig deeper into some of the commonplaces of our practice and to refine our understanding of the political potentialities of both literature and literary criticism. We ask, for instance, what might it really mean for a novel to act politically? In what ways can it be said that the novel intervenes in politics? And how can critique itself function best as a political practice in the contemporary moment? We will select readings according to group interest, but in general each meeting will pair a work of contemporary fiction with relevant selections from recent scholarly work.      Contact information: Pat Abatiell           14. The Victorian Reading Group     We will ruminate over primary texts (both fictional and non-fictional) written in the post-Romantic 19th century. We will concern ourselves with readings that deal with the prominent social issues of the Victorian era: the \u2018woman question\u2019 (marriage, suffrage, bodily autonomy, etc.), industrialization and its effects (slums, the urban poor, changed conditions of labour, etc.), colony and Empire. As opposed to focusing solely on long novels and poetry\u2014as is often the temptation with Victorian literature\u2014the group will read shorter texts that were widely distributed and widely read at the time of publication, with a particular focus on the short story as an emergent literary genre. We will read works that appeared in publications such as Household Words, Blackwoods, The Morning Chronicle, and Graham\u2019s Magazine , among others. We will, in other words, look to the popular instead of exclusively the canonical and examine how contemporary texts reflected and shaped the dialogue around the issues of the day.

With the zoning envelope now defined, the Working Group will take up the task of giving definitive guidance to the University Administration on implementation; of taking account of the existing, pressing space needs of academic units and programs; and of listening to the implications of the NYU Core Project for members of the University community.
