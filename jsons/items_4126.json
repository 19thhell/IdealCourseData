Often the idea for an independent study arises in a course; for example, in a seminar on early 20th-century American history, a student may develop an interest in the Harlem Renaissance and ask the instructor to supervise an independent study focused exclusively on this topic during the next semester. Students may also develop creative projects in areas such as, but not limited to, music composition, filmmaking, or fiction writing.     Below is an outline of the process that students follow to set up an independent study. Because the student and the instructor are designing a course, students must begin this process a full semester in advance. Students can refer to the Student Checklist to investigate the planning timeline for these steps:       Students should discuss with their faculty adviser the possibility of conducting an independent study.   Generate a basic idea: a problem or a question, a time period, a literary genre, a natural phenomenon, a philosophical theme, or a creative skill.   Identify an appropriate instructor: the student's faculty adviser or Gallatin class adviser; a member of the Gallatin faculty or other NYU faculty; and with special approval, a professor from another university or college. Contact the prospective instructor to propose the study and to discuss the plans for the work.   Complete and submit the Independent Study Proposal form for review and approval by Gallatin's Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies. Please note that submitting a proposal does not guarantee approval.   Identify an alternate course to take in case the proposal is not approved.         Policy for Undergraduate Students     Generally, the work for an independent study should be comparable to a Gallatin classroom course. The specific format of the work will be determined by the student and the instructor who will evaluate it. They may choose several short papers, or a longer paper written in sections as the work progresses and depending on the nature of the study, video productions, paintings or music productions may be appropriate. The work for the study should be submitted according to the schedule of due dates agreed upon at the outset, and as with a classroom course, late work may be penalized.   Independent studies may be taken for two, three or four credits. The number of credits is determined by the amount of work to be completed.     Instructors and students meet for a minimum number of hours per semester: for a 4-credit Independent Study, the minimum number of contact hours is seven (7). Contact hours for an Independent Study which is less than 4 credits should be prorated accordingly (e.g., a 2-credit independent study should meet for a minimum of 3.5 hours).   An instructor for a Gallatin Independent Study should be an NYU faculty member. In rare cases a professor from another university or college might be approved to instruct an Independent Study.     While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Undergraduate students therefore may register for no more than 8 credits per semester in any combination of independent study and/or tutorial.   While independent study provides students with the opportunity to work one-on-one with an instructor, in general, long distance independent studies are not permitted.   Students enrolled in another NYU school are generally not permitted to apply for a Gallatin Independent Study. In rare instances a student from another NYU school might be able to take a Gallatin Independent Study with a Gallatin professor. In all cases, students should contact KatheAnn Joseph for more information.   Students are expected to adhere to the proposal submission deadline . The completed independent study proposal consists of:     adviser\u2019s approval   instructor\u2019s approval   completed proposal form   description of the study   syllabus   booklist     Please note that independent studies do not fulfill any area of the Gallatin foundation requirement (liberal arts requirement or historical and cultural requirement).

While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Graduate students may therefore take a maximum of 12 credits of Individualized Projects. This includes any combination of Independent Study, Tutorial, Internship and Private Lesson credit. If a student receives credit for Course Equivalency, this will decrease his or her allowance of Individualized Project credit and that student should check with the Office of Advising to confirm the number of Individualized Project credits remaining.

Do you want the title to be included on your transcript?             Yes              No                       Questions          Questions      According to policy, answers to these questions should be NO. If you answer YES to any of these questions, please submit a supplemental written explanation with the description of the study.                       Are you planning to attend a course, class, workshop, etc., to supplement this study?             Yes              No                    Are you planning to make any type of payment to an instructor or separate institution for this study?             Yes              No                    Are you planning to be outside of the United States for any part of this study?             Yes              No                    Are you planning to not meet in person with your Independent Study Instructor?             Yes              No                    Are you planning to register for any other individualized projects this semester?             Yes              No               Description of the Study    Like the course description in a college catalog, this part of the proposal essay should describe the general theme and scope of the independent study. The theme may be stated as a problem to be investigated, an issue to be explored, or an argument to be defended. The essay might indicate where the student is starting out and where she would like to get in terms of answering a question, exploring a phenomenon, understanding a theory, building a skill or other goal. It should articulate the theme and strategy of the study as clearly as possible within about 250 words.                      Readings    The student must provide a reading list with authors and titles, even if tentative, along with the proposal. The list should be comparable to a similar classroom course (e.g., interdisciplinary seminars often assign 6-10 books, depending on length and complexity). Readings may change during the semester as the study evolves, but the preliminary list should be appropriate for the number of units, and should indicate the kind of works to be read. Proposals for creative projects should include readings, as well.                      Work to be Evaluated by the Instructor    The proposal should indicate the kinds of work (response papers, research essays, creative works, etc.) which will be evaluated by the instructor. Assignments should be comparable in extent to a similar classroom course (e.g., interdisciplinary seminars typically    assign about 25 pages of writing over the course of the semester). Provide details about this work, including the number, length and type of work to be submitted (e.g., two research papers, one 10 pages and the other 15; a portfolio of 20 exhibition-quality photographs plus four reading-response papers of 2 pages each).                      Syllabus    A schedule of meetings should be produced to specify the topics and readings to be covered at each session, as well the expected deadlines for assignments. Students can revise and adopt their syllabus with their instructor once the semester begins.                                     I have read and accept the terms of the Independent Study Proposal Guidelines and the Student Checklist.

Often the idea for an independent study arises in a course; for example, in a seminar on early 20th-century American history, a student may develop an interest in the Harlem Renaissance and ask the instructor to supervise an independent study focused exclusively on this topic during the next semester. Students may also develop creative projects in areas such as, but not limited to, music composition, filmmaking, or fiction writing.     Below is an outline of the process that students follow to set up an independent study. Because the student and the instructor are designing a course, students must begin this process a full semester in advance. Students can refer to the Student Checklist to investigate the planning timeline for these steps:       Students should discuss with their faculty adviser the possibility of conducting an independent study.   Generate a basic idea: a problem or a question, a time period, a literary genre, a natural phenomenon, a philosophical theme, or a creative skill.   Identify an appropriate instructor: the student's faculty adviser or Gallatin class adviser; a member of the Gallatin faculty or other NYU faculty; and with special approval, a professor from another university or college. Contact the prospective instructor to propose the study and to discuss the plans for the work.   Complete and submit the Independent Study Proposal form for review and approval by Gallatin's Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies. Please note that submitting a proposal does not guarantee approval.   Identify an alternate course to take in case the proposal is not approved.         Policy for Undergraduate Students     Generally, the work for an independent study should be comparable to a Gallatin classroom course. The specific format of the work will be determined by the student and the instructor who will evaluate it. They may choose several short papers, or a longer paper written in sections as the work progresses and depending on the nature of the study, video productions, paintings or music productions may be appropriate. The work for the study should be submitted according to the schedule of due dates agreed upon at the outset, and as with a classroom course, late work may be penalized.   Independent studies may be taken for two, three or four credits. The number of credits is determined by the amount of work to be completed.     Instructors and students meet for a minimum number of hours per semester: for a 4-credit Independent Study, the minimum number of contact hours is seven (7). Contact hours for an Independent Study which is less than 4 credits should be prorated accordingly (e.g., a 2-credit independent study should meet for a minimum of 3.5 hours).   An instructor for a Gallatin Independent Study should be an NYU faculty member. In rare cases a professor from another university or college might be approved to instruct an Independent Study.     While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Undergraduate students therefore may register for no more than 8 credits per semester in any combination of independent study and/or tutorial.   While independent study provides students with the opportunity to work one-on-one with an instructor, in general, long distance independent studies are not permitted.   Students enrolled in another NYU school are generally not permitted to apply for a Gallatin Independent Study. In rare instances a student from another NYU school might be able to take a Gallatin Independent Study with a Gallatin professor. In all cases, students should contact KatheAnn Joseph for more information.   Students are expected to adhere to the proposal submission deadline .

While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Graduate students may therefore take a maximum of 12 credits of Individualized Projects. This includes any combination of Independent Study, Tutorial, Internship and Private Lesson credit. If a student receives credit for Course Equivalency, this will decrease his or her allowance of Individualized Project credit and that student should check with the Office of Advising to confirm the number of Individualized Project credits remaining.

If you answer YES to any of these questions, please submit a supplemental written explanation with the description of the study.                       Are you planning to attend a course, class, workshop, etc., to supplement this study?             Yes              No                    Are you planning to make any type of payment to an instructor or separate institution for this study?

Yes              No                    Are you planning to register for any other individualized projects this semester?             Yes              No               Description of the Study    Like the course description in a college catalog, this part of the proposal essay should describe the general theme and scope of the independent study. The theme may be stated as a problem to be investigated, an issue to be explored, or an argument to be defended. The essay might indicate where the student is starting out and where she would like to get in terms of answering a question, exploring a phenomenon, understanding a theory, building a skill or other goal. It should articulate the theme and strategy of the study as clearly as possible within about 250 words.                      Readings    The student must provide a reading list with authors and titles, even if tentative, along with the proposal. The list should be comparable to a similar classroom course (e.g., interdisciplinary seminars often assign 6-10 books, depending on length and complexity). Readings may change during the semester as the study evolves, but the preliminary list should be appropriate for the number of units, and should indicate the kind of works to be read. Proposals for creative projects should include readings, as well.                      Work to be Evaluated by the Instructor    The proposal should indicate the kinds of work (response papers, research essays, creative works, etc.) which will be evaluated by the instructor. Assignments should be comparable in extent to a similar classroom course (e.g., interdisciplinary seminars typically    assign about 25 pages of writing over the course of the semester). Provide details about this work, including the number, length and type of work to be submitted (e.g., two research papers, one 10 pages and the other 15; a portfolio of 20 exhibition-quality photographs plus four reading-response papers of 2 pages each).                      Syllabus    A schedule of meetings should be produced to specify the topics and readings to be covered at each session, as well the expected deadlines for assignments. Students can revise and adopt their syllabus with their instructor once the semester begins.                                     I have read and accept the terms of the Independent Study Proposal Guidelines and the Student Checklist.
