The Center\u2019s goal is to develop and broaden interdisciplinary and cross-cultural scholarship, pedagogy, and public knowledge of religion and media at New York University. While this project was conceived before September 11, that event and its aftermath have dramatized the need for understanding the spread of religious ideas and practices through a variety of media. The Center is a joint project of the Religious Studies Program (Angela Zito, Director) and the Center for Media, Culture, and History , (Faye Ginsburg, Director, Pegi Vail, Director of Public Programing).

Each year the center focuses on a specific theme, hosting several Working Groups and planning public events that will illuminate its issues: In 2003/2004 the annual theme was Confession, Testimony, Witnessing . In May 2004 they hosted a three-day interdisciplinary conference: Religious Witness: the Intimate, the Everyday, and the World . For 2004\u20132005, the annual theme was Religious Experience: Memory, Media, Marketing . In May 2005, they presented, along with the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Indian, The Museum of Modern Art First Nations/First Features: A Showcase of World Indigenous Film and Media . For 2005\u20132006, as they started the year themed Religion, Media, and Body Politics , they were faced with the disastrous human response to the disaster of Hurricane Katrina. They immediately began planning a May 2006 conference called Body Counts/Bodies Count . The theme for 2006-2007 was Secularization, Media and the Globalization of Religion. A range of challenges to \"secularism\" emerging in contemporary forms of religious community and identity position themselves within and against secular regimes associated with modernity. We explored various media through which these challenges are mounted, pursued, and performed, and through which they acquire social weight.

My main areas of academic interest involve the place of religion in the American political system and religious conflict in the modern world. This relates to my overarching fascination with the factors involved in the construction of personal identity whether it be culture, religion or something far more personal; issues that were key to the construction of my bachelor's thesis. I am pursuing the joint religion/ journalism program at NYU.                William Puleo ; First Year Major Interests: I'm a native Staten Islander, born and raised. I followed in my mother's and grandfather's footsteps and graduated from NYU undergrad. I majored in Italian Culture and Society and minored in History. My interests were largely focused on Augustinian theology, crusader narratives and Sicilian Greek Orthodoxy. Via crusader and travel literature, I became interested in eastward moving Christianities. Nestorianism in China led me to the missionary ventures of Catholic priests during the Ming Dynasty. I am very interested in the interaction between Catholic and Confucian intellectualism especially with regards to the transmission of Western scientific texts amongst the Chinese literati.              Eden Consenstein ; Second Year Major Interests: I am a born and raised New Yorker, currently living in Brooklyn. I completed my undergrad at the University of Toronto in 2011, where I majored in Religious Studies. I spent the past year working at the Interfaith Center of New York, a non-profit that seeks to build bridges between New York\u2019s religious communities and civic institutions. My interests are in the role of religion in the public sphere, religion and cultural diversity and secularism in America.              Kathryn Newman ; Second Year  Journalism Concentration Major Interests: I graduated with a B.A. in Anthropology from Bard College in 2007 and an M.A. in International Affairs from Australian National University in 2011. As a freelance writer and editor, I have written a long form feature about the growth of the LDS Church in Mexico City and co-edited an anthology of Spanish-language fiction on messianic narratives. I am pursuing the joint Religion/Journalism concentration at NYU.              Ethan Poe ; Second Year Major Interests: I was born in St. Louis, Missouri. I graduated from the University of Kansas with a BA in Philosophy and Religious studies in 2013. At NYU, I hope to further my interest areas in North American religion, Mormonism, and religion and legal systems in preparation for a PhD. From a theoretical perspective I am extremely interested in the works of Leonard Primiano and Greg Mogenson.    .              Chris Bowman ; Second Year Major Interests: I received a BA in Religious Studies and Politics, with a focus on Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies, from New York University in 2011. In the graduate program, I look forward to engaging with conversations on secularism, religion and capitalism, and the relationship of religion and political radicalism.              Don Jolly ; Class of 2014 Major Interests: I was born in San Antonio, Texas. In the Spring of 2012, I graduated magna cum laude from St. Edward's University, with a bachelor of arts degree in religion and literature. My most successful work to date has been in the study of religion and popular culture: specifically exegetical treatments of Genesis in comic books. By \"most succesful,\" I mean that I gave a paper on it at regional conference. My passion is for esoteric study, and my senior thesis at St. Edward's explored the nature of the patriarch Enoch as depicted in the spirit communications of the Elizabethan magus John Dee. At NYU, I hope to expand my knowledge of Renaissance Christianity, Christian Hebraism and many, many other topics of which I am conscious but lack deep understanding. I'm also eager to sharpen my skills in writing and research, in preparation for a PhD. In addition to all that high-minded stuff, I'm excited about living somewhere far enough from Texas that people will notice my accent.              Andrew Walker-Cornetta ; Class of 2014 Major Interests: I completed my BA in Religious Studies at Indiana University in 2007. After graduating I worked with individuals labeled with disabilities at a non-profit organization in Indianapolis before moving to Cairo, Egypt to teach English and to learn some Arabic. Since then, I\u2019ve been living in New Jersey and working in a restaurant. At NYU I hope to situate myself in the midst of emerging conversations between disability studies, queer theory, and religious studies in order to investigate how religion in the US participates in the construction, reification, and complication of disability and its invisible opposite, normativity.              Janaki Challa ; Class of 2014 Major Interests: Ethics, Aesthetics, Phenomenology, Philosophical Theology, the Anthropology of Knowledge              Beiyin Deng ; Class of 2013 Major Interests: I got my BA degree in philosophy in Fudan University, China. After my graduation in 2011, I was admitted by the Religious Studies Program in NYU and now I am a second-year MA student. One of my focuses now is Buddhism in modern society in China, especially the role of Buddhism in social movements at present. Another one is Chinese death rituals in cities during modern times and I am particularly interested in investigating the changes of these rituals before and after the establishment of the nation.              Jenna Johnson ; Class of 2013 Major Interests: I am a full-time book editor and part-time graduate student whose lifelong interest in religion brought her to the NYU program in Religious Studies. My academic work focuses primarily on American Christianity and country music, which I love not just for it excellent demonstration of the ways in which religion works its way into our art and commerce, but also for its comfort with absurdity, its reflection on class and work, its sly lamentations, and its willingness to mix the silly with the sublime. I earned my BA in History from Columbia, another wonderful New York institution.              Jacob Rosen ; Class of 2013 Major Interests: Born and raised in the Philly suburbs, I graduated magna cum laude from Boston University in 2007 with a BS in Social Studies Education. After graduating, I traveled the world and taught English as a foreign language before moving to New York in 2008 to begin work as a high school History teacher in the NYC Department of Education. I am now a second year graduate student in the Religious Studies program at NYU, working in my \"free time\" to complete a thesis later this year on the subject of the New Christian Right in contemporary American political history.                    Nathan Schradle ; Class of 2013 Major Interests: I received my BA in Religious Studies from Occidental College in 2008, then spent three years working in special education in California. I originally became interested in Religious Studies through a more general interest in Critical Theory, an interest which I have continued to pursue here at NYU. I am broadly interested in the definition of the category of \u201creligion,\u201d especially the way in which public (i.e. politicized) definitions with particular histories come to be manifested in personal ones. Currently, I am focused on contemporary debates and instantiations within the frame of modern capitalism. My thesis focuses on the new affective and intellectual spaces for identity formation and world-building opened up by internet-based mediative technologies.

I am particularly interested in the development of evangelical, liberal Protestant, and secular \"therapeutic culture\" in the United States, and in how Protestantism has shaped\u2014and been shaped by\u2014spatial life.
