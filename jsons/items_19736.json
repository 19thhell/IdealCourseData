Research Interests Wave propagation, guiding and diffraction in electromagnetics, optics and acoustics; theory and application to devices using multilayered and/or periodic structures.   Research studies have addressed leaky waves for antennas and optical beam couplers; surface waves in dielectric films, in plasma layers and along the terrestrial ground; the scattering of optic and acoustic beams by layered media; the design of periodic structures for planar optical devices, and other applications.   General / Collaborative Research Research studies were funded by government agencies, which include NSF, ONR, AFCRL and AROD, as well as by RCA, Bell Laboratories, Schlumberger and other industrial laboratories. Most recent work has addressed the modeling of quantum-well infrared photodetectors, in collaboration with Dr. K. K. Choi, at the Electro-Optics and Photonics Division of the U.S. Army Research Laboratories, Adelphi, MD.

Research Interests Wave propagation, guiding and diffraction in electromagnetics, optics and acoustics; theory and application to devices using multilayered and/or periodic structures.   Research studies have addressed leaky waves for antennas and optical beam couplers; surface waves in dielectric films, in plasma layers and along the terrestrial ground; the scattering of optic and acoustic beams by layered media; the design of periodic structures for planar optical devices, and other applications.   General / Collaborative Research Research studies were funded by government agencies, which include NSF, ONR, AFCRL and AROD, as well as by RCA, Bell Laboratories, Schlumberger and other industrial laboratories. Most recent work has addressed the modeling of quantum-well infrared photodetectors, in collaboration with Dr. K. K. Choi, at the Electro-Optics and Photonics Division of the U.S. Army Research Laboratories, Adelphi, MD.
