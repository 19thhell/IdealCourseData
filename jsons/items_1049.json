Lecture. Given every fall. Moloney. 4 points.   Provides a  comprehensive introduction to the traditional and contemporary music  of the Celtic areas of Western Europe: Ireland, Scotland, Wales,  Brittany, and Galicia. Recordings and live performances present the  extraordinary range of singing styles and the musical instruments  employed in each culture, including harps, bagpipes, and a variety of  other wind, free reed, keyboard, and stringed instruments. Forms and  musical styles are explored in depth, along with a study of their  origin, evolution, and cultural links. Global Diaspora: The Irish Case IRISH-UA 170 Lecture. Given annually. 4 points. The Irish have exemplified global patterns of migration over centuries. This course aims at a systematic exploration of the dispersal of Irish people around the world, focusing on their interaction with the various host cultures they have encountered both as settlers and in other roles. Particular attention will be given to the movements of Irish on the European continent and in Britain; the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean; Australia and New Zealand; and South America. We will study the consequences of emigration for Ireland and for the receiving nations, as well as Ireland\u2019s transformation in the late twentieth century from emigrant nursery to an emigrant destination. Starting with a chronological focus, the class then moves to a more geographic concentration on some of the most prominent Irish diasporic communities.      The Irish and New York   IRISH-UA 180 Identical  to SCA-UA 758, HIST-UA 180. Lecture. Given annually. Casey. 4 points.   Explores the symbiotic  relationship between New York City and the Irish from the 18th  through the 20th centuries, as well as the impact of political,  social, and cultural changes in Ireland and America on a  transnational population. Factors beyond race and language, which  help define and preserve ethnic group identity, as well as the city\u2019s  role in the creation of a pseudo-Irish identity that is disseminated  on both sides of the Atlantic, are also explored. Readings are  broadly drawn from immigration, urban, and social history. Primary  documents, literature, and film are also used as texts.      Topics in Irish History   IRISH-UA 181 Identical  to HIST-UA 181. Lecture. Given annually. Casey, Lee, Truxes. 4  points.   Emphasis varies by  semester; designed to allow flexibility in course offerings from  visiting scholars and specialists in particular fields. Past  examinations have included imagery and ideology of Irish nationalism,  Irish American popular folk culture, and the Irish in America.  Recently, focus has concentrated on comparative study of famine and  emigration in Irish and world history, and on the distinctive  contributions of Irish migrants to the development of European and  Atlantic cultures in the early modern world.      History of Modern  Ireland I, 1580\u20131800   IRISH-UA 182 Identical  to HIST-UA 182. Lecture. Given every fall. Truxes. 4 points.   Examines the English  conquest of Ireland from the reign of Elizabeth I to the last meeting  of the Irish Parliament. Key themes include the plantation of Ireland  with settlers from England, Scotland, and Wales; the decline of the  Gaelic political order and culture; the religious reformation and  Counter-Reformation; Ireland as a site of English and European wars;  the imposition of a penal code; and the vain attempt to rebel against  British rule in the late 18th century, resulting in the Act of Union,  which disestablished the Irish Parliament in Dublin.      History of Modern  Ireland II, 1800 to the Present   IRISH-UA 183 Identical  to HIST-UA 183. Lecture. Given every spring. 4 points.   Introduces the general  themes that have shaped Irish history from 1800 to the present.  Particular attention is paid to the complex geopolitical relationship  that has existed between Ireland and Britain. Examines the place of  the historical memory in fashioning inherited identities shaped most  explicitly by nationalism and unionism. In the aftermath of  revolution, a bitter civil war and partition, the island saw two  state-building projects emerge catering to the needs of two  jurisdictions. Using the lens of Ireland, this class seeks to locate  the Irish experience in the context of world history as a nation  massively influenced by Britain and the United States.        Seminar in Irish  History   IRISH-UA 185 Identical  to HIST-UA 185. Casey, Lee, Truxes. 4 points.   Intensive examination  of specific areas of Irish history, with an emphasis on critical  reading and individual research projects. Past themes include the  development and modernization of the Republic of Ireland with  particular consideration of the economy; the Great Famine of 1845\u201351,  which was an immediate and long-term catastrophe for the Irish people  but also the catalyst for substantial changes\u2014positive and  negative\u2014in Irish society and culture; and the cinematic  representations of Irish Americans.      The Irish in America   IRISH-UA 187 Identical  to HIST-UA 187. Lecture. Given annually. Almeida, Casey. 4 points.   From the seventeenth century to the present, Irish people have been crossing the Atlantic to North America. They are one of the most significant ethnic groups to ever migrate from Europe to the United States. Their impact has been disproportional to their numbers but this only partially explains our contemporary understanding of \u201cIrish America.\u201d Ethnicity is an imprint and defining feature of American life yet the Irish experience with it over the past four centuries is a story complicated by multiple generations, diversity of class, continuing immigration, and rapid changes in both the homeland and the receiving country. This course will consider the factors affecting emigration from Ireland; examine the impact of the Irish on the development of the United States since the colonial period, particularly on its cities; study the changing Irish image in American popular culture; and consider what the Irish can teach us about the evolution of ethnic identity. The ultimate goal of this course is to learn to think historically.      Oral History of Irish  America   IRISH-UA 203 Seminar.  Given every fall. Almeida. 4 points.
