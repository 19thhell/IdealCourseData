The Handbook - as well as this supporting website - will evolve with changes in Federal law, sponsor requirements and NYU's needs. As a result, both the Handbook and website will be reviewed and updated each year by Sponsored Programs Administration (SPA).     Please take time to visit our Comments and Suggestions form, available in the right-hand column of this page. SPA wants feedback from Principal Investigators and their staff to ensure that the Handbook is responsive to its users. The Handbook and website will be reviewed and updated four times in its first year and annually thereafter.       The Handbook:   Focuses on Federal grants and other sponsor agreements. It also provides background and tools useful in managing Federal contracts and establishes policies and procedures governing sponsored programs post-award financial administration throughout NYU\u2019s global network.   Please note that exceptions associated with the requirements of local law and custom or operational needs must be submitted to and approved by Sponsored Programs Administration.   Full versions of these policies can be found in the NYU Policy &amp; Compliance website .     Grants and Contracts Management   Public and private grants and contracts management requires consideration of financial and administrative requirements and compliance considerations that must be taken into account with every new award.     This Handbook attempts to capture, simplify and organize critical information in an easy to use format that NYU faculty and staff can reference while managing federal grants and contracts.     Areas Covered   The SPA Handbook provides an overview of post-award sponsored program management, including:     Opening and Closing Sponsored Accounts   Re-budgeting     Managing Sponsored Program Expenditures, including Personnel Expenses, Travel, Membership Dues, Equipment, Computers, etc.     Dealing with Cost Share     The NIH Salary Cap     Processing Cost Transfers   Program Income   Working with Recharge Centers   Managing Equipment Purchased with Federal Funding     Managing Subawards     Closing Out Awards &amp; Financial Reporting     Handling Audits     Comprehensive Glossary of Terms and Acronyms                                      Handbook Table of Contents                      Select an Option...
