We find ourselves stretched between the past and the future, flung into a world we did not create and yearning for something better. We have expectations of the world and even fantasies of other ones. Our thought often transcends this world, leaving reality behind. The stories we tell of other, better worlds can often be critiques of our own, whereas sometimes we develop and implement projects for the transformation of this world and even of ourselves. Our goal is to demonstrate the ongoing conversation and practice of utopia in Western (i.e, ancient Greek and Roman, Western Mediterranean Christian, European, and Euro-American) cultural history. In examining some parts of this complex and at times contradictory tradition we will develop a set of questions which can be asked of utopian literature. We also examine our own relationship to this literary, ethical, and political tradition.  FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Political Economy Prof. Gross (History)  syllabus  What   is the \u201cmarket\u201d, the \u201ceconomy\u201d, or \u201ccapitalism\u201d? How do individuals   interact with each other in the marketplace? What is the morality of   commerce? And how does, or should, the state govern the economy? These   are all questions that have no simple answers and as a consequence they   stimulate controversy today, in America and throughout the world. Yet   these questions have a long pedigree. Since antiquity intellectuals have   grappled with the fundamental issues of what in the past they called   moral philosophy, what today we call political economy: how the   individual, the market, and the state should interact with each other.   Readings: Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Smith, Ricardo, Rousseau, Zola,   Marx, Mill, Bagehot, Weber, Orwell, Keynes, Polanyi, Friedman, Hayek,   Galbraith, Kindleberger, Harvey, Sachs. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Medieval Political Thought Prof. Stoller (NYU Libraries)  syllabus Medieval   political thought spanned three great religious traditions:   Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Across all three traditions it was   grounded in a deeply religious perspective on the human condition, one   originating in a set of sacred texts that shared a common monotheism and   a similar moral ethic. The political thought of all three groups was   equally grounded in a set of ancient, pagan texts, drawing on the   perspective of the Greeks and Romans, on whose shoulders the medievals   believed they stood. Political theorists across all three traditions   drew heavily from one another, but each spoke to the unique concerns of   its own community. We explore the commonalities and the contrasts among   the three political systems and the extraordinary minds that shaped   them. Readings will include Hebrew and Christian scriptures, the Qur'an,   Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Alfarabi, Alghazali, Aquinas, Avicenna,   Bacon, Giles of Rome, Maimonides, Marsilius of Padua, and Polgar.  FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Action Prof. Halpern (English)  syllabus  What   does it mean to perform an act? What are we doing when we do something?   The term \u201caction\u201d covers everything from picking up a pencil to leading   a political revolution. Action is a way of intervening in the world and   changing it, in minor or major ways. Both ethics and politics involve   acting in relation to others. Philosophers have found action interesting   because it bridges the mental and physical worlds, beginning as   intention and ending with some sort of embodied execution. The English   word \u201cact\u201d complicates things still further, since it can mean not only   \u201cto do something\u201d but also \u201cto pretend to do something; to play a part.\u201d   Acting in the \u201cserious\u201d sense is always haunted by dramatic or   play-acting. And because drama is the art form that relies on people   actually doing things onstage\u2014or rather, pretending to actually do   things onstage\u2014it is also an art form that has thought through questions   of action in sophisticated ways. We read a variety of works by   philosophers, playwrights, theologians, filmmakers, and economists in   order to get a sense of how action has been understood from the   classical era to the present day, including Aeschylus, Aristotle,   Augustine, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Smith, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Beckett.  FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Value Prof. Poovey (English) &amp; Prof. Zaloom (Social and Cultural Analysis)  syllabus Can   you put a price on sex? art? love? life? Is time money, or is   daydreaming time well-spent? Would you accept a pound of flesh as   payment of a debt? Is there such a thing as a free lunch, and what would   it taste like? We explore different\u2014and often conflicting\u2014conceptions   of value spanning literature, philosophy, ethnography, and social   theory, seeking to convey three fundamental principles: Value is not   inherent in things but the result of a social process, value is often   determined at the intersection of different conceptions of productive   potential, and value is conceptualized or measured in different, and   often conflicting, ways. Readings include selections from Aristotle,   Christian Scripture, Shakespeare, Smith, Bentham, Wordsworth, Austen,   Weber, Keynes, Milton Friedman, Kazuo Ishiguro, and Pierre Bourdieu. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014This World and the Next Prof. Connolly (Classics)  syllabus  Explores different ways of thinking about the world or worlds beyond (and better than) the one in which we live, concentrating on the afterlife, political utopias, and the worlds created by artistic imagination. Readings include Homer, Vergil, Dante, the Bible, Plato's Republic, Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto, selection of Romantic poetry, and Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, and its film adaptation, Blade Runner. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Arts and Publics Prof. Blake (English)  syllabus Civic values and public purpose are intricately bound up with the arts. Whenever a case needs to be made that the arts matter, we tend to speak (usually, in very general terms) about how the arts contribute to education, or self-expression, or community life, or public deliberation, or the moral and social reform of individuals and institutions. On the other side, those who question the public value of the arts might complain that the arts are elitist, or overweening, or out of touch, or too political, or not political enough. How did we come to think about the arts in these terms? What are some of our assumptions about public life, such that it makes sense for us to promote the arts as having an important public cultural role, or alternatively distrust or dismiss them for not properly or effectively living up to that role? And, ultimately, what is at stake: Why does it matter if the arts matter? Readings from the Classical period through the present day, with a specific focus on drama and theatre. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Visible and Invisible Cities Prof. Cox (Italian Studies)  syllabus The   experience of living in a city is one vital thread that connects us   with our ancient, medieval, and early modern ancestors, and that   continues to provide a unifying element in millions of our   contemporaries\u2019 disparate lives across the globe. Urban life is a   constant environment and stimulus, whether you find yourself in New   York, Florence, Accra, or Shanghai. Our aim is to supply conceptual   frameworks and historical contexts for this experience by exploring the   ways human communities have been theorized and imagined within the   Western tradition from classical antiquity through to the Renaissance,   particularly the city, conceived since Aristotle as the proper habitat   of humankind, and the relationship between the family or household and   the state. The primary texts encompass utopian writings and works of   political theory, but also texts describing and analyzing real-world   communities and visual and cartographic representations of cities and   urban space. Readings include the canonical\u2014from Plato, Aristotle,   Vergil, Dante, Boccaccio, More, Shakespeare\u2014to texts from Christine de   Pizan and Moderata Fontelong, marginalized from the canon and only now   becoming visible. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 403, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Rubenstein (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Beginning with the collision of the \"Judeo-Christian\" and Hellenistic traditions and their encounter in the Christian Scriptures and Augustine, we see Enlightenment thinkers grapple with the fusion of these traditions they had inherited, subjecting both to serious criticism and revising them as a new tradition\u2014science and technology\u2014rises to prominence. Reading from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Sophocles, Plato, Augustine, Montesquieu, Pope, Voltaire, and Rousseau. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology)  syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (College Core Curriculum)  syllabus Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology, Gorgias, Symposium; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German)  syllabus A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice. Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics - Materialism Prof. Shaw (English)  syllabus Why is materialism a dirty word? Through what logic has it come to be associated with crass monetary gain and excessive bodily pleasure? When did these associations begin, and why? What other senses of materialism (as a philosophy of the everyday, and as a critical corrective to idealism) lurk underneath these pejorative, immediate associations? How might they be activated? We examine conflicts between Christian idealism and a range of materialist philosophies, including Epicureanism, experimentalism and Marxism. Materialists became infamous for directing their attention at bodies rather than souls, at terrestrial matter rather than divine will, and at the letter rather than the spirit of scripture. We follow their lead and pay close attention to a range of texts and objects, but in doing so we also consider just how various materialisms could be, how their realist correctives operated at different scales and in different contexts: from the atomic to the economic, from the corporeal to the textual. Readings: Lucretius, Vergil\u2019s Georgics, 1 Corinthians, Machiavelli\u2019s Prince, More\u2019s Utopia, selections from Montaigne, Shakespeare, Bacon, Diderot, Wordsworth, Poe, Balzac, Marx, Nietzsche and Whitman.  SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Objectivity Prof. Gitelman (English)  syllabus Bias. Spin. Propaganda. Hype. These are familiar pejoratives for citizens of the twenty-first century, and by implication they privilege the same alternative: objectivity. Objectivity is a concept\u2014or an ideal\u2014that frames our understanding of pursuits as diverse as politics, journalism, and science, realms in which we hope to be able to discern the right, the true, and the real. But what is objectivity? Whose discernment counts as objective? How can we tell? Questions like these ask us to consider not only what we know but also how, while the conditions of evolving, possessing, and assessing knowledge turn out to be remarkably available to cultural and historical change. We consider the origins and character of objectivity within and against the Western intellectual tradition by considering selected episodes in its emergence, both ancient and modern, asking how thinkers have thought about knowing. What are or have been the available routes to certainty? What standards exist or have existed for knowledge about the past, about the self or about others, and about the world around us? Is it possible that the twenty-first century will involve new forms of objectivity? Readings: Matthew, Thucydides, Plato\u2019s Protagoras and Meno, Descartes\u2019 Discourse on Method, selections from Montaigne, Bird\u2019s Sheppard Lee, Agee and Evan\u2019s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Action Prof. Halpern (English)  syllabus  What   does it mean to perform an act? What are we doing when we do something?   The term \u201caction\u201d covers everything from picking up a pencil to leading   a political revolution. Action is a way of intervening in the world and   changing it, in minor or major ways. Both ethics and politics involve   acting in relation to others. Philosophers have found action interesting   because it bridges the mental and physical worlds, beginning as   intention and ending with some sort of embodied execution. The English   word \u201cact\u201d complicates things still further, since it can mean not only   \u201cto do something\u201d but also \u201cto pretend to do something; to play a part.\u201d   Acting in the \u201cserious\u201d sense is always haunted by dramatic or   play-acting.

SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Life and Death Prof. Velleman (Philosophy)  syllabus  Every   person has a life to live, but what is this thing, \u201ca life\u201d, that every   person has? To begin with, it\u2019s just the temporally extended existence   of the person, the proverbial three score and ten. But a person\u2019s life   is more than that, because it follows a natural progression of   life-stages, from childhood to adolescence to middle age to senescence.   And it\u2019s even more still, since it is partly the creation of the person   living it, who can plan it, evaluate it, anticipate its future, and   remember its past. We explore these and other aspects of a person\u2019s life   through works of literature and philosophy. What makes you the same   person throughout the different stages of your life? How does the   passage of time color your perception of life? What makes for a good   life? A meaningful life? Should you be grateful for having been born, or   dismayed at having to die? Readings: Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics,   Epicurus\u2019 \u201cLetter to Menoeceus,\u201d Cicero\u2019s De Finibus, Lucretius De Rerum   Natura, Dickens\u2019 Great Expectations, Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cA Confession\u201d and   \u201cDeath of Ivan Ilych,\u201d Kertesz\u2019 Kaddish for an Unborn Child, Kafka\u2019s   Metamorphosis, McCullers\u2019 Member of the Wedding, Vonnegut\u2019s   Slaughterhouse-Five. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Technologies of the Universe Prof. Weatherby (German)  syllabus The human is the \"tool-making animal,\" as Karl Marx wrote, quoting Benjamin Franklin. Marx's writing partner Friedrich Engels would make this the center of his philosophy, declaring the invention of tools and the work they do as the evolutionary force that led to the separation between the ape and the human. But if human activity is \"technological\" by nature, it is in nature itself that tools arise; then how does human time fit into geological time, how does the cosmos come to include the \"tool-making animal,\" and who remakes that cosmos? In an age sometimes now called the \"anthropocene,\" the questions of the cosmos and the tool are increasingly intertwined. Beginning with cosmogonies in the ancient world (Gilgamesh, Hebrew Bible, Hesiod, Plato), we track the shifts that led to the modern scientific conception of the universe (Aristotle, Copernicus, Helmholtz, Einstein). We then explore problems that the ubiquity of technological objects raises\u2014artificial life (Leibniz, Hoffmann, Lem), entropy (Kelvin, Wiener), computing (Babbage, Turing, von Neumann)\u2014compare Carl Sagan's Cosmos with its ongoing update by Neil deGrasse Tyson, and visit the Hayden Planetarium. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 402, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissanc e Prof. Sider (Classics)  syllabus The West began with Greece, moved to Rome, and the incorporated Judeo-Christian values during the Middle Ages. The Renaissance, looking back to the Greeks for re-inspiration, gave near final shape to our ideas of Western culture. Since this series of movements and influences is not chronological, neither shall we read our text in chronological order. Instead, we will take our rubric seriously and look for a few \"conversations\" between and among writers from all our areas: Hesiod and Genesis; Homer and Vergil; Aristophanes and Rabelais; Song of Songs, Sappho, and Marguerite de Navarre; Thucydides and Machiavelli; Catullus and Petrarch; Ovid and Shakespeare; Euripides, Plato, and a Gospel SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 403, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys (French)  syllabus The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and R\u00eaveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\" SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 403, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Chazan (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Focuses on the understanding of knowledge and truth in antiquity and the Enlightenment. Divergent perspectives on knowledge and truth have important implications for society and the individual. They lead to alternative notions of how society should be ordered, who should exercise power in society, the goals of individual endeavor, and the nature of individual fulfillment. Key texts from antiquity and the Enlightenment will be read and analyzed with these issues uppermost in mind. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Acts, Galatians; Sophocles' Antigone; Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Augustine's Confessions; Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus; Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration; Lessing's Nathan the Wise; Montesquieu's Persian Letters; Voltaire's Letters Concerning the English Nation; Paine's Age of Reason. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (College Core Curriculum)  syllabus Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus Explores the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides' Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.

We find ourselves stretched between the past and the future, flung into a world we did not create and yearning for something better. We have expectations of the world and even fantasies of other ones. Our thought often transcends this world, leaving reality behind. The stories we tell of other, better worlds can often be critiques of our own, whereas sometimes we develop and implement projects for the transformation of this world and even of ourselves. Our goal is to demonstrate the ongoing conversation and practice of utopia in Western (i.e, ancient Greek and Roman, Western Mediterranean Christian, European, and Euro-American) cultural history. In examining some parts of this complex and at times contradictory tradition we will develop a set of questions which can be asked of utopian literature. We also examine our own relationship to this literary, ethical, and political tradition.  FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Political Economy Prof. Gross (History)  syllabus  What   is the \u201cmarket\u201d, the \u201ceconomy\u201d, or \u201ccapitalism\u201d? How do individuals   interact with each other in the marketplace? What is the morality of   commerce? And how does, or should, the state govern the economy? These   are all questions that have no simple answers and as a consequence they   stimulate controversy today, in America and throughout the world. Yet   these questions have a long pedigree. Since antiquity intellectuals have   grappled with the fundamental issues of what in the past they called   moral philosophy, what today we call political economy: how the   individual, the market, and the state should interact with each other.   Readings: Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Smith, Ricardo, Rousseau, Zola,   Marx, Mill, Bagehot, Weber, Orwell, Keynes, Polanyi, Friedman, Hayek,   Galbraith, Kindleberger, Harvey, Sachs. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Medieval Political Thought Prof. Stoller (NYU Libraries)  syllabus Medieval   political thought spanned three great religious traditions:   Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Across all three traditions it was   grounded in a deeply religious perspective on the human condition, one   originating in a set of sacred texts that shared a common monotheism and   a similar moral ethic. The political thought of all three groups was   equally grounded in a set of ancient, pagan texts, drawing on the   perspective of the Greeks and Romans, on whose shoulders the medievals   believed they stood. Political theorists across all three traditions   drew heavily from one another, but each spoke to the unique concerns of   its own community. We explore the commonalities and the contrasts among   the three political systems and the extraordinary minds that shaped   them. Readings will include Hebrew and Christian scriptures, the Qur'an,   Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Alfarabi, Alghazali, Aquinas, Avicenna,   Bacon, Giles of Rome, Maimonides, Marsilius of Padua, and Polgar.  FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Action Prof. Halpern (English)  syllabus  What   does it mean to perform an act? What are we doing when we do something?   The term \u201caction\u201d covers everything from picking up a pencil to leading   a political revolution. Action is a way of intervening in the world and   changing it, in minor or major ways. Both ethics and politics involve   acting in relation to others. Philosophers have found action interesting   because it bridges the mental and physical worlds, beginning as   intention and ending with some sort of embodied execution. The English   word \u201cact\u201d complicates things still further, since it can mean not only   \u201cto do something\u201d but also \u201cto pretend to do something; to play a part.\u201d   Acting in the \u201cserious\u201d sense is always haunted by dramatic or   play-acting. And because drama is the art form that relies on people   actually doing things onstage\u2014or rather, pretending to actually do   things onstage\u2014it is also an art form that has thought through questions   of action in sophisticated ways. We read a variety of works by   philosophers, playwrights, theologians, filmmakers, and economists in   order to get a sense of how action has been understood from the   classical era to the present day, including Aeschylus, Aristotle,   Augustine, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Smith, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Beckett.  FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Value Prof. Poovey (English) &amp; Prof. Zaloom (Social and Cultural Analysis)  syllabus Can   you put a price on sex? art? love? life? Is time money, or is   daydreaming time well-spent? Would you accept a pound of flesh as   payment of a debt? Is there such a thing as a free lunch, and what would   it taste like? We explore different\u2014and often conflicting\u2014conceptions   of value spanning literature, philosophy, ethnography, and social   theory, seeking to convey three fundamental principles: Value is not   inherent in things but the result of a social process, value is often   determined at the intersection of different conceptions of productive   potential, and value is conceptualized or measured in different, and   often conflicting, ways. Readings include selections from Aristotle,   Christian Scripture, Shakespeare, Smith, Bentham, Wordsworth, Austen,   Weber, Keynes, Milton Friedman, Kazuo Ishiguro, and Pierre Bourdieu. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014This World and the Next Prof. Connolly (Classics)  syllabus  Explores different ways of thinking about the world or worlds beyond (and better than) the one in which we live, concentrating on the afterlife, political utopias, and the worlds created by artistic imagination. Readings include Homer, Vergil, Dante, the Bible, Plato's Republic, Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto, selection of Romantic poetry, and Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, and its film adaptation, Blade Runner. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Arts and Publics Prof. Blake (English)  syllabus Civic values and public purpose are intricately bound up with the arts. Whenever a case needs to be made that the arts matter, we tend to speak (usually, in very general terms) about how the arts contribute to education, or self-expression, or community life, or public deliberation, or the moral and social reform of individuals and institutions. On the other side, those who question the public value of the arts might complain that the arts are elitist, or overweening, or out of touch, or too political, or not political enough. How did we come to think about the arts in these terms? What are some of our assumptions about public life, such that it makes sense for us to promote the arts as having an important public cultural role, or alternatively distrust or dismiss them for not properly or effectively living up to that role? And, ultimately, what is at stake: Why does it matter if the arts matter? Readings from the Classical period through the present day, with a specific focus on drama and theatre. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Visible and Invisible Cities Prof. Cox (Italian Studies)  syllabus The   experience of living in a city is one vital thread that connects us   with our ancient, medieval, and early modern ancestors, and that   continues to provide a unifying element in millions of our   contemporaries\u2019 disparate lives across the globe. Urban life is a   constant environment and stimulus, whether you find yourself in New   York, Florence, Accra, or Shanghai. Our aim is to supply conceptual   frameworks and historical contexts for this experience by exploring the   ways human communities have been theorized and imagined within the   Western tradition from classical antiquity through to the Renaissance,   particularly the city, conceived since Aristotle as the proper habitat   of humankind, and the relationship between the family or household and   the state. The primary texts encompass utopian writings and works of   political theory, but also texts describing and analyzing real-world   communities and visual and cartographic representations of cities and   urban space. Readings include the canonical\u2014from Plato, Aristotle,   Vergil, Dante, Boccaccio, More, Shakespeare\u2014to texts from Christine de   Pizan and Moderata Fontelong, marginalized from the canon and only now   becoming visible. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 403, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Rubenstein (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Beginning with the collision of the \"Judeo-Christian\" and Hellenistic traditions and their encounter in the Christian Scriptures and Augustine, we see Enlightenment thinkers grapple with the fusion of these traditions they had inherited, subjecting both to serious criticism and revising them as a new tradition\u2014science and technology\u2014rises to prominence. Reading from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Sophocles, Plato, Augustine, Montesquieu, Pope, Voltaire, and Rousseau. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology)  syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (College Core Curriculum)  syllabus Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology, Gorgias, Symposium; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German)  syllabus A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice. Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics - Materialism Prof. Shaw (English)  syllabus Why is materialism a dirty word? Through what logic has it come to be associated with crass monetary gain and excessive bodily pleasure? When did these associations begin, and why? What other senses of materialism (as a philosophy of the everyday, and as a critical corrective to idealism) lurk underneath these pejorative, immediate associations? How might they be activated? We examine conflicts between Christian idealism and a range of materialist philosophies, including Epicureanism, experimentalism and Marxism. Materialists became infamous for directing their attention at bodies rather than souls, at terrestrial matter rather than divine will, and at the letter rather than the spirit of scripture. We follow their lead and pay close attention to a range of texts and objects, but in doing so we also consider just how various materialisms could be, how their realist correctives operated at different scales and in different contexts: from the atomic to the economic, from the corporeal to the textual. Readings: Lucretius, Vergil\u2019s Georgics, 1 Corinthians, Machiavelli\u2019s Prince, More\u2019s Utopia, selections from Montaigne, Shakespeare, Bacon, Diderot, Wordsworth, Poe, Balzac, Marx, Nietzsche and Whitman.  SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Objectivity Prof. Gitelman (English)  syllabus Bias. Spin. Propaganda. Hype. These are familiar pejoratives for citizens of the twenty-first century, and by implication they privilege the same alternative: objectivity. Objectivity is a concept\u2014or an ideal\u2014that frames our understanding of pursuits as diverse as politics, journalism, and science, realms in which we hope to be able to discern the right, the true, and the real. But what is objectivity? Whose discernment counts as objective? How can we tell? Questions like these ask us to consider not only what we know but also how, while the conditions of evolving, possessing, and assessing knowledge turn out to be remarkably available to cultural and historical change. We consider the origins and character of objectivity within and against the Western intellectual tradition by considering selected episodes in its emergence, both ancient and modern, asking how thinkers have thought about knowing. What are or have been the available routes to certainty? What standards exist or have existed for knowledge about the past, about the self or about others, and about the world around us? Is it possible that the twenty-first century will involve new forms of objectivity? Readings: Matthew, Thucydides, Plato\u2019s Protagoras and Meno, Descartes\u2019 Discourse on Method, selections from Montaigne, Bird\u2019s Sheppard Lee, Agee and Evan\u2019s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Action Prof. Halpern (English)  syllabus  What   does it mean to perform an act? What are we doing when we do something?   The term \u201caction\u201d covers everything from picking up a pencil to leading   a political revolution. Action is a way of intervening in the world and   changing it, in minor or major ways. Both ethics and politics involve   acting in relation to others. Philosophers have found action interesting   because it bridges the mental and physical worlds, beginning as   intention and ending with some sort of embodied execution.

SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Life and Death Prof. Velleman (Philosophy)  syllabus  Every   person has a life to live, but what is this thing, \u201ca life\u201d, that every   person has? To begin with, it\u2019s just the temporally extended existence   of the person, the proverbial three score and ten. But a person\u2019s life   is more than that, because it follows a natural progression of   life-stages, from childhood to adolescence to middle age to senescence.   And it\u2019s even more still, since it is partly the creation of the person   living it, who can plan it, evaluate it, anticipate its future, and   remember its past. We explore these and other aspects of a person\u2019s life   through works of literature and philosophy. What makes you the same   person throughout the different stages of your life? How does the   passage of time color your perception of life? What makes for a good   life? A meaningful life? Should you be grateful for having been born, or   dismayed at having to die? Readings: Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics,   Epicurus\u2019 \u201cLetter to Menoeceus,\u201d Cicero\u2019s De Finibus, Lucretius De Rerum   Natura, Dickens\u2019 Great Expectations, Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cA Confession\u201d and   \u201cDeath of Ivan Ilych,\u201d Kertesz\u2019 Kaddish for an Unborn Child, Kafka\u2019s   Metamorphosis, McCullers\u2019 Member of the Wedding, Vonnegut\u2019s   Slaughterhouse-Five. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Technologies of the Universe Prof. Weatherby (German)  syllabus The human is the \"tool-making animal,\" as Karl Marx wrote, quoting Benjamin Franklin. Marx's writing partner Friedrich Engels would make this the center of his philosophy, declaring the invention of tools and the work they do as the evolutionary force that led to the separation between the ape and the human. But if human activity is \"technological\" by nature, it is in nature itself that tools arise; then how does human time fit into geological time, how does the cosmos come to include the \"tool-making animal,\" and who remakes that cosmos? In an age sometimes now called the \"anthropocene,\" the questions of the cosmos and the tool are increasingly intertwined. Beginning with cosmogonies in the ancient world (Gilgamesh, Hebrew Bible, Hesiod, Plato), we track the shifts that led to the modern scientific conception of the universe (Aristotle, Copernicus, Helmholtz, Einstein). We then explore problems that the ubiquity of technological objects raises\u2014artificial life (Leibniz, Hoffmann, Lem), entropy (Kelvin, Wiener), computing (Babbage, Turing, von Neumann)\u2014compare Carl Sagan's Cosmos with its ongoing update by Neil deGrasse Tyson, and visit the Hayden Planetarium. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 402, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissanc e Prof. Sider (Classics)  syllabus The West began with Greece, moved to Rome, and the incorporated Judeo-Christian values during the Middle Ages. The Renaissance, looking back to the Greeks for re-inspiration, gave near final shape to our ideas of Western culture. Since this series of movements and influences is not chronological, neither shall we read our text in chronological order. Instead, we will take our rubric seriously and look for a few \"conversations\" between and among writers from all our areas: Hesiod and Genesis; Homer and Vergil; Aristophanes and Rabelais; Song of Songs, Sappho, and Marguerite de Navarre; Thucydides and Machiavelli; Catullus and Petrarch; Ovid and Shakespeare; Euripides, Plato, and a Gospel SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 403, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys (French)  syllabus The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and R\u00eaveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\" SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 403, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Chazan (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Focuses on the understanding of knowledge and truth in antiquity and the Enlightenment. Divergent perspectives on knowledge and truth have important implications for society and the individual. They lead to alternative notions of how society should be ordered, who should exercise power in society, the goals of individual endeavor, and the nature of individual fulfillment. Key texts from antiquity and the Enlightenment will be read and analyzed with these issues uppermost in mind. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Acts, Galatians; Sophocles' Antigone; Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Augustine's Confessions; Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus; Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration; Lessing's Nathan the Wise; Montesquieu's Persian Letters; Voltaire's Letters Concerning the English Nation; Paine's Age of Reason. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (College Core Curriculum)  syllabus Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus Explores the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides' Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.
