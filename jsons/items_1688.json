We have made major strides towards fulfilling this mission: our research, clinical, educational, and community services have expanded and grown in new directions. In the face of increased threats to our security and safety, our work has highlighted the importance of strengthening resilience in all children as a preventive strategy to enhance and protect their psychological well-being.   Although our efforts are making a difference, significant challenges remain. Research shows that over 75 percent of mental health disorders have their roots in the childhood and adolescent years, though fewer than one quarter of children or adolescents needing services receive treatment. Millions of children are never properly diagnosed or treated. In the coming year, we will continue to work for increased awareness of child mental health issues, new knowledge, new treatments, and better care to help give children back their childhood.

The Child Study Center (CSC) is a center for training, research, education, outreach, and clinical service delivery dedicated to the understanding, prevention, and treatment of child and adolescent mental health, behavioral, and learning problems. The faculty is committed to empirically demonstrated assessment and treatment methodologies, and to evaluating treatment outcome.   The Child and Adolescent Psychology Track was initiated in the 1997-1998 training year and offers an outstanding opportunity for interns who wish to pursue specialized training in clinical child and adolescent psychology. The program combines the assets of the Child Study Center and Bellevue Hospital Center to offer concentrated training with children, adolescents, young adults and families in both inpatient and outpatient settings.   The interns in the Child and Adolescent Psychology Track will be assigned, in consultation with the internship director, to three four-month rotations, at least one of which will be an inpatient experience (either the child inpatient or adolescent inpatient psychiatry unit at Bellevue). One of the other two rotations will also be child- or adolescent- focused; the third rotation need not be. Bilingual and multilingual students are encouraged to apply.   Child and adolescent psychology track interns will:   Treat outpatient cases with internalizing and externalizing disorders.   Conduct neuropsychological and/or educational testing protocols.   Function as co-therapists for specialized group therapy programs.   Attend specialized seminars and individual supervision.   Attend the weekly CSC Grand Rounds Program.   Evaluate and treat adults at Bellevue Hospital Center.
