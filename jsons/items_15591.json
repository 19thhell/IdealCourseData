NYU's approach to the health of our students is one of \u201cwellness\u201d: supporting students in all aspects of their lives in order to enable them to achieve academic success. We believe this approach works well for our campus.  However, the demands of academic life, coupled with work, family, community, and personal responsibilities can create a stressful environment for students. We know how devoted and concerned our faculty and staff are about the well-being of our students, and we want to provide you with guidance on how to respond in cases of student mental distress.            Wellness Exchange   We believe students often can benefit from professional help in understanding and adjusting to the changes they are experiencing and coping with problems they may encounter. Our principal mechanism to provide access to these services is the Wellness Exchange. The Wellness Exchange is NYU's extensive network of health and mental health resources .    A 24/7 hotline ( 212-443-9999 ) centrally links all of these services and puts students in touch with professionals who can help them address day-to-day challenges as well as other health-related concerns including medical issues, academic stress, depression, sexual assault, anxiety, alcohol and other drug dependence, sexually transmitted infections, and eating disorders. The Wellness Exchange can provide assistance in both emergency and non-emergency situations.   The Wellness Exchange provides a variety of entry points to its services to accommodate student choice. Students can seek counseling by appointment at the Counseling Service, by calling the Wellness Exchange hotline, or by using walk-in services located at the Student Health Center (726 Broadway). Counseling is also available within some of the schools in offices located in school buildings.     In case of a life threatening emergency that is imminent (i.e., someone is holding or says they have a weapon and is threatening to use it), please call 911 immediately and then NYU Public Safety (212) 998-2222.   If a student expresses (either verbally or in written work) thoughts or impulses to hurt him/herself or impulses to harm others without any immediate, visible plan or intent, keep the student where he or she is, call the Wellness Exchange at (212) 443-9999 and request an urgent assessment.   If the student is not at imminent risk, but you are worried about the student\u2019s or the community\u2019s well-being, please reach out to the Wellness Exchange in order to seek advice on how to help the student.

NYU's approach to the health of our students is one of \u201cwellness\u201d: supporting students in all aspects of their lives in order to enable them to achieve academic success. We believe this approach works well for our campus.  However, the demands of academic life, coupled with work, family, community, and personal responsibilities can create a stressful environment for students. We know how devoted and concerned our faculty and staff are about the well-being of our students, and we want to provide you with guidance on how to respond in cases of student mental distress.            Wellness Exchange   We believe students often can benefit from professional help in understanding and adjusting to the changes they are experiencing and coping with problems they may encounter. Our principal mechanism to provide access to these services is the Wellness Exchange. The Wellness Exchange is NYU's extensive network of health and mental health resources .    A 24/7 hotline ( 212-443-9999 ) centrally links all of these services and puts students in touch with professionals who can help them address day-to-day challenges as well as other health-related concerns including medical issues, academic stress, depression, sexual assault, anxiety, alcohol and other drug dependence, sexually transmitted infections, and eating disorders. The Wellness Exchange can provide assistance in both emergency and non-emergency situations.   The Wellness Exchange provides a variety of entry points to its services to accommodate student choice. Students can seek counseling by appointment at the Counseling Service, by calling the Wellness Exchange hotline, or by using walk-in services located at the Student Health Center (726 Broadway). Counseling is also available within some of the schools in offices located in school buildings.     In case of a life threatening emergency that is imminent (i.e., someone is holding or says they have a weapon and is threatening to use it), please call 911 immediately and then NYU Public Safety (212) 998-2222.   If a student expresses (either verbally or in written work) thoughts or impulses to hurt him/herself or impulses to harm others without any immediate, visible plan or intent, keep the student where he or she is, call the Wellness Exchange at (212) 443-9999 and request an urgent assessment.   If the student is not at imminent risk, but you are worried about the student\u2019s or the community\u2019s well-being, please reach out to the Wellness Exchange in order to seek advice on how to help the student.

To help examine Venezuela\u2019s current conjuncture, NYU\u2019s Gallatin School of Individualized Study is proud to host three prominent Caracas-based scholars for a one-day symposium examining the country\u2019s past, present, and future. Individual sessions on the country\u2019s upstart communes, perilous prisons, and democratic traditions will be followed by a plenary discussion assessing short and long term scenarios for Venezuela. Free and open to the public; may attend any and/or all sessions.

Es algo que puede sorprender sobre todo si consideramos que para muchos sectores se trata de un modelo muy distante de la realidad venezolana. Probablemente una respuesta est\u00e9 en su an\u00e1lisis en clave hist\u00f3rica, aproxim\u00e1ndonos a lo que los venezolanos mayoritariamente hemos entendido por democracia desde el siglo XIX.   The Venezuelan Prison: From Neoliberalism to the Bolivarian Revolution   ANDR\u00c9S ANTILLANO  Professor of Criminology, Universidad Central de Venezuela   This presentation considers two related ideas. On the one hand, how to explain the rise of criminal punishment in Bolivarian Venezuela, which runs contrary to what research on the relationship between neoliberalism, inequality, and punitive law predicts (punishment increases under neoliberalism and decreases under progressive regimes). On the other hand, how to describe prison life, which reproduces neoliberal logic inside through de facto privatization, exploitation and biopolitical regimentation, rigidity and suffering of the dispossessed.   Exclusionary-Inclusion and the incorporation of Popular Sectors in Venezuela under Chavismo   MAR\u00cdA PILAR GARC\u00cdA GUADILLA  Professor of Sociology and Urban Studies, Universidad Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar  Visiting Research Scholar, Tulane University   Venezuela\u2019s development plans, public policies and strategies of social organization for the incorporation of poor sectors under Chavismo could be defined as \u201cexclusionary\u201d because they do not take into account all constitutional rights, ethnic groups, social classes, political institution and ideological affiliations. They have stress an Extractive economy that neglects the rights of indigeneous communities, favored the socio-economic rights over the civic and political ones; privileged direct assembly decisions with the displacement and even substitution of existing institutions of representative democracy and, excluded the middle-class and social actors and organizations not aligned ideologically with the Bolivarian Revolutionary Project.
