The tradition and practice of developing new scripts and new talents dates back to the early days of the Playhouse, originally the Playwrights Theatre, which fostered the early works of Eugene O&rsquo;Neill, Susan Glaspell, and Edna St. Vincent Millay and where future stars, such as Bette Davis and Claudette Colbert, made their debuts.    For over fifteen years, the New Plays for Young Audiences (NPYA) play reading series has focused more specifically on the development of scripts for child and young people&rsquo;s audiences. The creative vision of the Program in Educational Theatre&rsquo;s co-founders, Lowell and Nancy Swortzell, was to establish a program to encourage the development of plays for youth written by both NYU students and noted authors in the U.S. and abroad . As a playwright himself and editor of several books of plays for children and adults, Lowell Swortzell understood that playwrights need a home where they can take risks in a supportive atmosphere &mdash; a place designed to both nurture and evaluate. This is precisely what O&rsquo;Neill and his colleagues achieved in their small theatre, and what NPYA achieves for young audiences today.    In over 15 years, The New Plays for Young Series has:       Developed over 50 plays by both established playwrights and emerging talents which have gone on to national recognition.    Brought public readings of these plays to the local community and facilitated audience talkbacks with playwright, director, actors, and dramaturge following each Sunday matinee.    Fostered opportunities for NYU students, alumni and professional actors to perform in the readings.    Provided a place where individual works can be developed, tested and brought to the wider realms of production and publication without commercial pressures.    Been praised in print, including Time Out New York which noted: &ldquo;Some of our best plays for young people have been polished during the NYU Educational Theatre Program&rsquo;s New Plays series.&rdquo;    Won national visibility, including capturing the 2001 Award from the American Alliance in Theatre and Education (AATE) for Outstanding New Theatre Project.    Run an attached class, called Problems in Play Production: The Development of New Plays, which studies play development.

The 12:07 (2003) by Laurie Brooks, director: Jeff Church; manuscript    The Odyssey ( 2003 ) adapted by R.N. Sandberg, director: Nancy Swortzell; Dramatic Publishing    As described by Dramatic Publishing, The Odyssey is the story not only of Odysseus' journey home from the Trojan War but of his son Telemachus' path to find out who he truly is. As Odysseus encounters the one-eyed Cyclops, Telemachus struggles to keep their home safe from greedy suitors. As Odysseus battles raging seas and the sly Circe, Telemachus himself sets sail to find his father. And on their parallel journeys, Odysseus and Telemachus encounter monsters and seas so treacherous that they are challenged to their limits. Will they survive to return home? If they do, what kind of heroes will they have become? This Odyssey imagines a somewhat different ending from Homer's epic. But the questions to be faced are the same set out in the ancient story. How do we protect our homes? What makes something or someone a monster? How do we deal with the monsters we encounter overseas? What does it mean to be a hero, to grow up, to be civilized? How does each one of us, despite our age, fears or background, confront the obstacles that life places in our path and find our way through?
