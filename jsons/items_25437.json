A total of 54 to 60 points beyond the master&rsquo;s degree (depending on the student&rsquo;s previous academic background) is required for the Ph.D. and 42 points for the Ed.D. degree. This includes general degree requirements and a minimum of 18 points in educational theatre to be selected in consultation with a doctoral adviser, according to the student&rsquo;s area of interest and professional goals. Doctoral students must complete a minimum of 36 points in residence beyond the master&rsquo;s degree. Details for the degree curriculum for the Ph.D. and Ed. D. appear under the Curriculum tab.

Ph.D. students must defend their dissertation during an oral examination. Three full-time faculty members are required to serve on doctoral students dissertation committee. Ed.D. students will develop a culminating study drawn from one or more of the programs&rsquo; specializations: Drama in Education, Applied Theatre, or Theatre for Young Audiences and Play Production. This might include dramatic work or other arts-based project, action research project, internship, and/or other applied theatre residency in lieu of a research-based dissertation. This will also require a formal proposal, faculty mentorship, and subsequent presentation and defense before a faculty committee. Students should consult the handbook for Doctoral Study published by the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development for the specific requirements of this degree. Course substitutions for any of the general degree requirements must be approved by the academic advisor, the department chairperson, and the vice dean.

Limited electives outside of the Program in Educational Theatre are permitted by advisement only. Please present a written case to your advisor, which outlines the relationship of the electives to your chosen pathway/area of focus. You must discuss your degree program with your advisor each semester, prior to registration. Not all courses are offered each semester.

Prerequisites The EDTC program requires you to have completed the equivalent of two semesters of acting or directing and 2 semesters of theatre history or dramatic criticism prior to admission. If you have not taken these prerequisite courses or their equivalent at the undergraduate level prior to admission, you must register for them before finishing your studies, which may increase the total number of credits required to complete the degree . This may increase the number of credits required for your degree.

Applications for doctoral study are accepted from candidates with clear demonstrated interest in research and scholarship. Acceptance into doctoral study is competitive. Students are encouraged to complete their program in five years. A satisfactorily completed master&rsquo;s degree with a research component is expected prior to application. A total of 54 to 60 points beyond the master&rsquo;s degree (depending on the student&rsquo;s previous academic background) is required for the Ph.D. and 42 points for the Ed.D. degree. This includes general degree requirements and a minimum of 18 points in educational theatre to be selected in consultation with a doctoral adviser, according to the student&rsquo;s area of interest and professional goals. Doctoral students must complete a minimum of 36 points in residence beyond the master&rsquo;s degree. Details for the degree curriculum for the Ph.D. and Ed. D. appear under the Curriculum tab. A candidacy examination is given approximately halfway through the academic work to determine what specific coursework is required. Upon completion of coursework, students must register in a one-point Collegium in performing arts education research each semester in order to maintain matriculation (MPAIA-GE 3400 Performing Arts Research Collegium) Both a proposal and a dissertation are required by doctoral students in the Ph.D. program. Ph.D. students must defend their dissertation during an oral examination. Three full-time faculty members are required to serve on doctoral students dissertation committee. Ed.D. students will develop a culminating study drawn from one or more of the programs&rsquo; specializations: Drama in Education, Applied Theatre, or Theatre for Young Audiences and Play Production. This might include dramatic work or other arts-based project, action research project, internship, and/or other applied theatre residency in lieu of a research-based dissertation. This will also require a formal proposal, faculty mentorship, and subsequent presentation and defense before a faculty committee. Students should consult the handbook for Doctoral Study published by the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development for the specific requirements of this degree. Course substitutions for any of the general degree requirements must be approved by the academic advisor, the department chairperson, and the vice dean.
