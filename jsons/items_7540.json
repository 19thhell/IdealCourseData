Highlights of the trip included corporate visits to Beijing Hyundai and CreditEase as well as lectures on corporate behavior, capital markets and the economy in China.    \"The DBi to Beijing was an unforgettable adventure and certainly a highlight of my MBA,\u201d said MBA student Elizabeth Frederick. \u201cThe academic, professional and social activities were a great way for us to experience the Chinese culture and business climate \u2013 and the personal and professional connections I gained were invaluable. It was exciting to learn about the rising importance of China while exploring such a dynamic city. Needless to say, the diversity of experience (and food!) made this one of my favorite courses at Stern.\"                                                                            View More &quot;Doing Business in...&quot; Slideshows                 Costa Rica, Spring 2015    Brazil, Fall 2014    Spain, Fall 2014    Asia (Singapore), Fall 2014    Israel, Fall 2014    China, Fall 2014    Australia, Fall 2014    Morocco, Fall 2014    Poland, Spring 2014    China, Spring 2014    Argentina, Spring 2014    Istanbul, Spring 2014    Costa Rica, Spring 2014    Italy, Spring 2014    Australia, Spring 2014    Singapore, Spring 2014    I srael, Spring 2014    Brazil, Spring 2014    Hong Kong, Spring 2014    Spain, Fall 2013    Turkey, Spring 2013    Brazil, Spring 2013    Australia, Spring 2013    Beijing, Spring 2013    Argentina, Spring 2013    Hungary, Spring 2013    Italy, Spring 2013    Costa Rica, Spring 2012    Argentina, Summer 2012    India, Spring 2012    Hong Kong, Spring 2012    Hungary, Summer 2012    China, Summer 2012    Brazil, Spring 2012    Spain, Fall 2011    China, Summer 2011    Budapest, Summer 2011    Italy, Spring 2010    Singapore, Winter 2011    Australia, Winter 2011                                                                              News      NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights to Tackle Migrant Labor Rights in the Construction Industry    Foreign Policy Association Awards Medal to Dean Peter Henry    Follow @NYUStern on Twitter and like NYU Stern on Facebook         Basics      Directions &amp; Maps    Faculty Directory    Contact Us                                 FACULTY OPINIONS    Read Stern faculty opinions on  relevant business topics             Sitemap | Privacy | &copy; 2015 Leonard N.
