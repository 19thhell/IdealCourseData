Interest in NYU's new campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai was especially significant, with a 26% rise in applicants to NYU Abu Dhabi and a 31% increase in applications to NYU Shanghai. The University's campus in New York experienced a 14% increase. More than 20 percent of applicants to NYU applied to more than one campus.
