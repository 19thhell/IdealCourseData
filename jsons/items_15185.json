The program also exposed me to opportunities I never knew existed, opening the door to clerkships, employment, and the world of public service. It also put me in contact with a host of role models \u2014 from heads of business to partners at law firms to politicians \u2014 that I have learned from immensely. I am deeply thankful and look forward to giving back to the program long after I graduate.\u201d   \u2014 AnBryce Scholar, Class of 2013   At its core, the AnBryce Scholarship Program seeks to identify and cultivate future leaders, who are committed to giving back to society and making a positive impact on the world. AnBryce Scholars endeavor to live with honor, act with intelligence, and lead with integrity.   The AnBryce Scholarship Program at NYU School of Law provides, among other things, full-tuition scholarships to incoming NYU Law students whose exceptional academic and leadership accomplishments were achieved in the face of extraordinarily challenging social and economic circumstances. To be eligible for consideration, candidates must be among the first in their immediate family to pursue a graduate or professional degree. In addition to receiving full-tuition scholarships, AnBryce Scholars participate in a variety of programs, including opportunities for summer employment at law firms aimed at enhancing professional development.   The AnBryce Scholarship Program was founded in 1998 through the landmark support of Anthony Welters \u201977 and his wife Ambassador Beatrice Wilkinson Welters, and the two foundations that they have endowed, the AnBryce Foundation and the Vincent Wilkinson Foundation. Mr. Welters, the first in his family to graduate college and pursue a graduate degree, knew how challenging the law school experience could be for a student in circumstances similar to his. Financial pressures and the need to work can distract from the academic experience, and the lack of family and other social supports can make navigating entry into the legal profession a daunting prospect. The AnBryce Scholarship Program seeks to alleviate the financial burden of its students, and to mentor them throughout their legal studies and as they embark upon their professional careers. Ambassador and Mr. Welters play an active role in the lives of the AnBryce Scholars, both during law school and afterwards, to assure that these students are afforded the opportunities that they need to succeed, personally and professionally.   AnBryce Scholars may also be assigned to receive a \u201cNamed Scholarship,\u201d within the AnBryce program. These scholarships are awarded by the School of Law in accordance with the wishes of the benefactors of the AnBryce program. Further information on each \u201cNamed Scholarship\u201d can be found by clicking the link at left.   The AnBryce Scholarship Program has proven to be an overwhelming success and we are excited to invite donors seeking to support diversity to expand the AnBryce Program\u2019s scope while at the same time realizing the donors\u2019 philanthropic goals. Major funding for the AnBryce Scholarship Program has been provided by the individuals, organizations and firms listed within the Named Scholarship link. Generous funding has also been provided by Daniel and Estrellita Brodsky Family Foundation; Randal S. Milch '85 and Amelia S. Salzman '85; Julie and Marc E. Platt '82; Ivan '86 and Nina Horowitz Ross '86 and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz Foundation and friends of the NYU School of Law.

In fact, international students, defined by NYU as students who do not hold citizenship or permanent residency status in the United States, comprise roughly 16% of the most recent entering class on our New York campus. There are, however, important notes for international students to consider when applying for admission:       Financial aid to international students on our New York campus is only available for incoming freshmen. If offered admission, international students will be required to submit a certification of finances demonstrating that they will be able to fund their four years of study through a combination of their own funds and any financial assistance we may provide. Students should not submit a certification of finances or bank statements until after they are offered admission.     All applicants, regardless of citizenship, must apply online. Students outside the U.S. who must send application documents (e.g. diplomas, transcripts, etc.) in hardcopy form are strongly encouraged to do so well in advance of our stated application deadlines.     NYU does not consider undergraduate admissions applications from students who already possess a bachelor's degree in any academic area, with the exception of Nursing and all majors offered through the School of Engineering. (Students interested in a second bachelor's degree in Nursing may click here for information. Students interested in a second bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering may click here for more information.)     International students may be required to submit TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE Academic results as proof of English language proficiency. Please review the English language proficiency section of the Standardized Tests page of our website for more information.       All applicants to NYU, regardless of citizenship, are held to the same admissions standards, and evaluated on the same admissions criteria.                                                                                          A note about certification of finances:                               It is not necessary for you to submit financial documents with your application. The New York University Application for Certificate of Eligibility (AFCOE), will be available online to students who are offered admission and who pay the enrollment deposit. All non-U.S. Citizens and non-U.S. permanent residents must file the AFCOE and submit appropriate evidence of their ability to finance their education before certificates for student visas (Form I-20) or exchange visitor visas (Form DS-2019) can be issued.

The program also exposed me to opportunities I never knew existed, opening the door to clerkships, employment, and the world of public service. It also put me in contact with a host of role models \u2014 from heads of business to partners at law firms to politicians \u2014 that I have learned from immensely. I am deeply thankful and look forward to giving back to the program long after I graduate.\u201d   \u2014 AnBryce Scholar, Class of 2013   At its core, the AnBryce Scholarship Program seeks to identify and cultivate future leaders, who are committed to giving back to society and making a positive impact on the world. AnBryce Scholars endeavor to live with honor, act with intelligence, and lead with integrity.   The AnBryce Scholarship Program at NYU School of Law provides, among other things, full-tuition scholarships to incoming NYU Law students whose exceptional academic and leadership accomplishments were achieved in the face of extraordinarily challenging social and economic circumstances. To be eligible for consideration, candidates must be among the first in their immediate family to pursue a graduate or professional degree. In addition to receiving full-tuition scholarships, AnBryce Scholars participate in a variety of programs, including opportunities for summer employment at law firms aimed at enhancing professional development.   The AnBryce Scholarship Program was founded in 1998 through the landmark support of Anthony Welters \u201977 and his wife Ambassador Beatrice Wilkinson Welters, and the two foundations that they have endowed, the AnBryce Foundation and the Vincent Wilkinson Foundation. Mr. Welters, the first in his family to graduate college and pursue a graduate degree, knew how challenging the law school experience could be for a student in circumstances similar to his. Financial pressures and the need to work can distract from the academic experience, and the lack of family and other social supports can make navigating entry into the legal profession a daunting prospect. The AnBryce Scholarship Program seeks to alleviate the financial burden of its students, and to mentor them throughout their legal studies and as they embark upon their professional careers. Ambassador and Mr. Welters play an active role in the lives of the AnBryce Scholars, both during law school and afterwards, to assure that these students are afforded the opportunities that they need to succeed, personally and professionally.   AnBryce Scholars may also be assigned to receive a \u201cNamed Scholarship,\u201d within the AnBryce program. These scholarships are awarded by the School of Law in accordance with the wishes of the benefactors of the AnBryce program. Further information on each \u201cNamed Scholarship\u201d can be found by clicking the link at left.   The AnBryce Scholarship Program has proven to be an overwhelming success and we are excited to invite donors seeking to support diversity to expand the AnBryce Program\u2019s scope while at the same time realizing the donors\u2019 philanthropic goals. Major funding for the AnBryce Scholarship Program has been provided by the individuals, organizations and firms listed within the Named Scholarship link. Generous funding has also been provided by Daniel and Estrellita Brodsky Family Foundation; Randal S. Milch '85 and Amelia S. Salzman '85; Julie and Marc E. Platt '82; Ivan '86 and Nina Horowitz Ross '86 and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz Foundation and friends of the NYU School of Law.

In fact, international students, defined by NYU as students who do not hold citizenship or permanent residency status in the United States, comprise roughly 16% of the most recent entering class on our New York campus. There are, however, important notes for international students to consider when applying for admission:       Financial aid to international students on our New York campus is only available for incoming freshmen. If offered admission, international students will be required to submit a certification of finances demonstrating that they will be able to fund their four years of study through a combination of their own funds and any financial assistance we may provide. Students should not submit a certification of finances or bank statements until after they are offered admission.     All applicants, regardless of citizenship, must apply online. Students outside the U.S. who must send application documents (e.g. diplomas, transcripts, etc.) in hardcopy form are strongly encouraged to do so well in advance of our stated application deadlines.     NYU does not consider undergraduate admissions applications from students who already possess a bachelor's degree in any academic area, with the exception of Nursing and all majors offered through the School of Engineering. (Students interested in a second bachelor's degree in Nursing may click here for information. Students interested in a second bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering may click here for more information.)     International students may be required to submit TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE Academic results as proof of English language proficiency. Please review the English language proficiency section of the Standardized Tests page of our website for more information.       All applicants to NYU, regardless of citizenship, are held to the same admissions standards, and evaluated on the same admissions criteria.                                                                                          A note about certification of finances:                               It is not necessary for you to submit financial documents with your application.
