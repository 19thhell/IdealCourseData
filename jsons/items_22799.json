Many organizations now seek individuals who have the capability to utilize both the lens and the skill sets offered by peacebuilding to help develop policies and programs that contribute to more sustainably peaceful societies.     The 15-credit Graduate Certificate in Peacebuilding is designed to meet the needs of both new and mid-career professionals who already operate in the international arena, but who need specific knowledge about the emerging theory and practice of peacebuilding in order to enhance their career opportunities. Students enrolled in the program will have the chance to investigate major theories and practices of international relations, and to examine how the emergence of peacebuilding thought reinforces some common approaches to global affairs, while transforming others.   Students who complete the Graduate Certificate in Peacebuilding will emerge with strengthened skills in: critical thinking about peace and conflict; conflict assessment and analysis; peace and conflict research; mediation; and peacebuilding program development and management.         The admissions criteria for the Graduate Certificate in Peacebuilding and the M.S. in Global Affairs are the same, and individuals who successfully earn the Certificate can apply course credits toward the completion of the M.S. in Global Affairs .

Many organizations now seek individuals who have the capability to utilize both the lens and the skill sets offered by peacebuilding to help develop policies and programs that contribute to more sustainably peaceful societies.     The 15-credit Graduate Certificate in Peacebuilding is designed to meet the needs of both new and mid-career professionals who already operate in the international arena, but who need specific knowledge about the emerging theory and practice of peacebuilding in order to enhance their career opportunities. Students enrolled in the program will have the chance to investigate major theories and practices of international relations, and to examine how the emergence of peacebuilding thought reinforces some common approaches to global affairs, while transforming others.   Students who complete the Graduate Certificate in Peacebuilding will emerge with strengthened skills in: critical thinking about peace and conflict; conflict assessment and analysis; peace and conflict research; mediation; and peacebuilding program development and management.         The admissions criteria for the Graduate Certificate in Peacebuilding and the M.S. in Global Affairs are the same, and individuals who successfully earn the Certificate can apply course credits toward the completion of the M.S. in Global Affairs .

Environment/Energy Policy        This concentration analyzes the implications of the changing global energy and environmental landscape, as well as the new and emerging opportunities and challenges energy and climate changes present for national and global sustainability and security. The modern energy sector is experiencing rapid change with new oil and gas developments reshaping traditional energy geopolitics; a strong and growing renewable energy sector impacting local, national, and international energy policies and future forecasts; and innovative technological advances that are transforming all areas of the energy supply chain. This concentration prepares students to compete and thrive in this challenging and exciting sector, taking advantage of the opportunities occurring across the energy and environmental landscape. Courses reflect the increasing importance of energy in the formulation of national and foreign policy among countries the world over, as well as the impact of climate change on our environment.                      Course     Title     Credits                     Human Rights and International Law        International law and its enforcement, transitional justice, human rights, laws of war, protection of the environment, national reconstruction, and international organizations all play an increasingly important role in the discourse of international affairs. This concentration not only provides an exploration of international law and basic human rights standards, but it also explores areas such as the women's human rights movement and the environment and human rights, as well as providing opportunities to develop skills in human rights research and advocacy.                      Course     Title     Credits                     International Development and Humanitarian Assistance        What can be done about the massive disparities in wealth, development, and opportunity between and within the countries of the world? Among the issues explored by this concentration are global poverty, the state and civil society in development, foreign aid, the role of gender in poverty alleviation, and the principles and politics of humanitarian assistance and intervention, including those aimed at refugees and internally displaced persons.                      Course     Title     Credits                     International Relations        The pace of change in international relations (IR) is accelerating rapidly and strategic surprise is now the norm. Nearly every day we wake up to something new and unanticipated. This concentration is designed to give students an advanced understanding of the factors shaping IR, and to place these factors in a futures context. What alternate future scenarios can we imagine? What are the forces for change in IR? How are these forces shaping the policies and capabilities of states and nonstate actors? What are the emerging issues that the world will have to face, and how might they be addressed? Courses within this concentration help students improve their ability to anticipate change, and equip them with the analytical tools essential for professional success in a transforming environment.
