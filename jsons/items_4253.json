EAST-UA 91 East Asian Art II: China , Korea, Japan from 1000 CE to Present (4 credits) Instructor: Michele Matteini Art History sponsored. Same as ARTH-UA 511. An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. Emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.         EAST-UA 517 Problems in Contemporary China (4 credits) Instructor: Rebecca Karl Same as HIST-UA 538 This course is designed to examine intensively several major problems in contemporary China (1980s to the present). On the one hand, these problems can be seen as partially representative of China\u2019s social, economic, and intellectual transformation from a Maoist-socialist state to a quasi-capitalist one-party state, transformations that have had and continue to have far-reaching consequences for China and the world in the past three decades; on the other hand, these problems also can be seen as representative of global transformations that chronologically coincided with and helped shape the direction of China\u2019s changes, as China firmly integrated itself into global capitalism and its attendant systems of knowledge production and social formations beginning in the 1980s.      EAST-UA 519 Law &amp; Justice in Chinese Society (4 credits) Instructor: Masato Hasegawa History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 551. As calls for government openness and transparency increase in China, the notion and application of the rule of law in Chinese society has become the subject of an intense debate both within and beyond China. This seminar aims to situate the contemporary debate over China's rule of law in a broader historical context and examines the historical processes of the production and interpretation of law in China from the pre-modern period to the modern era. Particular emphasis will be placed on assessing the manner in which the notion of justice has been defined and invoked in Chinese historical sources. The general course format combines critical reading of texts and active discussion. Readings will include both contemporary historical scholarship on law and society in China and an array of primary source materials in English or in English translation. Some background knowledge of Chinese history will be helpful, but is not required.      EAST-UA 531 Asia's Revolutions: China/India/Vietnam 1885-1962 (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts Same as HIST-UA 538.                               The aim of this introductory course is to establish a framework    for modern Asian history by a comparative approach to the national    independence movements in China, India, and Vietnam, as well as    the context within which they unfolded, in the period 1885-1962,    that is, from the Sino-French War to the Sino-Indian War. We    begin with the questions: why could there be no Gandhi in China,    no Mao in India? And how does Ho Chi Minh compare to these two    figures? The course will introduce students to some of the figures in    modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of    India and Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent    nationhood and of China from its semi-colonial status to    liberation. The principal figures whose lives and writings will be    studied and compared are Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sun    Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh. The course will give due    attention to other relevant figures such as M. Jinnah in the case    of India; Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; Phan Boi Chau in    the case of Vietnam. The main focus of the course is comparing    India and China, which have separate internal dynamics and little    to do with one another until World War Two, and then become    crucially involved in the post World War Two / Cold War world. Since war together with revolution constitutes the determinative    process of this historical period, we will pay attention to the    sequence of wars after 1885: the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the    Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), World War One (1914-18), the    Siberian Intervention (1918-23), the invasion of Manchuria (1931),    the Resistance War of China against Japan (1937-45), World War Two    in the Pacific, the Korean War, and the Indochina Wars (up to    1962). We will also compare the internal struggle in India,    between the Hindu and Muslim communities, leading to the formation    of Pakistan in 1947, and in China between the Communists and the    Nationalists, leading to the completion of the revolution in    1949. Consideration is given to the role of Tibet as a site of    conflict between India and China, the main cause of the    Sino-Indian War of 1962.      EAST-UA 552 The Cold War in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: James L Peck History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 552 This course will focus on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) will be the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We will examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early US global economic visions; the US and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon\u2019s global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia\u2019s place in \u201ca New World Order;\u201d and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we shall examine key de-classified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy. EAST-UA 610 Korean Modernism (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course explores the key debates and questions about modernity with a   focus on Colonial Korea. The concept of modernity\u2014as a particular   historical moment as well as a new thought system\u2014has emerged from the   rise of nation states, the development of capitalism,   and the growth of bodies of scientific knowledge. It indicates a   radical break from tradition, disenchantment with the religious life,   and strong belief in reason and progress. It also celebrates the newness   emerging from the interaction between the self and   the other, and an openness to the foreign and the world. This course   juxtaposes various interpretations of \u201cmodern\u201d events of colonial Korea   in conversation with theories that explicate modernity and what it means   to be modern. We will explore historiographies,   novels, and films dealing with the following themes: national ideology   and national bodies, economic and political contentions, modern   education and scientific management, class and gender formation,   capitalism and urbanization, colonial migration and cosmopolitanism,   anti-colonialism and socialist/revolutionary thought.\u200b      EAST-UA 613 Japanese Cinema (4 credits) Instructor: TBD Same as DRLIT-UA 613. This course examines Japanese cinema from its prehistory to its contemporary developments. The focus will be on the rise of Japanese subculture/popular culture in the 1980s and onward, and its long-term implications. The course is organized roughly chronologically, tracing major historical developments of Japanese popular culture, literature and film from the early modern (17-19th century) to the modern (20-21st century) period. Topics include Japanese pure film movement, genbun-itchi (unification of written-spoken language), benshi (orators), Ozu, anime (Japanese animation), \u201cthe end of literature\u201d discourse, and Japanese nouvelle-vague. This course includes screenings of film with English subtitles.      EAST-UA 710 Japan &amp; WWII in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: George S Solt History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 710.     The course examines Japan and World War II in Asia from a variety of critical perspectives. Two themes in particular will be highlighted throughout the course. First, we will consider how imperialism and colonialism of both the Euro-American and Japanese varieties were central to the War\u2019s outbreak, conduct, and resolution. Second, we will explore various local experiences and memories of the war. These will include the experiences and memories of marginalized groups in Japan and its colonies, \u201ccomfort women,\u201d victims of war atrocities, Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Please note that we will discuss the readings in class every week. Therefore, you must keep up with the readings and complete the weekly assignments.      EAST-UA 729 Traditional Drama China &amp; Japan (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts The course will compare a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention will be given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate scenes or entire plays will be screened for the class or assigned for viewing. EAST-UA 731 20th Century Chinese Literature in Translation (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp Realism has often been regarded as a dominant force in modern Chinese literature, but other styles of representation have also been important to Chinese literary creativity during the 20th century. This course examines the significance of three modes of literary \u201cexcess\u201d that disrupt the expectations of realism- the fantastic, the grotesque and the sublime \u2013 in the history of Chinese literature from the late-Qing dynasty to the late-20th century. While each of these modes possesses links to traditional Chinese culture, they have also provided new expressive resources for reflecting the reconfiguration of social values and human perception in China during the modern era. Focusing on close readings of fiction and some poetry, we will examine how Chinese writers have used the fantastic to transgress the boundaries of the real, employed the grotesque to expose reality\u2019s ugliness, and invoked the sublime to try to invest literature with the potential to change reality.  EAST-UA 736 Issues and Debates in Contemporary Korea (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course aims to understand the principles, logics, and dynamics that   have constituted the contemporary divided Korea\u2014with a particular focus   on South Korea. The postcolonial era in Korea soon led to the Korean   War and then the Cold War, which took the   two Koreas down dramatically different pathways. South Korea achieved   rapid and dramatic economic development, eventually witnessing exemplary   democratization movements emerge from the fight against dictatorial   government, class inequality, and sexual discrimination.   Despite an earlier start on economic development following its   socialist revolution, North Korea has suffered from a poor economy and a   repressive authoritarian regime. Paying attention to Cold War politics   as a major influence in creating and sustaining the   two Koreas, we explore three primary themes in the history of   contemporary Korea: 1) Nationalism, 2) Developmentalism, and 3)   Neoliberalism. The subtopics include: the Korean War and its impact,   anti-communistic nationalism and state violence, developmentalism   and democracy, class differentiation and gender formation,   multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism, urbanization and environmental   issues, youth and precarious labor, North Korea and human rights.        EAST-UA 832 Intro to Buddhism (4 credits) Instructor: Christopher Kelley Religious Studies sponsored. Same as RELST-UA 832 An introduction to this complex religion, emphasizing its history, teachings, and practices. Discusses its doctrinal development in India, then emphasizes certain local practices: Buddhism and the family in China; Buddhism, language, and hierarchy in Japan; the politics of Buddhist Tibet; and Buddhist art. Finally, the course touches on Buddhism in the United States.      EAST-UA 950 Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination (4 credits) Instructor: Phil Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media.      EAST-UA 952 Topics in Chinese Studies: Modern Chinese Drama (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp   China has always been home to a rich theatrical tradition, visible in such forms as Kun and Beijing operas. Yet beginning in the late-1800s, new knowledge of Western culture inspired major creative attempts to modernize the traditional theater and to introduce foreign styles of performance. While the efforts of such figures as Mei Lanfang led to the transformation of Beijing opera into China\u2019s first form of internationally- known theater, the spoken dramas of modern playwrights like Cao Yu and Tian Han offered realist plays of social critique to advance the reform of Chinese culture. Upon such foundations, drama developed into one of the most important and contested areas of artistic innovation and public engagement through China\u2019s 20th-century history of war, revolution and reform. This course examines the history of modern Chinese drama through close readings of exemplary dramatic texts, film viewings and the study of current scholarship on the topic.

It is currently undergoing a reconsideration of its academic program.               The Department of East Asian Studies of New York University offers a doctoral and master\u2019s program in East Asian Culture. The graduate program is concerned with culture, media, and questions of representation as they relate to the formation of East Asian societies such as China, Japan and Korea in modern times. Rather than pursue the practice of area studies in the traditional sense, the program is committed to a critical and, whenever possible, interdisciplinary examination of East Asia\u2019s modernity in a global configuration. While the program will emphasize how received pasts interact in the modern present of these societies, the principal emphasis will be on the question of modernity in search of its own historicity as both an historical and theoretical problematic. In the course of their study, students will be challenged to develop a critical awareness of the political, institutional, and methodological consequences, as well as the historical provenance of both disciplinary-based and area studies inquiry. Working with their advisers and other faculty inside and outside the department, students will be encouraged to design their programs around literary and film studies, as well as studies of other media and forms of representation; theoretical or intellectual debates; historiographical inquiry; questions of gender and sexuality; social and political movements; or any combination of the above. The intellectual strength and identity of our graduate program lies, first of all, in its sharp focus on the modern period and in its dedication to a theoretically informed, interdisciplinary approach to the study of culture and society of modern East Asia. Our core faculty members specialize in modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages and literatures; Chinese and Japanese film and media studies; modern Chinese and Japanese intellectual and cultural history; modern Korean society; and comparative studies of nationalism, colonialism, revolution, and cultural politics. This unit of expertise is further reinforced by our truly impressive array of associated members in history, anthropology, religious studies, art history, and cinema studies, whose work are mainly concerned with modern East Asia. This intellectual configuration, both sound in a traditional academic sense and marking a departure from the older area studies model, allows us to address many deep-seated and pressing issues of modern East Asia-as they took shape in the complex of global relations-with a depth of knowledge and critical rigor rarely seen in the field. As a part of the University community, the Graduate Program in East Asian Culture shares the general dynamic of NYU, which has been embarking on its pursuit to become a truly global university. The program closely works with and benefits form a plethora of interdisciplinary programs, centers, and institutes with a distinct international or internationalizing tendency, such as the International Center for Advanced Studies; the Center for Media, Culture, and History; the Asian/Pacific/ American Studies Program and Institute; the Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality; the Institute of Fine Arts, the Institute of the History of Production of Knowledge; the Institute for Law and Society, and so forth, with which our faculty have affiliations or working relations. This internal network of knowledge and knowledge production, coupled with the University-wide resources committed to international student and scholarly exchanges, visits, and coordination, has created a truly stimulating environment in which the student can thrive in his or her study of the modern East Asia.

EAST-UA 91 East Asian Art II: China , Korea, Japan from 1000 CE to Present (4 credits) Instructor: Michele Matteini Art History sponsored. Same as ARTH-UA 511. An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. Emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.         EAST-UA 517 Problems in Contemporary China (4 credits) Instructor: Rebecca Karl Same as HIST-UA 538 This course is designed to examine intensively several major problems in contemporary China (1980s to the present). On the one hand, these problems can be seen as partially representative of China\u2019s social, economic, and intellectual transformation from a Maoist-socialist state to a quasi-capitalist one-party state, transformations that have had and continue to have far-reaching consequences for China and the world in the past three decades; on the other hand, these problems also can be seen as representative of global transformations that chronologically coincided with and helped shape the direction of China\u2019s changes, as China firmly integrated itself into global capitalism and its attendant systems of knowledge production and social formations beginning in the 1980s.      EAST-UA 519 Law &amp; Justice in Chinese Society (4 credits) Instructor: Masato Hasegawa History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 551. As calls for government openness and transparency increase in China, the notion and application of the rule of law in Chinese society has become the subject of an intense debate both within and beyond China. This seminar aims to situate the contemporary debate over China's rule of law in a broader historical context and examines the historical processes of the production and interpretation of law in China from the pre-modern period to the modern era. Particular emphasis will be placed on assessing the manner in which the notion of justice has been defined and invoked in Chinese historical sources. The general course format combines critical reading of texts and active discussion. Readings will include both contemporary historical scholarship on law and society in China and an array of primary source materials in English or in English translation. Some background knowledge of Chinese history will be helpful, but is not required.      EAST-UA 531 Asia's Revolutions: China/India/Vietnam 1885-1962 (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts Same as HIST-UA 538.                               The aim of this introductory course is to establish a framework    for modern Asian history by a comparative approach to the national    independence movements in China, India, and Vietnam, as well as    the context within which they unfolded, in the period 1885-1962,    that is, from the Sino-French War to the Sino-Indian War. We    begin with the questions: why could there be no Gandhi in China,    no Mao in India? And how does Ho Chi Minh compare to these two    figures? The course will introduce students to some of the figures in    modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of    India and Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent    nationhood and of China from its semi-colonial status to    liberation. The principal figures whose lives and writings will be    studied and compared are Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sun    Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh. The course will give due    attention to other relevant figures such as M. Jinnah in the case    of India; Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; Phan Boi Chau in    the case of Vietnam. The main focus of the course is comparing    India and China, which have separate internal dynamics and little    to do with one another until World War Two, and then become    crucially involved in the post World War Two / Cold War world. Since war together with revolution constitutes the determinative    process of this historical period, we will pay attention to the    sequence of wars after 1885: the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the    Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), World War One (1914-18), the    Siberian Intervention (1918-23), the invasion of Manchuria (1931),    the Resistance War of China against Japan (1937-45), World War Two    in the Pacific, the Korean War, and the Indochina Wars (up to    1962). We will also compare the internal struggle in India,    between the Hindu and Muslim communities, leading to the formation    of Pakistan in 1947, and in China between the Communists and the    Nationalists, leading to the completion of the revolution in    1949. Consideration is given to the role of Tibet as a site of    conflict between India and China, the main cause of the    Sino-Indian War of 1962.      EAST-UA 552 The Cold War in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: James L Peck History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 552 This course will focus on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) will be the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We will examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early US global economic visions; the US and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon\u2019s global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia\u2019s place in \u201ca New World Order;\u201d and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we shall examine key de-classified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy. EAST-UA 610 Korean Modernism (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course explores the key debates and questions about modernity with a   focus on Colonial Korea. The concept of modernity\u2014as a particular   historical moment as well as a new thought system\u2014has emerged from the   rise of nation states, the development of capitalism,   and the growth of bodies of scientific knowledge. It indicates a   radical break from tradition, disenchantment with the religious life,   and strong belief in reason and progress. It also celebrates the newness   emerging from the interaction between the self and   the other, and an openness to the foreign and the world. This course   juxtaposes various interpretations of \u201cmodern\u201d events of colonial Korea   in conversation with theories that explicate modernity and what it means   to be modern. We will explore historiographies,   novels, and films dealing with the following themes: national ideology   and national bodies, economic and political contentions, modern   education and scientific management, class and gender formation,   capitalism and urbanization, colonial migration and cosmopolitanism,   anti-colonialism and socialist/revolutionary thought.\u200b      EAST-UA 613 Japanese Cinema (4 credits) Instructor: TBD Same as DRLIT-UA 613. This course examines Japanese cinema from its prehistory to its contemporary developments. The focus will be on the rise of Japanese subculture/popular culture in the 1980s and onward, and its long-term implications. The course is organized roughly chronologically, tracing major historical developments of Japanese popular culture, literature and film from the early modern (17-19th century) to the modern (20-21st century) period. Topics include Japanese pure film movement, genbun-itchi (unification of written-spoken language), benshi (orators), Ozu, anime (Japanese animation), \u201cthe end of literature\u201d discourse, and Japanese nouvelle-vague. This course includes screenings of film with English subtitles.      EAST-UA 710 Japan &amp; WWII in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: George S Solt History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 710.     The course examines Japan and World War II in Asia from a variety of critical perspectives. Two themes in particular will be highlighted throughout the course. First, we will consider how imperialism and colonialism of both the Euro-American and Japanese varieties were central to the War\u2019s outbreak, conduct, and resolution. Second, we will explore various local experiences and memories of the war. These will include the experiences and memories of marginalized groups in Japan and its colonies, \u201ccomfort women,\u201d victims of war atrocities, Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Please note that we will discuss the readings in class every week. Therefore, you must keep up with the readings and complete the weekly assignments.      EAST-UA 729 Traditional Drama China &amp; Japan (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts The course will compare a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention will be given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate scenes or entire plays will be screened for the class or assigned for viewing. EAST-UA 731 20th Century Chinese Literature in Translation (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp Realism has often been regarded as a dominant force in modern Chinese literature, but other styles of representation have also been important to Chinese literary creativity during the 20th century. This course examines the significance of three modes of literary \u201cexcess\u201d that disrupt the expectations of realism- the fantastic, the grotesque and the sublime \u2013 in the history of Chinese literature from the late-Qing dynasty to the late-20th century. While each of these modes possesses links to traditional Chinese culture, they have also provided new expressive resources for reflecting the reconfiguration of social values and human perception in China during the modern era. Focusing on close readings of fiction and some poetry, we will examine how Chinese writers have used the fantastic to transgress the boundaries of the real, employed the grotesque to expose reality\u2019s ugliness, and invoked the sublime to try to invest literature with the potential to change reality.  EAST-UA 736 Issues and Debates in Contemporary Korea (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course aims to understand the principles, logics, and dynamics that   have constituted the contemporary divided Korea\u2014with a particular focus   on South Korea. The postcolonial era in Korea soon led to the Korean   War and then the Cold War, which took the   two Koreas down dramatically different pathways. South Korea achieved   rapid and dramatic economic development, eventually witnessing exemplary   democratization movements emerge from the fight against dictatorial   government, class inequality, and sexual discrimination.   Despite an earlier start on economic development following its   socialist revolution, North Korea has suffered from a poor economy and a   repressive authoritarian regime. Paying attention to Cold War politics   as a major influence in creating and sustaining the   two Koreas, we explore three primary themes in the history of   contemporary Korea: 1) Nationalism, 2) Developmentalism, and 3)   Neoliberalism. The subtopics include: the Korean War and its impact,   anti-communistic nationalism and state violence, developmentalism   and democracy, class differentiation and gender formation,   multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism, urbanization and environmental   issues, youth and precarious labor, North Korea and human rights.        EAST-UA 832 Intro to Buddhism (4 credits) Instructor: Christopher Kelley Religious Studies sponsored. Same as RELST-UA 832 An introduction to this complex religion, emphasizing its history, teachings, and practices. Discusses its doctrinal development in India, then emphasizes certain local practices: Buddhism and the family in China; Buddhism, language, and hierarchy in Japan; the politics of Buddhist Tibet; and Buddhist art. Finally, the course touches on Buddhism in the United States.      EAST-UA 950 Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination (4 credits) Instructor: Phil Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media.      EAST-UA 952 Topics in Chinese Studies: Modern Chinese Drama (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp   China has always been home to a rich theatrical tradition, visible in such forms as Kun and Beijing operas. Yet beginning in the late-1800s, new knowledge of Western culture inspired major creative attempts to modernize the traditional theater and to introduce foreign styles of performance. While the efforts of such figures as Mei Lanfang led to the transformation of Beijing opera into China\u2019s first form of internationally- known theater, the spoken dramas of modern playwrights like Cao Yu and Tian Han offered realist plays of social critique to advance the reform of Chinese culture. Upon such foundations, drama developed into one of the most important and contested areas of artistic innovation and public engagement through China\u2019s 20th-century history of war, revolution and reform. This course examines the history of modern Chinese drama through close readings of exemplary dramatic texts, film viewings and the study of current scholarship on the topic.

Normally, at least three years of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean at the college level and substantial course work in Asian culture are required to enter the Ph.D. program. Please refer to the Graduate School of Arts and Science for the most up-to-date application requirements. Each student's program is determined in consultation with a faculty adviser and with the director of graduate studies in East Asian studies. Courses in other departments may be included whenever appropriate. In order to complete the Ph.D. requirements, the student must acquire 72 points, which are equivalent to 18 courses. Among those, 40 points, including Independent Study, must be taken within East Asian studies, while others can be completed through courses taken outside of East Asian studies, such as directed reading courses and research credits (a maximum of 16 points of research credit can be taken over five semesters). In the first year, the student should enroll in two to four language courses toward fulfilling the language requirements. At the end of the first year, the student is required to complete a research paper, based on the two completed first-year seminars, that addresses the theoretical-historical questions concerning the field of East Asian studies. This paper is separate from the term papers required by each course and constitutes a part of the general examination. Two members of the faculty (one of whom is the student's adviser) grade the examination. In the event of a failed performance, the student is permitted to retake the examination after consultation with his or her adviser. During the second year of study, the student is also required to fulfill the language requirements, including the requirement in a second East Asian language and/or a major European language, by signing up for courses offered in Chinese, Japanese or Korean or the selected European language. The bulk of the course work during the second year, however, should concentrate on the chosen field under various specialized \"topics\" (in Chinese literature, Chinese history, Japanese literature, Japanese visual culture, Korean film, East Asian cinema, etc.). A total of four topics courses must be completed within the student's chosen field. Course work in the third year is designed to allow the student to renew his or her inquiry in theory and methodology and to explore research areas that are interdisciplinary in nature. By the first half of the third year, the student should have finished all the required courses in East Asian studies. The student is advised to take the qualifying examination in three distinctively different subfields of East Asian studies by the end of the third year. A three-member faculty committee (including the student's adviser) is formed for each student for their comprehensive exam, qualifying exam (prospectus defense) and dissertation. The student and the adviser decide on the formation of the committee after consultation. After the successful completion of the comprehensive examination, the student submits a dissertation prospectus (qualifying exam), which should include a thesis and methodological statement, a preliminary table of contents, a bibliography, etc. The student must pass the oral examination based on his or her prospectus to advance to candidacy.
