This course introduces the essential elements required to take your performance skills to the next level and be a more effective singer in a small to medium-sized venue. Students will begin with a process of discovery as it relates to who they are as a performer and will continually integrate the implementation of tools gained from the process through the three-week term. Focusing on improving the performer's connection to music through varying in-class exercises and independent assignments, the class is designed to deepen the performer's skill set through practical, improvisational, rhythmic, harmonic studies and with the goal of taking away a set of positive routines that can be incorporated into a daily artistic practice. The course is open to original songwriting singers as well as performers of traditional, standard and contemporary repertoire looking to deepen their stagecraft. Song Performance Intensive participants should prepare two songs for basic performance, these and other songs will provide the set-list for a final performance in a proper NYC music venue.
