Congregation of vendors of all types of goods. Good for little souvenirs for friends and family. Really fun to walk around.     The Mercado de la Cebada (La Latina - just steps from the metro on c/Toledo)     Awesome fresh fruits, veggies, meat, etc.                                                                    Retail Shopping Areas                                        Puerto del Sol     Great shopping (Zara, H&amp;M, Bershka, etc.)     Goya     Great commercial shops and classy department stores     El Corte Ingles     There are two big stores: one in Sol and one up by campus, in the other direction from the school from the Santiago Bernabeu metro stop   Huge Department Store, the only place you can walk into to buy bread, milk, and cereal and walk out with the new limited edition Louis Vuitton bag.   You can buy everything from deck furniture to perfume.   Corte Ingles supermarkets are separate.

Taste of America (c/ Serrano 149)     American food store                            Attractions                                                  Museums                                  Prado (between metro stops Banco de Espana and Atocha)   Largest museum in Western Europe   Don\u2019t Miss: Velazquez (Las Meninas), Goya, Greco   The hour before closing is free but there is usually a long line       Reina Sofia (metro Atocha)   Houses contemporary Spanish art   Picasso\u2019s Guernica is a must see; Mir\u00f3 and Dal\u00ed are also featured   The hour before closing is free         Tip: Walk down Paseo del Prado to get from the Prado to the Reina Sofia. It\u2019s a really fun and artsy street.     Thyssen (near metro Banco de Espana and Sevilla)   Used to be a private collection   A lot smaller than the Reina Sofia and the Prado   Don't miss Tiziano, Tintoretto, and Van der Heyden                                                                    Entertainment                                 Flamenco   Lots of bars have daily shows   Look out for discounts in papers and magazines   Sometimes you can catch flamenco dancers doing performances on the street outside the Palacio Real.           Sporting Events   Futbol, or soccer in Madrid, is huge. Take advantage of our campus\u2019 vicinity to Santiago Bernabeu and go see Real Madrid play! After all, Spain won the 2008 Euro Cup!   To have the futbol experience without the price tag, consider going to a game against a lesser rival. Buy your ticket early and enjoy!                                                                                   Places to see                                 Palacio Real (metro Opera)     The Royal Palace, former home to the royal family, is gorgeous. The rooms are mostly kept intact so you can get an actual feeling of what it would have been like to live there.     Catedral de la Almudena (metro Opera)     This is the biggest cathedral in Madrid and is located right across from the Palacio Real. The design of the cathedral is very different from other cathedrals that you will see while you are in Europe.     Templo De Debod   Ancient Egyptian temple rebuilt in Madrid   Located in the Parque de Rosales, with a great view of Casa de Campo   Ask you intercambio to take you here, its especially pretty at sunset       Plaza de Espana   Usually filled with street vendors and tourists   Located at the end of Gran Via   In the middle of the plaza there is a statue of Cervantes and his characters, Don Quijote and Sancho Panza       Plaza Mayor   Main plaza of Madrid   Usually filled with street performers, tourists and locals and lines with restaurants, tourist shops and bars   Very close to Sol   A lot of festivities take place here (i.e. dos de mayo) and it's a great place to people-watch on a sunny day.       Goya's Tomb (Panteon de Goy)   Beautiful fresco paintings, done by Goya himself   A lesser known site, but a beautiful church, well worth seeing       Teleferico (metro Arguelles)   A cable car that traverses the Casa delCampo   Great views of Madrid   When you get off in Casa de Campo, explore for a bit before you get back on.

On a nice day, grab a baguette and a bottle of wine, call up some friends, and have a picnic in the park. There is also a lake in the middle of Reitro where you can rent a paddle boat and go for a row.            The best way to become a native in a city is to do what you would do at home in Madrid. So if you take yoga classes when you are in New York, take one here.                               \"I was lucky enough to enroll in the Art in the Prado Museum class that NYU Madrid offers. We would have class Tuesdays, and meet at the Prado Museum on Thursdays. It was one of the best courses I\u2019ve taken, and I have a new appreciation for art that I never could have realized without having lived in Madrid.\"   - Adam, NYU Madrid student                           Questions?
