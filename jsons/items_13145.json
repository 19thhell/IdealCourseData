What is the effect of emotions on consumer judgments? What are the effects of anticipated regrets on consumer choice? What is the interaction between need states, consumption contexts, and product choice? What are the effects of negative affective states on consumer judgments and choice? What are the psychological underpinnings of consumer decision making and choice? What are consumers&rsquo; desires for large assortments and their effects on consumer satisfaction? How can econometric models be built based on determinants of consumer decision making?
