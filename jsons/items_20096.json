In the last few years there has been increasing in     interest in     Financial Economics among graduate students and faculty     and we now     regularly offer three     courses in financial economics. These courses attract a     significant     number     of students from the department, from the Stern School,     and from other     universities     in New York City. The Department of Economics began     offering Financial     Economics     as a field of specialization in the academic year 2002.          Financial Economics can be taken as a primary field,     but it is     also a natural secondary field for students specializing     in     Macroeconomics, International Economics, Economic Theory     or     Econometrics. Students who wish to take Financial     Economics as a     primary field are strongly advised to take additional     courses offered     by the Department of Finance in the Stern School. In      any case,      students intending to take Financial Economics as a      primary field      should meet      with faculty NO LATER THAN the beginning of their      second year to      discuss their      background, their proposed course of study, and their      career plans .                       Field Committee                 Alberto Bisin      Sydney Ludvigson      Douglas Gale (chair)                 Requirements      for      Financial      Economics Field 2011-12          Primary =  Students are required to take      the following three      courses:        fall      2011 = ECON-GA 3001-03 &#8220;Financial Economics      Workshop&#8221; ; spring 2012 =       ECON-GA        2023 &#8220;Financial Economics III (Empirical      Asset Pricing),&#8221; plus an      appropriate finance course from      the Stern School or Courant Institute.       An additional course from the Stern School or      Courant Institute may be      substituted for one or more of the above courses,      subject to the requirement      that the three courses taken must include both asset      pricing and corporate finance,      and both theory and empirical courses. A      student taking Financial Economics as a primary field      must also complete a      research paper.             Secondary      =      Same as primary, except     that the paper is not     required if Financial Economics is taken as a secondary     field.       Attending      seminars is a critical part of a graduate student's      education. As soon practicable, students should      start attending one or      more of the seminars offered in the Department of      Economics in FAS or      by the Department of Finance in the Stern School.

In the last few years there has been increasing in     interest in     Financial Economics among graduate students and faculty     and we now     regularly offer three     courses in financial economics. These courses attract a     significant     number     of students from the department, from the Stern School,     and from other     universities     in New York City. The Department of Economics began     offering Financial     Economics     as a field of specialization in the academic year 2002.          Financial Economics can be taken as a primary field,     but it is     also a natural secondary field for students specializing     in     Macroeconomics, International Economics, Economic Theory     or     Econometrics. Students who wish to take Financial     Economics as a     primary field are strongly advised to take additional     courses offered     by the Department of Finance in the Stern School. In      any case,      students intending to take Financial Economics as a      primary field      should meet      with faculty NO LATER THAN the beginning of their      second year to      discuss their      background, their proposed course of study, and their      career plans .                       Field Committee                 Alberto Bisin      Sydney Ludvigson      Douglas Gale (chair)                 Requirements      for      Financial      Economics Field 2011-12          Primary =  Students are required to take      the following three      courses:        fall      2011 = ECON-GA 3001-03 &#8220;Financial Economics      Workshop&#8221; ; spring 2012 =       ECON-GA        2023 &#8220;Financial Economics III (Empirical      Asset Pricing),&#8221; plus an      appropriate finance course from      the Stern School or Courant Institute.       An additional course from the Stern School or      Courant Institute may be      substituted for one or more of the above courses,      subject to the requirement      that the three courses taken must include both asset      pricing and corporate finance,      and both theory and empirical courses. A      student taking Financial Economics as a primary field      must also complete a      research paper.             Secondary      =      Same as primary, except     that the paper is not     required if Financial Economics is taken as a secondary     field.       Attending      seminars is a critical part of a graduate student's      education. As soon practicable, students should      start attending one or      more of the seminars offered in the Department of      Economics in FAS or      by the Department of Finance in the Stern School.
