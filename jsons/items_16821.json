Neurons produce unique electrical events and use a complex, highly evolved system for communicating with one another. Cellular neuroscientists seek a thorough understanding of these fundamental processes, which emerge from the interplay of a large number of signaling molecules, ion channels, and numerous other fine-tuned pieces.     Molecular neuroscientists study the signaling among small molecules and proteins within neurons. They identify new targets and pathways that play critical roles in basic and complex neuronal mechanisms, such as those that underlie learning and memory. These molecules often are linked directly to neurological diseases and may prove to be clinically-relevant drug targets for new treatments.   At NYU, researchers use cutting edge techniques, from two-photon microscopy to in vivo labeling of individual neurons to microarray analysis, to investigate the development and function of the intact and diseased brain at the cellular and molecular level.\u00a0   Find out more about our cellular and molecular neuroscientists.
