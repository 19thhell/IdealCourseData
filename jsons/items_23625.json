phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.

phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.

Within the context of the field placement experience, and aligned practice courses, you will have the opportunity to integrate theory and practice. Because the Silver School of Social Work has developed unique partnerships with over 600 public and nonprofit agencies throughout the tri-state area, our placement sites are varied, of high quality, and offer students a rich learning environment. No school devotes as much effort to matching students with appropriate field learning opportunities.   Field learning will immerse you in the extraordinary range of human and social problems that lead clients to reach out for help. It will provide you the opportunity to develop skills and appreciate the realities of coping with complex problems in the context of specific service-delivery systems.   You will be trained to work with a wide range of populations in diverse practice settings. With an emphasis on training for social work practice that promotes social and economic justice, your field education will advance your learning as a relationship-centered, reflective practitioner, preparing you for work with individuals, groups, families, and communities.   For MSW students, in your first, or professional foundation, year, the primary goal of field learning is to provide a foundation of social work practice skills within a generalist perspective. (See foundation year learning objectives in the MSW Student Manual .)     In the second, or advanced concentration, year, MSW students focus their graduate education on specific aspects of social work within specific practice systems (fields of practice) along with their professional development and growth. The faculty advisor, in the capacity of educational consultant, assists students with the development of educational goals and objectives for the advanced concentration year. (See advanced concentration year learning objectives for in the MSW Student Manual .)     Focused Learning Opportunities   The School continues to expand its range of specialized initiatives for students in their advanced concentration year. Students who select to participate in focused learning opportunities are recommended to take specific courses and required colloquia designed to provide curricular support for specialized placements. The following focused learning opportunities are available to students:     Social Work Practice with Children and Families     Social Work Practice with Adolescents in Schools     Social Work Practice with Substance Abuse and Co-Occurring Disorders     Social Work Practice: Zelda Foster Studies in Palliative and End-of-Life Care     Social Work Practice: Evidence-Based Mental Health Practice for Adults with Severe Mental Illness     Social Work Practice: Macro/Micro Practice in Organizations   Social Work Practice : Integrated Youth Behavioral Health Project   Social Work Practice: Integrated Health Care with Adults       See the Fields of Practice and Focused Learning Opportunities Manual for full descriptions and requirements.

Within the context of the field placement experience, and aligned practice courses, you will have the opportunity to integrate theory and practice. Because the Silver School of Social Work has developed unique partnerships with over 600 public and nonprofit agencies throughout the tri-state area, our placement sites are varied, of high quality, and offer students a rich learning environment. No school devotes as much effort to matching students with appropriate field learning opportunities.   Field learning will immerse you in the extraordinary range of human and social problems that lead clients to reach out for help. It will provide you the opportunity to develop skills and appreciate the realities of coping with complex problems in the context of specific service-delivery systems.   You will be trained to work with a wide range of populations in diverse practice settings. With an emphasis on training for social work practice that promotes social and economic justice, your field education will advance your learning as a relationship-centered, reflective practitioner, preparing you for work with individuals, groups, families, and communities.   For MSW students, in your first, or professional foundation, year, the primary goal of field learning is to provide a foundation of social work practice skills within a generalist perspective. (See foundation year learning objectives in the MSW Student Manual .)     In the second, or advanced concentration, year, MSW students focus their graduate education on specific aspects of social work within specific practice systems (fields of practice) along with their professional development and growth. The faculty advisor, in the capacity of educational consultant, assists students with the development of educational goals and objectives for the advanced concentration year. (See advanced concentration year learning objectives for in the MSW Student Manual .)     Focused Learning Opportunities   The School continues to expand its range of specialized initiatives for students in their advanced concentration year. Students who select to participate in focused learning opportunities are recommended to take specific courses and required colloquia designed to provide curricular support for specialized placements. The following focused learning opportunities are available to students:     Social Work Practice with Children and Families     Social Work Practice with Adolescents in Schools     Social Work Practice with Substance Abuse and Co-Occurring Disorders     Social Work Practice: Zelda Foster Studies in Palliative and End-of-Life Care     Social Work Practice: Evidence-Based Mental Health Practice for Adults with Severe Mental Illness     Social Work Practice: Macro/Micro Practice in Organizations   Social Work Practice : Integrated Youth Behavioral Health Project   Social Work Practice: Integrated Health Care with Adults       See the Fields of Practice and Focused Learning Opportunities Manual for full descriptions and requirements.

Within the context of the field placement experience, and aligned practice courses, you will have the opportunity to integrate theory and practice. Because the Silver School of Social Work has developed unique partnerships with over 600 public and nonprofit agencies throughout the tri-state area, our placement sites are varied, of high quality, and offer students a rich learning environment. No school devotes as much effort to matching students with appropriate field learning opportunities.   Field learning will immerse you in the extraordinary range of human and social problems that lead clients to reach out for help. It will provide you the opportunity to develop skills and appreciate the realities of coping with complex problems in the context of specific service-delivery systems.   You will be trained to work with a wide range of populations in diverse practice settings. With an emphasis on training for social work practice that promotes social and economic justice, your field education will advance your learning as a relationship-centered, reflective practitioner, preparing you for work with individuals, groups, families, and communities.   For MSW students, in your first, or professional foundation, year, the primary goal of field learning is to provide a foundation of social work practice skills within a generalist perspective. (See foundation year learning objectives in the MSW Student Manual .)     In the second, or advanced concentration, year, MSW students focus their graduate education on specific aspects of social work within specific practice systems (fields of practice) along with their professional development and growth. The faculty advisor, in the capacity of educational consultant, assists students with the development of educational goals and objectives for the advanced concentration year. (See advanced concentration year learning objectives for in the MSW Student Manual .)     Focused Learning Opportunities   The School continues to expand its range of specialized initiatives for students in their advanced concentration year. Students who select to participate in focused learning opportunities are recommended to take specific courses and required colloquia designed to provide curricular support for specialized placements. The following focused learning opportunities are available to students:     Social Work Practice with Children and Families     Social Work Practice with Adolescents in Schools     Social Work Practice with Substance Abuse and Co-Occurring Disorders     Social Work Practice: Zelda Foster Studies in Palliative and End-of-Life Care     Social Work Practice: Evidence-Based Mental Health Practice for Adults with Severe Mental Illness     Social Work Practice: Macro/Micro Practice in Organizations   Social Work Practice : Integrated Youth Behavioral Health Project   Social Work Practice: Integrated Health Care with Adults       See the Fields of Practice and Focused Learning Opportunities Manual for full descriptions and requirements.

phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.
