Admitted students must provide the Office of Undergraduate Admissions with such proof of graduation by July 1 of the year they plan to enroll.   International Students: An extension will be granted to students outside the United States whose secondary schools operate on a different schedule. You will not be penalized for the late receipt of your graduation certificate or final report from your high school. Students who are submitting final exam results as proof of graduation should ensure that these results are sent to us as soon as they have been released, and provide official certificates as soon as these are available.     In all cases, proof of graduation must be provided prior to beginning the first semester of classes at NYU. NYU considers the following documents to serve as proof of secondary school graduation:     A final high school transcript submitted directly from the student\u2019s school. We will not accept a high school transcript submitted by the student. The final high school transcript must show the date of graduation.     Results from the General Education Development (GED) Test. Students may submit GED results in lieu of a final high school transcript. Students can take the GED Test almost anywhere in the United States and Canada and internationally at any of the 3,400 Official GED Testing Centers. Click here for more information about obtaining a GED .     Original or officially certified copies of nationally recognized high school graduation examination results, such as the Advanced Level General Certificate of Education or the International Baccalaureate Diploma. NYU reserves the right to request that a student submit an evaluation or authentication of their final transcript or examination results by an educational credential evaluation service.     Admitted homeschooled students must either be able to provide evidence of a homeschool diploma, a certificate of completion that is considered the equivalent of a high school diploma in the applicant's home state, or they must complete and submit results of their GED test prior to enrollment at NYU.   A college/university transcript from an accredited, degree-granting institution, showing evidence of 24 credits in: 6 semester hours or the equivalent in English language arts, including writing, speaking and reading (literature); 3 semester hours or the equivalent in mathematics; 3 semester hours or the equivalent in natural sciences; 3 semester hours or the equivalent in social sciences; 3 semester hours or the equivalent in humanities; and 6 semester hours or the equivalent in any other courses.     Final transcripts may be submitted by a school official through the Common Application website. All mailed transcripts and other proof of graduation documents, however, should bear an official stamp, be signed and mailed from a student's school in a sealed envelope to: New York University Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, New York 10012, USA.

Admitted students must provide the Office of Undergraduate Admissions with such proof of graduation by July 1 of the year they plan to enroll.   International Students: An extension will be granted to students outside the United States whose secondary schools operate on a different schedule. You will not be penalized for the late receipt of your graduation certificate or final report from your high school. Students who are submitting final exam results as proof of graduation should ensure that these results are sent to us as soon as they have been released, and provide official certificates as soon as these are available.     In all cases, proof of graduation must be provided prior to beginning the first semester of classes at NYU. NYU considers the following documents to serve as proof of secondary school graduation:     A final high school transcript submitted directly from the student\u2019s school. We will not accept a high school transcript submitted by the student. The final high school transcript must show the date of graduation.     Results from the General Education Development (GED) Test. Students may submit GED results in lieu of a final high school transcript. Students can take the GED Test almost anywhere in the United States and Canada and internationally at any of the 3,400 Official GED Testing Centers. Click here for more information about obtaining a GED .     Original or officially certified copies of nationally recognized high school graduation examination results, such as the Advanced Level General Certificate of Education or the International Baccalaureate Diploma. NYU reserves the right to request that a student submit an evaluation or authentication of their final transcript or examination results by an educational credential evaluation service.     Admitted homeschooled students must either be able to provide evidence of a homeschool diploma, a certificate of completion that is considered the equivalent of a high school diploma in the applicant's home state, or they must complete and submit results of their GED test prior to enrollment at NYU.   A college/university transcript from an accredited, degree-granting institution, showing evidence of 24 credits in: 6 semester hours or the equivalent in English language arts, including writing, speaking and reading (literature); 3 semester hours or the equivalent in mathematics; 3 semester hours or the equivalent in natural sciences; 3 semester hours or the equivalent in social sciences; 3 semester hours or the equivalent in humanities; and 6 semester hours or the equivalent in any other courses.     Final transcripts may be submitted by a school official through the Common Application website. All mailed transcripts and other proof of graduation documents, however, should bear an official stamp, be signed and mailed from a student's school in a sealed envelope to: New York University Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, New York 10012, USA. Documents may also be emailed to admissions.ops@nyu.edu but should still bear an official stamp, must come from a school official, and must be sent from an official school email address.

As per the recommendation from the admissions committee you have been admitted to the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering (School of Engineering) and under this condition are required to submit the necessary original or official documentation as outlined in your acceptance letter. This is a requirement you must fulfill in order to continue with your academic degree program and it is a stipulation of your acceptance to the Graduate School at the School of Engineering.

Students must present their most up to date documents to the Graduate Center to have their student account hold temporarily lifted and then meet with their academic advisor before registering for classes online. In each subsequent semester while fulfilling a Proof of Degree Completion conditional admission, students must visit the Graduate Center to have their hold temporarily lifted for class registration.
