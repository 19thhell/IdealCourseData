No more than 18 students are permitted in each seminar.     Recent first-year interdisciplinary seminars have included \u201cCapitalism and Democracy,\u201d \u201cThe Social Construction of Reality,\u201d and \u201cThe Thingliness of Things.\u201d       In addition, students take two thematic writing seminars, one each semester, with no more than 15 students in each class.     Recent writing seminars have included \u201cThe Idea of America: What Does it Mean?,&quot; \u201cImagining Cities,\u201d \u201cFood Culture and Food Writing,\u201d and \u201cMyths and Fables in Popular Culture.\u201d         First-year students are encouraged to explore their interests by taking courses in departments and schools throughout NYU in the fields of study in which they may choose to concentrate.               Sophomore Year     During the sophomore year, students begin to define their concentration. Sophomores often take at least one Gallatin interdisciplinary seminar, and many select a sophomore-only interdisciplinary seminar.     Recent sophomore-only seminars include\u201cAmerican Narratives I,\u201d \u201cLiterary and Critical Theory,\u201d and \u201cShakespeare's Mediterranean.\u201d         At the end of the sophomore year, each student writes the Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration, a short essay that is read and approved by his or her faculty adviser. This plan details the steps the student will take towards defining his or her concentration.   Sophomores are encouraged to explore their interests by taking courses in the other schools of NYU, and many also choose to study abroad for a semester.   Sophomores often undertake internships related to their fields of study in various businesses, cultural institutions, and nonprofit organizations throughout New York City.   Sophomores may also choose to pursue their work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.           Junior Year          Juniors often take several Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars.    In the junior year, students continue to deepen their knowledge in their chosen fields of study by taking courses widely in other departments and schools at NYU.    During the junior year, students begin preparing for their senior colloquium by taking the course, \u201cThird-Year Symposium,\u201d which guides them through the process of writing the rationale, a short essay with booklist that defines the focus of their colloquium. The rationale is read and approved by two faculty members.    Juniors often undertake internships related to their fields of study and may do some of their academic work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.    Juniors may also take advantage of study abroad options, perhaps for one semester or even for one year. Particularly popular study abroad options for Gallatin students are NYU in Prague, NYU in Ghana, and Gallatin-specific summer courses in Florence, Berlin, and Buenos Aires.               Senior Year     In the fall of their senior year, students finalize plans for their senior colloquium, a two-hour oral exam and conversation involving three faculty members. At the colloquium, students present a variety of texts that have proved important in their concentration. These texts are selected to represent a range of knowledge, touching on topics both ancient and modern. The colloquium is that capstone event of a Gallatin education.     Students continue taking Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars in their senior year and also take advanced courses throughout the University in their fields of focus.   In the second semester of the senior year, students have the option to undertake a senior project or senior essay.   Seniors undertake internships related to their fields of study and may continue to do some of their academic work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.                      top of page                                                                        NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

Description       This course engages a seemingly simple question: What is an object? Relatedly, what is a thing? As a means of illuminating these questions, we will consult everyday objects, theories of various object forms (from our very first loved objects, to commodities, fetishes, even lost things) and literary and artistic representations. One of our challenges will be to learn to read objects both by having them at hand, and by understanding how economic, psychic, and social values shape their visual and material properties. In this process, we will engage the popular view that objects tell us something, first and foremost, about the people who create and use them. We will also encounter the taboo proposition that objects may have an intentionality of their own, and that humans do not dictate the meaning of all things. Readings include Winnicott, \u201cTransitional Objects and Transitional Phenomena\u201d; Marx, \u201cCommodities\u201d; Bryson,\u00a0 Looking at the Overlooked: Four Essays on Still Life Painting \u00a0; Hebdige,\u00a0 Subculture: The Meaning of Style \u00a0; Baudrillard, \u201cThe Ideological Genesis of Need\u201d; Proust,\u00a0 Remembrance of Things Past \u00a0.

At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

No more than 18 students are permitted in each seminar.     Recent first-year interdisciplinary seminars have included \u201cCapitalism and Democracy,\u201d \u201cThe Social Construction of Reality,\u201d and \u201cThe Thingliness of Things.\u201d       In addition, students take two thematic writing seminars, one each semester, with no more than 15 students in each class.     Recent writing seminars have included \u201cThe Idea of America: What Does it Mean?,&quot; \u201cImagining Cities,\u201d \u201cFood Culture and Food Writing,\u201d and \u201cMyths and Fables in Popular Culture.\u201d         First-year students are encouraged to explore their interests by taking courses in departments and schools throughout NYU in the fields of study in which they may choose to concentrate.               Sophomore Year     During the sophomore year, students begin to define their concentration. Sophomores often take at least one Gallatin interdisciplinary seminar, and many select a sophomore-only interdisciplinary seminar.     Recent sophomore-only seminars include\u201cAmerican Narratives I,\u201d \u201cLiterary and Critical Theory,\u201d and \u201cShakespeare's Mediterranean.\u201d         At the end of the sophomore year, each student writes the Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration, a short essay that is read and approved by his or her faculty adviser. This plan details the steps the student will take towards defining his or her concentration.   Sophomores are encouraged to explore their interests by taking courses in the other schools of NYU, and many also choose to study abroad for a semester.   Sophomores often undertake internships related to their fields of study in various businesses, cultural institutions, and nonprofit organizations throughout New York City.   Sophomores may also choose to pursue their work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.           Junior Year          Juniors often take several Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars.    In the junior year, students continue to deepen their knowledge in their chosen fields of study by taking courses widely in other departments and schools at NYU.    During the junior year, students begin preparing for their senior colloquium by taking the course, \u201cThird-Year Symposium,\u201d which guides them through the process of writing the rationale, a short essay with booklist that defines the focus of their colloquium. The rationale is read and approved by two faculty members.    Juniors often undertake internships related to their fields of study and may do some of their academic work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.    Juniors may also take advantage of study abroad options, perhaps for one semester or even for one year. Particularly popular study abroad options for Gallatin students are NYU in Prague, NYU in Ghana, and Gallatin-specific summer courses in Florence, Berlin, and Buenos Aires.               Senior Year     In the fall of their senior year, students finalize plans for their senior colloquium, a two-hour oral exam and conversation involving three faculty members. At the colloquium, students present a variety of texts that have proved important in their concentration. These texts are selected to represent a range of knowledge, touching on topics both ancient and modern. The colloquium is that capstone event of a Gallatin education.     Students continue taking Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars in their senior year and also take advanced courses throughout the University in their fields of focus.   In the second semester of the senior year, students have the option to undertake a senior project or senior essay.   Seniors undertake internships related to their fields of study and may continue to do some of their academic work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.                      top of page                                                                        NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

Description       This course engages a seemingly simple question: What is an object? Relatedly, what is a thing? As a means of illuminating these questions, we will consult everyday objects, theories of various object forms (from our very first loved objects, to commodities, fetishes, even lost things) and literary and artistic representations. One of our challenges will be to learn to read objects both by having them at hand, and by understanding how economic, psychic, and social values shape their visual and material properties. In this process, we will engage the popular view that objects tell us something, first and foremost, about the people who create and use them. We will also encounter the taboo proposition that objects may have an intentionality of their own, and that humans do not dictate the meaning of all things.

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.
