You will be required to complete the affidavit form , including certification by your attorney supervisor, for the qualifying pro bono project(s) that you do. If you do more than one project to make up the 50 hours, you will need to file affidavits for each project. It is recommended that you complete the form(s) at the time you complete the pro bono work. You can find the affidavit form, Rule 520.16 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (which explains the requirement), and Frequently Asked Questions , on the NY Courts website. We strongly suggest that you review the rule and Frequently Asked Questions before completing the affidavit to ensure that your work qualifies.   What counts:     Pro bono work must be law-related and supervised by an attorney, judge, or law school faculty or instructor in order to qualify.   Internships with a broad range of organizations including legal services providers; public defender and prosecutor offices; not-for-profit organizations; state, local, or federal government agencies or legislative bodies; and judges or court systems can all count if the work is law-related and properly supervised.   Pro bono work abroad could also qualify if it is law-related and supervised by an attorney in that jurisdiction. You will be asked to explain the nature and circumstances of the work in detail.   Pro bono work at a law firm qualifies as long as no fee is being paid, and the work is duly supervised and law related.   Many, though not all, NYU Law clinics qualify.   You are allowed to receive funding or academic credit for qualifying pro bono work and still satisfy the requirement.     What does NOT count:     Scholarly research, such as academic research for a professor or work for a law journal or publication.   Student-directed pro bono. At present, work of student organizations such as REACH, Unemployment Action Center, and the Suspension Representation Project does not qualify because students are not supervised by an attorney.   Community service that is not law-related, such as working at a food shelter.   Pro bono work done before you started law school. However, LLMs can count some work completed prior to the LLM program.     How to get credit for your pro bono work:     All applicants to the New York State Bar will be required to furnish an affidavit/s signed by their attorney supervisor/s confirming that they have completed at least 50 hours of pro bono work. Click here for the affidavit.   You may also need to ensure your pro bono hours are documented on an affidavit of law-related employment. Check the requirements with the Judicial Department to which you are assigned for the purposes of admission.     For more information:     The text of the rule and a detailed FAQ can be found here .   You can watch PILC's NYS Pro Bono Rule Information Video here .   Contact David Glasgow, Public Interest Law Center Fellow ( david.glasgow@nyu.edu )     How to track pro bono hours on Symplicity:   How to Activate the Pro Bono Module on Symplicity     Log onto your Symplicity profile.
