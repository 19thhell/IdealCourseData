The film stars the voices of Yuji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yuko Tanaka, Kaoru Kobayashi, Masahiko Nishimura, Akihiro Miwa, Mitsuko Mori and Hisaya Morishige.  Princess Mononoke is a period drama set in the late Muromachi period (approximately 1337 to 1573) of Japan, but with fantasy elements. The story follows the young Emishi warrior Ashitaka's involvement in the struggle between the supernatural guardians of a forest and the humans who consume its resources. The term \"Mononoke\" is not a name, but a general term in the Japanese language for a spirit or monster; a closer rendering of the title into English would be \"The Mononoke Princess\" or \"The Spirit Princess\".
