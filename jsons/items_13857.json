Between modules, students complete approximately 20 hours of work per week on pre- and post-module tasks.      Module I: NYU Stern - New York    Strategic and Macro-Sovereign Risk Framework - Ingo Walter    Students will learn a holistic view of integrated risk management that is globally relevant. To acquire this perspective, students will learn about modern risk metrics and its evident limitations; acquire an appreciation for the importance of low-probability high-impact events and correlation spikes; discuss practical alternatives to create effective, efficient, and robust risk-transfer structures; and analyze issues related to the implementation of risk management systems and compliance with key regulatory requirements in risk-sensitive industries. By the end of the course, you will be able to place all these issues in a conceptual framework that forms the backbone of the program as a whole.    The course then moves on to cover sovereign risk and issues in country risk assessment. Topics include macroeconomic drivers of exchange rate volatilities, sources of macroeconomic internal and external disequilibrium, sovereign risk calibration, and building sovereign risk dimensions into exposure portfolios.    Behavioral Finance: Application to Risk - Hersh Shefrin    Effective risk management requires a mix of qualitative skills involving psychology and risk culture alongside quantitative skills involving probability and statistics. Issues pertaining to psychology and risk culture were root causes of adverse events such as the global financial crisis, the BP oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, the threat posed by global warming, the JPMorgan London Whale event, and the failure of the commodities brokerage firm MF Global. This course provides participants with a structural framework for how to analyze the manner in which cognitive, emotional, and social factors impact the management of both financial risk and operational risk. The integration of quantitative and qualitative approaches is a central theme of the course. Students will acquire a series of skills for identifying and managing specific psychological phenomena that underlie the practice and culture of risk management.    Concepts in Risk Management: Statistical Models - Rohit Deo  Here, students will be introduced to statistical concepts and models that are of use in Quantitative Risk Management. We will start with basic ideas from probability theory such as probability distributions, expected values, higher moments, skewness, and kurtosis and then cover more advanced topics such as nonlinear models, non-normal distributions, tail index estimation, etc.                   Module II: Amsterdam    Corporate Finance  Here, students will build the analytical framework to value a business and begin to learn concepts of optimal capital structure, risk and return, leverage, and cost of capital. In addition, students will understand how financial decisions affect value and acquire the analytical tools necessary for sound financial decision making.     Concepts in Risk Management II: Finance Applications - Pierre Hillion  In this course, students will learn the theoretical concepts behind risk analytics and their practical use in the fund management industry. After a review of the theoretical and statistical concepts underlying portfolio management, the course focus will shift to risk analytics, tracking error ex-ante and ex-post, as well as tracking error decomposition and its usefulness in active portfolio management.     Market Risk, VaR Modeling and RAROC - Marcin Kacperczyk  This course will provide the analytical and practical tools necessary to manage market risks. The course starts with the regulatory requirements of Basel II with respect to market risk, then continue with analyzing basic tools to measure market risk including Value at Risk (VaR), RAROC (Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital), sensitivity tests, scenario analysis, stress testing, and back-testing of the models.    Students will also become familiar with the strategic issues of hedging policy, through discussions that include the hedging impact of non-tradable risks and linkages between different types of risk.               Module III: NYU Stern - New York    Concepts in Risk Management II: Finance Applications - Rangarajan Sundaram  Derivative securities have become ubiquitous in today's financial world. Even as they have been condemned as \"weapons of mass financial destruction\" by Warren Buffet and blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis, the notional outstanding of all derivatives contracts in just the over-the-counter market currently approaches $700 trillion (a four-fold increase since 2003), and it is estimated that over 90% of the world's 500 largest companies use derivatives to manage their risk.    In this course, we examine the main classes of derivatives securities---futures, forwards, options, and swaps---focusing on their uses and valuation. We make liberal use of case studies (Aracruz, Metallgesellschaft, Barings, SocGen, Harvard, and others) to understand and highlight the potential risks in these instruments. We also examine the valuation and hedging of derivative securities at both a formal level, and equally importantly, an intuitive one (how do these models work? what do they capture? what do they omit? how could they go wrong?).     Credit Risk Management and Credit Derivatives - Anthony Saunders  Here, students will be introduced to and focus more closely on issues in credit risk, concepts behind its modeling, and analysis of credit-related instruments such as default-prone debt of credit derivatives. Students will acquire an understanding of how and why these products played such a critical role in the ongoing crisis. We will also lead students through the new financial sector reforms and discuss their direct or indirect impact on credit derivatives, and credit markets in general, going forward.    The course will include analysis of the Basel II Model, the implications of the standardized and internal-ratings-based (IRB) approaches and issues relating to their implementation. New models and approaches will be analyzed including KMV, Creditmetrics, and so-called reduced-forms credit risk measurement models.     Financial Crises: Causes, Consequences and Remedies - Viral Acharya  This course helps students understand what caused the recent mortgage and sovereign debt crises in the Western economies; why regulation failed given its static nature and misplaced focus on individual firms rather than the system as a whole; and, what financial sector reforms are being undertaken to address these causes of crises and regulatory flaws. Will these new reforms succeed? Or do they continue to leave \"shadow banking\" in shadows? And will new forms of shadow banking emerge as regulatory arbitrage, perpetuating a new cycle of financial innovations and crises?    See NYU Stern's Global Systemic Risk Rankings and related research.     Risk and Structured Finance - Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh  This course provides students with an improved understanding of developments in securitization and structured credit risk transfer, with special emphasis on the recent credit market disruptions and the changes in regulation under consideration.    In addition to covering risk transfer through asset-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, the course explains risk transfer using credit derivatives and synthetic asset securitization. Given its prominence among structured products today, special emphasis is placed on mortgage-backed securities. The new techniques open up fresh possibilities for the transfer, pricing and management of credit risk.    See Center for Real Estate Finance Research for NYU Stern's work in this area.  MSRM Class of 2012 Capstone: Strategic Mortgage Default in Financial Institutions: a Proposal for an Alternative Management         Liquidity Risk - Bruce Tuckman  Liquidity is the ability of a firm to meet its cash obligations from a combination of existing cash reserves, asset sales, and new borrowing. Liquidity risk management, then, is the art of balancing the existential danger of being caught without enough liquidity against the costs of maintaining liquidity.    While liquidity risk management has always been essential for financial firms, the spectacular and fatal losses of liquidity during the financial crisis of \u201807-\u201909 have greatly increased the focus of managers, regulators, and even the general public on this important branch of risk management.    This unit begins by explaining the challenges of liquidity risk management, i.e., how various financial firms face uncertainties with respect to the stability of funding sources and the liquidity of assets, which can be mitigated to varying degress at varying costs. Several cases will then illustrate the practice, and sometimes failure, of liquidity risk management in specific settings. The unit will conclude with a survey of techniques used to measure, model, and manage liquidity risk, including those recently mandated by national and international regulators.     Corporate and Sovereign Bankruptcy, Distressed Investing and Restructuring - Edward Altman  Professor Altman explores with MSRM students his thoughts on current conditions and outlook for Global Corporate and Sovereign Debt Markets and strategies for investing in distressed firms and their securities. His well known Z-Score family of models will be analyzed for investment and restructuring strategies as well as updated statistics on rating equivalents and default/recovery rates.               Module IV: Abu Dhabi    Operational Risk in Banking and Finance - Michael Pinedo  Here, the objective is to discuss Operational Risk in a more applied manner. The goal is that students will be able to get acquainted with concepts and ideas that are useful in their dealings with Operational Risk on a day-to-day basis in their groups or in their departments.     Risk Management in Global Corporate Finance - Massimo Massa   In this session, the goal is to understand the international dimension of risk and develop a framework to quantify it. We will consider how firms should hedge risk from a broad strategic perspective and zoom in on currency risk and, in particular, transaction, translation, and economic exposure. We will study when it makes sense to hedge financially and what types of contracts to consider. We then will go into detail on the link between currency risk and international financing, comparing domestic issues versus international issues, and hedged structures versus non-hedged alternatives. The different ways of hedging the currency exposure embedded in the bonds will be discussed.     Enterprise Risk and Corporate Governance - Ingo Walter  The mission here is to investigate the risks associated with strategic and tactical developments in financial and non-financial firms and their linkages to the reputational capital of the firm as it is embedded in share prices. Students will also examine the role of corporations, investors, intermediaries, and regulators in the events that preceded and followed the build-up and bursting of the financial bubble and consider key dimensions of corporate governance. The concepts will be illustrated through recent and classic case studies of situations of financial scandals.            Closing: NYU Stern - New York   Strategic Risk Capstone    The Strategic Risk Capstone requires students to build on their own professional experience and exposure to the academic content of the program to create a meaningful project that demonstrates their ability to take an integrated view of risk management in global finance. This could take a number of forms:       The global financial implications of a specific risk management technique, instrument, or market    The impact of risk management on the competitive positioning and strategic execution of firms (or a particular firm) in global financial markets and particular market segments    An in-house project to examine a key risk management issue of interest to that firm    An assessment of probable future directions in the development of specific instruments, techniques, or markets associated with risk management      Examples:       Does Risk Management Matter to Shareholders?       The authors of this paper pose a question that is central to any student devoting a year to studying risk management: Does it matter to shareholders? The authors develop a creative research design that allows them to test whether firms with more sophisticated risk management techniques have different characteristics (e.g. Tobin's Q, financial leverage, and stock return volatility) compared to firms with an unsophisticated approach to risk management. Their empirical analysis confirms that there are statistically significant differences between firms with sophisticated versus unsophisticated risk management practices as it pertains to Tobin's Q, financial leverage, and stock market volatility. Measured by these indicators, the authors conclude that risk management matters for certain operational parameters of the firm (leverage) and the resultant financial market outcomes (Tobin's Q and leverage).          A Framework for Operational Risk Mitigation       This paper attempts to develop a new framework, dubbed CRAM for Corporate Risk Adaptation Model, to identify firms with the likelihood of avoiding a catastrophic operational risk event, or surviving one if the event were to occur. CRAM relies on 4 categories of data (People, Process, Governance, and External) and 12 key factors that populate the categories. The authors draw on 5 case studies (WorldCom, MT Global, Toyota, Enron, and Marsh &amp; McLennan) to make an initial calibration of the model, but then include several other firms (Apple, Google, Starbucks, Mastercard) as a way to check whether the model classifies these successful companies as \u201cgood.\u201d          Systemic Risk Safeguards for Central Clearing Counterparties       The authors of this project have tackled a large and complex issue that stands in the foreground of the Dodd-Frank policy agenda. Dodd-Frank mandates a much larger role for central counterparties (CCPs) to handle the clearing and settlement of derivative transactions that historically were largely traded and cleared on a bilateral basis. Putting many eggs in a single basket clearly elevates the need to watch the basket. The authors of this project dissect various sources of capital that underlay a generic CCP, and then run a series of simulations subjecting the CCP to stress conditions in order to assess how many layers of the risk waterfall are impacted under different stress scenarios.          Corporate Risk Management Experiences During the 2008 Crisis       The project addressed how various firms, most of which were in the food sector and therefore heavily exposed to commodity price changes, responded to the financial turbulence of the 2008 crisis. The authors developed a common template of data, narrative, tables and charts to include for each of the seven companies in the sample. The sample included companies headquartered in the USA and Latin American, some primarily privately owned and others publicly held, and so offered a reasonable cross section of firms, some of which managed their way through the multitude of risks in the crisis and others of which succumbed by having to take on substantial new debt or bankruptcy.          See some other examples here.

Between modules, students complete approximately 20 hours of work per week on pre- and post-module tasks.      Module I: NYU Stern - New York    Strategic and Macro-Sovereign Risk Framework - Ingo Walter    Students will learn a holistic view of integrated risk management that is globally relevant. To acquire this perspective, students will learn about modern risk metrics and its evident limitations; acquire an appreciation for the importance of low-probability high-impact events and correlation spikes; discuss practical alternatives to create effective, efficient, and robust risk-transfer structures; and analyze issues related to the implementation of risk management systems and compliance with key regulatory requirements in risk-sensitive industries. By the end of the course, you will be able to place all these issues in a conceptual framework that forms the backbone of the program as a whole.    The course then moves on to cover sovereign risk and issues in country risk assessment. Topics include macroeconomic drivers of exchange rate volatilities, sources of macroeconomic internal and external disequilibrium, sovereign risk calibration, and building sovereign risk dimensions into exposure portfolios.    Behavioral Finance: Application to Risk - Hersh Shefrin    Effective risk management requires a mix of qualitative skills involving psychology and risk culture alongside quantitative skills involving probability and statistics. Issues pertaining to psychology and risk culture were root causes of adverse events such as the global financial crisis, the BP oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, the threat posed by global warming, the JPMorgan London Whale event, and the failure of the commodities brokerage firm MF Global. This course provides participants with a structural framework for how to analyze the manner in which cognitive, emotional, and social factors impact the management of both financial risk and operational risk. The integration of quantitative and qualitative approaches is a central theme of the course. Students will acquire a series of skills for identifying and managing specific psychological phenomena that underlie the practice and culture of risk management.    Concepts in Risk Management: Statistical Models - Rohit Deo  Here, students will be introduced to statistical concepts and models that are of use in Quantitative Risk Management. We will start with basic ideas from probability theory such as probability distributions, expected values, higher moments, skewness, and kurtosis and then cover more advanced topics such as nonlinear models, non-normal distributions, tail index estimation, etc.                   Module II: Amsterdam    Corporate Finance  Here, students will build the analytical framework to value a business and begin to learn concepts of optimal capital structure, risk and return, leverage, and cost of capital. In addition, students will understand how financial decisions affect value and acquire the analytical tools necessary for sound financial decision making.     Concepts in Risk Management II: Finance Applications - Pierre Hillion  In this course, students will learn the theoretical concepts behind risk analytics and their practical use in the fund management industry. After a review of the theoretical and statistical concepts underlying portfolio management, the course focus will shift to risk analytics, tracking error ex-ante and ex-post, as well as tracking error decomposition and its usefulness in active portfolio management.     Market Risk, VaR Modeling and RAROC - Marcin Kacperczyk  This course will provide the analytical and practical tools necessary to manage market risks. The course starts with the regulatory requirements of Basel II with respect to market risk, then continue with analyzing basic tools to measure market risk including Value at Risk (VaR), RAROC (Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital), sensitivity tests, scenario analysis, stress testing, and back-testing of the models.    Students will also become familiar with the strategic issues of hedging policy, through discussions that include the hedging impact of non-tradable risks and linkages between different types of risk.               Module III: NYU Stern - New York    Concepts in Risk Management II: Finance Applications - Rangarajan Sundaram  Derivative securities have become ubiquitous in today's financial world. Even as they have been condemned as \"weapons of mass financial destruction\" by Warren Buffet and blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis, the notional outstanding of all derivatives contracts in just the over-the-counter market currently approaches $700 trillion (a four-fold increase since 2003), and it is estimated that over 90% of the world's 500 largest companies use derivatives to manage their risk.    In this course, we examine the main classes of derivatives securities---futures, forwards, options, and swaps---focusing on their uses and valuation. We make liberal use of case studies (Aracruz, Metallgesellschaft, Barings, SocGen, Harvard, and others) to understand and highlight the potential risks in these instruments. We also examine the valuation and hedging of derivative securities at both a formal level, and equally importantly, an intuitive one (how do these models work? what do they capture? what do they omit? how could they go wrong?).     Credit Risk Management and Credit Derivatives - Anthony Saunders  Here, students will be introduced to and focus more closely on issues in credit risk, concepts behind its modeling, and analysis of credit-related instruments such as default-prone debt of credit derivatives. Students will acquire an understanding of how and why these products played such a critical role in the ongoing crisis. We will also lead students through the new financial sector reforms and discuss their direct or indirect impact on credit derivatives, and credit markets in general, going forward.    The course will include analysis of the Basel II Model, the implications of the standardized and internal-ratings-based (IRB) approaches and issues relating to their implementation. New models and approaches will be analyzed including KMV, Creditmetrics, and so-called reduced-forms credit risk measurement models.     Financial Crises: Causes, Consequences and Remedies - Viral Acharya  This course helps students understand what caused the recent mortgage and sovereign debt crises in the Western economies; why regulation failed given its static nature and misplaced focus on individual firms rather than the system as a whole; and, what financial sector reforms are being undertaken to address these causes of crises and regulatory flaws. Will these new reforms succeed? Or do they continue to leave \"shadow banking\" in shadows? And will new forms of shadow banking emerge as regulatory arbitrage, perpetuating a new cycle of financial innovations and crises?    See NYU Stern's Global Systemic Risk Rankings and related research.     Risk and Structured Finance - Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh  This course provides students with an improved understanding of developments in securitization and structured credit risk transfer, with special emphasis on the recent credit market disruptions and the changes in regulation under consideration.    In addition to covering risk transfer through asset-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, the course explains risk transfer using credit derivatives and synthetic asset securitization. Given its prominence among structured products today, special emphasis is placed on mortgage-backed securities. The new techniques open up fresh possibilities for the transfer, pricing and management of credit risk.    See Center for Real Estate Finance Research for NYU Stern's work in this area.  MSRM Class of 2012 Capstone: Strategic Mortgage Default in Financial Institutions: a Proposal for an Alternative Management         Liquidity Risk - Bruce Tuckman  Liquidity is the ability of a firm to meet its cash obligations from a combination of existing cash reserves, asset sales, and new borrowing. Liquidity risk management, then, is the art of balancing the existential danger of being caught without enough liquidity against the costs of maintaining liquidity.    While liquidity risk management has always been essential for financial firms, the spectacular and fatal losses of liquidity during the financial crisis of \u201807-\u201909 have greatly increased the focus of managers, regulators, and even the general public on this important branch of risk management.    This unit begins by explaining the challenges of liquidity risk management, i.e., how various financial firms face uncertainties with respect to the stability of funding sources and the liquidity of assets, which can be mitigated to varying degress at varying costs. Several cases will then illustrate the practice, and sometimes failure, of liquidity risk management in specific settings. The unit will conclude with a survey of techniques used to measure, model, and manage liquidity risk, including those recently mandated by national and international regulators.     Corporate and Sovereign Bankruptcy, Distressed Investing and Restructuring - Edward Altman  Professor Altman explores with MSRM students his thoughts on current conditions and outlook for Global Corporate and Sovereign Debt Markets and strategies for investing in distressed firms and their securities. His well known Z-Score family of models will be analyzed for investment and restructuring strategies as well as updated statistics on rating equivalents and default/recovery rates.               Module IV: Abu Dhabi    Operational Risk in Banking and Finance - Michael Pinedo  Here, the objective is to discuss Operational Risk in a more applied manner. The goal is that students will be able to get acquainted with concepts and ideas that are useful in their dealings with Operational Risk on a day-to-day basis in their groups or in their departments.     Risk Management in Global Corporate Finance - Massimo Massa   In this session, the goal is to understand the international dimension of risk and develop a framework to quantify it. We will consider how firms should hedge risk from a broad strategic perspective and zoom in on currency risk and, in particular, transaction, translation, and economic exposure. We will study when it makes sense to hedge financially and what types of contracts to consider. We then will go into detail on the link between currency risk and international financing, comparing domestic issues versus international issues, and hedged structures versus non-hedged alternatives. The different ways of hedging the currency exposure embedded in the bonds will be discussed.     Enterprise Risk and Corporate Governance - Ingo Walter  The mission here is to investigate the risks associated with strategic and tactical developments in financial and non-financial firms and their linkages to the reputational capital of the firm as it is embedded in share prices. Students will also examine the role of corporations, investors, intermediaries, and regulators in the events that preceded and followed the build-up and bursting of the financial bubble and consider key dimensions of corporate governance. The concepts will be illustrated through recent and classic case studies of situations of financial scandals.            Closing: NYU Stern - New York   Strategic Risk Capstone    The Strategic Risk Capstone requires students to build on their own professional experience and exposure to the academic content of the program to create a meaningful project that demonstrates their ability to take an integrated view of risk management in global finance. This could take a number of forms:       The global financial implications of a specific risk management technique, instrument, or market    The impact of risk management on the competitive positioning and strategic execution of firms (or a particular firm) in global financial markets and particular market segments    An in-house project to examine a key risk management issue of interest to that firm    An assessment of probable future directions in the development of specific instruments, techniques, or markets associated with risk management      Examples:       Does Risk Management Matter to Shareholders?       The authors of this paper pose a question that is central to any student devoting a year to studying risk management: Does it matter to shareholders? The authors develop a creative research design that allows them to test whether firms with more sophisticated risk management techniques have different characteristics (e.g. Tobin's Q, financial leverage, and stock return volatility) compared to firms with an unsophisticated approach to risk management. Their empirical analysis confirms that there are statistically significant differences between firms with sophisticated versus unsophisticated risk management practices as it pertains to Tobin's Q, financial leverage, and stock market volatility. Measured by these indicators, the authors conclude that risk management matters for certain operational parameters of the firm (leverage) and the resultant financial market outcomes (Tobin's Q and leverage).          A Framework for Operational Risk Mitigation       This paper attempts to develop a new framework, dubbed CRAM for Corporate Risk Adaptation Model, to identify firms with the likelihood of avoiding a catastrophic operational risk event, or surviving one if the event were to occur. CRAM relies on 4 categories of data (People, Process, Governance, and External) and 12 key factors that populate the categories. The authors draw on 5 case studies (WorldCom, MT Global, Toyota, Enron, and Marsh &amp; McLennan) to make an initial calibration of the model, but then include several other firms (Apple, Google, Starbucks, Mastercard) as a way to check whether the model classifies these successful companies as \u201cgood.\u201d          Systemic Risk Safeguards for Central Clearing Counterparties       The authors of this project have tackled a large and complex issue that stands in the foreground of the Dodd-Frank policy agenda. Dodd-Frank mandates a much larger role for central counterparties (CCPs) to handle the clearing and settlement of derivative transactions that historically were largely traded and cleared on a bilateral basis. Putting many eggs in a single basket clearly elevates the need to watch the basket. The authors of this project dissect various sources of capital that underlay a generic CCP, and then run a series of simulations subjecting the CCP to stress conditions in order to assess how many layers of the risk waterfall are impacted under different stress scenarios.          Corporate Risk Management Experiences During the 2008 Crisis       The project addressed how various firms, most of which were in the food sector and therefore heavily exposed to commodity price changes, responded to the financial turbulence of the 2008 crisis. The authors developed a common template of data, narrative, tables and charts to include for each of the seven companies in the sample. The sample included companies headquartered in the USA and Latin American, some primarily privately owned and others publicly held, and so offered a reasonable cross section of firms, some of which managed their way through the multitude of risks in the crisis and others of which succumbed by having to take on substantial new debt or bankruptcy.

Rangan            Prerequisites : Undergraduate linear     algebra.            Linear algebra is two things in one: a general methodology     for solving linear systems, and a beautiful abstract     structure underlying much of mathematics and the sciences.     This course will try to strike a balance between both. We     will follow the book of our own Peter Lax, which does a     superb job in describing the mathematical structure of     linear algebra, and complement it with applications and     computing. The most advanced topics include spectral theory,     convexity, duality, and various matrix decompositions.             Text : Lax, P.D. (2007).

Prerequisites : Elements of linear algebra and the     theory of rings and fields.            The objects of study in algebraic geometry are systems     defined by polynomial equations. Here are some examples:      1. x^2+y^2+z^2-w^2=0;      2. y^2=x^3-2x      3. x^2+y^2=u^2, x^2+z^2=v^2, y^2+z^2=w^2, x^2+y^2+z^2=t^2.            The first example gives a projective quadric; the second one     defines an elliptic curve. The rational solutions of the     third one provide a rectangular box such that the lengths of     the edges, face diagonals, and long diagonals are rational     numbers. The existence of such a solution is still not     known.            We will start this introductory course with some topics from     the commutative algebra, such as ideals in polynomial rings     and the famous Nullstellensatz theorem. We will also discuss     some projective geometry in dimension two. A large part of     the course will be devoted to the study of elliptic curves     over various fields: finite fields, fields of rational or     complex numbers. For elliptic curves defined over finite     fields we will discuss as well applications in cryptography.                                                                        MATH-GA     2170.001 INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY      3 points. Fall term.      Monday, 11:00-12:50, O. Regev.                 Prerequisites : Strong mathematical     background.            The primary focus of this course will be on definitions and     constructions of various cryptographic objects, such as     pseudo-random generators, encryption schemes, digital     signature schemes, message authentication codes, block     ciphers, and others time permitting. We will try to     understand what security properties are desirable in such     objects, how to properly define these properties, and how to     design objects that satisfy them. Once we establish a good     definition for a particular object, the emphasis will be on     constructing examples that provably satisfy the definition.     Thus, a main prerequisite of this course is mathematical     maturity and a certain comfort level with proofs. Secondary     topics that we will cover only briefly will be current     cryptographic practice and the history of cryptography and     cryptanalisys.

Prerequisites : (Serial) programming experience with     C/C++ or FORTRAN (C will mostly be used in class), and some     familiarity with numerical methods.           This class will be an introduction to the fundamentals of     parallel scientific computing. We will establish a basic     understanding of modern computer architectures (CPUs and     accelerators, memory hierarchies, interconnects) and of     parallel approaches to programming these machines (distributed     vs. shared memory parallelism: MPI, OpenMP, OpenCL). Issues     such as load balancing, communication, and synchronization     will be covered and illustrated in the context of parallel     numerical algorithms. Since a prerequisite for good parallel     performance is good serial performance, this aspect will also     be addressed. Along the way you will be exposed to important     tools for high performance computing such as debuggers,     schedulers, visualization, and version control systems.           This will be a hands-on class, with several parallel (and     serial) computing assignments, in which students can and will     have to explore material independently. Students will learn     some Unix in this course.           Text : Rauber, T., &amp; Runger, G. (2013). Parallel                   Programming for Multicore and Cluster Systems (2nd     ed.).

Prerequisites : Derivative     Securities, Scientific Computing, Computing for Finance, and     Stochastic Calculus.            The term \"statistical arbitrage\" covers any trading strategy     that uses statistical tools and time series analysis to     identify approximate arbitrage opportunities while     evaluating the risks inherent in the trades (considering the     transaction costs and other practical aspects). This course     starts with a review of Time Series models and addresses     econometric aspects of financial markets such as volatility     and correlation models. We will review several stochastic     volatility models and their estimation and calibration     techniques as well as their applications in volatility based     trading strategies. We will then focus on statistical     arbitrage trading strategies based on cointegration, and     review pairs trading strategies. We will present several key     concepts of market microstructure, including models of     market impact, which will be discussed in the context of     developing strategies for optimal execution. We will also     present practical constraints in trading strategies and     further practical issues in simulation techniques. Finally,     we will review several algorithmic trading strategies     frequently used by practitioners.

Fall Term             Prerequisites : Univariate statistics, multivariate     calculus, linear algebra, and basic computing (e.g.     familiarity with MATLAB or co-registration in Computing in     Finance).           A comprehensive introduction to the theory and     practice of portfolio management, the central component of     which is risk management. Econometric techniques are     surveyed and applied to these disciplines. Topics covered     include: factor and principal-component models, CAPM,     dynamic asset pricing models, Black-Litterman, forecasting     techniques and pitfalls, volatility modeling,     regime-switching models, and many facets of risk management,     both theory and practice.                 Spring Term                Risk Management is arguably one of the most     important tools for managing a trading book and quantifying     the effects of leverage and diversification (or lack     thereof).            This course is an introduction to risk-management techniques     for portfolios of (i) equities and delta-1 securities and     futures (ii) equity derivatives (iii) fixed income     securities and derivatives, including credit derivatives,     and (iv) mortgage-backed securities.            A systematic approach to the subject is adopted, based on     selection of risk factors, econometric analysis,     extreme-value theory for tail estimation, correlation     analysis, and copulas to estimate joint factor     distributions. We will cover the construction of     risk-measures (e,g. VaR and Expected Shortfall) and     historical back-testing of portfolios. We also review     current risk-models and practices used by large financial     institutions and clearinghouses.            If time permits, the course will also cover models for     managing the liquidity risk of portfolios of financial     instruments.

The second part     of the course will focus on the econometric issues     associated with portfolio optimization. Issues such as     estimation of returns, covariance structure, predictability,     and the necessary econometric techniques to succeed in     portfolio management will be covered. Readings will be drawn     from the literature and extensive class notes.                MATH-GA 2753.001 ADVANCED RISK     MANAGEMENT      3 points. Spring term.      Monday, 7:10-9:00, Instructor TBA.           Prerequisites : Derivative     Securities, Computing in Finance or equivalent programming.            The importance of financial risk management has been     increasingly recognized over the last several years. This     course gives a broad overview of the field, from the     perspective of both a risk management department and of a     trading desk manager, with an emphasis on the role of     financial mathematics and modeling in quantifying risk. The     course will discuss how key players such as regulators, risk     managers, and senior managers interact with trading.     Specific techniques for measuring and managing the risk of     trading and investment positions will be discussed for     positions in equities, credit, interest rates, foreign     exchange, commodities, vanilla options, and exotic options.     Students will be trained in developing risk sensitivity     reports and using them to explain income, design static and     dynamic hedges, and measure value-at-risk and stress tests.     Students will create Monte Carlo simulations to determine     hedge effectiveness. Extensive use will be made of examples     drawn from real trading experience, with a particular     emphasis on lessons to be learned from trading disasters.             Text : Allen, S.L. (2003).

MATH-GA 2797.001 CREDIT MARKETS     AND MODELS      3 points. Fall term.      Wednesday, 7:10-9:00, Instructor TBA.           Prerequisites : Computing in     Finance (or equivalent), Derivative Securities (or     equivalent), familiarity with analytical methods applied to     interest rate derivatives.            This course addresses a number of practical issues concerned     with modeling, pricing and risk management of a range of     fixed-income securities and structured products exposed to     default risk. Emphasis is on developing intuition and     practical skills in analyzing pricing and hedging problems.     In particular, significant attention is devoted to credit     derivatives.            We begin with discussing default mechanism and its     mathematical representation. Then we proceed to building     risky discount curves from market prices and applying this     analytics to pricing corporate bonds, asset swaps, and     credit default swaps. Risk management of credit books will     be addressed as well. We will next examine pricing and     hedging of options on assets exposed to default risk.            After that, we will discuss structural (Merton-style) models     that connect corporate debt and equity through the firm\u2019s     total asset value. Applications of this approach include the     estimation of default probability and credit spread from     equity prices and effective hedging of credit curve     exposures.            A final segment of the course will focus on credit     structured products. We start with cross-currency swaps with     a credit overlay. We will next analyze models for pricing     portfolio transactions using Merton-style approach. We also     will discuss portfolio loss model based on a transition     matrix approach. These models will then be applied to the     pricing of collateralized debt obligation tranches and     pricing counterparty credit risk taking wrong-way exposure     into account.

The first addresses     the fixed-income models most frequently used in the finance     industry, and their applications to the pricing and hedging     of interest-based derivatives. The second part covers the     foreign exchange derivatives markets, with a focus on     vanilla options and first-generation (flow) exotics.     Throughout both parts, the emphasis is on practical aspects     of modeling, and the significance of the models for the     valuation and risk management of widely-used derivative     instruments.

Prerequisites : Knowledge of PDE,     complex analysis, numerical methods, and experience in     programming are strongly recommended.            This course will be an introduction to several numerical     methods known as \"fast analysis-based algorithms,\" including     fast multiple methods, butterfly algorithms, hierarchical     matrix compression and fast direct solvers. These     algorithms can be used to solve many of the PDE governing     classical mathematical physics, namely electromagnetics,     acoustics, heat diffusion, and fluid dynamics. There are     additional applications in signal processing and data     analysis. Methods from potential theory, applied     analysis, functional analysis, numerical linear algebra,     complex analysis, and asymptotic analysis are central to the     construction of almost all such algorithms.            Grading will be based on a course project.                MATH-GA     2830.003 ADVANCED TOPICS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS (Convex     Duality in Math Finance)      3 points. Fall term.

Spring term.      Monday, 1:25-3:15, C.      Fernandez-Granda .             Prerequisites : Basic knowledge of probability and     linear algebra.             In recent years, optimization-based techniques have had     a major impact in two areas of data analysis: inverse     problems and statistical estimation in high-dimensional     spaces. The main principle underlying these techniques is to     exploit nonparametric prior knowledge about the data by     solving tractable optimization problems. Some representative     examples include sparse regression analysis of genomic data,     compressed sensing in medical imaging and signal processing,     and low-rank models in recommender systems and computer     vision. This course provides an introduction to     optimization-based methods by describing the theoretical     tools used to analyze them, the computational algorithms     developed to implement them and some of their main     applications. The course will start with a brief     introduction to basic concepts in convex optimization. Class     materials will be posted online .

Tuesday, 9:00-10:50, D. Giannakis .           This course serves as an introduction to     the fundamentals of geophysical fluid dynamics. No prior     knowledge of fluid dynamics will be assumed, but the course     will move quickly into the subtopic of rapidly rotating,     stratified flows. Topics to be covered include (but are not     limited to): the advective derivative, momentum conservation     and continuity, the rotating Navier-Stokes equations and     non-dimensional parameters, equations of state and     thermodynamics of Newtonian fluids, atmospheric and oceanic     basic states, the fundamental balances (thermal wind,     geostrophic and hydrostatic), the rotating shallow water     model, vorticity and potential vorticity, inertia-gravity     waves, geostrophic adjustment, the quasi-geostrophic     approximation and other small-Rossby number limits, Rossby     waves, baroclinic and barotropic instabilities, Rayleigh and     Charney-Stern theorems, geostrophic turbulence. Students     will be assigned bi-weekly homework assignments and some     computer exercises, and will be expected to complete a final     project. This course will be supplemented with out-of-class     instruction.             Recommended Texts : Vallis, G.K. (2006).

Tuesday, 1:25-3:15, O.     Pauluis .           What effects the large scale circulation of the     atmosphere? Like the antiquated heating system of     a New York apartment, solar radiation unevenly warms the     Earth, leading to gradients in energy in both altitude and     latitude. But unlike the simple convection of air in     your drafty home, the effects of rotation, stratification, and     moisture lead to exotic variations in weather and climate,     giving us something to chat about over morning coffee... and     occasionally bringing modern life to a standstill.           The goals of this course are to describe and understand the     processes that govern atmospheric fluid flow, from the Hadley     cells of the tropical troposphere to the polar night jet of     the extratropical stratosphere, and to prepare you for     research in the climate sciences. Building on your     foundation in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, we will explore how     stratification and rotation regulate the atmosphere's response     to gradients in heat and moisture. Much of our work will     be to explain the zonal mean circulation of the atmosphere,     but in order to accomplish this we\u2019ll need to learn a great     deal about deviations from the zonal mean: eddies and     waves. It turns out that eddies and waves, planetary,     synoptic (weather system size) and smaller in scale, are the     primary drivers of the zonal mean circulation throughout much,     if not all, of the atmosphere.           There will also be a significant numerical modeling component     to the course. You will learn how to run an atmospheric     model on NYU's High Performance Computing facility, and then     design and conduct experiments to test the theory developed in     class for a final course project.

Amidst the shouting over climate change and what action should     be taken about it, this course seeks to focus in on the     science of climate prediction. We will work our way through     the components of state-of-the-art climate models, endeavoring     to understand, or at least appreciate, the science and     approximations that lie behind predictions of future climate     change. The course will proceed in seminar format.     Participants will be expected to read background material on     climate models and complete a research oriented project,     running and/or analyzing the output from an IPCC class climate     model. No experience in climate modeling is required, but a     basic knowledge of fluid dynamics and physics will help.           Our goal is to work through the key components of a climate     model. The Earth\u2019s climate is determined by interactions     between the atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere (ice sheets,     glaciers, sea ice) and land surfaces (terrestrial hydrology,     biology, etc.). This course will be biased towards the     atmospheric component of a climate model, but we will seek to     understand how interactions between the atmosphere and the     other elements of the climate system are represented in     models.

Monday, 9:00-10:50, Y.                        Bakhtin .            Prerequisites: Probability: Limit Theorems I (or the     equivalent knowledge of probability and measure theory)            No knowledge of ergodic theory, dynamical systems, or Markov     processes will be assumed (although acquaintance with those     subjects will make the course more meaningful). A     significant amount of time in this course will be devoted to     material that may be viewed as preparatory.            To understand the behavior of a deterministic or random     dynamical system, it is often useful to find and study     stationary regimes or invariant distributions, since they     govern long-term statistical properties of the system. From     this point of view, existence and uniqueness of invariant     distributions and, more generally, description of all     invariant distributions along with convergence to     equilibrium become important questions that this course will     be centered around.            The course will begin with a discussion of deterministic     dynamics, then proceed to Markov processes and random     dynamics. The state space for Markov processes will be     consecutively assumed to be finite, countable, finite     dimensional, infinite dimensional, and appropriate methods     and notions will be discussed such as compactness,     Krylov--Bogolyubov method, coupling, regularity conditions     of minorization type, Doeblin and Harris conditions, strong     Feller property, Lyapunov functions, asymptotic strong     Feller property, asymptotic coupling, one force -- one     solution principle. In the end of this course, these notions     will be applied to stochastic PDEs such as stochastic     Navier--Stokes system and stochastic Burgers equation.
