If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

Let me set the scene for you: I was only six years old Read More                                                                                                                                                                                                    2                                                April 13, 2015                         Beau Benson                                                                Staff Blogger                                        My Week in Shanghai                                    Last week I found myself on a plane to Shanghai a couple days after finishing up the review process for freshman applicants here in New York. To say I was excited to travel to China to see NYU Shanghai for the first time would be an understatement (my colleague and I had a countdown on his phone for months!) and the experience did not disappoint.

Maybe it\u2019s because I studied dance for a long time, but there is something about jumping that is just SO FUN.

Decisions will be sent via email and not posted on our website. \u00a0Applicants each year hunt throughout our NYU Home website (and NYU Albert student information system) looking for evidence that a decision has been made. \u00a0No such decision has been made on your application until you have an email with that decision.   2. On Friday, March 28, we also expect to mail packets of information (and official admission letters) to all admitted students. \u00a0Each of our campuses (New York, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai) has its own admit packet. \u00a0All will be mailed on Friday. \u00a0The only remaining decisions to be made and mailed after March 28 will be for Chinese nationals who have applied for admission to NYU Shanghai.   3. If you applied for financial aid (by completing a CSS Financial Aid PROFILE &#8211; and a FAFSA if applicable), you will be able to view your financial aid award sometime after 3pm (Eastern Standard Time) on Friday.   More than 52,000 students applied for admission to NYU this year &#8211; a record-breaking number. \u00a0As a result, much of the news we need to deliver on Friday will be hard. \u00a0We were truly humbled by the volume this year and honored to learn about so many students &#8211; their goals, their aspirations, etc. \u00a0Our admission committees thank you in advance for your patience and resilience &#8211; and we wish you all the best as you finalize your college search for the fall.                         21 Comments                Mr. Abbott, I am very excited. I don&#8217;t think I will be able to focus much until Friday, but I will be working hard until then. I feel as though I have worked very hard and tried my best, and that is all that I can do. I have followed this blog daily and stayed loyal to this school. I wish the very best to all of the applicants. Although I am unaware of whether or not you have noticed that I commented on all of your recent posts, I would appreciate if you could give this comment a read.   Looking back at my experience with college applications, I wish that I could have maybe had said more in my essay about why I truly want to attend NYU, but at the time, I didn&#8217;t know it was as important to me as it surely is now. I now know that NYU is my dream school. I have realized that New York City offers me everything I am looking for and more, and I know that I could go on to be extremely accomplished and be a notable alumnae in the industry of my choice if accepted. Although I am confident that my essay was strong, I now have even more to say about why I would be honored to attend NYU.   My high school experience didn&#8217;t go exactly as planned. I hit some road bumps with bullying and other issues that made it difficult for me to have the typical high school experience. Eventually, I switched to online school, overcame my obstacles, and learned SO much in the process. I am extremely glad I made the choice to attend an online high school, and I have tried to take strong AP classes within my curriculum available, but I do know that if I were at a brick and mortar school that I would surely be more competitive. However, I have worked as hard as I possibly could with the circumstances. I rigorously prepared for the SAT because I knew it was important to demonstrate my abilities and provide an accurate representation of my aptitude as an online school student.   If accepted to NYU I guarantee you I would be a notable alumnae. If possible, I would appreciate if someone could give my application one further review. I hope that this comment has made it clear some of the reasons why. I would be honored to attend. Ultimately the college application process has been a very unique and enriching journey and I have learned so much. I hope that this journey can conclude with my admission to NYU.                             Jennifer                   March 24, 2014                                                    Wow. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to get much sleep Friday night (due to the difference in time zones). I hope I get in.

While I was an exchange student in South Korea.  After graduating from high school in the top 1 percent.  When I was fifteen years old.   I speak English and Korean fluently, Spanish very well, and I&#8217;m conversational in French and Chinese. I was on the most challenging curriculum possible at my school, and I took 16 classes -in Korean, mind you- while I was abroad.   I was heavily involved in many many extracurricular activities inside and outside of school (4 years of theater, church band, choir, dance, taekwondo, academic honor society, quiz bowl, etc) AND I worked two jobs. My recommendation letters were fantastic. My record was squeaky clean. And I was absolutely, madly in love with NYU Gallatin.   And. I. Got. Rejected.   Excuse me but&#8230; what?   Just&#8230; What?   Pray tell, what does it take to get in to college these days?? I&#8217;m sorry, but I know that I deserved admission. This is absolute nonsense.

Applicants each year hunt throughout our NYU Home website (and NYU Albert student information system) looking for evidence that a decision has been made. No such decision has been made on your application until you have an email with that decision.                             subarjo                   April 8, 2014                                                        what is the % that NY accepts out of the 52,000 that applied?  thank you!

I was wondering if anyone got any merit scholarship information yet? Like the presidential honors scholar of the honors program? Or does that come separately after acceptance?
