[{"detail": [{"content": "CHAPTER 4                         SOCIAL CLASS AND EDUCATIONAL EQUALITY      Caroline Hodges Persell 2003            Picture  three babies born at the same time, but to parents of different social-class  backgrounds. The first baby is born into a wealthy, well-educated, business or  professional family. The second is born into a middle-class family in which  both parents attended college and have middle-level managerial or social  service jobs. The third is born into a poor family in which neither parent  finished high school or has a steady job. Will these children receive the same  education? Although the United   States is based on the promise of  equal opportunity for all people, the educational experiences of these three  children are likely to be quite different.      Education  in the United States is not a single, uniform system that is available  to every child in the same way. Children of different social classes are likely  to attend different types of schools, to receive different types of  instruction, to study different curricula, and to leave school at different  rates and times. As a result, when children end their schooling, they differ  more than when they entered, and these differences may be used by society in an  effort to legitimate adult inequalities. If we understand better how schools  may help construct inequalities, we may be in a better position to try to  change them.      The nature and meaning of social class are issues  often debated by social scientists. U.S. researchers often measure social class by asking  survey questions about a person's or a family's educational level, occupation,  rank in an organization, and earnings. A few have tried to included measures  of wealth such as home ownership or other assets. Several features of social  class in the United States are worth special mention. Social class inequality  is greater in the United   States than in any other industrial or post-industrial  society in the world. Germany , Japan , Italy , France , Switzerland , England , Sweden , the Netherlands , you name it, all have considerably less social  class inequality than the United   States . The countries with the least amount of class-based  educational inequality are Sweden and the Netherlands , and they are also the countries where a familys  social class background is less related to their childrens school achievement  (Blossfield and Shavit, 1993). Furthermore, income inequality has widened in the U.S. during the last  twenty years, increasing inequality among children as well (Lichter &amp;  Eggebeen, 1993; Mayer 2001). The growing economic inequality in the U. S. affects how much education people  receive. In states with bigger  gaps between high and low income families (i.e., more income inequality), young  people who grow up in high-income families obtain more education and children  in low-income families obtain less education, compared to states with smaller  gaps between high and low income families, where family income is not so  strongly related to the amount of education the children obtain (Mayer, 2001).  The explanation for these differences seems to be more state spending for  schooling and higher economic returns to schooling in states with higher income  inequality (Mayer, 2001). At the  same time, the U.S. has an historical belief in opportunity for all,  regardless of their social origins.      This  paradox of great and growing inequality and the belief in opportunity for all  creates a special problem for the United   States , namely the &quot;management  of ambition&quot; (Brint and Karabel, 1989, p. 7). Many more people aspire to  high paying careers than can actually enter them. One result has been the  growth of educational credentialism (Collins, 1979), which means that more and  more education is required for all jobs, especially professional and managerial  occupations. This means that education is playing an ever-increasing role in  the process of sorting people into their highly unequal adult positions. This  sorting does not happen randomly, however.      Social  class has been consistently related to educational success through time  (Coleman, Campbell, Hobson, McPartland, Mood, Weinfeld &amp; York, 1966; Gamoran  2001; Goldstein, 1967; Grissmer, Kirby, Berends, &amp; Williamson, 1994;  Hanson, 1994; Mare, 1981; Mayeske &amp; Wisler, 1972; Persell 1977). Although  there are a number of exceptions, students from higher social-class backgrounds  tend to get better grades and to stay in school longer than do students from  lower-class backgrounds. The question is, why does this happen? Does the  educational system contribute to the widening of educational results over time?  If so, how and what might change it? I argue that three features of American  education affect educational inequalities:            1.  The structure of schooling in the United   States      2.  The beliefs held by many members of U.S. society and hence by many educators      3.  Teachers, curriculum, and teaching practices in U.S. schools            The   structure of schooling refers to such features as differences between  urban rural, and suburban schools, and differences between public and private  schools. Educational beliefs includes beliefs about IQ (intelligence  quotient) and testing. Teachers,  Curriculum, and teaching practices include  teacher training and recruitment, tracking of students into certain curricula,  teachers' expectations about what different children can learn, and differences  in the quantity and quality of what is taught.      This  chapter reviews research showing differences in educational structures,  beliefs, and practices; examines how these differences are related to the  social-class backgrounds of students, considers the consequences they have for  student achievement; and analyzes how they affect individuals' adult lives.  Lest this be too depressing an account, at the end of the chapter I suggest  some ways that teachers, other educators, and parents might work to improve  education.            EDUCATIONAL  STRUCTURES      The  three babies described above are not likely to attend the same school, even if  they live in the same area. Most students in the United States attend  schools that are relatively alike with respect to the social-class backgrounds  of the other students. One reason this happens is that people in the United States tend to live in areas that are fairly similar with respect to class  and race. If they attend their neighborhood school, they are with students from  similar backgrounds. If children grow up in a fairly diverse area such as a  large city, mixed suburb, or rural area, they are less likely to attend the  same schools. The states with the most private schools, for example, are the  states with the largest concentrations of urban areas (Coleman, Hoffer &amp;  Kilgore, 1982). If, by chance, students of different backgrounds do attend the  same school, they are very likely to experience different programs of study  because of tracking and ability grouping.      In  older suburbs or cities, children of higher-class families are more likely to  attend homogeneous neighborhood schools, selective public schools, or private  schools, and to be in higher tracks; lower-class children are also likely to  attend school together. Middle-class families try to send their children to  special public schools, parochial schools, or private schools if they can  afford them.      Private  day and boarding schools are also relatively similar with respect to social  class, despite the fact that some scholarships are awarded. Researchers who  studied elite boarding schools, for example, found that 46 percent of the  families had incomes of more than $100,000 per year in the early 1980s (Cookson  &amp; Persell, 1985). This is undoubtedly true of many more than half the  families today.      Let's  look more closely at elite private schools and exclusive suburban schools,  which are overwhelmingly attended by upper- and upper-middle-class students; at  parochial schools, attended by middle-class and working-class students, and at  large urban public schools, heavily attended by lower-class pupils. Although  these descriptions gloss over many distinctions within each major type of  school, they do convey some of the range of differences that exist under the  overly broad umbrella we call U.S. education.            Schools  of the Upper and Upper-Middle Classes       At most upper- and upper-middle-class high  schools, the grounds are spacious and well kept, the computer, laboratory,  language, and athletic facilities are extensive, the teachers are well educated  and responsive to students and parents, classes are small, nearly every student  studies a college preparatory curriculum, and considerable homework is  assigned.      At  the private schools, these tendencies are often intensified. The schools are  quite small, with few having more than 1,200 students. Teachers do not have  tenure or belong to unions, so they can be fired by the headmaster or  headmistress if they are considered unresponsive to students or parents.  Classes are small, often having no more than fifteen students, and sometimes  fewer. Numerous advanced placement courses offer the possibility of college  credit. Students remark that it is &quot;not cool to be dumb around here.&quot;  (Cookson &amp; Persell, 1985, p. 95). Most students watch very little  television during the school week and do a great deal of homework (Cookson  &amp; Persell, 1985, p. 95). They have many opportunities for extracurricular  activities, such as debate and drama clubs, publications, and music, and the  chance to learn sports that colleges value, such as crew, ice hockey, squash,  and lacrosse. Research suggests that participating in one or more  extracurricular activities increases students' desire to attend school. Students  have both academic and personal advisors who monitor their progress, help them  solve problems, and try to help them have a successful school experience.      Affluent  suburban communities have a robust tax base to support annual costs that in the  2000s often exceeded $15,000 per pupil. School board members are elected by  members of the community who are likely to know them. Private schools are run  by self-perpetuating boards of trustees, many of whom are graduates of the  school. The school head is chosen by the board of trustees and may be replaced  by them if they are not satisfied.            Private  Parochial Schools       Many differences exist among parochial schools,  but in general these schools are also relatively small. More of the high school  students in them study an academic program and do more homework than do their  public-school peers. They also are subjected to somewhat stricter discipline  (Coleman, Hoffer &amp; Kilgore, 1982). The classes, however, are often larger  than elite private, suburban, or urban school classes, with sometimes as many  as forty or fifty pupils per class. Some non-Catholic middle- and working-class  parents, especially those in urban areas, send their children to parochial  schools (Coleman, Hoffer &amp; Kilgore).      The  costs at parochial schools are relatively low, especially compared to private  schools, because these schools are subsidized by religious groups. These  schools have relatively low teacher salaries and usually have no teachers'  unions. Currently there are more lay teachers and fewer nuns, sisters, priests,  and brothers as teachers. The schools are governed by the religious authority that  runs them.            Urban  Schools       Urban schools are usually quite large, and they  are part of an even larger school system that is invariably highly  bureaucratic. They usually offer varied courses of study, including academic,  vocational, and general curricular tracks. The school systems of large cities  and older, larger suburbs tend to lack both political and economic resources.  These systems are generally highly centralized, with school board members  generally elected on a citywide basis. School board members are often concerned  members of the community who may send their own children to private schools,  and they may have little knowledge about or power over the daily operations of  the public system. The authority of professional educators is often buttressed  by bureaucratic procedures and by unionization of teachers and administrators (Persell,  2000). Some observers (Rogers, 1968, and Rogers and Chung, 1983) have  described the system as one of organizational paralysis, rather than  governance.      Economically,  the large city school systems are also relatively powerless. Because schools are supported by  local property taxes, and because there is a great deal of housing segregation  by social class as well as race in the United States, students who live in  low-income areas are very likely to attend schools with lower per pupil  expenditures. Some schools with very high per pupil spending even raise  additional private funds to supplement the generous tax monies used to support  the school. Thus, they are able to provide additional educational enrichments  to the students attending such schools.      Unequal educational expenditures have  serious consequences for the condition of school buildings, libraries and  laboratories, computer equipment, the richness of curricular offerings, ability  to hire experienced and certified teachers, class size, and the variety of  extracurricular offerings. Such disparities in educational opportunities  affect how much children learn, how long they stay in school, their graduation  rates, and the rates at which they successfully pursue further education after  high school. While the question of whether money makes a difference in  educational achievement has been debated (Coleman et al., 1966 and Hanushek,  1989, 1996), more recent research has refined the question so as to see money  as a threshold condition that is necessary but not always sufficient for  achievement. How the money is spent certainly matters (Ellliott, 1998; Gamoran  et al., 2000; Wenglinsky, 1997). Expenditures need to be connected to opportunities  to learn effectively (Gamoran et al., 2000), to having good teachers (Darling-  Hammond, 1995), to inquiry-based teaching methods (Elliott, 1998), and to good  equipment, especially in the case of science (Elliott, 1998).      Because of the importance of funding  equity, 20 states in the U.S. have faced court challenges,  resulting in court decisions requiring them to provide all students with equal  access to quality schools. (Dively &amp; Hickrod, 1992; Times , 2002:  A18). Perhaps the most extensive and bitterly contested of these suits is  Abbott v. Burke in New   Jersey , brought in  1981. This case produced eight court rulings, ordering equal funding in urban  and suburban schools, a high-quality preschool program for poor districts, and  standards-based reforms to close the achievement gap between rich and poor  students. After years of delay, in January 2002, newly-elected New Jersey  Governor James McGreevey announced that he would abide by the courts rulings.  This court case has been described by some as perhaps the most significant  education case since the Supreme Courts desegregation ruling nearly 50 years  ago ( Times , 2002: A18). It affects 30 underprivileged districts in the  state and may have implications for other states facing such court challenges.      In  general, then, a child's social-class background is related to the school  attended, the size of the school, the political and economic resources  available to the school, the curricula offered, and the ensuing educational  opportunities (Persell, Cookson, &amp; Catsambis, 1992).   EDUCATIONAL BELIEFS       Since the last century ideas about testing students  have permeated education. For decades the concept of measuring intelligence,  or IQ testing, played a major role in education. The concept of IQ has been used to explain why  some children learn more slowly than others, why African American children do  less well in school than White children, and why lower-class children do less  well than middle- and upper-middle-class children. The latest example of this  argument is the highly controversial book, The Bell Curve , by Richard  Herrnstein and Charles Murray (1994). IQ tests are often used to justify  variations in education, achievement, and rewards. The justification usually is  that because some people are more intelligent than others, they are entitled to  more opportunities, rewards, including curricular track placement and exposure  to special educational programs and resources.       Critics of IQ tests have raised a number of good  points about the accuracy of the tests. For example, IQ tests do not measure  such important features of intelligence as creative or divergent thinking,  logic, and critical reasoning. The idea of multiple intelligences is well  developed by Howard Gardner in his book Frames of Mind ( Gardner ,  1983). Stephen Jay Gould's The Mismeasure of Man (1981) may still be  the single best critical analysis of IQ tests.            In the last several decades,  increasing emphasis has been placed on the use of large-scale achievement  tests. This so-called high-stakes testing has been used as the basis for  deciding the educational track to which students are assigned, determining  whether a student moves to the next grade in school, and whether a student  graduates from high school. Such tests may also be used to hold educators,  schools, and school districts accountable. The focus here is on how the use of  tests affects individuals, and whether it is discriminatory or unfair for  students of different social class backgrounds.      The purposes of using such tests  include setting high standards for student learning and raising student  achievement. However, when some students do poorly on a test, schools and  teachers can respond in several different ways. They can work harder with the  students obtaining low scores, providing them with more personal attention,  tutoring, and additional learning experiences in an effort to improve their  achievement test scores. Such responses usually require additional resources,  which many schools, especially ones that are already underfunded, may not  have. Another possible response is that schools try to get rid of students  with lower scores, by encouraging them to drop out or transfer, or through  other means. This is clearly an unintended consequence of high stakes testing,  and one that impacts most severely on the most educationally needy and  vulnerable students. One set of researchers has observed that the educational  achievement gaps between poor and rich students are larger in states with more  extensive student testing programs, and that student accountability decreases  opportunities for learning for all students (Schiller and Muller, 2002). More  research is needed on how schools respond to accountability (Schiller and  Muller, 2002).      In 1997, the U.S. Congress asked the  National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study and make written  recommendations on appropriate methods that would ensure that tests are not  used in a discriminatory manner or inappropriately for student promotion,  tracking or graduation (Heubert &amp; Hauser, 1999, p. 7). Among the  committees recommendations are the following:            Because a test score is not exact, high-stakes educational  decisions should not be made solely or automatically on the basis of a single  test score but should also take other relevant information into account such  as grades, developmental factors, attendance, and teacher recommendations (p.  6).            Tests should be used for high-stakes decisions about  individual mastery only after implementing changes in teaching and curriculum  that ensure that students have been taught the knowledge and skills on which  they will be tested (p. 6). In other words, students should not be tested  until they have been taught the content.            Everyone involved in education, including parents, educators,  and public officials, should understand the nature and interpretation of test  scores (p. 5).            Students who receive low test scores should be offered a  range of alternatives, such as effective remedial education, not just an  either-or consequence of social promotion or grade repetition. [1]             Appropriate test use carries over to appropriate student  preparation. Students should not see test items in advance, nor should  teaching be narrowly geared to just what is on the test, without improving the  broader set of academic skills that the test is intended to measure (p. 7)            Students with disabilities and English-language learners  require special consideration to ensure validity and fairness.            Finally, there is a need for research on whether using  particular tests is educationally beneficial for studentsfor example, by  increasing academic achievement or reducing dropout rates. (p. 8)            Historically, IQ tests were used by  teachers and schools to explain why racial/ethnic minority and low-income  students were not performing as well as majority and higher income students. I  find it very interesting that the states with the largest percentages of  racial/ethnic minority students are also more likely to have the most  articulated standards for student achievement (based on data in U.S. Bureau of  the Census and The State of State Standards 2000 ), while states with  lower percentages of racial/ethnic minority students have been slower to jump  onto the high-stakes testing bandwagon.      TEACHERS, CURRICULUM, AND TEACHING PRACTICES            The relatively recent growth of  high-stakes testing may deflect attention from essential features of schools  that affect learning. Educational equity requires that we examine not only the  educational funding, but what that funding is used for and how it affects  education. Three features of schools highlight how students educational  experiences vary depending on their social class, specifically the teachers  they get, curricular tracking, and teachers expectations.            Teachers      Schools with more low income students  are more likely to have teachers who are not certified at all, or who are  teaching out of their area of certification (Ingersoll, 1999). Large shortages  of certified teachers in such major urban areas as New York City in recent years have led to several  changes. The Schools Chancellor developed an alternative, abbreviated path to  temporary certification, aimed at career-changers and recent college graduates  with no teaching experience. The alternative path to provisional certification  involves a month of intensive education courses. At the end of this time, they  are placed in the 100 lowest-performing schools from the prior year. About 30  percent of the new certified teachers in the fall of 2002 in New York City had this alternative certification.  In addition, New York and other cities received recruits  from Teach for America , a non-profit organization that  recruits college graduates, provides a summer of intensive training, and places  them in troubled schools.      Like New York , many school districts around the country, including Los Angeles , Atlanta , and Washington , DC have alternative certification programs in an effort to address the  shortage of qualified teachers. However, there is considerable debate over the  abbreviated training that alternative route certification involves. Some, for  example Arthur Levine, President of Teachers College at Columbia University,  point out that the definition of a certified teacher has been reclassified, but  the net result is that we will still have large numbers of students this fall  whose teachers are unprepared to teach them (Goodnough, 2002). On the other  hand, Rod Paige, the U.S. Secretary of Education, has dismissed the  pedagogical course work offered by schools of educationlike Teachers Collegeas  cumbersome and often ineffective (Goodnough, 2002: B3). Research by Gomez and  Grobe (1990, cited in Darling-Hammond, 1995: 472) finds that alternative-route  teacher candidates had more uneven performance ratings compared to trained  beginners, particularly in the area of classroom management and in their  knowledge of instructional techniques. Their students, in turn, scored  significantly lower in language arts, compared to students of fully prepared  beginning teachers, when students initial achievement levels were held  constant (Gomez and Grobe, 1990, cited in Darling-Hammond 1995: 472).      As Darling-Hammond notes, policy  makers have nearly always answered the problem of teacher shortages by lowering  standards, so that people who have had little or no preparation for teaching  can be hired, (1995: 471). It is notable that this issue does not surface in  more affluent, suburban public schools, because they have very low percentages  of teachers who are not certified or are teaching outside their areas of  certification (Ingersoll, 1999). One reason that such areas can attract and  retain certified teachers better than inner city schools is that they pay  higher salaries on the average.      In 2002, New York City improved its ability to attract more  certified teacher applicants as well as those with alternative certification because  it raised the starting salaries of entry-level teachers from $31,910 to  $39,000. They also raised the maximum yearly salary that certified teachers  hired from other districts could initially earn from $43,370 to nearly  $61,000. In 1986, Connecticut also solved its teacher shortage by  dramatically raising and equalizing beginning teacher salaries (Darling-Hammond,  1995, p. 477).      The question will be whether New York or other urban school systems can  retain the new teachers they have hired. Teacher turnover rates are much  higher in low-income and urban school districts than in more affluent areas  (Darling-Hammond, 1990, 1992; Grissmer &amp; Kirby, 1987; Wise et al., 1987).  Thus, teacher mentoring, professional development, and support remain important  issues to address if educational equality is to be achieved. The effective  professional development of teachers has been found to enhance student learning  (Gamoran et al. 2000).      Teachers, however, work within  educational structures that contribute to unequal learning opportunities. This  is especially true of the educational practice of tracking.      Tracking      The  first recorded instance of tracking was the Harris plan in St. Louis ,  begun in 1867. Since then, tracking has followed a curious pattern in the United States of alternate popularity and disuse. In the 1920s and 1930s, when  many foreign immigrants settled in the United   States , tracking increased greatly.  Thereafter, it fell into decline until the late 1950s, when it was revived,  apparently in response to the USSR's launching of Sputnik and the United  States' competitive concern with identifying and educating the gifted (Conant,  1961; Oakes, 1985). That period was also marked by large migrations of rural  southern African Americans to northern cities and by an influx of Puerto Rican  and Mexican American migrants into the United   States . Tracking is much more extensive in U.S. schools than in most other countries.  (Darling-Hammond 1995, p. 474). This observation prompts us to ask why this is  the case. There are two differences between the U.S. and European countries that might account for the difference. The U.S. has more racial and economic inequality than European  countries, and educational achievement and attainment are more important for a  persons (more unequal) occupation, earnings, and other life chances in the U.S. than in European countries.      Tracking  today is widespread, particularly in large, diverse school systems and in schools  serving primarily lower-class students. It is less prevalent, and less rigid  when it occurs, in upper-middle-class suburban and private schools and in  parochial schools (Jones, Vanfossen &amp; Spade, 1985). Schools with more low-income students  have smaller academic tracks and larger remedial and vocational programs, while  schools serving affluent students may have only academic tracks and no  vocational or remedial programs (Oakes, 1992:13). Differences in the courses  students take, especially in such areas as mathematics, science, and foreign  language go a long way toward explaining differences in achievement test scores  (Darling-Hammond 1995:473).      What  exactly is tracking? To address this question, we need to examine the  distinction between ability grouping and curriculum differentiation. Proponents  of ability grouping stress flexible subject-area assignment. By this they mean  that students are assigned to learning groups on the basis of their background  and achievement in a subject area at any given moment, and that skills and  knowledge are evaluated at relatively frequent intervals. Students showing  gains can be shifted readily into another group. They might also be in  different ability groups in different subjects, according to their own rate of growth  in each subject. This practice suggests a common curriculum shared by all  students, with only the mix of student abilities being varied. It also assumes  that, within that curriculum, all groups are taught the same material.      In  fact, it seems that group placement becomes self-perpetuating, that students  are often grouped at the same level in all subjects, and that even a shared  curriculum may be taught differently to different groups. This is especially  likely to happen in large, bureaucratic, urban public schools. Quite often,  different ability groups are assigned to different courses of study, resulting  in simultaneous grouping by curriculum and ability. Rosenbaum notes that  although ability grouping and curriculum grouping may appear different to educators,  in fact they share several social similarities: (1) Students are placed with  those defined as similar to themselves and are segregated from those deemed  different, (2) group placement is done on the basis of criteria such as  ability or postgraduate plans that are unequally esteemed. Thus, group  membership immediately ranks students in a status hierarchy, formally stating  that some students are better than others (Rosenbaum, 1976). Following  Rosenbaum, the general term of tracking is applied here to both types of  grouping (Rosenbaum, 1976).      On  what basis are students assigned to tracks? Three major criteria have been  noted in the literature: (1) standardized test scores; (2) teacher grades,  recommendations, or opinions about pupils; and (3) pupil race and socioeconomic  class. Test scores are usually based on large group-administered aptitude  tests, a method considered least valid by test-givers. Teacher opinions about  students may be influenced by test scores, pupil social class, or ethnicity, as  discussed below. Social class and ethnicity have been found in some research  studies to be directly related to track assignments as well, even when ability  and teacher recommendations were similar (Brookover, Leu &amp; Kariger, 1965;  Rist, 1970). This is  partly because of prior educational placements and experiences, partly due to  counselors advice (colored by their view of students futures), and partly  because parents are more likely to intervene effectively in tracking decisions  for higher social-class students (Darling-Hammond, 1995, 474).      Thus,  the social-class background of students is related to the prevalence of  tracking in the schools, to the nature of the available tracks, and to the ways  track assignments are made. Furthermore, while there is some relationship  between tested ability and track placement, it is highly imperfect (Dreeben  &amp; Barr, 1988; Pallas, Entwisle, Alexander, &amp; Stluka, 1994).      Once  students are assigned to different tracks, what happens to them? Researchers  suggest that tracking has effects through at least three mechanisms. These are  instructional, social, and institutional in nature, and all three may operate  together. The major instructional processes that have been observed to  vary according to track placement include the unequal allocation of educational  resources, the instruction offered, student teacher interactions, and  student-student interactions. Dreeben &amp; Barr (1988) found variations in  the content, pacing, and quantity of instruction in different tracks. Higher  ranked reading groups were taught more (and learned more) words than lower  ranked reading groups, according to Gamoran (1984, 1986). Hallinan studied  within class ability grouping in thirty-four elementary school classes. She  found that ability grouping affects the learning of students in higher and  lower groups because it influences their opportunities for learning, the  instructional climate, and the student aptitudes clustered in the different  groups. High-ability groups spend more time on tasks during class; that is,  more class time is devoted to actual teaching activities. Also, teachers use  more interesting teaching methods and materials. Finally, teachers hold higher  expectations, and the other students support learning more in the  higher-ability groups. As a result, the aptitude of students in the higher  groups tends to develop more than does the aptitude of students in the lower  group (Hallinan, 1987).      In  secondary schools, college-track students consistently receive better teachers,  class materials, laboratory facilities, field trips, and visitors than their  lower-track counterparts (Findley &amp; Bryan, 1975; Goodlad, 1984; Oakes,  1985; Rosenbaum, 1976; Schafer, Olexa &amp; Polk, 1973). Oakes observed that  teachers of high-track students set aside more time for student learning and  devoted more class time to learning activities. Fewer students in these classes  engaged in &quot; off-task&quot; activities (Oakes, 1985, p. 111). Oakes also  found that &quot;students are being exposed to knowledge and taught behaviors  that differ not only educationally but also in socially important ways.  Students at the top are exposed to the knowledge that is highly valued in our  culture, knowledge that identifies its possessors as 'educated.'&quot; (Oakes,  1985, p. 91-92). Similarly, those students are taught critical thinking,  creativity, and independence. Students at the bottom are denied access to these  educationally and socially important experiences (Oakes, 1985, p. 92).       Freiberg   (1970) found that higher-track students received more empathy, praise, and use  of their ideas, as well as less direction and criticism, than did lower-track  students. Oakes (1985) observed that teachers spent more time in low-track  classes on discipline and that students in those classes perceived their  teachers as more punitive than did students in high-track classes.       Socially, tracks may create settings that shape  students' self-esteem and expectations about academic performance. For  example, Rosenbaum (1976) reported that more than one-third of lower-track  (non-college) students mentioned &quot;blatant insults directed at them by  teachers and administrators 'Teachers are always telling us how dumb we are.'  One articulate general track student in that study reported that he sought  academic help from a teacher but was told that he was not smart enough to learn  the material. Several students reported that a lower-track student who asks a  guidance counselor for a change of classes is not only prevented from changing  but is also insulted for being so presumptuous as to make the request&quot; (Rosenbaum,  1976: 179-180). Rosenbaum was told by one teacher, &quot;You're wasting your  time asking these kids for their opinions. There's not an idea in any of their  heads.&quot; As the researcher notes, &quot;This comment was not expressed in  the privacy of the teacher's room; it was said at a normal volume in a quiet  classroom full of students!&quot; (p. 180).      Students  have been observed to pick up on the negative evaluations associated with lower  track placement. They may make fun of lower-track students, call them  unflattering names, or stop associating with them (Rosenbaum, 1976). Hence, a  major result of tracking is differential respect from peers and teachers, with  implications for both instruction and esteem.       Institutionally, tracking creates groups of  students who are understood by teachers and parents as having certain qualities  and capacities, above and beyond the actual skills they possess. The symbolic  value of track placement thus creates expectations in teachers and parents,  independent of student performance. These expectations affect placement in  subsequent levels of the educational system (Gamoran, 1984). Ability groups  limit teachers' perceptions of what grades are appropriate for students in  different tracks (Reuman, 1989). Both parents and teachers rated children in  higher reading groups as more competent and likely to do better in the future  than children in low reading groups, even when children's initial performance  levels and parents' prior beliefs about their children's abilities were held  constant (Pallas et al., 1994, p. 41). Further consequences of tracking  include segregation of students by social class and ethnicity, (Esposito, 1973;   Hobson v. Hansen , 1967; Racial and Social Isolation in the Schools ,  1969; Oakes, 1985) unequal learning by students in different tracks, (Findley  &amp; Bryan, 1970; Oakes, 1985; Rosenbaum, 1976; Shafer, Olexa &amp; Polk,  1973) and unequal chances to attend college (Alexander, Cook &amp; McDill,  1978; Alexander &amp; Eckland, 1975; Jaffe &amp; Adams, 1970; Rosenbaum, 1976;  Rosenbaum, 1980; Jones, Spade &amp; Vanfossen, 1987). The percentage of  students in an academic curriculum may be the single most significant  structural difference between different types of schools. Noncollege  preparatory programs may foreclose future opportunities for young persons by  failing to provide them with the courses or training necessary for admission to  institutions of higher education, or for pursuing particular college majors  (Hallinan, 1987).      Darling-Hammond suggests that  tracking persists because few teachers are prepared to manage heterogeneous  classrooms effectively (1995, p. 474). In  the 1980s, tracking came under considerable attack, and a movement toward  &quot;detracking&quot; gained support (Braddock and McParland, 1990; Oakes,  1985, 1992; Wheelock, 1992). But even when teachers have a strong ideology of de-tracking and have  succeeded in ending tracking in some communities, they have encountered serious  resistance and opposition from parents (Wells and Oakes, 1996). In their  three-year longitudinal case studies of 10 racially and socioeconomically  mixed secondary schools that were participating in detracking reform, Oakes and  her colleagues found that detracking is a highly normative and political  endeavor that confronts deeply held cultural beliefs, ideologies, and fiercely  protected arrangements of material and political advantage in local  communities (1997: 507). For example, being in an honors course confers  advantages in the competition for college admissions. Detracking was able to occur  when politically savvy teachers were able to involve powerful parents in  meaningful ways in the process of implementing it (Oakes et al. 1997: 506).      Teachers'  Expectations       Educational structures such as schools that are  socioeconomically homogeneous, growing use of standardized achievement tests, and  practices such as tracking go a long way toward shaping the expectations  teachers hold about students. Teacher training and textbooks have tended to  attribute educational failures to deficiencies in the children. Often, such  deficiencies are assumed to reside in the social characteristics of the pupils,  such as their social-class background, ethnicity, language, or behavior rather  than in social structure. In a review of relevant research, Persell found that  student social class was related to teacher expectations when other factors  such as race were not more salient, when expectations were engendered by real  children, or when teachers had a chance to draw inferences about a student's  social class rather than simply being told his or her background (Persell,  1977, pp. 105-107). Sometimes social class was related to teacher expectations  even when the child's current IQ and achievement were comparable. That is,  teachers held lower expectations for lower-class children than for middle-class  children even when those children had similar IQ scores and achievement.      Teachers'  expectations may also be influenced by the behavior and physical appearance of  the children (Ritts, Patterson, &amp; Tubbs, 1992). Social class may influence  teacher expectations directly or indirectly through test scores, appearance,  language style, speed of task performance, and behavior. All of these traits  are themselves culturally defined and are related to class position. Moreover,  teacher expectations are influenced more by negative information about pupil  characteristics than by positive data. It is important to know this because  much of the information teachers gain about low income children seems to be  negative.      Another  factor that may influence teacher expectations and pupil performance is the  operation of the cultural capital possessed by families of higher social  classes. As used here, the term cultural capital refers to the cultural  resources and assets that families bring to their interactions with school  personnel. By virtue of their own educational credentials and knowledge of  educational institutions, parents, especially mothers, are able to help their  children get the right teachers and courses and do extra work at home if necessary  (Baker &amp; Stevenson, 1986; Grissmer et al., 1994; Lareau, 1989; Useem,  1990).      If  teacher expectations are often influenced by the social class of students, do  those expectations have significant consequences for students? Research on this  question has produced seemingly contradictory results. The controversy began  with the publication of Pygmalion in the Classroom (Rosenthal &amp;  Jacobson, 1968). That book suggested that the expectations of classroom  teachers might powerfully influence the achievement of students. Hundreds of  studies on the possibility of &quot;expectancy effects&quot; have been  conducted since then (Cooper &amp; Good, 1983). One thing is clear: only  expectations that teachers truly believe are likely to affect their behaviors.      When  teachers hold higher expectations for pupils, how does this affect their  behavior? Their expectations seem to affect the frequency of interaction they  have with their pupils and the kinds of behaviors they show toward different  children. Teachers spend more time interacting with pupils for whom they have  higher expectations (Persell, 1977). For example, Brophy and Good (1970) found  that students for whom teachers held high expectations were praised more  frequently when correct and were criticized less frequently when wrong or unresponsive  than were pupils for whom teachers had low expectations.      Rosenthal  (1974) believes that teachers convey their expectations in at least four  related ways. He bases this judgment on his review of 285 studies of  interpersonal influence, including at least 80 in classrooms or other settings.  First, he sees a general climate factor, consisting of the overall warmth a  teacher shows to children, with more shown to high-expectancy students. Second,  he sees students for whom high expectations are held as receiving more praise  for doing something right than do students for whom low expectations are held.  Third, Rosenthal notes that high-expectancy students are taught more than are  low expectancy students. This is consistent with research by others and summarized  by Persell (1977). Fourth, Rosenthal indicates that expectancy may be affected  by a response opportunity factor. That is, students for whom the teacher has  higher expectations are called on more often and are given more chances to  reply, as well as more frequent and more difficult questions.      A  fifth way teachers convey their expectations, which Rosenthal does not mention  but which has been observed by others, is the different type of curricula  teachers may present to children for whom they have different expectations. One  study found that teachers report that they present completely different types  of economics to students of differently perceived abilities (Keddie, 1971).  Another study reported that teachers use more reading texts and more difficult  ones with the top reading group (Alpert, 1975). Clearly, there is evidence that  at least some teachers behave differently toward students for whom they hold  different expectations. The critical question remains: Do these expectations  and behaviors actually affect students? Do the students think differently about  themselves or learn more as a result of the expectations teachers hold? Therein  lies the heart of the &quot;Pygmalion effect&quot; controversy.      Students  report being aware of the different expectations teachers have for them, and  notice differences in the way teachers treat them. For example, students  studied by Ferguson (2001) reported that when they asked the teacher a question  they received only a brief one sentence reply, but when other students (for  whom the teacher had higher expectations) asked the same question, the teacher  spoke at length in response.      When  teachers hold definite expectations and when those expectations are reflected  in their behavior toward children, these expectations are related to student  cognitive changes, even when pupil IQ and achievement are controlled. Moreover,  negative expectations, which can be observed only in natural settings because  it is unethical to induce negative expectations experimentally, appear to have  even more powerful consequences than do positive expectation. Moreover,  socially vulnerable children (i.e., younger, lower-class, and minority  children) seem to be more susceptible to lower teacher expectations (Rosenthal  &amp; Jacobson, 1968).            CONSEQUENCES  OF SOCIAL CLASS AND EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY      This  profile of social-class differences in education in the United States is oversimplified, but considerable evidence suggests that the  general patterns described here do exist. Social-class backgrounds affect where  students go to school and what happens to them once they are there. As a  result, lower-class students tend to encounter less prepared teachers, are less  likely to be exposed to valued curricula, are taught less of whatever curricula  they do study, and are expected to do less work in the classroom and outside of  it. Hence, they learn less and are less well prepared for the next level of  education.      Although  students have many reasons for dropping out of school or for failing to  continue, their experiences in school may contribute to their desire to  continue or to quit. Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore found that 24 percent of  public high school students dropped out, compared to 12 percent of Catholic and  13 percent of other private school students (Coleman, Hoffer &amp; Kilgore,  1982). Social class is a more important cause of lost talent among U.S.   youth in the late high school and post-high school years than gender or race,  according to Hanson (1994).      Similarly,  college attendance depends on a number of factors, including access to the  necessary financial resources. Nevertheless, it is striking how differently  students at different schools fare. Graduation from a private rather than a  public high school is related to attending a four-year (rather than a two-year)  college, (Falsey &amp; Heyns, 1984) attending a highly selective college,  (Persell, Cookson, &amp; Catsambis, 1992) and earning higher income in adult  life (Lewis &amp; Wanner, 1979). Even within the same school, track placement  is related to college attendance (Alexander, Cook &amp; McDill, 1978; Alexander  &amp; McDill, 1976; Jaffe &amp; Adams, 1970; Rosenbaum, 1976; Rosenbaum, 1980).  College attendance, in turn, is related to the adult positions and earnings one  attains (Kamens, 1974; Tinto, 1980; Useem, 1984; Useem &amp; Karabel, 1986). In  1987, women college graduates aged thirty to thirty-four earned 83 percent more  than did women with a high school education, and the comparable premium for men  was 57 percent more (U.S. Department of Education, 1990, p. 52). Thus, educational  inequalities help create and legitimate economic and social inequalities.      However,  most educators do not want to enhance and legitimate social inequalities.  Therefore, it seems reasonable to ask, What can they do to try to change these  patterns?            RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR ACTION      Teachers,  educators, and concerned citizens might consider the following actions:      1.  Working politically and legally to increase the educational resources available  to all children, not just those in wealthy school districts, and not just the  gifted and talented. Those concerned might do this by joining a political party  that works to advance the interests of the less advantaged members of society,  by attending political meetings, by holding candidates accountable for their  positions on education, and by supporting class action lawsuits for educational  equity. We can join other people interested in scrutinizing candidates' records  of support for education, and contribute time, money, or both to the campaigns  of candidates seeking to defeat incumbents who have not supported quality  education for all children.      2.  Working to reduce economic inequalities in society. This can be done by  supporting income-tax reforms at the national level that benefit hard-working  low- and middle-income families, by opposing tax cuts for the rich, by  supporting job programs at reasonable wages and health care programs for those  who can work, and by providing aid for poor parents who are unable to work.      3.  Working to build economically and racially integrated communities. This can be  done by choosing to live in such a community, by supporting federal subsidies  for low-income housing in mixed-income areas, and by opposing efforts to  restrict access to certain communities by members of particular ethnic or income  groups. Such restrictions might take the form of zoning that prohibits the  construction of high-rise housing for low-income groups or limits housing lots  to a large size, such as two acres, or by red-lining by banks that refuse to  provide mortgages in certain neighborhoods.      4.  Working to support prenatal care for all pregnant women. Currently, about  one-quarter of them receive no prenatal care. Helping all pregnant women could  reduce or eliminate perhaps one-third of all learning disorders (Hodgkinson,  1989).      5.  Working to support Head Start programs for all eligible children. Only 16  percent of low-income children eligible for the preschool program for  four-year-olds are now enrolled in it, yet Head Start has a proven track  record. Every dollar invested in quality preschool education yields $4.75  because of lower costs later on for special education and public assistance,  and the incarceration of people who commit crimes (Weikart &amp; Schweinhart,  1984; Children's Defense Fund: A Call for Action, 1988).      6.  Using tests for diagnosing rather than dismissing students. For example,  instead of taking a low test score as evidence that a child cannot learn, we  can examine what parts of a particular test were difficult for that child. If  necessary, we can obtain further, individual testing to identify and analyze  what skills the child needs to develop, and devise strategies for teaching  those specific skills. We can try alternative teaching strategies with each  child until we find one that works. If a child has difficulty learning to read  phonetically, for example, we might try teaching that child a different way,  perhaps visually. We can help children with various kinds of learning  disabilities learn ways to compensate for their difficulties. For example, planning  their work in advance, organizing it so that they have enough time to complete  the necessary steps, and allowing time for someone else to check their spelling  are all compensatory strategies that can be adopted to good effect by children  trying to overcome various learning disabilities.      7.  Working on finding the abilities students do have, rather than on deciding that  they haven't any. For example, if a student has strong artistic, musical,  athletic, or auditory talents, but is weaker in the verbal or mathematical  areas, we can help that child find ways into the academic subjects through  their strengths.      8.  Supporting efforts at detracking.      9.  Learning about and using collaborative teaching techniques, such as those developed  by Elizabeth Cohen and her colleagues at Stanford University that work  effectively in heterogeneous classes (Cohen, 1994, 2000; Cohen and Lotan 1997;  Sharan, 1980).      10.  Committing to the use of a variety of pedagogical techniques, curricular  assignments, and projects that address the learning needs of individual  children.      11.  Expecting and demanding a lot from students in the way of effort thought, and  work. We can help students take pride in themselves and their work by teaching  them what first-rate work should look like. The written materials students get  from teachers and schools and the appearance of the classrooms, hallways, and  school should all convey a sense of care, quality, and value. We can carefully  check the work students do, suggest constructive ways they might improve it,  and expect them to do better the next time.      12.  Teaching students content and subject matter. We can show students that we  value them and their learning by devoting class time to pedagogically useful  tasks, by refusing to waste class time on frivolous activities, and by trying  to stick to an annual schedule of curricular coverage.      13.  Helping students see how education is relevant and useful for their lives,  perhaps by bringing back graduates who have used school as a springboard to  better themselves and their worlds. Schools might keep a roster of successful  graduates and post pictures and stories about them for current students to see.  We can bring in examples that link learning with life accomplishments so  students can begin to see connections between school and life. For example, we  might invite people who run their own business to talk about how they use math,  or bring in people who work in social service organizations to show how they  use writing in their daily work.            SUMMARY      This  chapter explores how educational structures, beliefs, and practices contribute  to unequal educational outcomes. To achieve greater educational equality,  educators must understand what social-class differences presently exist in  those structures, beliefs, and practices. If these differences are understood,  then the educational experiences of children of all social classes might be  made more similar.      The  higher one's social-class background, the more likely one is to attend a  smaller school with more resources including better teachers, smaller classes,  and an academic curriculum. Achieving greater educational equality means making  such school experiences available to all students, regardless of their  social-class backgrounds.      Widespread  confidence in educational testing and the growing use of high-stakes testing  runs the risk of blaming students for their failure and diverting attention  from how the social organization of schools may help to create failures. Instead,  we should be examining how teachers, cufficulum, and teaching practices of  schools attended by children of different social classes influence their  learning.      The  educational process of tracking refers to the segregation of students into  different learning or curriculum groups that are unequally ranked in a prestige  hierarchy. Whether based on ability grouping or curricular grouping, such  tracking tends to reduce learning opportunities for students in the lower  groups, while increasing such opportunities for students in higher groups. As  a result, this educational practice contributes to educational inequalities.  The detracking movement represents an important effort toward achieving greater  educational equality, but it has encountered some resistance from certain  parents.      Teachers  may unconsciously form different learning expectations about students of  different social-class backgrounds. When teachers hold higher expectations for  students, they tend to spend more time interacting with those students, praise  them more, teach them more, call on them more often, and offer them a more  socially valued curriculum. When teachers hold higher expectations, and when  those expectations are evident in their behavior, they increase student  learning. Thus, achieving greater educational equality means that teachers' expectations  for lower-class students need to be raised.      Because  the educational structures, beliefs, and practices examined here are related to  unequal educational attainment, and because educational success is related to  lifetime occupations and earnings, it is important that educational  inequalities be reduced. This chapter recommends a number of steps that  concerned educators and citizens can take to promote educational and social  equality.            QUESTIONS  AND ACTIVITIES      1.  According to Persell, in what ways do schools contribute to inequality? What  evidence does the author give to support her position?      2.  Give examples of how each of the following factors contributes to educational  inequality: (a) educational structures; (b) funding inequities, (c) testing practices;  and (d) teachers and curriculum.      3.  What are the major characteristics of each of the following types of schools:  (a) elite private schools and exclusive suburban schools, (b) parochial  schools; and (c) large urban public school systems?      4.  Why do students from different social-class backgrounds often attend different  schools or get assigned to different tracks when they attend the same schools?  How does the social-class background of students influence the kind of  education they often receive?      5.  Visit and observe in (a) a local elite private school; (b) a school in an  upper-middle-class suburb; and (c) an inner-city school. How are these schools  alike? How are they different? Based on your visits and observations, what  tentative generalizations can you make about education, social class, and  inequality? To what extent are your generalizations similar to and different  from those of Persell?      6.  What cautions should teachers, principals, policy makers, and parents keep in  mind when interpreting standardized achievement tests?      7.  What is the self-fulfilling prophecy? How does it affect teacher expectations?      8.  What is tracking? Why do you think tracking is more widespread in large,  diverse school systems and in schools serving primarily lower-class students  than in upper-middle-class suburban, private, and parochial schools?      9.  How do the school experiences of students in lower and higher tracks differ?  How does tracking contribute to educational inequality? What is detracking?      10.  Why does tracking persist?      11.  How do factors related to social class influence teacher expectations of  students?      12. How do teacher expectations influence  how teachers and pupils interact, what students are taught, and what students  achieve?   REFERENCES      Alexander, K. L. and Eckland, B. K. (1975, June).

{"detail": [{"content": "CHAPTER 4                         SOCIAL CLASS AND EDUCATIONAL EQUALITY      Caroline Hodges Persell 2003            Picture  three babies born at the same time, but to parents of different social-class  backgrounds. The first baby is born into a wealthy, well-educated, business or  professional family. The second is born into a middle-class family in which  both parents attended college and have middle-level managerial or social  service jobs. The third is born into a poor family in which neither parent  finished high school or has a steady job. Will these children receive the same  education? Although the United   States is based on the promise of  equal opportunity for all people, the educational experiences of these three  children are likely to be quite different.      Education  in the United States is not a single, uniform system that is available  to every child in the same way. Children of different social classes are likely  to attend different types of schools, to receive different types of  instruction, to study different curricula, and to leave school at different  rates and times. As a result, when children end their schooling, they differ  more than when they entered, and these differences may be used by society in an  effort to legitimate adult inequalities. If we understand better how schools  may help construct inequalities, we may be in a better position to try to  change them.      The nature and meaning of social class are issues  often debated by social scientists. U.S. researchers often measure social class by asking  survey questions about a person's or a family's educational level, occupation,  rank in an organization, and earnings. A few have tried to included measures  of wealth such as home ownership or other assets. Several features of social  class in the United States are worth special mention. Social class inequality  is greater in the United   States than in any other industrial or post-industrial  society in the world. Germany , Japan , Italy , France , Switzerland , England , Sweden , the Netherlands , you name it, all have considerably less social  class inequality than the United   States . The countries with the least amount of class-based  educational inequality are Sweden and the Netherlands , and they are also the countries where a familys  social class background is less related to their childrens school achievement  (Blossfield and Shavit, 1993). Furthermore, income inequality has widened in the U.S. during the last  twenty years, increasing inequality among children as well (Lichter &amp;  Eggebeen, 1993; Mayer 2001). The growing economic inequality in the U. S. affects how much education people  receive. In states with bigger  gaps between high and low income families (i.e., more income inequality), young  people who grow up in high-income families obtain more education and children  in low-income families obtain less education, compared to states with smaller  gaps between high and low income families, where family income is not so  strongly related to the amount of education the children obtain (Mayer, 2001).  The explanation for these differences seems to be more state spending for  schooling and higher economic returns to schooling in states with higher income  inequality (Mayer, 2001). At the  same time, the U.S. has an historical belief in opportunity for all,  regardless of their social origins.      This  paradox of great and growing inequality and the belief in opportunity for all  creates a special problem for the United   States , namely the &quot;management  of ambition&quot; (Brint and Karabel, 1989, p. 7). Many more people aspire to  high paying careers than can actually enter them. One result has been the  growth of educational credentialism (Collins, 1979), which means that more and  more education is required for all jobs, especially professional and managerial  occupations. This means that education is playing an ever-increasing role in  the process of sorting people into their highly unequal adult positions. This  sorting does not happen randomly, however.      Social  class has been consistently related to educational success through time  (Coleman, Campbell, Hobson, McPartland, Mood, Weinfeld &amp; York, 1966; Gamoran  2001; Goldstein, 1967; Grissmer, Kirby, Berends, &amp; Williamson, 1994;  Hanson, 1994; Mare, 1981; Mayeske &amp; Wisler, 1972; Persell 1977). Although  there are a number of exceptions, students from higher social-class backgrounds  tend to get better grades and to stay in school longer than do students from  lower-class backgrounds. The question is, why does this happen? Does the  educational system contribute to the widening of educational results over time?  If so, how and what might change it? I argue that three features of American  education affect educational inequalities:            1.  The structure of schooling in the United   States      2.  The beliefs held by many members of U.S. society and hence by many educators      3.  Teachers, curriculum, and teaching practices in U.S. schools            The   structure of schooling refers to such features as differences between  urban rural, and suburban schools, and differences between public and private  schools. Educational beliefs includes beliefs about IQ (intelligence  quotient) and testing. Teachers,  Curriculum, and teaching practices include  teacher training and recruitment, tracking of students into certain curricula,  teachers' expectations about what different children can learn, and differences  in the quantity and quality of what is taught.      This  chapter reviews research showing differences in educational structures,  beliefs, and practices; examines how these differences are related to the  social-class backgrounds of students, considers the consequences they have for  student achievement; and analyzes how they affect individuals' adult lives.  Lest this be too depressing an account, at the end of the chapter I suggest  some ways that teachers, other educators, and parents might work to improve  education.            EDUCATIONAL  STRUCTURES      The  three babies described above are not likely to attend the same school, even if  they live in the same area. Most students in the United States attend  schools that are relatively alike with respect to the social-class backgrounds  of the other students. One reason this happens is that people in the United States tend to live in areas that are fairly similar with respect to class  and race. If they attend their neighborhood school, they are with students from  similar backgrounds. If children grow up in a fairly diverse area such as a  large city, mixed suburb, or rural area, they are less likely to attend the  same schools. The states with the most private schools, for example, are the  states with the largest concentrations of urban areas (Coleman, Hoffer &amp;  Kilgore, 1982). If, by chance, students of different backgrounds do attend the  same school, they are very likely to experience different programs of study  because of tracking and ability grouping.      In  older suburbs or cities, children of higher-class families are more likely to  attend homogeneous neighborhood schools, selective public schools, or private  schools, and to be in higher tracks; lower-class children are also likely to  attend school together. Middle-class families try to send their children to  special public schools, parochial schools, or private schools if they can  afford them.      Private  day and boarding schools are also relatively similar with respect to social  class, despite the fact that some scholarships are awarded. Researchers who  studied elite boarding schools, for example, found that 46 percent of the  families had incomes of more than $100,000 per year in the early 1980s (Cookson  &amp; Persell, 1985). This is undoubtedly true of many more than half the  families today.      Let's  look more closely at elite private schools and exclusive suburban schools,  which are overwhelmingly attended by upper- and upper-middle-class students; at  parochial schools, attended by middle-class and working-class students, and at  large urban public schools, heavily attended by lower-class pupils. Although  these descriptions gloss over many distinctions within each major type of  school, they do convey some of the range of differences that exist under the  overly broad umbrella we call U.S. education.            Schools  of the Upper and Upper-Middle Classes       At most upper- and upper-middle-class high  schools, the grounds are spacious and well kept, the computer, laboratory,  language, and athletic facilities are extensive, the teachers are well educated  and responsive to students and parents, classes are small, nearly every student  studies a college preparatory curriculum, and considerable homework is  assigned.      At  the private schools, these tendencies are often intensified. The schools are  quite small, with few having more than 1,200 students. Teachers do not have  tenure or belong to unions, so they can be fired by the headmaster or  headmistress if they are considered unresponsive to students or parents.  Classes are small, often having no more than fifteen students, and sometimes  fewer. Numerous advanced placement courses offer the possibility of college  credit. Students remark that it is &quot;not cool to be dumb around here.&quot;  (Cookson &amp; Persell, 1985, p. 95). Most students watch very little  television during the school week and do a great deal of homework (Cookson  &amp; Persell, 1985, p. 95). They have many opportunities for extracurricular  activities, such as debate and drama clubs, publications, and music, and the  chance to learn sports that colleges value, such as crew, ice hockey, squash,  and lacrosse. Research suggests that participating in one or more  extracurricular activities increases students' desire to attend school. Students  have both academic and personal advisors who monitor their progress, help them  solve problems, and try to help them have a successful school experience.      Affluent  suburban communities have a robust tax base to support annual costs that in the  2000s often exceeded $15,000 per pupil. School board members are elected by  members of the community who are likely to know them. Private schools are run  by self-perpetuating boards of trustees, many of whom are graduates of the  school. The school head is chosen by the board of trustees and may be replaced  by them if they are not satisfied.            Private  Parochial Schools       Many differences exist among parochial schools,  but in general these schools are also relatively small. More of the high school  students in them study an academic program and do more homework than do their  public-school peers. They also are subjected to somewhat stricter discipline  (Coleman, Hoffer &amp; Kilgore, 1982). The classes, however, are often larger  than elite private, suburban, or urban school classes, with sometimes as many  as forty or fifty pupils per class. Some non-Catholic middle- and working-class  parents, especially those in urban areas, send their children to parochial  schools (Coleman, Hoffer &amp; Kilgore).      The  costs at parochial schools are relatively low, especially compared to private  schools, because these schools are subsidized by religious groups. These  schools have relatively low teacher salaries and usually have no teachers'  unions. Currently there are more lay teachers and fewer nuns, sisters, priests,  and brothers as teachers. The schools are governed by the religious authority that  runs them.            Urban  Schools       Urban schools are usually quite large, and they  are part of an even larger school system that is invariably highly  bureaucratic. They usually offer varied courses of study, including academic,  vocational, and general curricular tracks. The school systems of large cities  and older, larger suburbs tend to lack both political and economic resources.  These systems are generally highly centralized, with school board members  generally elected on a citywide basis. School board members are often concerned  members of the community who may send their own children to private schools,  and they may have little knowledge about or power over the daily operations of  the public system. The authority of professional educators is often buttressed  by bureaucratic procedures and by unionization of teachers and administrators (Persell,  2000). Some observers (Rogers, 1968, and Rogers and Chung, 1983) have  described the system as one of organizational paralysis, rather than  governance.      Economically,  the large city school systems are also relatively powerless. Because schools are supported by  local property taxes, and because there is a great deal of housing segregation  by social class as well as race in the United States, students who live in  low-income areas are very likely to attend schools with lower per pupil  expenditures. Some schools with very high per pupil spending even raise  additional private funds to supplement the generous tax monies used to support  the school. Thus, they are able to provide additional educational enrichments  to the students attending such schools.      Unequal educational expenditures have  serious consequences for the condition of school buildings, libraries and  laboratories, computer equipment, the richness of curricular offerings, ability  to hire experienced and certified teachers, class size, and the variety of  extracurricular offerings. Such disparities in educational opportunities  affect how much children learn, how long they stay in school, their graduation  rates, and the rates at which they successfully pursue further education after  high school. While the question of whether money makes a difference in  educational achievement has been debated (Coleman et al., 1966 and Hanushek,  1989, 1996), more recent research has refined the question so as to see money  as a threshold condition that is necessary but not always sufficient for  achievement. How the money is spent certainly matters (Ellliott, 1998; Gamoran  et al., 2000; Wenglinsky, 1997). Expenditures need to be connected to opportunities  to learn effectively (Gamoran et al., 2000), to having good teachers (Darling-  Hammond, 1995), to inquiry-based teaching methods (Elliott, 1998), and to good  equipment, especially in the case of science (Elliott, 1998).      Because of the importance of funding  equity, 20 states in the U.S. have faced court challenges,  resulting in court decisions requiring them to provide all students with equal  access to quality schools. (Dively &amp; Hickrod, 1992; Times , 2002:  A18). Perhaps the most extensive and bitterly contested of these suits is  Abbott v. Burke in New   Jersey , brought in  1981. This case produced eight court rulings, ordering equal funding in urban  and suburban schools, a high-quality preschool program for poor districts, and  standards-based reforms to close the achievement gap between rich and poor  students. After years of delay, in January 2002, newly-elected New Jersey  Governor James McGreevey announced that he would abide by the courts rulings.  This court case has been described by some as perhaps the most significant  education case since the Supreme Courts desegregation ruling nearly 50 years  ago ( Times , 2002: A18). It affects 30 underprivileged districts in the  state and may have implications for other states facing such court challenges.      In  general, then, a child's social-class background is related to the school  attended, the size of the school, the political and economic resources  available to the school, the curricula offered, and the ensuing educational  opportunities (Persell, Cookson, &amp; Catsambis, 1992).   EDUCATIONAL BELIEFS       Since the last century ideas about testing students  have permeated education. For decades the concept of measuring intelligence,  or IQ testing, played a major role in education. The concept of IQ has been used to explain why  some children learn more slowly than others, why African American children do  less well in school than White children, and why lower-class children do less  well than middle- and upper-middle-class children. The latest example of this  argument is the highly controversial book, The Bell Curve , by Richard  Herrnstein and Charles Murray (1994). IQ tests are often used to justify  variations in education, achievement, and rewards. The justification usually is  that because some people are more intelligent than others, they are entitled to  more opportunities, rewards, including curricular track placement and exposure  to special educational programs and resources.       Critics of IQ tests have raised a number of good  points about the accuracy of the tests. For example, IQ tests do not measure  such important features of intelligence as creative or divergent thinking,  logic, and critical reasoning. The idea of multiple intelligences is well  developed by Howard Gardner in his book Frames of Mind ( Gardner ,  1983). Stephen Jay Gould's The Mismeasure of Man (1981) may still be  the single best critical analysis of IQ tests.            In the last several decades,  increasing emphasis has been placed on the use of large-scale achievement  tests. This so-called high-stakes testing has been used as the basis for  deciding the educational track to which students are assigned, determining  whether a student moves to the next grade in school, and whether a student  graduates from high school. Such tests may also be used to hold educators,  schools, and school districts accountable. The focus here is on how the use of  tests affects individuals, and whether it is discriminatory or unfair for  students of different social class backgrounds.      The purposes of using such tests  include setting high standards for student learning and raising student  achievement. However, when some students do poorly on a test, schools and  teachers can respond in several different ways. They can work harder with the  students obtaining low scores, providing them with more personal attention,  tutoring, and additional learning experiences in an effort to improve their  achievement test scores. Such responses usually require additional resources,  which many schools, especially ones that are already underfunded, may not  have. Another possible response is that schools try to get rid of students  with lower scores, by encouraging them to drop out or transfer, or through  other means. This is clearly an unintended consequence of high stakes testing,  and one that impacts most severely on the most educationally needy and  vulnerable students. One set of researchers has observed that the educational  achievement gaps between poor and rich students are larger in states with more  extensive student testing programs, and that student accountability decreases  opportunities for learning for all students (Schiller and Muller, 2002). More  research is needed on how schools respond to accountability (Schiller and  Muller, 2002).      In 1997, the U.S. Congress asked the  National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study and make written  recommendations on appropriate methods that would ensure that tests are not  used in a discriminatory manner or inappropriately for student promotion,  tracking or graduation (Heubert &amp; Hauser, 1999, p. 7). Among the  committees recommendations are the following:            Because a test score is not exact, high-stakes educational  decisions should not be made solely or automatically on the basis of a single  test score but should also take other relevant information into account such  as grades, developmental factors, attendance, and teacher recommendations (p.  6).            Tests should be used for high-stakes decisions about  individual mastery only after implementing changes in teaching and curriculum  that ensure that students have been taught the knowledge and skills on which  they will be tested (p. 6). In other words, students should not be tested  until they have been taught the content.            Everyone involved in education, including parents, educators,  and public officials, should understand the nature and interpretation of test  scores (p. 5).            Students who receive low test scores should be offered a  range of alternatives, such as effective remedial education, not just an  either-or consequence of social promotion or grade repetition. [1]             Appropriate test use carries over to appropriate student  preparation. Students should not see test items in advance, nor should  teaching be narrowly geared to just what is on the test, without improving the  broader set of academic skills that the test is intended to measure (p. 7)            Students with disabilities and English-language learners  require special consideration to ensure validity and fairness.            Finally, there is a need for research on whether using  particular tests is educationally beneficial for studentsfor example, by  increasing academic achievement or reducing dropout rates. (p. 8)            Historically, IQ tests were used by  teachers and schools to explain why racial/ethnic minority and low-income  students were not performing as well as majority and higher income students. I  find it very interesting that the states with the largest percentages of  racial/ethnic minority students are also more likely to have the most  articulated standards for student achievement (based on data in U.S. Bureau of  the Census and The State of State Standards 2000 ), while states with  lower percentages of racial/ethnic minority students have been slower to jump  onto the high-stakes testing bandwagon.      TEACHERS, CURRICULUM, AND TEACHING PRACTICES            The relatively recent growth of  high-stakes testing may deflect attention from essential features of schools  that affect learning. Educational equity requires that we examine not only the  educational funding, but what that funding is used for and how it affects  education. Three features of schools highlight how students educational  experiences vary depending on their social class, specifically the teachers  they get, curricular tracking, and teachers expectations.            Teachers      Schools with more low income students  are more likely to have teachers who are not certified at all, or who are  teaching out of their area of certification (Ingersoll, 1999). Large shortages  of certified teachers in such major urban areas as New York City in recent years have led to several  changes. The Schools Chancellor developed an alternative, abbreviated path to  temporary certification, aimed at career-changers and recent college graduates  with no teaching experience. The alternative path to provisional certification  involves a month of intensive education courses. At the end of this time, they  are placed in the 100 lowest-performing schools from the prior year. About 30  percent of the new certified teachers in the fall of 2002 in New York City had this alternative certification.  In addition, New York and other cities received recruits  from Teach for America , a non-profit organization that  recruits college graduates, provides a summer of intensive training, and places  them in troubled schools.      Like New York , many school districts around the country, including Los Angeles , Atlanta , and Washington , DC have alternative certification programs in an effort to address the  shortage of qualified teachers. However, there is considerable debate over the  abbreviated training that alternative route certification involves. Some, for  example Arthur Levine, President of Teachers College at Columbia University,  point out that the definition of a certified teacher has been reclassified, but  the net result is that we will still have large numbers of students this fall  whose teachers are unprepared to teach them (Goodnough, 2002). On the other  hand, Rod Paige, the U.S. Secretary of Education, has dismissed the  pedagogical course work offered by schools of educationlike Teachers Collegeas  cumbersome and often ineffective (Goodnough, 2002: B3). Research by Gomez and  Grobe (1990, cited in Darling-Hammond, 1995: 472) finds that alternative-route  teacher candidates had more uneven performance ratings compared to trained  beginners, particularly in the area of classroom management and in their  knowledge of instructional techniques. Their students, in turn, scored  significantly lower in language arts, compared to students of fully prepared  beginning teachers, when students initial achievement levels were held  constant (Gomez and Grobe, 1990, cited in Darling-Hammond 1995: 472).      As Darling-Hammond notes, policy  makers have nearly always answered the problem of teacher shortages by lowering  standards, so that people who have had little or no preparation for teaching  can be hired, (1995: 471). It is notable that this issue does not surface in  more affluent, suburban public schools, because they have very low percentages  of teachers who are not certified or are teaching outside their areas of  certification (Ingersoll, 1999). One reason that such areas can attract and  retain certified teachers better than inner city schools is that they pay  higher salaries on the average.      In 2002, New York City improved its ability to attract more  certified teacher applicants as well as those with alternative certification because  it raised the starting salaries of entry-level teachers from $31,910 to  $39,000. They also raised the maximum yearly salary that certified teachers  hired from other districts could initially earn from $43,370 to nearly  $61,000. In 1986, Connecticut also solved its teacher shortage by  dramatically raising and equalizing beginning teacher salaries (Darling-Hammond,  1995, p. 477).      The question will be whether New York or other urban school systems can  retain the new teachers they have hired. Teacher turnover rates are much  higher in low-income and urban school districts than in more affluent areas  (Darling-Hammond, 1990, 1992; Grissmer &amp; Kirby, 1987; Wise et al., 1987).  Thus, teacher mentoring, professional development, and support remain important  issues to address if educational equality is to be achieved. The effective  professional development of teachers has been found to enhance student learning  (Gamoran et al. 2000).      Teachers, however, work within  educational structures that contribute to unequal learning opportunities. This  is especially true of the educational practice of tracking.      Tracking      The  first recorded instance of tracking was the Harris plan in St. Louis ,  begun in 1867. Since then, tracking has followed a curious pattern in the United States of alternate popularity and disuse. In the 1920s and 1930s, when  many foreign immigrants settled in the United   States , tracking increased greatly.  Thereafter, it fell into decline until the late 1950s, when it was revived,  apparently in response to the USSR's launching of Sputnik and the United  States' competitive concern with identifying and educating the gifted (Conant,  1961; Oakes, 1985). That period was also marked by large migrations of rural  southern African Americans to northern cities and by an influx of Puerto Rican  and Mexican American migrants into the United   States . Tracking is much more extensive in U.S. schools than in most other countries.  (Darling-Hammond 1995, p. 474). This observation prompts us to ask why this is  the case. There are two differences between the U.S. and European countries that might account for the difference. The U.S. has more racial and economic inequality than European  countries, and educational achievement and attainment are more important for a  persons (more unequal) occupation, earnings, and other life chances in the U.S. than in European countries.      Tracking  today is widespread, particularly in large, diverse school systems and in schools  serving primarily lower-class students. It is less prevalent, and less rigid  when it occurs, in upper-middle-class suburban and private schools and in  parochial schools (Jones, Vanfossen &amp; Spade, 1985). Schools with more low-income students  have smaller academic tracks and larger remedial and vocational programs, while  schools serving affluent students may have only academic tracks and no  vocational or remedial programs (Oakes, 1992:13). Differences in the courses  students take, especially in such areas as mathematics, science, and foreign  language go a long way toward explaining differences in achievement test scores  (Darling-Hammond 1995:473).      What  exactly is tracking? To address this question, we need to examine the  distinction between ability grouping and curriculum differentiation. Proponents  of ability grouping stress flexible subject-area assignment. By this they mean  that students are assigned to learning groups on the basis of their background  and achievement in a subject area at any given moment, and that skills and  knowledge are evaluated at relatively frequent intervals. Students showing  gains can be shifted readily into another group. They might also be in  different ability groups in different subjects, according to their own rate of growth  in each subject. This practice suggests a common curriculum shared by all  students, with only the mix of student abilities being varied. It also assumes  that, within that curriculum, all groups are taught the same material.      In  fact, it seems that group placement becomes self-perpetuating, that students  are often grouped at the same level in all subjects, and that even a shared  curriculum may be taught differently to different groups. This is especially  likely to happen in large, bureaucratic, urban public schools. Quite often,  different ability groups are assigned to different courses of study, resulting  in simultaneous grouping by curriculum and ability. Rosenbaum notes that  although ability grouping and curriculum grouping may appear different to educators,  in fact they share several social similarities: (1) Students are placed with  those defined as similar to themselves and are segregated from those deemed  different, (2) group placement is done on the basis of criteria such as  ability or postgraduate plans that are unequally esteemed. Thus, group  membership immediately ranks students in a status hierarchy, formally stating  that some students are better than others (Rosenbaum, 1976). Following  Rosenbaum, the general term of tracking is applied here to both types of  grouping (Rosenbaum, 1976).      On  what basis are students assigned to tracks? Three major criteria have been  noted in the literature: (1) standardized test scores; (2) teacher grades,  recommendations, or opinions about pupils; and (3) pupil race and socioeconomic  class. Test scores are usually based on large group-administered aptitude  tests, a method considered least valid by test-givers. Teacher opinions about  students may be influenced by test scores, pupil social class, or ethnicity, as  discussed below. Social class and ethnicity have been found in some research  studies to be directly related to track assignments as well, even when ability  and teacher recommendations were similar (Brookover, Leu &amp; Kariger, 1965;  Rist, 1970). This is  partly because of prior educational placements and experiences, partly due to  counselors advice (colored by their view of students futures), and partly  because parents are more likely to intervene effectively in tracking decisions  for higher social-class students (Darling-Hammond, 1995, 474).      Thus,  the social-class background of students is related to the prevalence of  tracking in the schools, to the nature of the available tracks, and to the ways  track assignments are made. Furthermore, while there is some relationship  between tested ability and track placement, it is highly imperfect (Dreeben  &amp; Barr, 1988; Pallas, Entwisle, Alexander, &amp; Stluka, 1994).      Once  students are assigned to different tracks, what happens to them? Researchers  suggest that tracking has effects through at least three mechanisms. These are  instructional, social, and institutional in nature, and all three may operate  together. The major instructional processes that have been observed to  vary according to track placement include the unequal allocation of educational  resources, the instruction offered, student teacher interactions, and  student-student interactions. Dreeben &amp; Barr (1988) found variations in  the content, pacing, and quantity of instruction in different tracks. Higher  ranked reading groups were taught more (and learned more) words than lower  ranked reading groups, according to Gamoran (1984, 1986). Hallinan studied  within class ability grouping in thirty-four elementary school classes. She  found that ability grouping affects the learning of students in higher and  lower groups because it influences their opportunities for learning, the  instructional climate, and the student aptitudes clustered in the different  groups. High-ability groups spend more time on tasks during class; that is,  more class time is devoted to actual teaching activities. Also, teachers use  more interesting teaching methods and materials. Finally, teachers hold higher  expectations, and the other students support learning more in the  higher-ability groups. As a result, the aptitude of students in the higher  groups tends to develop more than does the aptitude of students in the lower  group (Hallinan, 1987).      In  secondary schools, college-track students consistently receive better teachers,  class materials, laboratory facilities, field trips, and visitors than their  lower-track counterparts (Findley &amp; Bryan, 1975; Goodlad, 1984; Oakes,  1985; Rosenbaum, 1976; Schafer, Olexa &amp; Polk, 1973). Oakes observed that  teachers of high-track students set aside more time for student learning and  devoted more class time to learning activities. Fewer students in these classes  engaged in &quot; off-task&quot; activities (Oakes, 1985, p. 111). Oakes also  found that &quot;students are being exposed to knowledge and taught behaviors  that differ not only educationally but also in socially important ways.  Students at the top are exposed to the knowledge that is highly valued in our  culture, knowledge that identifies its possessors as 'educated.'&quot; (Oakes,  1985, p. 91-92). Similarly, those students are taught critical thinking,  creativity, and independence. Students at the bottom are denied access to these  educationally and socially important experiences (Oakes, 1985, p. 92).       Freiberg   (1970) found that higher-track students received more empathy, praise, and use  of their ideas, as well as less direction and criticism, than did lower-track  students. Oakes (1985) observed that teachers spent more time in low-track  classes on discipline and that students in those classes perceived their  teachers as more punitive than did students in high-track classes.       Socially, tracks may create settings that shape  students' self-esteem and expectations about academic performance. For  example, Rosenbaum (1976) reported that more than one-third of lower-track  (non-college) students mentioned &quot;blatant insults directed at them by  teachers and administrators 'Teachers are always telling us how dumb we are.'  One articulate general track student in that study reported that he sought  academic help from a teacher but was told that he was not smart enough to learn  the material. Several students reported that a lower-track student who asks a  guidance counselor for a change of classes is not only prevented from changing  but is also insulted for being so presumptuous as to make the request&quot; (Rosenbaum,  1976: 179-180). Rosenbaum was told by one teacher, &quot;You're wasting your  time asking these kids for their opinions. There's not an idea in any of their  heads.&quot; As the researcher notes, &quot;This comment was not expressed in  the privacy of the teacher's room; it was said at a normal volume in a quiet  classroom full of students!&quot; (p. 180).      Students  have been observed to pick up on the negative evaluations associated with lower  track placement. They may make fun of lower-track students, call them  unflattering names, or stop associating with them (Rosenbaum, 1976). Hence, a  major result of tracking is differential respect from peers and teachers, with  implications for both instruction and esteem.       Institutionally, tracking creates groups of  students who are understood by teachers and parents as having certain qualities  and capacities, above and beyond the actual skills they possess. The symbolic  value of track placement thus creates expectations in teachers and parents,  independent of student performance. These expectations affect placement in  subsequent levels of the educational system (Gamoran, 1984). Ability groups  limit teachers' perceptions of what grades are appropriate for students in  different tracks (Reuman, 1989). Both parents and teachers rated children in  higher reading groups as more competent and likely to do better in the future  than children in low reading groups, even when children's initial performance  levels and parents' prior beliefs about their children's abilities were held  constant (Pallas et al., 1994, p. 41). Further consequences of tracking  include segregation of students by social class and ethnicity, (Esposito, 1973;   Hobson v. Hansen , 1967; Racial and Social Isolation in the Schools ,  1969; Oakes, 1985) unequal learning by students in different tracks, (Findley  &amp; Bryan, 1970; Oakes, 1985; Rosenbaum, 1976; Shafer, Olexa &amp; Polk,  1973) and unequal chances to attend college (Alexander, Cook &amp; McDill,  1978; Alexander &amp; Eckland, 1975; Jaffe &amp; Adams, 1970; Rosenbaum, 1976;  Rosenbaum, 1980; Jones, Spade &amp; Vanfossen, 1987). The percentage of  students in an academic curriculum may be the single most significant  structural difference between different types of schools. Noncollege  preparatory programs may foreclose future opportunities for young persons by  failing to provide them with the courses or training necessary for admission to  institutions of higher education, or for pursuing particular college majors  (Hallinan, 1987).      Darling-Hammond suggests that  tracking persists because few teachers are prepared to manage heterogeneous  classrooms effectively (1995, p. 474). In  the 1980s, tracking came under considerable attack, and a movement toward  &quot;detracking&quot; gained support (Braddock and McParland, 1990; Oakes,  1985, 1992; Wheelock, 1992). But even when teachers have a strong ideology of de-tracking and have  succeeded in ending tracking in some communities, they have encountered serious  resistance and opposition from parents (Wells and Oakes, 1996). In their  three-year longitudinal case studies of 10 racially and socioeconomically  mixed secondary schools that were participating in detracking reform, Oakes and  her colleagues found that detracking is a highly normative and political  endeavor that confronts deeply held cultural beliefs, ideologies, and fiercely  protected arrangements of material and political advantage in local  communities (1997: 507). For example, being in an honors course confers  advantages in the competition for college admissions. Detracking was able to occur  when politically savvy teachers were able to involve powerful parents in  meaningful ways in the process of implementing it (Oakes et al. 1997: 506).      Teachers'  Expectations       Educational structures such as schools that are  socioeconomically homogeneous, growing use of standardized achievement tests, and  practices such as tracking go a long way toward shaping the expectations  teachers hold about students. Teacher training and textbooks have tended to  attribute educational failures to deficiencies in the children. Often, such  deficiencies are assumed to reside in the social characteristics of the pupils,  such as their social-class background, ethnicity, language, or behavior rather  than in social structure. In a review of relevant research, Persell found that  student social class was related to teacher expectations when other factors  such as race were not more salient, when expectations were engendered by real  children, or when teachers had a chance to draw inferences about a student's  social class rather than simply being told his or her background (Persell,  1977, pp. 105-107). Sometimes social class was related to teacher expectations  even when the child's current IQ and achievement were comparable. That is,  teachers held lower expectations for lower-class children than for middle-class  children even when those children had similar IQ scores and achievement.      Teachers'  expectations may also be influenced by the behavior and physical appearance of  the children (Ritts, Patterson, &amp; Tubbs, 1992). Social class may influence  teacher expectations directly or indirectly through test scores, appearance,  language style, speed of task performance, and behavior. All of these traits  are themselves culturally defined and are related to class position. Moreover,  teacher expectations are influenced more by negative information about pupil  characteristics than by positive data. It is important to know this because  much of the information teachers gain about low income children seems to be  negative.      Another  factor that may influence teacher expectations and pupil performance is the  operation of the cultural capital possessed by families of higher social  classes. As used here, the term cultural capital refers to the cultural  resources and assets that families bring to their interactions with school  personnel. By virtue of their own educational credentials and knowledge of  educational institutions, parents, especially mothers, are able to help their  children get the right teachers and courses and do extra work at home if necessary  (Baker &amp; Stevenson, 1986; Grissmer et al., 1994; Lareau, 1989; Useem,  1990).      If  teacher expectations are often influenced by the social class of students, do  those expectations have significant consequences for students? Research on this  question has produced seemingly contradictory results. The controversy began  with the publication of Pygmalion in the Classroom (Rosenthal &amp;  Jacobson, 1968). That book suggested that the expectations of classroom  teachers might powerfully influence the achievement of students. Hundreds of  studies on the possibility of &quot;expectancy effects&quot; have been  conducted since then (Cooper &amp; Good, 1983). One thing is clear: only  expectations that teachers truly believe are likely to affect their behaviors.      When  teachers hold higher expectations for pupils, how does this affect their  behavior? Their expectations seem to affect the frequency of interaction they  have with their pupils and the kinds of behaviors they show toward different  children. Teachers spend more time interacting with pupils for whom they have  higher expectations (Persell, 1977). For example, Brophy and Good (1970) found  that students for whom teachers held high expectations were praised more  frequently when correct and were criticized less frequently when wrong or unresponsive  than were pupils for whom teachers had low expectations.      Rosenthal  (1974) believes that teachers convey their expectations in at least four  related ways. He bases this judgment on his review of 285 studies of  interpersonal influence, including at least 80 in classrooms or other settings.  First, he sees a general climate factor, consisting of the overall warmth a  teacher shows to children, with more shown to high-expectancy students. Second,  he sees students for whom high expectations are held as receiving more praise  for doing something right than do students for whom low expectations are held.  Third, Rosenthal notes that high-expectancy students are taught more than are  low expectancy students. This is consistent with research by others and summarized  by Persell (1977). Fourth, Rosenthal indicates that expectancy may be affected  by a response opportunity factor. That is, students for whom the teacher has  higher expectations are called on more often and are given more chances to  reply, as well as more frequent and more difficult questions.      A  fifth way teachers convey their expectations, which Rosenthal does not mention  but which has been observed by others, is the different type of curricula  teachers may present to children for whom they have different expectations. One  study found that teachers report that they present completely different types  of economics to students of differently perceived abilities (Keddie, 1971).  Another study reported that teachers use more reading texts and more difficult  ones with the top reading group (Alpert, 1975). Clearly, there is evidence that  at least some teachers behave differently toward students for whom they hold  different expectations. The critical question remains: Do these expectations  and behaviors actually affect students? Do the students think differently about  themselves or learn more as a result of the expectations teachers hold? Therein  lies the heart of the &quot;Pygmalion effect&quot; controversy.      Students  report being aware of the different expectations teachers have for them, and  notice differences in the way teachers treat them. For example, students  studied by Ferguson (2001) reported that when they asked the teacher a question  they received only a brief one sentence reply, but when other students (for  whom the teacher had higher expectations) asked the same question, the teacher  spoke at length in response.      When  teachers hold definite expectations and when those expectations are reflected  in their behavior toward children, these expectations are related to student  cognitive changes, even when pupil IQ and achievement are controlled. Moreover,  negative expectations, which can be observed only in natural settings because  it is unethical to induce negative expectations experimentally, appear to have  even more powerful consequences than do positive expectation. Moreover,  socially vulnerable children (i.e., younger, lower-class, and minority  children) seem to be more susceptible to lower teacher expectations (Rosenthal  &amp; Jacobson, 1968).            CONSEQUENCES  OF SOCIAL CLASS AND EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY      This  profile of social-class differences in education in the United States is oversimplified, but considerable evidence suggests that the  general patterns described here do exist. Social-class backgrounds affect where  students go to school and what happens to them once they are there. As a  result, lower-class students tend to encounter less prepared teachers, are less  likely to be exposed to valued curricula, are taught less of whatever curricula  they do study, and are expected to do less work in the classroom and outside of  it. Hence, they learn less and are less well prepared for the next level of  education.      Although  students have many reasons for dropping out of school or for failing to  continue, their experiences in school may contribute to their desire to  continue or to quit. Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore found that 24 percent of  public high school students dropped out, compared to 12 percent of Catholic and  13 percent of other private school students (Coleman, Hoffer &amp; Kilgore,  1982). Social class is a more important cause of lost talent among U.S.   youth in the late high school and post-high school years than gender or race,  according to Hanson (1994).      Similarly,  college attendance depends on a number of factors, including access to the  necessary financial resources. Nevertheless, it is striking how differently  students at different schools fare. Graduation from a private rather than a  public high school is related to attending a four-year (rather than a two-year)  college, (Falsey &amp; Heyns, 1984) attending a highly selective college,  (Persell, Cookson, &amp; Catsambis, 1992) and earning higher income in adult  life (Lewis &amp; Wanner, 1979). Even within the same school, track placement  is related to college attendance (Alexander, Cook &amp; McDill, 1978; Alexander  &amp; McDill, 1976; Jaffe &amp; Adams, 1970; Rosenbaum, 1976; Rosenbaum, 1980).  College attendance, in turn, is related to the adult positions and earnings one  attains (Kamens, 1974; Tinto, 1980; Useem, 1984; Useem &amp; Karabel, 1986). In  1987, women college graduates aged thirty to thirty-four earned 83 percent more  than did women with a high school education, and the comparable premium for men  was 57 percent more (U.S. Department of Education, 1990, p. 52). Thus, educational  inequalities help create and legitimate economic and social inequalities.      However,  most educators do not want to enhance and legitimate social inequalities.  Therefore, it seems reasonable to ask, What can they do to try to change these  patterns?            RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR ACTION      Teachers,  educators, and concerned citizens might consider the following actions:      1.  Working politically and legally to increase the educational resources available  to all children, not just those in wealthy school districts, and not just the  gifted and talented. Those concerned might do this by joining a political party  that works to advance the interests of the less advantaged members of society,  by attending political meetings, by holding candidates accountable for their  positions on education, and by supporting class action lawsuits for educational  equity. We can join other people interested in scrutinizing candidates' records  of support for education, and contribute time, money, or both to the campaigns  of candidates seeking to defeat incumbents who have not supported quality  education for all children.      2.  Working to reduce economic inequalities in society. This can be done by  supporting income-tax reforms at the national level that benefit hard-working  low- and middle-income families, by opposing tax cuts for the rich, by  supporting job programs at reasonable wages and health care programs for those  who can work, and by providing aid for poor parents who are unable to work.      3.  Working to build economically and racially integrated communities. This can be  done by choosing to live in such a community, by supporting federal subsidies  for low-income housing in mixed-income areas, and by opposing efforts to  restrict access to certain communities by members of particular ethnic or income  groups. Such restrictions might take the form of zoning that prohibits the  construction of high-rise housing for low-income groups or limits housing lots  to a large size, such as two acres, or by red-lining by banks that refuse to  provide mortgages in certain neighborhoods.      4.  Working to support prenatal care for all pregnant women. Currently, about  one-quarter of them receive no prenatal care. Helping all pregnant women could  reduce or eliminate perhaps one-third of all learning disorders (Hodgkinson,  1989).      5.  Working to support Head Start programs for all eligible children. Only 16  percent of low-income children eligible for the preschool program for  four-year-olds are now enrolled in it, yet Head Start has a proven track  record. Every dollar invested in quality preschool education yields $4.75  because of lower costs later on for special education and public assistance,  and the incarceration of people who commit crimes (Weikart &amp; Schweinhart,  1984; Children's Defense Fund: A Call for Action, 1988).      6.  Using tests for diagnosing rather than dismissing students. For example,  instead of taking a low test score as evidence that a child cannot learn, we  can examine what parts of a particular test were difficult for that child. If  necessary, we can obtain further, individual testing to identify and analyze  what skills the child needs to develop, and devise strategies for teaching  those specific skills. We can try alternative teaching strategies with each  child until we find one that works. If a child has difficulty learning to read  phonetically, for example, we might try teaching that child a different way,  perhaps visually. We can help children with various kinds of learning  disabilities learn ways to compensate for their difficulties. For example, planning  their work in advance, organizing it so that they have enough time to complete  the necessary steps, and allowing time for someone else to check their spelling  are all compensatory strategies that can be adopted to good effect by children  trying to overcome various learning disabilities.      7.  Working on finding the abilities students do have, rather than on deciding that  they haven't any. For example, if a student has strong artistic, musical,  athletic, or auditory talents, but is weaker in the verbal or mathematical  areas, we can help that child find ways into the academic subjects through  their strengths.      8.  Supporting efforts at detracking.      9.  Learning about and using collaborative teaching techniques, such as those developed  by Elizabeth Cohen and her colleagues at Stanford University that work  effectively in heterogeneous classes (Cohen, 1994, 2000; Cohen and Lotan 1997;  Sharan, 1980).      10.  Committing to the use of a variety of pedagogical techniques, curricular  assignments, and projects that address the learning needs of individual  children.      11.  Expecting and demanding a lot from students in the way of effort thought, and  work. We can help students take pride in themselves and their work by teaching  them what first-rate work should look like. The written materials students get  from teachers and schools and the appearance of the classrooms, hallways, and  school should all convey a sense of care, quality, and value. We can carefully  check the work students do, suggest constructive ways they might improve it,  and expect them to do better the next time.      12.  Teaching students content and subject matter. We can show students that we  value them and their learning by devoting class time to pedagogically useful  tasks, by refusing to waste class time on frivolous activities, and by trying  to stick to an annual schedule of curricular coverage.      13.  Helping students see how education is relevant and useful for their lives,  perhaps by bringing back graduates who have used school as a springboard to  better themselves and their worlds. Schools might keep a roster of successful  graduates and post pictures and stories about them for current students to see.  We can bring in examples that link learning with life accomplishments so  students can begin to see connections between school and life. For example, we  might invite people who run their own business to talk about how they use math,  or bring in people who work in social service organizations to show how they  use writing in their daily work.            SUMMARY      This  chapter explores how educational structures, beliefs, and practices contribute  to unequal educational outcomes. To achieve greater educational equality,  educators must understand what social-class differences presently exist in  those structures, beliefs, and practices. If these differences are understood,  then the educational experiences of children of all social classes might be  made more similar.      The  higher one's social-class background, the more likely one is to attend a  smaller school with more resources including better teachers, smaller classes,  and an academic curriculum. Achieving greater educational equality means making  such school experiences available to all students, regardless of their  social-class backgrounds.      Widespread  confidence in educational testing and the growing use of high-stakes testing  runs the risk of blaming students for their failure and diverting attention  from how the social organization of schools may help to create failures. Instead,  we should be examining how teachers, cufficulum, and teaching practices of  schools attended by children of different social classes influence their  learning.      The  educational process of tracking refers to the segregation of students into  different learning or curriculum groups that are unequally ranked in a prestige  hierarchy. Whether based on ability grouping or curricular grouping, such  tracking tends to reduce learning opportunities for students in the lower  groups, while increasing such opportunities for students in higher groups. As  a result, this educational practice contributes to educational inequalities.  The detracking movement represents an important effort toward achieving greater  educational equality, but it has encountered some resistance from certain  parents.      Teachers  may unconsciously form different learning expectations about students of  different social-class backgrounds. When teachers hold higher expectations for  students, they tend to spend more time interacting with those students, praise  them more, teach them more, call on them more often, and offer them a more  socially valued curriculum. When teachers hold higher expectations, and when  those expectations are evident in their behavior, they increase student  learning. Thus, achieving greater educational equality means that teachers' expectations  for lower-class students need to be raised.      Because  the educational structures, beliefs, and practices examined here are related to  unequal educational attainment, and because educational success is related to  lifetime occupations and earnings, it is important that educational  inequalities be reduced. This chapter recommends a number of steps that  concerned educators and citizens can take to promote educational and social  equality.            QUESTIONS  AND ACTIVITIES      1.  According to Persell, in what ways do schools contribute to inequality? What  evidence does the author give to support her position?      2.  Give examples of how each of the following factors contributes to educational  inequality: (a) educational structures; (b) funding inequities, (c) testing practices;  and (d) teachers and curriculum.      3.  What are the major characteristics of each of the following types of schools:  (a) elite private schools and exclusive suburban schools, (b) parochial  schools; and (c) large urban public school systems?      4.  Why do students from different social-class backgrounds often attend different  schools or get assigned to different tracks when they attend the same schools?  How does the social-class background of students influence the kind of  education they often receive?      5.  Visit and observe in (a) a local elite private school; (b) a school in an  upper-middle-class suburb; and (c) an inner-city school. How are these schools  alike? How are they different? Based on your visits and observations, what  tentative generalizations can you make about education, social class, and  inequality? To what extent are your generalizations similar to and different  from those of Persell?      6.  What cautions should teachers, principals, policy makers, and parents keep in  mind when interpreting standardized achievement tests?      7.  What is the self-fulfilling prophecy? How does it affect teacher expectations?      8.  What is tracking? Why do you think tracking is more widespread in large,  diverse school systems and in schools serving primarily lower-class students  than in upper-middle-class suburban, private, and parochial schools?      9.  How do the school experiences of students in lower and higher tracks differ?  How does tracking contribute to educational inequality? What is detracking?      10.  Why does tracking persist?      11.  How do factors related to social class influence teacher expectations of  students?      12. How do teacher expectations influence  how teachers and pupils interact, what students are taught, and what students  achieve?   REFERENCES      Alexander, K. L. and Eckland, B. K. (1975, June).

My current work reflects my long-standing interests in two fundamental      issues/questions. Understanding the relationship between the pattern      of transactions among people and their social contexts, or what      I refer to as social regularities (Seidman, 1988), and the identification      of the strategies, tactics, and loci of intervention to alter the      social regularities of a setting and promote positive psychological      development. I also continue to work on critical conceptual and      methodological issues, e.g., culturally anchored methodology (Hughes      & Seidman, 2002), holistic perspectives and methods (Seidman & Pedersen,      2003), and integrative chapters and volumes in community psychology      (Rappaport & Seidman, 2000; Revenson & Seidman, 2002). I am also      a member of the newly funded National Science Foundation Center      of Culture, Development, & Education (CRCDE). I am particularly      interested in the culture of schools and classrooms and how these      \"cultures\" impact the well known \"achievement gap.\"      Adolescent Development in the Urban Context      Since joining the faculty at NYU, I have been conducting a longitudinal      study of over 1400 economically at-risk urban adolescents, known      as the Adolescent Pathways Project (APP; Seidman, 1991). The bulk      of my work on the APP has focused on several major issues: a) understanding      how the normative transitions from elementary to junior high school      and from junior to senior high school impact developmental trajectories;      b) developing a holistic understanding of how the unique constellations      of daily transactions of youth with their family, peers, school,      and neighborhood are associated with different developmental outcomes;      and c) discovering and understanding profiles of contextual competence.      Normative School Transitions      The transition into junior high school seems to be far more problematic      than the transition into high school. While academic performance      drops across both transitions, self-esteem only declines across      the transition to junior high school (Seidman et al, 1994, 1996).      These changes do not vary as a function of student gender or race/ethnicity.      After making the transition to junior high school the students become      more disengaged from the educational enterprise: They report increased      academic hassles, decreased support from teachers, and reduced extracurricular      involvement. Two years after this school transition, these effects      are not attenuated. Currently, we are examining the long-term effects,      i.e., five years later, of these normative transitions and the potential      factors that moderate and mediate these effects, e.g., racial/ethnic      identity..      As we have begun to look at individual trajectories of self-esteem      across the transition to junior high school and beyond, we find      that there are seven different patterns of change in self-esteem      over time, not one. Only two of these self-esteem trajectories experience      immediate and dramatic declines in self-esteem across the transition      year even though they were relatively high in self-esteem before      commencing the transition to junior high school. These two trajectories      are not differentiated from the other two trajectories that began      high in self-esteem in terms of any personality or individual demographic      variables. On the other hand, the students constituting the trajectories      that declined dramatically were more likely to reside in under-resourced      neighborhoods and families. These families appeared too over taxed      to be able to provide the support needed for youth to successfully      make this difficult school transition.      Holistic Views of Family, Peers, and Neighborhood Settings           In a series of studies, we have looked holistically at youth perceived      daily hassles, social support, and involvement with family, peer,      and neighborhood (Seidman et al., 1998, 1999). Within each setting      youth describe a series of dramatically different constellations      of perceived transactions. These different constellations of transactions      place youth at differential levels of risk/protection, in terms,      of self-esteem, depression, and antisocial behavior. When we examine      the joint effects of family and peer profiles on self-esteem, we      find a strong association between family and peer profiles that      are similar, yet peer transactions also partially mediate the association      between family transactions and self-esteem (Roberts et al., 2000).      Contextual Competence      Most recently, we have uncovered nine distinct constellations      of youths' behavioral and perceptual self-reports of engagement      and performance with peer, school, athletic, employment, cultural,      and religious contexts when they are 16 to 17 years of age. We refer      to these as profiles of contextual competence (Pedersen et al.,      under review). Overall, profiles with high engagement in only a      single context, such as religion or athletics, do not buffer youths      from negative developmental outcomes. Profiles representing high      engagement and performance with two or more contexts are associated      with higher self-esteem and lower depression. At the same time,      profiles marked by high engagement in the risky contexts of athletics      or employment are associated with greater delinquency. These results      have important implications for planning of services by youth organizations.      Using these profiles of contextual competence in conjunction with      the youth's time diaries, we plan to examine the association between      profile and time use. We also plan to examine the direct and indirect      effects of family and peer transactions during early adolescence      on the profiles of contextual competence that emerge in middle adolescence.           Intervention and Policy      Our research on school transitions has lead to evidence-based      major policy recommendations for educational reform (Seidman, Aber,      & French, 2003; Seidman, in preparation). We have found that the      transition to the junior high school is riskier than the transition      to senior high school because a greater developmental mismatch occurs      at the time of the transition to junior high school. That is, early      adolescents experience numerous biological, cognitive, emotional,      and social changes. These changes occur at a time when students      make the shift from an elementry school setting in which all the      students and teachers are known to each other to one in which they      are shuffled from one unfamiliar teacher and set of classmates to      another classroom every 40 minutes. Our findings, in conjunction      with other literature, lead us to recommend that: a) more resources      and attention be directed toward the organization of schooling during      early adolescence; b) ideally, early adolescents should attend K-8      schools; and c) when K-8 schools are not feasible, middle grades      schools need to be reorganized into smaller and more stable environments      attuned to the developmental needs of early adolescents to maintain      their engagement in the educational enterprise.           back to the top                     Biography           Education      University of Kentucky (Ph.D., 1969; Clinical Psychology & Medical      Behavioral Science)      Temple University (MA, 1965; Psychology)      Pennsylvania State University (BS, 1963; Psychology)     Selected Honors and Awards      Resident Scholar (2001), Rockefeller Foundation's Bellagio Center      (Italy)           Ethnic Minority Mentorship Award (2001), The Society for Community      Research and Action: A Division of the APA           Outstanding Alumnus Award (sustained excellence in research, teaching,      and service) (2000), University of Kentucky           Outstanding Contributions to Education and Training in Community      Research and Action (Inaugural Award) (1999), Council of Program                Directors in Community Research & Action           Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award (1990), The Society      for Community Research and Action: A Division of the APA President,                Division of Community Psychology (1987), APA      Exemplary Project-Adolescent Diversion Project (1978), Child Welfare      Information Exchange, U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare      Fulbright-Hays Senior Research Scholar (1977 - 1978), University      of Athens (Greece)      Consulting Psychology Research Award, First Prize (1976), Division      of Consulting Psychology, APA      Exemplary Project-Community-Based Adolescent Diversion Program      (1975), National Institute of Law Enforcement Administration Agency,      U.S. Dept. of Justice      Vicarious Awards      My doctoral students have received first prize for their dissertations      five different times - twice from the Society for the Psychological      Study of Social Issues, twice from the Division of Consulting Psychology,      and once from the Society for Community Research and Action.           back to the top                         Selected Publications      Adolescent Development in the Urban Context      Pedersen, S., Seidman, E., Yoshikawa, H., Rivera, A., Allen, L.,      & Aber, J.L.
