DNA damage and errors in DNA replication, recombination and repair, and epigenetic mechanisms all contribute to genomic instability and tumor progression. Many of the basic aspects of genome integrity such as how cells sense and process damage and how epigenetic marks are propagated, are still not understood. Insights into these processes will require a fundamental understanding of genome biology along with the use of model systems.   The genome integrity training program will harness the growing strength in genome research at the NYU SOM and the NYU downtown campus to prepare students for modern research in genome biology and its application to human disease. The program aims at a) providing in depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which cells detect, signal, and repair DNA damage to ensure faithful chromosome propagation and b) understanding how these mechanisms function in the context of tissue homeostasis and cellular and organismal fitness. The program builds on a strong core of researchers with expertise in multiple aspects of genome biology across a broad range of research areas including Cancer biology, Immunology, and Stem Cell research.
