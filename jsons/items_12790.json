Bloggers, Tweeters, aspiring TV talking heads and print reporters will learn how to cut through the noise and produce reporting that stands out, makes a difference.and gives them an edge in a crowded field.   The emphasis is on New York City-based fieldwork resulting in a capstone, semester-long investigative project of your choosing that is worthy of publication. You will learn how to develop ideas for a project, find and cultivate sources, pitch and write the story in a clear, compelling and fair fashion while adhering to the highest standards of accuracy and objectivity. You will see how to mine the records of courthouses, police agencies, property clerks, health agencies, City Hall, campaign finance, tax authorities and other municipal, nonprofit and law-enforcement offices for exclusive material. Your aim will be to produce a story that sheds a light on a little-known or hidden topic with important implications for the public and readers.

Bloggers, Tweeters, aspiring TV talking heads and print reporters will learn how to cut through the noise and produce reporting that stands out, makes a difference.and gives them an edge in a crowded field.   The emphasis is on New York City-based fieldwork resulting in a capstone, semester-long investigative project of your choosing that is worthy of publication. You will learn how to develop ideas for a project, find and cultivate sources, pitch and write the story in a clear, compelling and fair fashion while adhering to the highest standards of accuracy and objectivity. You will see how to mine the records of courthouses, police agencies, property clerks, health agencies, City Hall, campaign finance, tax authorities and other municipal, nonprofit and law-enforcement offices for exclusive material. Your aim will be to produce a story that sheds a light on a little-known or hidden topic with important implications for the public and readers.

The award supports a work of journalism in any medium on significant underreported subjects in the public interest. The Reporting Award's first recipient, Sarah Stillman , returned to Iraq -- and made her first trip to Afghanistan -- to pursue an investigative reporting project on the wars' third-country nationals. The second recipient, Jina Moore , investigated so-called \"vulture funds,\" distressed debt investors who purchase delinquent debt of sovereign nations, many of them poor.   Sarah Stillman's piece, \" The Invisible Army ,\" appeared in the June 6, 2011 issue of The New Yorker. Sarah was a visiting scholar and inaugural recipient in 2010 of the Journalism Institute's Reporting Award. Using funds from the Award, which funds articles on under-reported subjects in the public interest, she reported in Iraq and Afghanistan on the plight of foreign workers on U.S. military bases there.   Subsequent awards have supported reporting on the following topics: Haitian earthquake victims; California farm workers; social services denial of parental rights for the mentally ill; the business of medical data collection; and the effect of coastal zoning and climate change on residents in northern New England.   In establishing the award, the Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s faculty cited the need for encouraging enterprise journalism during a time of extensive layoffs and budget cuts throughout the journalism industry. The American Society of News Editors has reported the loss of 16,200 full-time newspaper editorial jobs from 2003 to 2012, while Ad Age reports the loss of 38,000 magazine positions. These numbers are only partially offset by the growth of about 5,000 jobs at digital news organizations, as reported by the Pew Research Center.   \"The severe reduction in resources has a negative impact on all kinds of reporting, but especially investigative because of the high cost of doing it well,\" said Stephen D. Solomon , associate director of the Institute. \"Support provided by the Reporting Award and other nontraditional sources can help fill in some of the gaps.\"   The Institute will select up to two winners of the Reporting Award. Each winner may receive a different amount of money, at the discretion of the Committee. The maximum award is $12,500. The award is divided into two payments. Each winner will receive an advance of $2,500 on acceptance of the proposal and the signing of the agreement, and is eligible to receive the balance of the agreed-upon award on completion and acceptance of the Work by the November 1, 2015 deadline, provided the Institute\u2019s Awards Committee judges the work acceptable.\u00a0The winner also has use of the Institute\u2019s facilities as well as NYU\u2019s libraries and other scholarly resources. The Institute expects that the completed work will be published in a reputable media outlet of wide circulation.   \u00a0   View the Reporting Award's recipients .

We will explore how to take advantage of the two main sources of information\u2014documents and people\u2014and discuss when and how to use computer data to both enhance a story or provide the foundation for a major project. Throughout the course, the goal will be to constantly delve beneath the surface. Going deep is the essence of investigative reporting, which pulls together all publicly available information, as well as harder-to-find material, to present the fullest possible picture. Corporations and powerful individuals employ armies of PR experts, lawyers and lobbyists to ensure that only their version of reality prevails, and it is the lonely duty of journalists to dispel this fog of self-interest. At least as important as mastering the technical skills will be learning to think critically and skeptically. The relentlessly upbeat press release, the carefully worded SEC filing or the late-Friday-afternoon earnings statement each, as a matter of course, should be probed for accuracy and omission. What important development went unsaid? Did the company chairman really resign to \u201cspend more time with his family\u201d?   \u00a0   Open to BER students only.                                               Arthur L.

Bloggers, Tweeters, aspiring TV talking heads and print reporters will learn how to cut through the noise and produce reporting that stands out, makes a difference.and gives them an edge in a crowded field.   The emphasis is on New York City-based fieldwork resulting in a capstone, semester-long investigative project of your choosing that is worthy of publication. You will learn how to develop ideas for a project, find and cultivate sources, pitch and write the story in a clear, compelling and fair fashion while adhering to the highest standards of accuracy and objectivity. You will see how to mine the records of courthouses, police agencies, property clerks, health agencies, City Hall, campaign finance, tax authorities and other municipal, nonprofit and law-enforcement offices for exclusive material. Your aim will be to produce a story that sheds a light on a little-known or hidden topic with important implications for the public and readers.

The award supports a work of journalism in any medium on significant underreported subjects in the public interest. The Reporting Award's first recipient, Sarah Stillman , returned to Iraq -- and made her first trip to Afghanistan -- to pursue an investigative reporting project on the wars' third-country nationals. The second recipient, Jina Moore , investigated so-called \"vulture funds,\" distressed debt investors who purchase delinquent debt of sovereign nations, many of them poor.   Sarah Stillman's piece, \" The Invisible Army ,\" appeared in the June 6, 2011 issue of The New Yorker. Sarah was a visiting scholar and inaugural recipient in 2010 of the Journalism Institute's Reporting Award. Using funds from the Award, which funds articles on under-reported subjects in the public interest, she reported in Iraq and Afghanistan on the plight of foreign workers on U.S. military bases there.   Subsequent awards have supported reporting on the following topics: Haitian earthquake victims; California farm workers; social services denial of parental rights for the mentally ill; the business of medical data collection; and the effect of coastal zoning and climate change on residents in northern New England.   In establishing the award, the Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s faculty cited the need for encouraging enterprise journalism during a time of extensive layoffs and budget cuts throughout the journalism industry. The American Society of News Editors has reported the loss of 16,200 full-time newspaper editorial jobs from 2003 to 2012, while Ad Age reports the loss of 38,000 magazine positions. These numbers are only partially offset by the growth of about 5,000 jobs at digital news organizations, as reported by the Pew Research Center.   \"The severe reduction in resources has a negative impact on all kinds of reporting, but especially investigative because of the high cost of doing it well,\" said Stephen D. Solomon , associate director of the Institute. \"Support provided by the Reporting Award and other nontraditional sources can help fill in some of the gaps.\"   The Institute will select up to two winners of the Reporting Award. Each winner may receive a different amount of money, at the discretion of the Committee. The maximum award is $12,500. The award is divided into two payments. Each winner will receive an advance of $2,500 on acceptance of the proposal and the signing of the agreement, and is eligible to receive the balance of the agreed-upon award on completion and acceptance of the Work by the November 1, 2015 deadline, provided the Institute\u2019s Awards Committee judges the work acceptable.\u00a0The winner also has use of the Institute\u2019s facilities as well as NYU\u2019s libraries and other scholarly resources. The Institute expects that the completed work will be published in a reputable media outlet of wide circulation.   \u00a0   View the Reporting Award's recipients .

We will explore how to take advantage of the two main sources of information\u2014documents and people\u2014and discuss when and how to use computer data to both enhance a story or provide the foundation for a major project. Throughout the course, the goal will be to constantly delve beneath the surface. Going deep is the essence of investigative reporting, which pulls together all publicly available information, as well as harder-to-find material, to present the fullest possible picture. Corporations and powerful individuals employ armies of PR experts, lawyers and lobbyists to ensure that only their version of reality prevails, and it is the lonely duty of journalists to dispel this fog of self-interest. At least as important as mastering the technical skills will be learning to think critically and skeptically. The relentlessly upbeat press release, the carefully worded SEC filing or the late-Friday-afternoon earnings statement each, as a matter of course, should be probed for accuracy and omission. What important development went unsaid? Did the company chairman really resign to \u201cspend more time with his family\u201d?   \u00a0   Open to BER students only.                                               Arthur L.
