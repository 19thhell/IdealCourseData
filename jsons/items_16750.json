See this page for examples of non-business courses approved for the co-concentration.

Any 8 units (or more) of course work in a single foreign language will count as one of the two electives for the co-major/concentration. Note: Students may also take any 6-credit intensive language course (e.g. FREN-UA 10, Intensive Elementary French I) to satisfy this requirement.   Non-foreign Language  In general, a non-business elective is one that has some significant impact on business practices of the 21st century. The undergraduate faculty adviser evaluates courses for appropriateness. To request a course evaluation, the international business undergraduate adviser would need to receive the syllabus of the course, in-person or via e-mail, and a description of the request. Applicable courses may, but are not limited to, be offered through the College of Arts and Science , Wagner Graduate School of Public Service , and Tisch School of the Arts .

Students who intend to pursue a career in multinational firms, financial institutions, international organizations, or government agencies are strongly advised to acquire a solid perspective on the global dimensions of business, alongside their functional area of concentration. This insight has been the basis of the continued popularity of global business as a specialization in the MBA program. The Stern School has one of the largest faculties conducting research on the global dimensions of business which helps to support a broad spectrum of internationally focused courses. These courses consider important functional issues such as international trade and international macroeconomic relationships; international accounting and taxation; international marketing; and international banking and finance. They also convey specific skills such as international financial management and international negotiations. The global business specialization builds on the international content of the MBA core, notably the Global Economy course.
