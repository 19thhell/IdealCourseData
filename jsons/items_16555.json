Welcome to Revue     Welcome to the official blog of the program in Educational Theatre at New York University. The Program in Educational Theatre was founded in 1966 and since that time has provided opportunities for students to develop artistry in traditional and non-traditional performance spaces. In Educational Theatre, we are theatre makers\u2014and regardless of the population with whom we collaborate, whether it is teachers or students or members of a community, the essence of our work is to do with art and process. This blog shares ideas, stories, articles and the latest information from the field of Educational Theatre, where art-making meets education.

Welcome to Revue     Welcome to the official blog of the program in Educational Theatre at New York University. The Program in Educational Theatre was founded in 1966 and since that time has provided opportunities for students to develop artistry in traditional and non-traditional performance spaces. In Educational Theatre, we are theatre makers\u2014and regardless of the population with whom we collaborate, whether it is teachers or students or members of a community, the essence of our work is to do with art and process. This blog shares ideas, stories, articles and the latest information from the field of Educational Theatre, where art-making meets education.

Friss                H istory             The University of the City of New-York was founded on April 18, 1831    during a period of major commercial growth for the city. The founders    of what would be renamed New York University in 1896 sought to create    a modern institution that broke with religious, classical, and sectarian    traditions. The founders, led by President Albert Gallatin, issued a manifesto,    &#8220;Considerations Upon the Expediency and the Means of Establishing    a University in the City of New-York,&#8221; which stressed the need for    prac tical study to prepare citizens for participation in city life.    Chancellor James M. Mathews led the University through its formative    years. Much smaller than it is today, the faculty included five professors    and seven part-time instructors. Annual tuition was $80, while room and    board were two dollars a week. Classes were held in rented rooms in Clinton    Hall, a facility located near City Hall. By 1835, the University was able    to build a home of its own in Washington Square&#8212;the neo-Gothic University    Building. This structure became home to artists, writers, and inventors    associated with the university. Here Samuel F.B. Morse constructed his    telegraph and John W. Draper worked on his daguerreotypes.    The University continued to grow and thrive intermittently throughout    the 19th and the 20th century. Chancellor Henry Mitchell MacCracken (1891-1910)    catapulted the University into the modern era, replacing the University    Building with the more modern Main Building (1895) and fostering the expansion    of the Schools of Law, Medicine, Engineering, and the new professional    schools, such as the Graduate School of Arts and Science (1886). Most    importantly, MacCracken rejuvenated the undergraduate division by establishing    a new campus uptown on an estate in the Bronx.    Freed from the confines of the city, the University Heights campus contained    lecture halls, laboratories, athletic fields, a gymnasium, and dormitories    for undergraduate and engineering students. Stanford White, architect    of the Washington Square Arch, designed much of the campus, including    his masterpiece&#8212;Gould Library (named for railroad giant Jay Gould).       The opening of University Heights had a ripple effect over the whole    school; NYU grew at a fast pace, opening several professional schools,    including the School of Commerce (now the Leonard N. Stern School of Business)    (1900), and an expanded School of Dentistry (1865/1925). Enrollment steadily    increased, especially with the establishment of the four-year, coed Washington    Square College in 1914. By the late 1940s, NYU enrolled more than 40,000    students and employed about 2,000 faculty.    This growth soon proved to be too much for NYU to sustain. Financial    difficulties forced the University to sell the uptown campus in 1973.    However, this sale, as well as the sale of the C.F. Mueller Company, a    pasta company that NYU owned in a trust fund, allowed the University to    refurbish and develop its Washington Square campus. The University constructed    the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, named after the philanthropist and pharmaceutical    executive. The library not only provided a central location for the campus    but consolidated the Library collections which were scattered in 36 separate    areas.
