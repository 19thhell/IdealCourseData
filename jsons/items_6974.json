Description       Long before the current vogue for eco-living, recycling, and repurposing, there have been people surviving with little fanfare on leftovers and discards, and theorists meditating on the revolutionary possibilities of refuse and junk. This seminar introduces students to the work of Walter Benjamin, who is both a central figure in critical theory and an early, powerful commentator on the politics and aesthetics of the cast-off. We begin the course with Agn\u00e8s Varda\u2019s film The Gleaners and I , and we continue to explore the relation between theory and the collecting and recycling of ideas, images, and objects, especially those that have been overlooked or abandoned. What, if anything, do ragpickers or dumpster divers have to teach us about subjects as large as theory, history, modernity, and the city? Our primary text is Benjamin's expansive and unfinished work of citations and brief commentaries, The Arcades Project (1927-1940), but we consider the work of other 19th and 20th century collectors and archivists. We read widely from Freud, Marx, and the Frankfurt School, with additional materials ranging from the photographs of Eug\u00e8ne Atget to the films of Chris Marker. What did Benjamin and the moderns make of dross, and what can we glean from their thought for our own times?

Open to advanced undergraduates with permission of the instructor (jack.tchen@nyu.edu).                    Description       This is an intensive research seminar \u201cdecolonizing\u201d knowledge and building on the students' own subaltern archival work, with the goal of producing publishable essays. As part of the &quot;hidden&quot; organizing work of groups excluded and marginalized from dominant normalizing political cultures, collectors and their collections are a foundational yet largely unrecognized group of cultural activists. This course will examine our own subject positions and our gleanings, visit collectors and their collections, and examine critical writings related to collecting, making presence, and the political culture of knowledge-making. Agnes Varda\u2019s documentaries\u00a0 The Gleaners and I \u00a0and\u00a0 Two Years Later \u00a0will serve as a starting point for the class. Readings will likely include: essays by James Hevia, Dominick LaCapra, Bruno Latour, and Ann Stoler; and selections from: Ann Cvetkovich,\u00a0 An Archive of Feelings \u00a0, Jacques Derrida,\u00a0 Archive Fever \u00a0, Richards,\u00a0 The Imperial Archive \u00a0, Linda Tuhiwai Smith,\u00a0 Decolonizing Methodologies \u00a0, and Diana Taylor,\u00a0 The Archive and the Repertoire \u00a0.

Description       Long before the current vogue for eco-living, recycling, and repurposing, there have been people surviving with little fanfare on leftovers and discards, and theorists meditating on the revolutionary possibilities of refuse and junk. This seminar introduces students to the work of Walter Benjamin, who is both a central figure in critical theory and an early, powerful commentator on the politics and aesthetics of the cast-off. We begin the course with Agn\u00e8s Varda\u2019s film The Gleaners and I , and we continue to explore the relation between theory and the collecting and recycling of ideas, images, and objects, especially those that have been overlooked or abandoned. What, if anything, do ragpickers or dumpster divers have to teach us about subjects as large as theory, history, modernity, and the city? Our primary text is Benjamin's expansive and unfinished work of citations and brief commentaries, The Arcades Project (1927-1940), but we consider the work of other 19th and 20th century collectors and archivists. We read widely from Freud, Marx, and the Frankfurt School, with additional materials ranging from the photographs of Eug\u00e8ne Atget to the films of Chris Marker. What did Benjamin and the moderns make of dross, and what can we glean from their thought for our own times?

Description       Long before the current vogue for eco-living, recycling, and repurposing, there have been people surviving with little fanfare on leftovers and discards, and theorists meditating on the revolutionary possibilities of refuse and junk. This seminar will introduce students to the work of Walter Benjamin, who is both a central figure in critical theory and an early, powerful commentator on the politics and aesthetics of the cast-off. We begin the course with Agnes Varda's film The Gleaners and I, and we will continue to explore the relation between theory and the collecting and recycling of ideas, images, and objects, especially those that have been overlooked or abandoned. What, if anything, do ragpickers or dumpster divers have to teach us about subjects as large as theory, history, modernity, and the city? Our primary text will be Benjamin's expansive and unfinished work of citations and brief commentaries, The Arcades Project (1927-1940), but we will consider the work of other 19th and 20th century collectors and archivists. Texts include the poems of Baudelaire and Aragon, the theory of Freud, the short stories of Walser, the photographs of Blossfeldt and Atget, the Mnemosyne-Atlas of Warburg. What did Benjamin and these moderns make of dross, and what can we glean from their thought for our own times?
