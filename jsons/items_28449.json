Students will learn: image processing, animated images, sound file management, digital audio recording and editing, video and movie processing, and DVD production. Elements of live performance multimedia production will be introduced for application in the afternoon workshop. Workshops for Dance and Movement Concepts of modern dance incorporate floorwork, traveling combinations, improvisation, and composition studies. Participants will understand the importance of proper alignment, breath support, flow and will increase their ability to move with passion. Participants will be challenged to find new ways of moving, to expand their movement potential, and to develop their unique style within the framework of the workshops and final production.    Workshops for Music and Sound Participants focus on integrative and collaborative techniques.    Workshops for Visual Elements Activities include experiences for technological, visual and video developers who will explore image and video applications, live and processed, including technological applications suitable for mixed media, intermedia, and multimedia. Workshops for Sound Elements Activities pursue sound design in relationship to multimedia environments, including microphones, speaker placement, spatial considerations and site specific setup procedures, suitable for mixed media, intermedia, and multimedia. Workshops for Collaborative Process Applications of techniques from the above workshops.

Elements of live performance multimedia production will be introduced for application in the afternoon workshop. Workshops for Dance and Movement Concepts of modern dance incorporate floorwork, traveling combinations, improvisation, and composition studies. Participants will understand the importance of proper alignment, breath support, flow and will increase their ability to move with passion. Participants will be challenged to find new ways of moving, to expand their movement potential, and to develop their unique style within the framework of the workshops and final production.    Workshops for Music and Sound Participants focus on integrative and collaborative techniques.    Workshops for Visual Elements Activities include experiences for technological, visual and video developers who will explore image and video applications, live and processed, including technological applications suitable for mixed media, intermedia, and multimedia. Workshops for Sound Elements Activities pursue sound design in relationship to multimedia environments, including microphones, speaker placement, spatial considerations and site specific setup procedures, suitable for mixed media, intermedia, and multimedia. Workshops for Collaborative Process Applications of techniques from the above workshops. Collaborative teams are formed and students collaborate to develop multimedia works to be presented in the final performance.

Elements of live performance multimedia production will be introduced for application in the afternoon workshop. Workshops for Dance and Movement Concepts of modern dance incorporate floorwork, traveling combinations, improvisation, and composition studies. Participants will understand the importance of proper alignment, breath support, flow and will increase their ability to move with passion. Participants will be challenged to find new ways of moving, to expand their movement potential, and to develop their unique style within the framework of the workshops and final production.    Workshops for Music and Sound Participants focus on integrative and collaborative techniques.    Workshops for Visual Elements Activities include experiences for technological, visual and video developers who will explore image and video applications, live and processed, including technological applications suitable for mixed media, intermedia, and multimedia. Workshops for Sound Elements Activities pursue sound design in relationship to multimedia environments, including microphones, speaker placement, spatial considerations and site specific setup procedures, suitable for mixed media, intermedia, and multimedia. Workshops for Collaborative Process Applications of techniques from the above workshops. Collaborative teams are formed and students collaborate to develop multimedia works to be presented in the final performance.
