Additional information  may be obtained from departmental advisers and from the College  Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130.      Honors      Dean's Honors List    A Dean's Honors List  is compiled at the end of each academic year, in June. This is an  honors roll of matriculated students who have achieved an average of  3.65 or higher for that academic year (September to May) in at least  28 graded points. To be listed, a student must not have any grades of  Incomplete or N at the time the list is compiled. Note that  grade point averages are carried to two decimal places (but are not  rounded off).      Honorary Societies  in Arts and Science    Any student seeking to  join a departmental scholastic honorary society is required to  maintain, as a minimum scholastic requirement for election to  membership, a general average of 3.50, as well as an average in the  major subject of 3.50. Students should consult with departmental  advisers in regard to the specific requirements for the various  departmental honor societies.      Phi Beta Kappa    Phi Beta Kappa  celebrates and advocates excellence in the liberal arts and sciences.      The Phi Beta Kappa  Society invites for induction the most outstanding arts and science  students in America's leading colleges and universities. NYU's  College of Arts and Science chapter, the Beta of New York, was  established in 1858. In terms of seniority, it ranks as the 15th  oldest chapter of the Society.      Each April, the faculty  members of the Beta chapter automatically review the academic  performance of all students in the College for eligibility for  election to Phi Beta Kappa.      Eligibility for  Graduation With Latin Honors    To be graduated with honors, a student must have at least 64 points earned in courses from CAS, GSAS and selected Tisch departments. All graded courses taken while enrolled either in the College or in another school of NYU will be used in computing the grade point average on which Latin honors are based, as long as the 64 point residency requirement is met. Pass/\"P\" grades are not counted; grades received in courses taken at other institutions are also not counted. The student must also have a clean record of conduct.      Effective with the September 2008 graduating class, the GPA cutoffs for each category are determined by the combined GPA distribution from the preceding academic year, all graduation moments included. The cutoff for summa cum laude is the GPA included within the top 5 percent of the previous year's graduating class. The cutoff for magna cum laude is the GPA included within the next 10 percent of the previous year's class. The cutoff for cum laude is the GPA included within the next 15 percent of the previous year's class. For example, the necessary GPA level for summa cum laude for students graduating in September 2008 will be based on the GPA cutoff for the top 5 percent of the combined graduates from September 2007, January 2008, and May 2008.          Departmental Honors    Students who have  completed at least 64 points of graded work in the College may be  awarded degrees with departmental honors if they complete the  designated honors sequence in a department and maintain the requisite  grade point average. There are three levels: honors, high honors, and  highest honors.      Students seeking  admission to and graduation with departmental honors are expected to  have a minimum grade point average of 3.65, both overall and in the  major. Departments may exercise some flexibility in admissions, as  follows. In rare cases where a candidate for admission to a  departmental honors program falls short of the expected minimum GPA,  the director of undergraduate studies or the director of departmental  honors may petition the director of college honors for an exception.  In all cases, once admitted, students are expected to maintain the  GPA at the stipulated level in order to graduate with departmental  honors. Should there be an exceptional circumstance in which the  stipulated GPA is not maintained, the director of college honors may  be petitioned for an exception. If the case is compelling, the latter  will inform the registrar's office of the waiver.      Honors programs must,  minimally, be a two-term (8-point) experience that includes a  capstone research project. The capstone project, which typically  culminates in a thesis, should reflect sustained original research  over two semesters. The scope and length of a thesis will vary by  discipline, but the thesis is typically 40 to 60 pages in length. All students completing  departmental honors must make public presentations of their work,  preferably at the CAS Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) held at  the end of the academic year, or in a departmental forum (e.g., oral  defenses or presentations) held in conjunction with the URC.      Students with double  majors in discrete, unrelated disciplines must complete honors  programs in each major for which they seek honors. Students with  double majors in interdisciplinary or related fields may, if the two  departments concur, convene a joint honors committee to establish an  interdisciplinary research program of course work that culminates in  a single thesis. Similarly, in the case of joint majors, the relevant  departments must work out an agreement on the requirements for honors  and on the supervision and evaluation of students' theses or  projects.      Presidential Honors  Scholars    Membership in the  Presidential Honors Scholars at the College of Arts and Science  offers outstanding students the opportunity to receive special  advising from College faculty and staff, to challenge themselves in  honors courses and through independent research, to study away, to  take advantage of New York City's cultural resources, and to  develop leadership skills through community service. Scholars  comprise a distinguished group of undergraduates; only the top 10  percent of the entering class are chosen, and students who apply for  entry after they have matriculated must demonstrate not only  superlative academic achievements but also a consistent record of  leadership and service to the community.      Freshmen appointed on  the basis of their high school records participate in a Scholars  Seminar. They meet regularly for lectures and discussions and  participate in a wide variety of cocurricular activities. These  include the Scholars Lecture Series, cultural events in the city,  social events, and community service projects. Scholars also register  for a Freshman Honors Seminar. During the January intersession,  freshman scholars travel with faculty mentors to Villa La Pietra in  Florence, Italy. Sophomore scholars also participate in a study away  spring break, choosing a destination that most closely relates to  their academic or personal interests. During their junior or senior  year, scholars spend an entire semester (or year) studying at one of  NYU's programs or exchanges away. In their junior and senior years,  they also enroll in the honors track of their chosen major. In  addition, Presidential Honors Scholars are committed to volunteering  and serving in the community.      Membership in the  Scholars Program is renewable annually, depending on the quality of  the scholar's academic records and his or her level of  participation in the program. All scholars are expected to be  full-time students and maintain a grade point average of at least  3.65. Students who are not designated as Presidential Honors Scholars  for the freshman year are invited to apply for membership at the end  of the spring semester.      Further information is  available from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver  Center, Room 909 (212-998-8140) or from the Office of Undergraduate  Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor (212-998-4540).         Martin Luther King,  Jr., Scholars Program    Since its inception in  1987, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Scholars Program has awarded over  400 need-based and merit scholarships to incoming freshmen at NYU.  These students present records of outstanding academic achievement,  leadership, and commitment to the principles of community service,  humanitarianism, and social progress. MLK Scholars help to plan and  participate in academic and cultural events that draw on the vast  resources of New York University and New York City. They explore  cultural diversity through domestic and international travel and take  the lead in helping others through community service.      Women in Science  Program    The Women in Science  (WINS) Program selects and supports a core group of talented,  motivated women from each entering class who are interested in a  career path focused on science and math research. These women, WINS  Scholars, will have the opportunity to participate in a program of  study, research, and mentoring specifically tailored to their chosen  academic path. WINS Scholars are offered certain specialized courses  and invitations to events with notable women in the science and math  professions, as well as both a financial scholarship and a research  stipend. Information is available from the College's  Preprofessional Center (Silver Center, Room 901; 212-998-8160).      Lewis Rudin City  Scholars    Rudin Scholars are  outstanding entering freshmen selected from public and parochial high  schools in all five boroughs of New York City. In addition to their  scholarship, the scholars participate in academic and cultural  activities in New York City. The program is named in honor of the  late real estate developer Lewis Rudin, former president of the  Association for a Better New York and an NYU alumnus and trustee.

{"detail": [{"content": "Honors and Awards, College of Arts and Science Bulletin | NYU                                                  Navigation       College of Arts and Science Bulletin                 About Arts and Science | Departments and Programs | The Faculty             Home &gt; Honors and Awards         Honors and Awards            Matriculated students  with superior academic records are honored in various ways, such as  by placement on the Dean's Honors List, election  to honor societies, and admission to departmental honors programs.      Additional information  may be obtained from departmental advisers and from the College  Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130.      Honors      Dean's Honors List    A Dean's Honors List  is compiled at the end of each academic year, in June. This is an  honors roll of matriculated students who have achieved an average of  3.65 or higher for that academic year (September to May) in at least  28 graded points. To be listed, a student must not have any grades of  Incomplete or N at the time the list is compiled. Note that  grade point averages are carried to two decimal places (but are not  rounded off).      Honorary Societies  in Arts and Science    Any student seeking to  join a departmental scholastic honorary society is required to  maintain, as a minimum scholastic requirement for election to  membership, a general average of 3.50, as well as an average in the  major subject of 3.50. Students should consult with departmental  advisers in regard to the specific requirements for the various  departmental honor societies.      Phi Beta Kappa    Phi Beta Kappa  celebrates and advocates excellence in the liberal arts and sciences.      The Phi Beta Kappa  Society invites for induction the most outstanding arts and science  students in America's leading colleges and universities. NYU's  College of Arts and Science chapter, the Beta of New York, was  established in 1858. In terms of seniority, it ranks as the 15th  oldest chapter of the Society.      Each April, the faculty  members of the Beta chapter automatically review the academic  performance of all students in the College for eligibility for  election to Phi Beta Kappa.      Eligibility for  Graduation With Latin Honors    To be graduated with honors, a student must have at least 64 points earned in courses from CAS, GSAS and selected Tisch departments. All graded courses taken while enrolled either in the College or in another school of NYU will be used in computing the grade point average on which Latin honors are based, as long as the 64 point residency requirement is met. Pass/\"P\" grades are not counted; grades received in courses taken at other institutions are also not counted. The student must also have a clean record of conduct.      Effective with the September 2008 graduating class, the GPA cutoffs for each category are determined by the combined GPA distribution from the preceding academic year, all graduation moments included. The cutoff for summa cum laude is the GPA included within the top 5 percent of the previous year's graduating class. The cutoff for magna cum laude is the GPA included within the next 10 percent of the previous year's class. The cutoff for cum laude is the GPA included within the next 15 percent of the previous year's class. For example, the necessary GPA level for summa cum laude for students graduating in September 2008 will be based on the GPA cutoff for the top 5 percent of the combined graduates from September 2007, January 2008, and May 2008.          Departmental Honors    Students who have  completed at least 64 points of graded work in the College may be  awarded degrees with departmental honors if they complete the  designated honors sequence in a department and maintain the requisite  grade point average. There are three levels: honors, high honors, and  highest honors.      Students seeking  admission to and graduation with departmental honors are expected to  have a minimum grade point average of 3.65, both overall and in the  major. Departments may exercise some flexibility in admissions, as  follows. In rare cases where a candidate for admission to a  departmental honors program falls short of the expected minimum GPA,  the director of undergraduate studies or the director of departmental  honors may petition the director of college honors for an exception.  In all cases, once admitted, students are expected to maintain the  GPA at the stipulated level in order to graduate with departmental  honors. Should there be an exceptional circumstance in which the  stipulated GPA is not maintained, the director of college honors may  be petitioned for an exception. If the case is compelling, the latter  will inform the registrar's office of the waiver.      Honors programs must,  minimally, be a two-term (8-point) experience that includes a  capstone research project. The capstone project, which typically  culminates in a thesis, should reflect sustained original research  over two semesters. The scope and length of a thesis will vary by  discipline, but the thesis is typically 40 to 60 pages in length. All students completing  departmental honors must make public presentations of their work,  preferably at the CAS Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) held at  the end of the academic year, or in a departmental forum (e.g., oral  defenses or presentations) held in conjunction with the URC.      Students with double  majors in discrete, unrelated disciplines must complete honors  programs in each major for which they seek honors. Students with  double majors in interdisciplinary or related fields may, if the two  departments concur, convene a joint honors committee to establish an  interdisciplinary research program of course work that culminates in  a single thesis. Similarly, in the case of joint majors, the relevant  departments must work out an agreement on the requirements for honors  and on the supervision and evaluation of students' theses or  projects.      Presidential Honors  Scholars    Membership in the  Presidential Honors Scholars at the College of Arts and Science  offers outstanding students the opportunity to receive special  advising from College faculty and staff, to challenge themselves in  honors courses and through independent research, to study away, to  take advantage of New York City's cultural resources, and to  develop leadership skills through community service. Scholars  comprise a distinguished group of undergraduates; only the top 10  percent of the entering class are chosen, and students who apply for  entry after they have matriculated must demonstrate not only  superlative academic achievements but also a consistent record of  leadership and service to the community.      Freshmen appointed on  the basis of their high school records participate in a Scholars  Seminar. They meet regularly for lectures and discussions and  participate in a wide variety of cocurricular activities. These  include the Scholars Lecture Series, cultural events in the city,  social events, and community service projects. Scholars also register  for a Freshman Honors Seminar. During the January intersession,  freshman scholars travel with faculty mentors to Villa La Pietra in  Florence, Italy. Sophomore scholars also participate in a study away  spring break, choosing a destination that most closely relates to  their academic or personal interests. During their junior or senior  year, scholars spend an entire semester (or year) studying at one of  NYU's programs or exchanges away. In their junior and senior years,  they also enroll in the honors track of their chosen major. In  addition, Presidential Honors Scholars are committed to volunteering  and serving in the community.      Membership in the  Scholars Program is renewable annually, depending on the quality of  the scholar's academic records and his or her level of  participation in the program. All scholars are expected to be  full-time students and maintain a grade point average of at least  3.65. Students who are not designated as Presidential Honors Scholars  for the freshman year are invited to apply for membership at the end  of the spring semester.      Further information is  available from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver  Center, Room 909 (212-998-8140) or from the Office of Undergraduate  Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor (212-998-4540).         Martin Luther King,  Jr., Scholars Program    Since its inception in  1987, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Scholars Program has awarded over  400 need-based and merit scholarships to incoming freshmen at NYU.  These students present records of outstanding academic achievement,  leadership, and commitment to the principles of community service,  humanitarianism, and social progress. MLK Scholars help to plan and  participate in academic and cultural events that draw on the vast  resources of New York University and New York City. They explore  cultural diversity through domestic and international travel and take  the lead in helping others through community service.      Women in Science  Program    The Women in Science  (WINS) Program selects and supports a core group of talented,  motivated women from each entering class who are interested in a  career path focused on science and math research. These women, WINS  Scholars, will have the opportunity to participate in a program of  study, research, and mentoring specifically tailored to their chosen  academic path. WINS Scholars are offered certain specialized courses  and invitations to events with notable women in the science and math  professions, as well as both a financial scholarship and a research  stipend. Information is available from the College's  Preprofessional Center (Silver Center, Room 901; 212-998-8160).      Lewis Rudin City  Scholars    Rudin Scholars are  outstanding entering freshmen selected from public and parochial high  schools in all five boroughs of New York City. In addition to their  scholarship, the scholars participate in academic and cultural  activities in New York City. The program is named in honor of the  late real estate developer Lewis Rudin, former president of the  Association for a Better New York and an NYU alumnus and trustee.

Presidential Honors Scholars, Advanced Honors Seminars, and Departmental Honors programs are some of these opportunities (Freshman Honors Seminars are now required of all incoming CAS students; these courses remain rigorous and devoted to academic inquiry at a sophisticated level).      Presidential Honors Scholars           The top five percent of the entering class is invited to join; students may also apply for entry after they have matriculated, having demonstrated superlative academic achievement and a consistent record of leadership and service to the community. In this program, students will be able to: Receive special advising from College faculty and staff Challenge themselves in honors courses and through independent research Study abroad Take advantage of New York City's cultural resources, and develop leadership skills through community service.      Activities include: Scholars Lecture Series Cultural events in the city Community service projects Freshman Honors Seminar Study abroad intersession Trips    Scholars are admitted as freshmen directly from high school. Membership in the Scholars Program is renewable annually, depending on the quality of the scholar's academic records and his or her level of participation in the program. All scholars are expected to be full-time students and maintain a grade point average of at least 3.65.    Students interested in joining the program have the opportunity to apply in the spring term prior to their sophomore year. Applications are available in the Dean's office, Silver Center, Room 909, each year after spring break.    Freshman Seminars     This first-year requirement offers freshmen the opportunity to be in a small, intellectually stimulating class taught by a distinguished faculty member. Introduce students to demanding and challenging standards of analysis and argumentation, oral as well as written, by means of intensive discussion, papers on focused topics, and reading that emphasizes critical interpretation rather than absorption of information.      Except where noted, the seminars do not assume any specific course or background on the student's part. Each seminar is 4 points, and enrollment is limited to 18 students.       Advanced Honors Seminars    Established in response to the popularity and success of the Freshman Honors Seminars, the Advanced Honors Seminars are primarily designed for sophomores and juniors in the College. Offered in the spring of each year, they give students the same opportunity to come into direct contact with great ideas and great thinkers in small seminars taught by distinguished professors from throughout the University faculty. Each seminar is 4 credits and enrollment is usually limited to 18 students. Departmental Honors      Many departments and programs offer talented and highly motivated juniors and seniors the opportunity to take individual honors courses or to enroll in special honors programs that often culminate in the writing of a thesis under faculty supervision. See the individual departmental listings for further information.               WINS - Women in Science at NYU    A selective program for highly motivated women planning careers in science and mathematics    Did you know that there are more women than men at many liberal arts colleges but that nationally women are underrepresented in scientific and mathematical studies and research? To address this shortage, the College of Arts and Science at NYU has instituted the Women in Science (WINS) program that will capitalize on the talents of women undergraduates who are interested in careers that focus on research in science and math. A core group of women, WINS Scholars, are selected from each entering class whose interests and abilities are nurtured through a highly individualized program of study, research, and mentoring.   WINS seeks to foster the talents and support the aspirations of young women preparing for professional and academic careers that involve research in anthropology, bio-chemistry, biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, neural science, physics, or psychology.
