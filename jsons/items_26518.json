In most cases, the author or creator of the work is the copyright holder unless they have transferred the rights to someone else through a written agreement, such as a publishing agreement.   If the work is created as part of a person's employment, it may be a \"work for hire,\" meaning that the employer is the copyright holder. In the university setting, faculty writings and other \"traditional works of scholarship,\" such as syllabi and lecture materials are typically not considered to be works for hire.   If two or more people together create a work, they are joint holders of the copyright. Joint owners each have an equal right to exercise and enforce the copyright.                                               Introduction                   Welcome!

What is copyright?                 Copyright is a form of legal protection that provides authors of original creative works with limited control over the reproduction and distribution of their work. It gives copyright holders a set of exclusive rights to     reproduce the work, in whole or in part,   distribute copies of the work,   publicly perform the work,   publicly display the work, and   prepare derivative works based on the original, such as translations or adaptations.     These rights are subject to exceptions and limitations, such as \"fair use,\" which allow limited uses of works without the permission of the copyright holder.                                             What does copyright protect?                 Copyright protects \"original works of authorship.\" To be protected by copyright, a work must be original and recorded . It cannot be copied or expressed without being recorded.   Types of works protected by copyright include:     literary works   musical works   dramatic works   choreographic works   pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works   sound recordings   architectural works     What is not protected by copyright?     facts or ideas   titles, names, short phrases, or slogans   procedures, methods, systems or processes   works of the United States government   works that have passed into the public domain                                               How do works get copyrighted?                 Under U.S. law, works are protected by copyright automatically at the time of their creation. You are not required to put a copyright notice on the work ( e.g. &copy; 2010 New York University), to register the work with the U.S. Copyright Office, or to publish the work.   Although providing a copyright notice is not legally required, it can be a good idea to include one anyway if you are making your work publicly available. A copyright notice should provide a way for people who want to use your work to contact you, such as: \"&copy; 2010 [name]. For permissions and questions contact [address/email].\"                                             How can I tell if a work is still under copyright?                 Depending upon when a work was created, it is subject to different requirements regarding copyright notice and registration, as well as different copyright terms.   For example, before 1978 U.S. law required that works be published with a notice of copyright to receive protection. Failure to comply with this requirement would result in the work being in the public domain.   Copyright Term and the Public Domain , a guide to copyright duration created by Peter Hirtle at Cornell University, is a comprehensive and useful resource for researching a work's copyright status.   As a general rule, works registered or published in the U.S. before 1923 are in the public domain.

Under current U.S. law, copyright lasts until 70 years after the death of the author. For works made for hire, the copyright term is either 95 years from the date of publication, or 120 years from the date of creation, whichever is shorter.   After the copyright term expires, works pass into the public domain, meaning that anyone is free to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise re-use the work.                                             A Note on Public Domain                 Works that are in the public domain in the U.S. are not protected by copyright because     The author dedicated them to public use;   The copyright term has expired without renewal;   The work is of a type that does not qualify for copyright protection.     You can use any U.S. work in the public domain in any way that you want, as much as you want. They belong to the public. Keep in mind, however, that the requirements for public domain vary by country.   There are several great resources for finding and accessing materials in the public domain:     Project Gutenberg for books   Public Domain Information Project (PD Info) for music   OpenFlix for movies   See the Using Images page for great resources for images               Comments (0)                                              close                                                                                                          Applying Fair Use                                                                                  Classroom Exception                 Copyright law provides a classroom exception in section 110(1) that allows instructors to display or show entire copyrighted works during the course of a face-to-face classroom session. This exception exists independently of fair use and may be a more applicable option for exposing students to copyrighted material.   Keep in mind that the exception only applies to face-to-face instruction . Separate rules apply for material posted online for courses. See the section on Online Course Sites for more information.

In order to balance the interests of the creators of copyrighted works with the public's ability to benefit from those works, copyright law includes the exemption of Fair Use .   Fair use allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes such as criticism, parody, news reporting, research and scholarship, and teaching.   However, just because a use is educational does not mean that it automatically qualifies as fair use. Copyright law sets forth four factors, all of which must be considered when determining whether a use falls under fair use.

Duncan, S. K. Clement, and B. Rozum, 2013, in S. Davis-Kahl and M. K. Hensley (Eds.), Common ground at the nexus of information literacy and scholarly communication , p. 280. Copyright 2013 by the Association of College and Research Libraries. Adapted with permission.                                             Factor 1: Purpose & Character of Use                 As a general matter, educational, nonprofit, and personal uses are favored as fair uses. Making a commercial use of a work typically weighs against fair use, but a commmercial use does not automatically defeat a fair use claim.   \"Transformative\" uses are also favored as fair uses. A use is considered to be transformative when it     results in the creation of an entirely new work (as opposed to an adaptation of an existing work, which is merely derivative and not transformative); or   uses the original work for a new and different purpose.     Weighing in favor of fair use:     Showing a film during class for the purpose of criticism and comment   Creating a parody of an existing work - transformative   Using a book as a prop in a stage performance - transformative     Weighing against fair use:     Showing a film on campus for a party or other social gathering   Adapting an existing work to a new medium, such from book to film or television to stage   Reading from a book during the course of a stage performance                                               Factor 2: Nature of Copyrighted Work                 In general, published works and factual, non-fiction works are more likely to qualify for fair use. Unpublished works tend to receive more copyright protection because the law values the creator's right to decide how and when to distribute a work. Likewise, \"highly creative\" works (e.g., poetry, art, entertainment film, fiction novels) tend to receive more protection than factual, non-fiction works (e.g., documentary films, informational displays, educational texts) because the law seeks to provide maximum protection to a creator's artistic effort.   This does not mean, however, that unpublished works or highly creative works can never be used without permission. A determination of fair use depends on the balance of all four factors.   Weighing in favor of fair use:     A documentary film on the migration of Canadian geese   A poster outlining the structure of amino acids   A book explaining the economic ramifications of the Civil War     Weighing  against fair use:     A performance of Arthur Miller's The Crucible   A display of Ansel Adams's photographs   A showing of the latest Blockbuster film       Image Credit: [ Tibetan musical score ], Wellcome Library, London .                                              Factor 3: Amount and Substantiality                 The law does not set bright lines or absolute limits on how much of a work may be used to be considered fair use. Generally, the less of a work you use, the more likely it is to fall under fair use.   However, it is important to be aware that the this factor considers not just the quantity of what is used but also qualitatively assesses whether the use includes the so-called \"heart of the work.\" Even small portions may exceed fair use if the most notable or creative aspects of a work are used.   While using an entire work is less favored under the amount factor, there are nevertheless many instances in which doing so will still qualify as fair use. If you have a legitimate need to use an entire work-- e.g. an image that is being critiqued in a scholarly presentation--this may be appropriate and permissible as a fair use.   Weighing in favor of fair use:     Posting a 30-second clip of a film online for students to critique   Distributing a chapter of a text for class discussion   Displaying an entire painting for the purposes of commentary during a presentation     Weighing against fair use:     Posting an entire film online for students to view   Distributing copies (print or digital) of an entire text for class discussion   Playing audio of an entire symphony performance during a presentation on a subject completely unrelated to music                                               Factor 4: Effect Upon the Potential Market                 The final consideration is whether the use results in economic harm to the creator or copyright owner. In evaluating this factor, it is important to consider not just whether your particular use has a negative impact, but also whether widespread use of the same type would have an effect on the work's potential market.   Courts have established that licensing is part of the potential value of a copyrighted work ; evaluating this factor may require an investigation into whether there is a reasonably available licensing mechanism for the work. If so, this weighs against relying on fair use.   On the other hand, use of works that are considered \"out of commerce\" (e.g., out-of-print books) is more likely to be considered fair use.   Weighing in favor of fair use:      Distributing copies of significant portions of an out-of-print book for class discussion   Posting a journal article on a password-protected course website for supplemental reading   Showing a film that is no longer in distribution     Weighing against fair use:      Distributing copies of signficant portions of a required textbook for class discussion   Posting a journal article on the open web for supplemental reading   Showing a film that is currently in distribution and available for licensing                                               Fitting the Factors Together                   Image Credit: Puzzle , Olga Berrios on Flickr   As you go through the four factors for fair use, it is important to keep in mind that all the factors work together in balance. It is not all or nothing. Lack of one factor is not likely to disqualify a use for fair use. Likewise, a use may contain elements of all factors and still not qualify as fair use.   The purpose in using the four-factor analysis is to weigh those factors as a whole to determine if the balance is tipped in the direction of fair use. This can be difficult to determine, but it also allows for a lot of flexibility for users.

As a copyright holder, you have the right to determine how your work is shared with and used by others. Retaining your copyright allows you to make decisions about how your work is distributed, accessed, re-used, and priced. Authors who transfer their copyright without retaining any rights may lose the ability to use and share their work in ways that are important to their academic careers -- distributing copies to their students and colleagues, making it available online, or reusing portions in a subsequent work.   Can I post my articles online?   If you have signed a publication agreement, then the answer depends on the terms of that agreement. Increasingly, journal publishers will allow authors to retain the right to \"self-archive\" their work in an online archive, such as an institutional repository or personal web site.   Is my publication agreement negotiable?   Yes! Although publishers often have a standard form agreement, you can still ask for the rights you need and negotiate an agreement that balances your rights with those of your publisher. The Scholar's Copyright Addendum Engine can help you to identify what rights are important to you, and the corresponding language to incorporate into your publication agreement.   What is open access?   Open access typically refers to scholarly journal literature that is freely accessible online, without monetary cost and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. Open access publications usually provide immediate online access to your work upon publication. The Directory of Open Access Journals is a comprehensive listing of open access scientific and scholarly journals.                                             Introduction                 Copyright law automatically gives authors rights over their original creative work, including the right to reproduce, publicly distribute, display, and perform works, as well as the right to create derivative works. As an author, you have options for how to exercise these rights. New technologies and publishing models have created an increasing number of opportunities to make your work available to the broadest possible audience, increasing the impact of your scholarship and giving others the opportunity to learn from and build off of your scholarly research.   When publishing your work, the agreement you sign with your publisher will determine who retains what rights to your work. By understanding the terms of your publishing contract and negotiating the rights you need, you can protect your ability to use your work in the ways that are important to you and your career, such as:     republication in a subsequent work   sharing copies with colleagues or students   placing your work in an online repository or on your own website     For more information, visit Resources for Authors , maintained by the Scholarly Publishing &amp; Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC).                                                  close                                                                                                          Getting Permission                                                                                  Sample Permission Letters                 Below are sample letters you can use to obtain permission from a copyright owner to use his or her work. These letters can be modified to suit your specific requests.             Permission to Use Work in Publication            Permission to Display or Stream Work on Web            Permission to Use of Student Work            Permission to Use Work in Published Dissertation            Permission to Reproduce Work for Classroom Use            Permission to Use Work in a Conference                                              Permission FAQs                 Why do I need permission to use a work?   When a work is protected by copyright, the holder of the copyright is given a set of exclusive rights over the work, including the right to copy, distribute, perform, and adapt the work. These rights are subject to a number of exceptions, including Fair Use and exemptions for classroom teaching. Unless your use of a work meets the requirements of one of these exceptions, copyright law requires you to get permission from the copyright holder before using their work.   If I want to use a work for educational purposes, isn't that Fair Use?   Possibly, but not necessarily. Fair Use allows limited use of copyrighted works without requiring permission from the copyright holder for a number of educational purposes -- commentary, criticism, research, teaching, or scholarship. However, it is important to remember that an educational purpose alone does not mean that your use will be protected as Fair Use. Copyright law sets forth a number of fact-specific criteria that must be evaluated to determine whether a use is \"Fair.\" Please refer to the Fair Use section of this guide for more information.   Do I need permission to show a movie in class?   No, you do not need permission from the copyright holder to show a copyrighted movie in a face-to-face ( i.e. , not online) class at NYU. This is because copyright law provides for a specific exemption that allows performances or displays of works during face-to-face teaching activities at nonprofit educational institutions, whether in the classroom or in a \"similar place devoted to instruction.\" This exemption applies not just to movies, but to any copyrighted work. This exemption does not extend to situations where you have reason to believe that the copy of the work was \"not lawfully made,\" e.g. an illegally copied DVD.   What about to make copies of course readings for my students?   First, before making copies, you should check whether course readings can be made available through direct links to a licensed library resource -- if the material you wish to distribute has already been licensed by the library, you will not need to worry about getting permission. If you are creating a coursepack -- whether print or electronic -- you will need to use NYU Bookstores Coursepack Service , which will obtain the necessary copyright clearances.   Creating copies of course readings in situations other than Coursepacks ( e.g. , supplemental or newly-published articles that you wish to make available during the course of the semester) may qualify as Fair Use. The NYU Statement of Policy on Photocopying Copyrighted Materials, part of the NYU Faculty Handbook , has guidance on applying Fair Use when making copies for classroom use.   Do I need permission to post materials on NYU Classes?   You do not need permission to post materials on NYU Classes if (1) the material is in the public domain, (2) the owner has already given permission through an open license, such as Creative Commons, (3) NYU Libraries has a license to link to the material, or (4) you perform a Fair Use evaluation and determine that Fair Use applies. Please see the \"Do You Need Permission?\" section of this page for more information on these categories.   In situations that do not fall into one of these categories, you will need permission. This includes creating electronic coursepacks on NYU Classes or other course sites. NYU policy requires you to utilize NYU Bookstores Coursepack Service when creating print or electronic coursepacks.    Do I need permission to link to materials on the web?   Generally, merely providing links to materials on the web does not require the permission of the copyright holder. It is a good rule of thumb to use linking to provide access to copyrighted materials whenever possible, rather than posting PDFs or otherwise reproducing web materials.   Do I need to get permission in writing?   You should make a habit of getting permission in writing whenever possible. Although under the law copyright permission does not have to be written, having a record of the grant of permission offers you greater protection should questions or disputes arise in the future. Depending on how you plan to use the work, you may need documentary evidence to show others that you have the permission of the copyright holder. For example, many publishers will require written proof of permission in order to include copyrighted works in your own publication.                                              Introduction                   Obtaining copyright permission is the process of getting consent from a copyright owner to use their work. This is also called licensing -- by giving you permission, the copyright owner grants you a license to use their work in a particular way.   The owner is not granting you copyright to the work, only permission to use it.   Even if not legally required, getting permission can sometimes be a practical way to lower your risks and avoid potential copyright disputes.   Follow the steps below to determine if you need permission for your use and, if so, to obtain that permission.   Image Credit: Francesco Gonin, from I promessi sposi. Source: commons.wikimedia.org                                              1. Determine if You Need Permission                 Your first step is to determine if you need permission in order to use a work.   For instance, you do NOT need permission if:     the work is in the public domain &rarr; Works in the public domain are no longer protected by copyright law and may be used without permission. Cornell's Copyright Term and the Public Domain is a good  tool for figuring out whether a particular work is in the public domain.       the owner has already given permission &rarr; Many creators choose to make their work freely available for use through open access licenses. A common means to do this is through a Creative Commons license . Requirements for these open access licenses vary, so check the terms carefully before using an open access work.       classroom performances and displays &rarr; Section 110 of the Copyright Act permits the performance or display of works during the course of face-to-face teaching activities in the classroom. For example, you do not need permission to show a movie or display an image in an NYU course. However, the exemption does not permit you to reproduce or distribute copies of copyrighted works and it only applies to face-to-face teaching. There is a separate law for online courses .       NYU already has a license &rarr; NYU Libraries licenses a considerable amount of digital content for use as course materials that can be made available to students through the NYU Libraries Linking Service . You can Ask NYU Libraries if material has been licensed.       your use qualifies as Fair Use &rarr;  Refer to the Fair Use page of this guide to determine if your use is covered.                                               Copyright Permissions Workflow                            Comments (0)                                         2. Identify the Copyright Owner                   The next step is to identify who owns the copyright in the work.   The author is the first owner of the copyright, but the author may sell or transfer the copyright to someone else. For many works, the publisher rather than the author is the copyright holder. You can often identify the owner through a copyright notice such as \"&copy; 2010 NYU Press.\" However, not all copyrighted works will have a notice.   NYU provides a number of services to assist with identifying copyright owners and securing permissions. You can use the resources listed on the right under Finding Copyright Owners and Licensing Agencies .   For NYU course readings, N YU Bookstores Coursepack Service clears copyright permissions and provides protection from liability for infringement to NYU and individual faculty members. The Coursepack Service can also be used to obtain permission to post course materials online, such as on Blackboard.   NYU faculty members seeking permission to use recorded music or audiovisual materials from NYU Libraries can contact Bobst Library's Avery Fisher Center for Media and Music for assistance with locating rights holders and obtaining performance rights.

Ask for Permission                 Once you have identified the copyright owner, you then need to determine the substance of your permission request. It is important that your request clearly describe the scope of how you intend to use the work, otherwise the permission you receive may fall short of meeting your needs. For example, if you ask to use a work in a conference presentation, the permission may not include making the presentation available online, or publishing it in conference proceedings. Be sure to include all the rights you anticipate needing, and include alternatives if you are unsure of the format ( e.g. print, DVD, web) in which the work will be used. If you will be using the work only for noncommercial, educational purposes, include this information as well -- many copyright holders will be more willing to grant permission if they understand that their work will be used for education.   The sample letters below can serve as your starting point:             Permission to Use Work in Publication            Permission to Use Work in Published Dissertation            Permission to Display or Stream Work on Web            Permission to Use of Student Work            Permission to Use Work in a Conference            Permission to Reproduce Work for Classroom Use                                              4. Keep a record!                   Lastly, be sure to keep a copy of all permissions and license agreements! Having a written record can be invaluable if questions or disputes arise down the road, and allow you to demonstrate to others that you have the legal right to use the owner's work (particularly publishers, who will often require written proof that permission has been obtained).   Although getting written permission from the copyright owner is your best bet, permission does not have to be in writing. If you aren't able to get something in writing, document your conversation. You may also want to send a letter of confirmation to the owner setting out your agreement.   In some cases, you may never get a response from the copyright holder -- you may never even be able to identify who they are or how to contact them! It can be difficult to know how to proceed when you reach a dead end. Unfortunately, no matter how diligently you have tried to get permission, these efforts cannot completely eliminate the risk of infringement should you proceed to use the work. Columbia's Copyright Advisory Office has put together a helpful list of Possible Solutions for when you find yourself in this all-too-common situation.

Finding Copyright Owners                   Identifying and finding copyright owners can be a difficult task, but there are many resources that can help with the search.   The Copyright Office's Online Catalog contains copyright information for post-1978 works that were registered with the Office. For pre-1978 works, the Office's registration records are available in hard copy form.   The Copyright Office publication How to Investigate the Copyright Status of Work has information on how to determine the copyright status of a work using the Office's resources.   WATCH --Writers, Artists, and Their Copyright Holders--is a database providing copyright and contact informaiton for a number of individuals in the creative field.   The National Assoc iation for Music Education's Copyright Center can provide guidance on how to navigate licensing and other copyright issues for musical works.           Comments (0)                                         Licensing Agencies                 Licensing agencies allow potential users of copyrighted works to purchase licenses without having to contact the copyright owner directly.   Copyright Clearance Center offers pay-per-use permission services for academic uses of books, journal articles, and other literary works, such as posting works on course management systems. For some works, the CCC can instantly grant permission online.   Three licensing agencies -- ASCAP , BMI , and SESAC -- together license the performance rights for the vast majority of music published in the U.S. Performance licenses cover uses related to the public performance of copyrighted music, such as concert performances or playing a musical recording in a public space.   Harry Fox Agency offers mechanical licenses for the reproduction and distribution of musical works. This includes digital licenses for uses such as streaming or digital downloads.     The Motion Picture Licensing Corporation , Movie Licensing USA , and Swank Motion Pictures grant public performance rights for movies.

Clips of copyrighted movies and music can also be uploaded to NYU Classes under Fair Use.     In addition, copyright law provides a classroom exception in section 110(1) allowing instructors to show entire copyrighted works during the course of a face-to-face class session.                                             Online Course Sites                    The law permits faculty to provide access to copyrighted material for registered students using an online course site such as NYU Classes, but copyright (and sometimes licensing) restrictions still apply.                                              Linking to Materials vs Posting PDFs                 Articles and other materials from library databases are subject to license agreements that specify how database contents may be used. For information on how database materials can be used, including whether it is permitted to post PDFs of materials on NYU Classes, contact Ask-A-Librarian .   Generally, all database materials can be made available through NYU Classes by linking to the appropriate database. Linking is just as easy as attaching a PDF, but it is a better option for providing access to licensed material while staying within copyright and license terms. To learn how to provide permalinks to database articles that your students can access throughout the semester, see the research guide on Adding Library Resources .   You also have the option of creating an e-reserve of database links using the NYU Libraries' Linking Service . This service creates a storehouse of permalinks outside of NYU Classes for students to access licensed reading material for the course.   When there is no license agreement specifying how materials can be used, the U.S. Copyright Act applies to posting PDFs of library materials on NYU Classes. Copyright law permits posting in three situations:     the work is in the public domain -- see Copyright Term and the Public Domain   you have permission from the copyright owner -- see Getting Permission   your use qualifies as Fair Use -- see Applying Fair Use                                               TEACH Act and Distance Education                 The Technology, Education, and Copyright Harmonization Act of 2002  permits instructors of non-profit educational institutions to display audio-visual and other works for distance education courses in a manner comparable to what would be permitted in a live, face-to-face classroom. Under the TEACH Act, instructors may make available online for student use:     full performances of nondramatic literary or musical works (i.e. , no plays, musicals, operas, etc.); or   \"reasonable and limited portions\" of dramatic audio-visual or other types of works.     The material must only be made available to students enrolled in a particular course (e.g., under the password-protected auspices of a Course Management System) and only during the time period (e.g., quarter, semester, summer session) of that particular course. In addition, the material must be accompanied by a notice to students that it only be used in accordance with copyright law and the copyright policy of the institution.   For more information about the TEACH Act and how it applies, see this overview from Columbia University .   It should be noted that the TEACH Act stands apart from the Fair Use exception. Even if an instructor is unable to make material available to students under the TEACH Act, the use still may qualify for Fair Use protection. Contact us at fairuse@nyu.edu with any questions regarding applications of TEACH Act or Fair Use.

The Coursepack Service clears all copyright permissions, and permission fees are incorporated into the coursepack price.   Faculty using the Coursepack Service are indemnified by NYU against any claims of copyright infringement.                                                  close                                                                                                          Using Images                                                                                  Finding Images You Can Legally Use                     Here are several excellent sources for images in the public domain and creative commons-licensed content:    College Art Association Image Sources - Links to free, restricted and unrestricted, image banks.

That said, there are many cases in which copyright law permits re-use:     1. The image is a public domain work.  Generally, anything published in the U.S. before 1923 is in the public domain. For more info, check out the Peter Hirtle's Copyright Term and the Public Domain .    2. The image is available under a Creative Commons license.  CC images are labeled as such. When using a CC image, be sure to provide proper attribution to the source.   3. The image is otherwise made available for re-use by the content provider.  Some websites permit you to re-use their images on your own website, as long as certain conditions are met ( e.g. noncommercial use only). In these cases, you can find out whether re-use is permitted by looking at the website&rsquo;s Terms &amp; Conditions.   4. The image is copyrighted, but re-use qualifies as Fair Use . In the context of using images on a website, you have a stronger Fair Use argument if you are directly commenting on or critiquing the image, or if you are using the image in a way that is transformative.     Fair Use likely does not apply when images are being used solely to make a web page more visually interesting; the use of the image should serve some instructional or educational purpose.   Keep in mind that if an image is subject to a license agreement (such as images from library databases), it can only be used according to what the license allows, even if Fair Use would otherwise allow for re-use. See the box to the right on Using Database Images .    For more information, see Analyzing Fair Use .     5. You have permission from the copyright owner. For more information, see Getting Permission .

To make giving credit easy, look for images that give you enough information to attribute them.  At minimum, do your best to: 1. Link to back to the original work 2. Give credit to the image creator 3. Follow attribution instructions provided by the source   Generic Image Credit Format: Title by A. Creator , via source  (CC License Type) .

Using Database Images                 The Library provides NYU faculty and students with access to a number of great image repositories, including the images available in Artstor and Artnet. These images are high resolution and free for use by anyone with a Net ID and access to Library electronic materials.   However, use of these database images are subject to license terms and conditions that limit how you may reuse the material. While you are free to view images on the database and even download them for your own study in many cases, you are not permitted to post database images to public websites , including your own personal websites or study sites, such as Study Blue. Doing so is a violation of the user terms of the database.   If you wish to use any images you find in your own scholarship, such as a thesis, dissertation, or article, you will need to contact the database owner for permission to republish the images. You can find out more in the section on Getting Permission .
