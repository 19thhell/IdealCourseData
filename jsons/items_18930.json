Course Level: Intermediate 4 points.  No prerequisite.                                         This course offers a broad survey of American cinema from its beginnings (and even its history) up to 1960. While the emphasis will be on the dominant, narrative fiction film, there will be attention to other modes of American cinema such as experimental film, animation, shorts, and non-fiction film. The course will look closely at films themselves -- how do their styles and narrative structures change over time? -- but also at contexts: how do films reflect their times? how does the film industry develop? what are the key institutions that had impact on American film over its history? We will also attend to the role of key figures in film's history: from creative personnel (for example, the director or the screenwriter) to industrialists and administrators, to censors to critics and to audiences themselves. The goal will be to provide an overall understanding of one of the most consequential of modern popular art forms and of its particular contributions to the art and culture of our modernity.

Phillips  Department of Cinema Studies      CALL #: 75691      Monday 6:20PM -  9:50 p.m.      Over the last 50 years the American  Cinema has produced a remarkably rich abundance of entertaining, exciting, and  challenging films. This course is designed to provide a survey of the wealth of  styles, forms, purposes, and approaches to filmmaking that developed and  emerged in this era. While Hollywood  has obviously served as the dominant mode of filmmaking in this country, a  significant diversity of other filmmaking practices have continued to operate  and sometimes thrive outside of it. Beyond the attention paid to Hollywood narrative cinema as it has changed and evolved  over this half-century, we will also consider documentaries, avant-garde and  experimental works, independent narrative cinema, and \u2015cult\u2016  films. Consequentially, we will be screening a variety of films, including works  by such notable American filmmakers as Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola,  Quentin Tarantino, George Romero, John Singleton, and Michael Moore. Cross-listed  with H56.0324 (UG FILM/TV).
