No more than 18 students are permitted in each seminar.     Recent first-year interdisciplinary seminars have included \u201cCapitalism and Democracy,\u201d \u201cThe Social Construction of Reality,\u201d and \u201cThe Thingliness of Things.\u201d       In addition, students take two thematic writing seminars, one each semester, with no more than 15 students in each class.     Recent writing seminars have included \u201cThe Idea of America: What Does it Mean?,&quot; \u201cImagining Cities,\u201d \u201cFood Culture and Food Writing,\u201d and \u201cMyths and Fables in Popular Culture.\u201d         First-year students are encouraged to explore their interests by taking courses in departments and schools throughout NYU in the fields of study in which they may choose to concentrate.               Sophomore Year     During the sophomore year, students begin to define their concentration. Sophomores often take at least one Gallatin interdisciplinary seminar, and many select a sophomore-only interdisciplinary seminar.     Recent sophomore-only seminars include\u201cAmerican Narratives I,\u201d \u201cLiterary and Critical Theory,\u201d and \u201cShakespeare's Mediterranean.\u201d         At the end of the sophomore year, each student writes the Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration, a short essay that is read and approved by his or her faculty adviser. This plan details the steps the student will take towards defining his or her concentration.   Sophomores are encouraged to explore their interests by taking courses in the other schools of NYU, and many also choose to study abroad for a semester.   Sophomores often undertake internships related to their fields of study in various businesses, cultural institutions, and nonprofit organizations throughout New York City.   Sophomores may also choose to pursue their work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.           Junior Year          Juniors often take several Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars.    In the junior year, students continue to deepen their knowledge in their chosen fields of study by taking courses widely in other departments and schools at NYU.    During the junior year, students begin preparing for their senior colloquium by taking the course, \u201cThird-Year Symposium,\u201d which guides them through the process of writing the rationale, a short essay with booklist that defines the focus of their colloquium. The rationale is read and approved by two faculty members.    Juniors often undertake internships related to their fields of study and may do some of their academic work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.    Juniors may also take advantage of study abroad options, perhaps for one semester or even for one year. Particularly popular study abroad options for Gallatin students are NYU in Prague, NYU in Ghana, and Gallatin-specific summer courses in Florence, Berlin, and Buenos Aires.               Senior Year     In the fall of their senior year, students finalize plans for their senior colloquium, a two-hour oral exam and conversation involving three faculty members. At the colloquium, students present a variety of texts that have proved important in their concentration. These texts are selected to represent a range of knowledge, touching on topics both ancient and modern. The colloquium is that capstone event of a Gallatin education.     Students continue taking Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars in their senior year and also take advanced courses throughout the University in their fields of focus.   In the second semester of the senior year, students have the option to undertake a senior project or senior essay.   Seniors undertake internships related to their fields of study and may continue to do some of their academic work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.                      top of page                                                                        NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

Atoms are basic building blocks     of matter, and cannot be chemically subdivided by ordinary means.             The word atom is derived from the Greek word atom which     means indivisible. The Greeks concluded that matter could be broken     down into particles to small to be seen. These particles were called      atoms             Atoms are composed of three type of particles: protons, neutrons,     and electron. Protons and neutrons are responsible for most of the atomic     mass e.g in a 150 person 149 lbs, 15 oz are protons and neutrons while     only 1 oz. is electrons. The mass of an electron is very small (9.108     X 10 -28 grams).    Both the protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus. Protons have     a postive (+) charge, neutrons have no charge --they are neutral. Electrons     reside in orbitals around the nucleus. They have a negative charge (-).     It is the number of protons that determines the atomic number, e.g.,     H = 1. The number of protons in an element is constant (e.g., H=1, Ur=92)     but neutron number may vary, so mass number (protons + neutrons) may     vary.     The same element may contain varying numbers of neutrons; these forms     of an element are called isotopes. The chemical properties of isotopes     are the same, although the physical properties of some isotopes may     be different. Some isotopes are radioactive-meaning they &quot;radiate&quot;     energy as they decay to a more stable form, perhaps another element     half-life: time required for half of the atoms of an element to decay     into stable form. Another example is oxygen, with atomic number of 8     can have 8, 9, or 10 neutrons.         What are elements?     All matter is made up of elements which are fundamental substances     which cannot be broken down by chemical means. There are 92 elements     that occur naturally. The elements hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen     are the elements that make up most living organisms. Some other elements     found in living organisms are: magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, sodium,     potassium.     By the late 1800's many elements had already been discovered. The scientist     Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, proposed an arrangement of know     elements based on their atomic mass. The modern arrangement of the elements     is known as the Periodic Table of Elements and is arranged according     to the atomic number of elements.              Here is an Interactive Table     of Elements where you can learn more about each of the elements.             What makes each element unique?  Every atom would like     to have an electron configuration like a noble gases. In noble gases     the outer electron shell is complete. This makes the element chemically     inert. Helium is an example of a noble (inert) gas. It is not present     in organisms because it is not chemically reactive.             Historical Models of the atom         BOHR MODEL    Bohr model shows electrons circling the nucleus at different levels     or orbitals much like planets circle the sun. Electrons move from one     energy state to another but can only exist aft defineite energy levels.     The energy absorbed or released when electrons change states is in the     form of electromagnetic radiation.         THE WAVE MODEL AND QUANTUM THEORY     The Bohr model was only able to explain the very simplest atoms, like     hydrogen. Today's modern day theory is based on mathematics and the     properties of waves. The wave model forms the basis for the     Quantum Theory     . This theory gives the probability of locating electrons in a particular     location, unlike assuming electrons orbit the nucleus as in the Bohr     model.             How are electrons organized around the nucleus?         All atoms would like to attain electron configurations like noble     gases. That is, have completed outer shells. Atoms can form stable electron     configurations like noble gases     by:         losing electrons     sharing electrons     gaining electrons.         For a stable configuration each atom must fill its outer energy level.     In the case of noble gases that means eight electrons in the last     shell (with the exception of He which has two electrons).     Atoms that have 1, 2 or 3 electrons in their outer levels will tend     to lose them in interactions with atoms that have 5, 6 or 7 electrons     in their outer levels. Atoms that have 5, 6 or 7 electrons in their     outer levels will tend to gain electrons from atoms with 1, 2 or 3 electrons     in their outer levels. Atoms that have 4 electrons in the outer most     energy level will tend neither to totally lose nor totally gain electrons     during interactions.     This     Periodic Table of Elements will show you the electron configuration     for any element you click on.         Visualizing Atomic Orbitals             The atomic orbitals of the hydrogen atom can be visualized as a cloud     around the nucleus. The orbital represents a probability of finding     the electron at a particular location. Darker regions signify a greater     probability. Shown below are the 1s (lowest orbital and the 2s orbital.             1s 2s        Atomic orbitals do not always have the shape of a sphere. Higher orbitals     have very unusual shapes.              2px 3px               These orbitals were prepared by Dr. Yue-Ling Wong from the University    of Florida for more images click    here.

No more than 18 students are permitted in each seminar.     Recent first-year interdisciplinary seminars have included \u201cCapitalism and Democracy,\u201d \u201cThe Social Construction of Reality,\u201d and \u201cThe Thingliness of Things.\u201d       In addition, students take two thematic writing seminars, one each semester, with no more than 15 students in each class.     Recent writing seminars have included \u201cThe Idea of America: What Does it Mean?,&quot; \u201cImagining Cities,\u201d \u201cFood Culture and Food Writing,\u201d and \u201cMyths and Fables in Popular Culture.\u201d         First-year students are encouraged to explore their interests by taking courses in departments and schools throughout NYU in the fields of study in which they may choose to concentrate.               Sophomore Year     During the sophomore year, students begin to define their concentration. Sophomores often take at least one Gallatin interdisciplinary seminar, and many select a sophomore-only interdisciplinary seminar.     Recent sophomore-only seminars include\u201cAmerican Narratives I,\u201d \u201cLiterary and Critical Theory,\u201d and \u201cShakespeare's Mediterranean.\u201d         At the end of the sophomore year, each student writes the Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration, a short essay that is read and approved by his or her faculty adviser. This plan details the steps the student will take towards defining his or her concentration.   Sophomores are encouraged to explore their interests by taking courses in the other schools of NYU, and many also choose to study abroad for a semester.   Sophomores often undertake internships related to their fields of study in various businesses, cultural institutions, and nonprofit organizations throughout New York City.   Sophomores may also choose to pursue their work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.           Junior Year          Juniors often take several Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars.    In the junior year, students continue to deepen their knowledge in their chosen fields of study by taking courses widely in other departments and schools at NYU.    During the junior year, students begin preparing for their senior colloquium by taking the course, \u201cThird-Year Symposium,\u201d which guides them through the process of writing the rationale, a short essay with booklist that defines the focus of their colloquium. The rationale is read and approved by two faculty members.    Juniors often undertake internships related to their fields of study and may do some of their academic work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.    Juniors may also take advantage of study abroad options, perhaps for one semester or even for one year. Particularly popular study abroad options for Gallatin students are NYU in Prague, NYU in Ghana, and Gallatin-specific summer courses in Florence, Berlin, and Buenos Aires.               Senior Year     In the fall of their senior year, students finalize plans for their senior colloquium, a two-hour oral exam and conversation involving three faculty members. At the colloquium, students present a variety of texts that have proved important in their concentration. These texts are selected to represent a range of knowledge, touching on topics both ancient and modern. The colloquium is that capstone event of a Gallatin education.     Students continue taking Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars in their senior year and also take advanced courses throughout the University in their fields of focus.   In the second semester of the senior year, students have the option to undertake a senior project or senior essay.   Seniors undertake internships related to their fields of study and may continue to do some of their academic work in independent studies, tutorials, and private lessons in the arts.                      top of page                                                                        NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

Atoms are basic building blocks     of matter, and cannot be chemically subdivided by ordinary means.             The word atom is derived from the Greek word atom which     means indivisible. The Greeks concluded that matter could be broken     down into particles to small to be seen. These particles were called      atoms             Atoms are composed of three type of particles: protons, neutrons,     and electron. Protons and neutrons are responsible for most of the atomic     mass e.g in a 150 person 149 lbs, 15 oz are protons and neutrons while     only 1 oz. is electrons. The mass of an electron is very small (9.108     X 10 -28 grams).    Both the protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus. Protons have     a postive (+) charge, neutrons have no charge --they are neutral. Electrons     reside in orbitals around the nucleus. They have a negative charge (-).     It is the number of protons that determines the atomic number, e.g.,     H = 1. The number of protons in an element is constant (e.g., H=1, Ur=92)     but neutron number may vary, so mass number (protons + neutrons) may     vary.     The same element may contain varying numbers of neutrons; these forms     of an element are called isotopes. The chemical properties of isotopes     are the same, although the physical properties of some isotopes may     be different. Some isotopes are radioactive-meaning they &quot;radiate&quot;     energy as they decay to a more stable form, perhaps another element     half-life: time required for half of the atoms of an element to decay     into stable form. Another example is oxygen, with atomic number of 8     can have 8, 9, or 10 neutrons.         What are elements?     All matter is made up of elements which are fundamental substances     which cannot be broken down by chemical means. There are 92 elements     that occur naturally. The elements hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen     are the elements that make up most living organisms. Some other elements     found in living organisms are: magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, sodium,     potassium.     By the late 1800's many elements had already been discovered. The scientist     Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, proposed an arrangement of know     elements based on their atomic mass. The modern arrangement of the elements     is known as the Periodic Table of Elements and is arranged according     to the atomic number of elements.              Here is an Interactive Table     of Elements where you can learn more about each of the elements.             What makes each element unique?  Every atom would like     to have an electron configuration like a noble gases. In noble gases     the outer electron shell is complete. This makes the element chemically     inert. Helium is an example of a noble (inert) gas. It is not present     in organisms because it is not chemically reactive.             Historical Models of the atom         BOHR MODEL    Bohr model shows electrons circling the nucleus at different levels     or orbitals much like planets circle the sun. Electrons move from one     energy state to another but can only exist aft defineite energy levels.     The energy absorbed or released when electrons change states is in the     form of electromagnetic radiation.         THE WAVE MODEL AND QUANTUM THEORY     The Bohr model was only able to explain the very simplest atoms, like     hydrogen. Today's modern day theory is based on mathematics and the     properties of waves. The wave model forms the basis for the     Quantum Theory     . This theory gives the probability of locating electrons in a particular     location, unlike assuming electrons orbit the nucleus as in the Bohr     model.             How are electrons organized around the nucleus?         All atoms would like to attain electron configurations like noble     gases. That is, have completed outer shells. Atoms can form stable electron     configurations like noble gases     by:         losing electrons     sharing electrons     gaining electrons.         For a stable configuration each atom must fill its outer energy level.     In the case of noble gases that means eight electrons in the last     shell (with the exception of He which has two electrons).     Atoms that have 1, 2 or 3 electrons in their outer levels will tend     to lose them in interactions with atoms that have 5, 6 or 7 electrons     in their outer levels. Atoms that have 5, 6 or 7 electrons in their     outer levels will tend to gain electrons from atoms with 1, 2 or 3 electrons     in their outer levels. Atoms that have 4 electrons in the outer most     energy level will tend neither to totally lose nor totally gain electrons     during interactions.     This     Periodic Table of Elements will show you the electron configuration     for any element you click on.         Visualizing Atomic Orbitals             The atomic orbitals of the hydrogen atom can be visualized as a cloud     around the nucleus. The orbital represents a probability of finding     the electron at a particular location. Darker regions signify a greater     probability. Shown below are the 1s (lowest orbital and the 2s orbital.             1s 2s        Atomic orbitals do not always have the shape of a sphere. Higher orbitals     have very unusual shapes.              2px 3px               These orbitals were prepared by Dr. Yue-Ling Wong from the University    of Florida for more images click    here.
