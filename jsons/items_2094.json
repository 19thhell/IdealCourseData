Description       &quot;The poem of force,&quot; according to Simone Weil, the\u00a0 Iliad \u00a0is also a poem of forceful influence. In this course we will read the\u00a0 Iliad \u00a0intensively, followed by an examination of its heritage on the dramatic stage. In the first half of the semester we will primarily explore the\u00a0 Iliad \u00a0in terms of the poetics of traditionality; the political economy of epic; the ideologics of the\u00a0 M\u00e4nnerbund \u00a0(the &quot;band of fighting brothers&quot;); the\u00a0 Iliad \u00a0's uses of reciprocity; its construction of gender; its intimations of tragedy. In the second half of the course, informed by a reading of Aristotle's\u00a0 Poetics \u00a0, we will focus on responses to the\u00a0 Iliad \u00a0in dramatic form; possible readings will include Sophocles'\u00a0 Ajax \u00a0; Euripides'\u00a0 Iphigeneia in Aulis \u00a0; Shakespeare's\u00a0 Troilus and Cressida \u00a0; Racine's\u00a0 Andromaque \u00a0; Giraudoux's\u00a0 La guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu; \u00a0Ellen McLaughlin's\u00a0 Iphigenia and Other Daughters. \u00a0Students will give presentations on an Iliadic intertext of their own choosing.
