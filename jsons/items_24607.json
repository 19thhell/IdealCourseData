              Center for Research on Teaching and Learning           The Center for Research on Teaching and Learning (CRTL) was organized in spring 2002 in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development&rsquo;s Department of Teaching and Learning. CRTL&rsquo;s mission is to support the Department&rsquo;s Teacher Education Programs in fulfilling their commitment to develop professional educators who have a broad and deep understanding of their practice, along with a moral commitment to equity and social justice. CRTL works with NYU faculty and staff to coordinate, design, and implement research and evaluation projects that will help to inform and improve our pre-service and in-service teacher development efforts. CRTL also serves as a forum for faculty and staff to share ideas and discuss the critical issues in urban education. In all research endeavors, CRTL focuses on the processes and causes that underlie the ultimate goal of the work of education&mdash;effective teaching resulting in high student achievement.

              Center for Research on Teaching and Learning           The Center for Research on Teaching and Learning (CRTL) was organized in spring 2002 in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development&rsquo;s Department of Teaching and Learning. CRTL&rsquo;s mission is to support the Department&rsquo;s Teacher Education Programs in fulfilling their commitment to develop professional educators who have a broad and deep understanding of their practice, along with a moral commitment to equity and social justice. CRTL works with NYU faculty and staff to coordinate, design, and implement research and evaluation projects that will help to inform and improve our pre-service and in-service teacher development efforts. CRTL also serves as a forum for faculty and staff to share ideas and discuss the critical issues in urban education. In all research endeavors, CRTL focuses on the processes and causes that underlie the ultimate goal of the work of education&mdash;effective teaching resulting in high student achievement.
