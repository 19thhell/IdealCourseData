Employing approaches from the humanities and social sciences, the program prepares students to analyze the current American food system, its global connections, and local alternatives. The program examines cultural, political, economic, environmental, and geographic approaches to food within local, urban and global contexts.    The MA in Food Studies requires 19 credits in mandatory coursework that covers food systems, culture, and policy, as well as a research component. Beyond these requirements, students can take 21 credits in specialization modules (policy/advocacy, business/social entrepreneurship, media/cultural analysis) to dig deeper into their interests. Our mission is to examine the ways in which individuals, communities, and societies produce, distribute, and consume food.

Our faculty , prominent leaders in their field, teach and mentor students, while actively conducting research to stay engaged.    Get insider access. Upon enrolling, students study with food professionals who serve as adjuncts and guest lecturers and are welcomed by food production companies, non-profit food organizations, publishers, public relations and marketing firms, magazines, food distributors, food producers and educational institutions.    Study abroad. We now offer coursework --and a program of study--in global sites like Paris, Hong Kong, Puerto Rico, and Puebla, for students to gain an immersive experience in an international context.

The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) (if required)- [ETS Institution Code: 2556]:    The TOEFL is mandatory for all applicants whose native language is NOT English and did not receive the equivalent of a 4 year U.S. undergraduate education from an institution where English is the official language of instruction. Applicants holding or completing a graduate degree from an English speaking institution are still required to submit a TOEFL if your graduate education was LESS THAN four years in duration at an institution where English was the official language of instruction. The TOEFL cannot be waived.    Although we do not have a required TOEFL score, successful applicants score 100 or above on the Internet-based test or 600 or above on the paper-based test.    If you are required to submit a TOEFL score, you must submit your score in two formats:       An official TOEFL score report must be sent to NYU Steinhardt for ETS.
