In the popular culture of America we can find many reflections of the heroic figure; in writing, in the graphic art of comic books, and most certainly in the aftermath of September 11th, heroes are ever present. Our cultural champions speak to our collective need to make sense of the nonsensical and to establish order in both our external and internal worlds. Indeed it is through the internal world of the psyche and the lens of psychological thought that we may gain a better perspective of the fusion of creativity and knowledge that we have come to call the heroic figure.           Creative experience and its expression cannot exist without some contextual framework by which it is understood and appreciated. The very survival of all that is creative depends upon such knowledge. Just as a bird released from its cage must eventually return to roost or perish in the wilderness so must our creative thoughts and imaginings eventually return to the reality of the corporeal world and the causal laws that govern it. This is the very nature of that which we call 'learning' and it is in such a way that creative thought gains relevance and weight, becoming part of our conscious reality. It is through this relationship between creativity and knowledge, between that which we imagine and that which we know, that we may gain a greater understanding of the heroic figure and its cultural significance.           The archetype of the hero is an expression of our imagination as well as a reflection of our experience. Carl Jung develops this idea in his essay, &quot;On the Relation of Analytical Psychology to Poetry&quot; when he writes, &quot;The primordial image, or archetype, is a figure-be it a daemon, a human being or a process-that constantly recurs in the course of history and appears wherever creative fantasy is freely expressed&quot; (186). Throughout history and across cultural divides the heroic figure appears, a symbolic expression of mankind's struggle to at once define as well as challenge the boundaries of existence. The stories of mythological heroes such as Herakles and Odysseus survive today not because they entertain us but because they teach us. Speaking of these mythic figures in the essay, &quot;Ancient Myths and Modern Man&quot;, Joseph L. Henderson writes, &quot;Their special role suggests that the essential function of the heroic myth is the development of the individual's ego-consciousness-his awareness of his own strengths and weaknesses-in a manner that will equip him for the arduous tasks with which life will confront him&quot; (112). By looking to the hero we are really looking back into the reality of our own state of being, searching for signposts in the landscape of the mythic that will somehow provide texture and traction as we navigate through the obstacles of our daily lives.           Through the heroic figure we gain a better understanding of who we are. It is no coincidence then that in our conscious and subconscious journey of self-discovery we have colonized our popular culture with the ethos of heroic myth. In comic books we find reassurance that even those who appear meek and mild mannered may only be a phone booth away from revealing their true nature and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Movie icon Arnold Schwarzenegger, who made his debut in the 1970 film, Hercules in New York, has spent three decades defying the aging process (in and of itself a heroic act), and reminding us in countless bad movies that a single individual with a lot of guns may indeed rescue the world from evil. On television, a top rated show chronicles the adolescence of Superman as its opening theme song pleads, &quot;Won't somebody save me?&quot; In newspapers we read of heroes in sport, astounding us with feats of physical supremacy. And we stand in awe, amazed by the acts of heroism that survived and defined the pathos of September 11th.           The hero educates, informs, and inspires. In surmounting adversity, the hero offers the individual a similar opportunity for transcendence, beyond the heroic ideal and into the realm of autonomous individuation, &quot;the process by which a person becomes a psychological 'in-dividual', that is, a separate, indivisible unity or 'whole'&quot; (Jung 27). In her essay &quot;I Will Be My Own Hero,&quot; Kristen E. Hughes comes to such a realization: &quot;It is not by aspiring to be a great man, or even by following one that I can find my answers. So now I am involved in a new search for a hero within me, but this time the hero will not be a bull, or a Ulysses, or even a Tudor queen&quot; (52). Through her relationship to the archetypal figure Ms. Hughes realizes the need for a heroic quest of her own, a quest in the pursuit of the ultimate knowledge, knowledge of self.           This newfound insight into individual identity, accessed through the portal of creative thought, can also serve the needs of the collective. In the aftermath of the attack on the World Trade Center, an entire city, indeed all of America itself, looked towards the heroic figure as a means to give some context to the chaos and some meaning to the immeasurable loss that we all witnessed and in some way suffered through. Heroes like NYPD Officer Moira Smith, was such a figure, a thirteen-year veteran of the department as well as a wife and mother of two who died in the collapse of the World Trade Center. A final photo of Officer Smith shows her escorting an injured man out of the Trade Center minutes before its collapse. After delivering the man to a paramedic, she returned to the building to look for more survivors, a final selfless action mirrored by hundreds of others who perished in the line of duty (&quot;Policewoman&quot; B4).           Through the story of Officer Smith we unite in not only grief but in courage, gaining through her sacrifice a new understanding and respect for the heroic ideal. As separate entities trying to cope with the magnitude of this disaster, we feel isolated and alone. By focusing on the beacon of light held by our modern day heroes, by firefighters and policemen, the individual finds strength and comfort and unity within a larger group. In Man and his Symbols , Carl Jung explains, &quot;In other words, his identity is temporarily dismembered or dissolved in the collective unconscious. From this state he is then ceremoniously rescued by the rite of the new birth. This is the first act of true consolidation of the ego with the larger group, expressed as totem, clan, tribe, or all three combined&quot; (130). In this Jungian model of ego identification we see how the individual seeks salvation through dissolution into what is commonly referred to as the collective unconscious, defined by Bem Allen in his book, Theories of Personality as &quot;a storehouse of ancestral experiences dating to the dawn of humankind and common to all humans&quot; (54). This state of grace is achieved through creative rituals and symbolic expressive figures, such as the archetypal hero. It is in this way that we come to know, understand, and survive psychic experiences that defy and confound the boundaries of rational thought. For the individual as well as the group, the hero hands us hope, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. Just as in mythology, however, such a valuable gift is never without its price.           The heroic figure owes its very existence to the adversarial forces that oppose it, a symbiotic relationship not unlike the one that exists between creativity and knowledge. Without darkness there can be no light just as there can be no appreciation for the creative without the intellectual awareness and knowledge that infuses it with meaning. The hero seeks to unite these divergent energies through his deeds and in the process must recognize and challenge the ominous shadow self that resides within him. Henderson explains, &quot;For most people the dark or negative side of the personality remains unconscious. The hero, on the contrary, must realize that the shadow exists and that he can draw strength from it. [Indeed] before the ego can triumph, it must master and assimilate the shadow&quot; (120-1). The challenge before the hero is not only to acknowledge chaos but also to embrace it, a symbolic representation of the challenge before us all.           The hero reminds us of our own inner demons, of dragons sleeping in dark places that we would rather not visit. Part of us wishes, like the knight in shining armor, to awaken the beast within and slay it while another part yearns to seduce the serpent, to slide our fingers along its silvery scales and feel its hot breath against our cheek. With either action we run the risk of unleashing a creature we may not be able to contain. Addressing this conundrum in her essay, &quot;The Process of Individuation,&quot; M.L. von Franz writes, &quot;Divining in advance whether our dark partner symbolizes a shortcoming that we should overcome or a meaningful bit of life that we should accept-this is one of the most difficult problems that we encounter on the way to individuation&quot; (175-6). And so we applaud the hero's action, amazed and inspired by her fortitude and courage while at the same time subconsciously outraged at the audacity of her endeavor. It is beyond our capacity to accept without reservation the heroic figure, a figure whose very existence confronts us with a side of our psyche we strive to keep from conscious thought. For this threat to our psychic security, the hero must pay.           When Icarus dared fly too high on waxen wings, the heat of the sun and his own hubris sent him plummeting like a rock into the roiling sea below. The landscape of the hero is littered with such warnings, cautionary tales that remind the individual of the risk one takes in challenging accepted boundaries. Kristen Hughes hints at the cost of her own self-exploration when she writes, &quot;I am finding a new Hero in myself to follow. She can be violent at times, because she can be everything, but she will always be sorry. No matter how hungry her heart, indifference will not suit her. She has an indomitable will but is never proud for long&quot; (54). Hughes acknowledges the limitlessness of the hero within her. Flying on newfound wings, much like Icarus, she can &quot;be everything.&quot; Hughes however, unlike the mythic hero, realizes the sorrow and humility that come with such freedom and knowledge. She also recognizes the violence inherent in a heroic struggle, as anything worth realizing must be worth fighting for.           Perhaps nowhere is this thought more clearly illustrated than on the actual battlefield of war, a home ground for the heroic ideal. Tim O'Brien in his essay &quot;How To Tell A True War Story,&quot; speaks of the revelatory nature of warfare and its repercussions: &quot;Though it's odd, you're never more alive than when you're almost dead. You recognize what's valuable. Freshly, as if for the first time, you love what's best in yourself and in the world, all that might be lost&quot; (447). The experiences of Hughes and O'Brien mirror that of the heroic initiate and in some way bring us a sense of comfort in their commonality. One cannot touch the face of God without consequence. For daring to dip into the well of the subconscious and stir up its dark and troubling waters, the hero may wear a laurel wreath only if it has first been dipped in his own blood. That we find some sense of satisfaction in this retribution speaks to our ambivalent relationship with not only the heroic figure but our own humanity as well. We turn to the hero for hope but with the very promise of transcendence we find ourselves pressed against our own mortality, like fading flowers in the pages of a vast and heavy book.           The heroic figure calls to us precisely because he resonates with the promise of life after death, a prospect that simultaneously enthralls and terrifies. Echoes of this theme can be heard in Kristen Hughes' search for the hero within herself when she writes, &quot;It is not by aspiring to be a great man, or even by following one that I can find my answers&quot; (52). One gets the sense that for Hughes, an ideal or dream has somehow died, opening a doorway to self-discovery. For O'Brien the very real possibility of physical death on the battlefield grants him a sensation of being &quot;more alive&quot; and aware, in communion with all of creation. In Greek mythology heroes were buried with a coin beneath their tongue, payment to be offered to the ferryman Charon for transit across the River Styx to an afterlife in the Elysian Fields. And Carl Jung, in his essay, &quot;Approaching the Unconscious,&quot; refers to arguably the most well-known heroic archetype in the Western World when he writes, &quot;The general idea of Christ the Redeemer belongs to the world-wide and pre-Christ theme of the hero and rescuer who, although he has been devoured by a monster, appears again in a miraculous way, having overcome whatever monster it was that swallowed him&quot; (72-3). Like moths to the proverbial flame, we are drawn to the concept of Death and the promise of Life Everlasting that flickers within it. Evading all empirical evidence, our belief must be built upon a foundation of faith, in and of itself a creative construct. Knowledge thwarted, still we stumble forward, desperate to find some proof, some real life experience to substantiate our conviction. Such is the fuel with which wars are waged.           More compelling than any religious or territorial or economic contention, our collective need to experience and substantiate the state of being for which the archetypal hero stands, drives us forward onto the fields of battle. Given that the dead are unable to confirm that life exists after life has been lost, mankind must console itself by marching to the brink of the abyss fortified with the belief that the end is, in actuality, just the beginning. This is the certitude that must shine in the eyes of the soldier; it is the fervor of the suicide bomber and the kamikaze pilot. It is the creative thinking that must be entertained in even the most hopeless of hearts. It is the belief that allows us to live in a world that we will always imagine more completely than we will ever know.           We reach into the caldron of creative thought, hoping to gain some kind of knowledge that will bring order and explanation to the world that exists within and without. As we pull back our hand, hoping to grasp one single solid answer, we sadly find ourselves instead with a handful of quivering questions. Mythology and the archetypal figure cannot explain our physical reality; they can only serve as creative expressions of it, with all its ambiguity and doubt. Indeed, the heroic archetype owes its very existence to the uncertainty that confounds our desire to know 'how it all turns out.' Through the heroic figure we write a story with no ending but one full of possibility. It is a tale at once uplifting and disheartening, shedding light and casting shadow. Knowledge will never answer the questions that this story poses, but it will expand our appreciation of it, uncovering nuance and meaning, adding dimension and depth to every thought we have and every action we take.           What we forget in our desire to know is that chaos and ambiguity are the very nature of creativity. It is only upon the Dionysian landscape, in the warm, wet, rich soil of imagination that the creative flower may bloom. What we also wish to forget is the fact that our physical reality, far from being removed from this chaotic energy, is merely another reflection of it. While we may live in a world governed by the familiar causal laws of science, it is a world, as Thomas Hobbes reminds us in The Leviathan , where life can be solitary, brutish and short. It is no wonder then that in the face of such insecurity the clarion call of the hero is so keenly heard.           Works Cited           Allen, Bem P. Personality Theories .

In the popular culture of America we can find many reflections of the heroic figure; in writing, in the graphic art of comic books, and most certainly in the aftermath of September 11th, heroes are ever present. Our cultural champions speak to our collective need to make sense of the nonsensical and to establish order in both our external and internal worlds. Indeed it is through the internal world of the psyche and the lens of psychological thought that we may gain a better perspective of the fusion of creativity and knowledge that we have come to call the heroic figure.           Creative experience and its expression cannot exist without some contextual framework by which it is understood and appreciated. The very survival of all that is creative depends upon such knowledge. Just as a bird released from its cage must eventually return to roost or perish in the wilderness so must our creative thoughts and imaginings eventually return to the reality of the corporeal world and the causal laws that govern it. This is the very nature of that which we call 'learning' and it is in such a way that creative thought gains relevance and weight, becoming part of our conscious reality. It is through this relationship between creativity and knowledge, between that which we imagine and that which we know, that we may gain a greater understanding of the heroic figure and its cultural significance.           The archetype of the hero is an expression of our imagination as well as a reflection of our experience. Carl Jung develops this idea in his essay, &quot;On the Relation of Analytical Psychology to Poetry&quot; when he writes, &quot;The primordial image, or archetype, is a figure-be it a daemon, a human being or a process-that constantly recurs in the course of history and appears wherever creative fantasy is freely expressed&quot; (186). Throughout history and across cultural divides the heroic figure appears, a symbolic expression of mankind's struggle to at once define as well as challenge the boundaries of existence. The stories of mythological heroes such as Herakles and Odysseus survive today not because they entertain us but because they teach us. Speaking of these mythic figures in the essay, &quot;Ancient Myths and Modern Man&quot;, Joseph L. Henderson writes, &quot;Their special role suggests that the essential function of the heroic myth is the development of the individual's ego-consciousness-his awareness of his own strengths and weaknesses-in a manner that will equip him for the arduous tasks with which life will confront him&quot; (112). By looking to the hero we are really looking back into the reality of our own state of being, searching for signposts in the landscape of the mythic that will somehow provide texture and traction as we navigate through the obstacles of our daily lives.           Through the heroic figure we gain a better understanding of who we are. It is no coincidence then that in our conscious and subconscious journey of self-discovery we have colonized our popular culture with the ethos of heroic myth. In comic books we find reassurance that even those who appear meek and mild mannered may only be a phone booth away from revealing their true nature and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Movie icon Arnold Schwarzenegger, who made his debut in the 1970 film, Hercules in New York, has spent three decades defying the aging process (in and of itself a heroic act), and reminding us in countless bad movies that a single individual with a lot of guns may indeed rescue the world from evil. On television, a top rated show chronicles the adolescence of Superman as its opening theme song pleads, &quot;Won't somebody save me?&quot; In newspapers we read of heroes in sport, astounding us with feats of physical supremacy. And we stand in awe, amazed by the acts of heroism that survived and defined the pathos of September 11th.           The hero educates, informs, and inspires. In surmounting adversity, the hero offers the individual a similar opportunity for transcendence, beyond the heroic ideal and into the realm of autonomous individuation, &quot;the process by which a person becomes a psychological 'in-dividual', that is, a separate, indivisible unity or 'whole'&quot; (Jung 27). In her essay &quot;I Will Be My Own Hero,&quot; Kristen E. Hughes comes to such a realization: &quot;It is not by aspiring to be a great man, or even by following one that I can find my answers. So now I am involved in a new search for a hero within me, but this time the hero will not be a bull, or a Ulysses, or even a Tudor queen&quot; (52). Through her relationship to the archetypal figure Ms. Hughes realizes the need for a heroic quest of her own, a quest in the pursuit of the ultimate knowledge, knowledge of self.           This newfound insight into individual identity, accessed through the portal of creative thought, can also serve the needs of the collective. In the aftermath of the attack on the World Trade Center, an entire city, indeed all of America itself, looked towards the heroic figure as a means to give some context to the chaos and some meaning to the immeasurable loss that we all witnessed and in some way suffered through. Heroes like NYPD Officer Moira Smith, was such a figure, a thirteen-year veteran of the department as well as a wife and mother of two who died in the collapse of the World Trade Center. A final photo of Officer Smith shows her escorting an injured man out of the Trade Center minutes before its collapse. After delivering the man to a paramedic, she returned to the building to look for more survivors, a final selfless action mirrored by hundreds of others who perished in the line of duty (&quot;Policewoman&quot; B4).           Through the story of Officer Smith we unite in not only grief but in courage, gaining through her sacrifice a new understanding and respect for the heroic ideal. As separate entities trying to cope with the magnitude of this disaster, we feel isolated and alone. By focusing on the beacon of light held by our modern day heroes, by firefighters and policemen, the individual finds strength and comfort and unity within a larger group. In Man and his Symbols , Carl Jung explains, &quot;In other words, his identity is temporarily dismembered or dissolved in the collective unconscious. From this state he is then ceremoniously rescued by the rite of the new birth. This is the first act of true consolidation of the ego with the larger group, expressed as totem, clan, tribe, or all three combined&quot; (130). In this Jungian model of ego identification we see how the individual seeks salvation through dissolution into what is commonly referred to as the collective unconscious, defined by Bem Allen in his book, Theories of Personality as &quot;a storehouse of ancestral experiences dating to the dawn of humankind and common to all humans&quot; (54). This state of grace is achieved through creative rituals and symbolic expressive figures, such as the archetypal hero. It is in this way that we come to know, understand, and survive psychic experiences that defy and confound the boundaries of rational thought. For the individual as well as the group, the hero hands us hope, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. Just as in mythology, however, such a valuable gift is never without its price.           The heroic figure owes its very existence to the adversarial forces that oppose it, a symbiotic relationship not unlike the one that exists between creativity and knowledge. Without darkness there can be no light just as there can be no appreciation for the creative without the intellectual awareness and knowledge that infuses it with meaning. The hero seeks to unite these divergent energies through his deeds and in the process must recognize and challenge the ominous shadow self that resides within him. Henderson explains, &quot;For most people the dark or negative side of the personality remains unconscious. The hero, on the contrary, must realize that the shadow exists and that he can draw strength from it. [Indeed] before the ego can triumph, it must master and assimilate the shadow&quot; (120-1). The challenge before the hero is not only to acknowledge chaos but also to embrace it, a symbolic representation of the challenge before us all.           The hero reminds us of our own inner demons, of dragons sleeping in dark places that we would rather not visit. Part of us wishes, like the knight in shining armor, to awaken the beast within and slay it while another part yearns to seduce the serpent, to slide our fingers along its silvery scales and feel its hot breath against our cheek. With either action we run the risk of unleashing a creature we may not be able to contain. Addressing this conundrum in her essay, &quot;The Process of Individuation,&quot; M.L. von Franz writes, &quot;Divining in advance whether our dark partner symbolizes a shortcoming that we should overcome or a meaningful bit of life that we should accept-this is one of the most difficult problems that we encounter on the way to individuation&quot; (175-6). And so we applaud the hero's action, amazed and inspired by her fortitude and courage while at the same time subconsciously outraged at the audacity of her endeavor. It is beyond our capacity to accept without reservation the heroic figure, a figure whose very existence confronts us with a side of our psyche we strive to keep from conscious thought. For this threat to our psychic security, the hero must pay.           When Icarus dared fly too high on waxen wings, the heat of the sun and his own hubris sent him plummeting like a rock into the roiling sea below. The landscape of the hero is littered with such warnings, cautionary tales that remind the individual of the risk one takes in challenging accepted boundaries. Kristen Hughes hints at the cost of her own self-exploration when she writes, &quot;I am finding a new Hero in myself to follow. She can be violent at times, because she can be everything, but she will always be sorry. No matter how hungry her heart, indifference will not suit her. She has an indomitable will but is never proud for long&quot; (54). Hughes acknowledges the limitlessness of the hero within her. Flying on newfound wings, much like Icarus, she can &quot;be everything.&quot; Hughes however, unlike the mythic hero, realizes the sorrow and humility that come with such freedom and knowledge. She also recognizes the violence inherent in a heroic struggle, as anything worth realizing must be worth fighting for.           Perhaps nowhere is this thought more clearly illustrated than on the actual battlefield of war, a home ground for the heroic ideal. Tim O'Brien in his essay &quot;How To Tell A True War Story,&quot; speaks of the revelatory nature of warfare and its repercussions: &quot;Though it's odd, you're never more alive than when you're almost dead. You recognize what's valuable. Freshly, as if for the first time, you love what's best in yourself and in the world, all that might be lost&quot; (447). The experiences of Hughes and O'Brien mirror that of the heroic initiate and in some way bring us a sense of comfort in their commonality. One cannot touch the face of God without consequence. For daring to dip into the well of the subconscious and stir up its dark and troubling waters, the hero may wear a laurel wreath only if it has first been dipped in his own blood. That we find some sense of satisfaction in this retribution speaks to our ambivalent relationship with not only the heroic figure but our own humanity as well. We turn to the hero for hope but with the very promise of transcendence we find ourselves pressed against our own mortality, like fading flowers in the pages of a vast and heavy book.           The heroic figure calls to us precisely because he resonates with the promise of life after death, a prospect that simultaneously enthralls and terrifies. Echoes of this theme can be heard in Kristen Hughes' search for the hero within herself when she writes, &quot;It is not by aspiring to be a great man, or even by following one that I can find my answers&quot; (52). One gets the sense that for Hughes, an ideal or dream has somehow died, opening a doorway to self-discovery. For O'Brien the very real possibility of physical death on the battlefield grants him a sensation of being &quot;more alive&quot; and aware, in communion with all of creation. In Greek mythology heroes were buried with a coin beneath their tongue, payment to be offered to the ferryman Charon for transit across the River Styx to an afterlife in the Elysian Fields. And Carl Jung, in his essay, &quot;Approaching the Unconscious,&quot; refers to arguably the most well-known heroic archetype in the Western World when he writes, &quot;The general idea of Christ the Redeemer belongs to the world-wide and pre-Christ theme of the hero and rescuer who, although he has been devoured by a monster, appears again in a miraculous way, having overcome whatever monster it was that swallowed him&quot; (72-3). Like moths to the proverbial flame, we are drawn to the concept of Death and the promise of Life Everlasting that flickers within it. Evading all empirical evidence, our belief must be built upon a foundation of faith, in and of itself a creative construct. Knowledge thwarted, still we stumble forward, desperate to find some proof, some real life experience to substantiate our conviction. Such is the fuel with which wars are waged.           More compelling than any religious or territorial or economic contention, our collective need to experience and substantiate the state of being for which the archetypal hero stands, drives us forward onto the fields of battle. Given that the dead are unable to confirm that life exists after life has been lost, mankind must console itself by marching to the brink of the abyss fortified with the belief that the end is, in actuality, just the beginning. This is the certitude that must shine in the eyes of the soldier; it is the fervor of the suicide bomber and the kamikaze pilot. It is the creative thinking that must be entertained in even the most hopeless of hearts. It is the belief that allows us to live in a world that we will always imagine more completely than we will ever know.           We reach into the caldron of creative thought, hoping to gain some kind of knowledge that will bring order and explanation to the world that exists within and without. As we pull back our hand, hoping to grasp one single solid answer, we sadly find ourselves instead with a handful of quivering questions. Mythology and the archetypal figure cannot explain our physical reality; they can only serve as creative expressions of it, with all its ambiguity and doubt. Indeed, the heroic archetype owes its very existence to the uncertainty that confounds our desire to know 'how it all turns out.' Through the heroic figure we write a story with no ending but one full of possibility. It is a tale at once uplifting and disheartening, shedding light and casting shadow. Knowledge will never answer the questions that this story poses, but it will expand our appreciation of it, uncovering nuance and meaning, adding dimension and depth to every thought we have and every action we take.           What we forget in our desire to know is that chaos and ambiguity are the very nature of creativity. It is only upon the Dionysian landscape, in the warm, wet, rich soil of imagination that the creative flower may bloom. What we also wish to forget is the fact that our physical reality, far from being removed from this chaotic energy, is merely another reflection of it. While we may live in a world governed by the familiar causal laws of science, it is a world, as Thomas Hobbes reminds us in The Leviathan , where life can be solitary, brutish and short. It is no wonder then that in the face of such insecurity the clarion call of the hero is so keenly heard.           Works Cited           Allen, Bem P. Personality Theories .

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

In the popular culture of America we can find many reflections of the heroic figure; in writing, in the graphic art of comic books, and most certainly in the aftermath of September 11th, heroes are ever present. Our cultural champions speak to our collective need to make sense of the nonsensical and to establish order in both our external and internal worlds. Indeed it is through the internal world of the psyche and the lens of psychological thought that we may gain a better perspective of the fusion of creativity and knowledge that we have come to call the heroic figure.           Creative experience and its expression cannot exist without some contextual framework by which it is understood and appreciated. The very survival of all that is creative depends upon such knowledge. Just as a bird released from its cage must eventually return to roost or perish in the wilderness so must our creative thoughts and imaginings eventually return to the reality of the corporeal world and the causal laws that govern it. This is the very nature of that which we call 'learning' and it is in such a way that creative thought gains relevance and weight, becoming part of our conscious reality. It is through this relationship between creativity and knowledge, between that which we imagine and that which we know, that we may gain a greater understanding of the heroic figure and its cultural significance.           The archetype of the hero is an expression of our imagination as well as a reflection of our experience. Carl Jung develops this idea in his essay, &quot;On the Relation of Analytical Psychology to Poetry&quot; when he writes, &quot;The primordial image, or archetype, is a figure-be it a daemon, a human being or a process-that constantly recurs in the course of history and appears wherever creative fantasy is freely expressed&quot; (186). Throughout history and across cultural divides the heroic figure appears, a symbolic expression of mankind's struggle to at once define as well as challenge the boundaries of existence. The stories of mythological heroes such as Herakles and Odysseus survive today not because they entertain us but because they teach us. Speaking of these mythic figures in the essay, &quot;Ancient Myths and Modern Man&quot;, Joseph L. Henderson writes, &quot;Their special role suggests that the essential function of the heroic myth is the development of the individual's ego-consciousness-his awareness of his own strengths and weaknesses-in a manner that will equip him for the arduous tasks with which life will confront him&quot; (112). By looking to the hero we are really looking back into the reality of our own state of being, searching for signposts in the landscape of the mythic that will somehow provide texture and traction as we navigate through the obstacles of our daily lives.           Through the heroic figure we gain a better understanding of who we are. It is no coincidence then that in our conscious and subconscious journey of self-discovery we have colonized our popular culture with the ethos of heroic myth. In comic books we find reassurance that even those who appear meek and mild mannered may only be a phone booth away from revealing their true nature and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Movie icon Arnold Schwarzenegger, who made his debut in the 1970 film, Hercules in New York, has spent three decades defying the aging process (in and of itself a heroic act), and reminding us in countless bad movies that a single individual with a lot of guns may indeed rescue the world from evil. On television, a top rated show chronicles the adolescence of Superman as its opening theme song pleads, &quot;Won't somebody save me?&quot; In newspapers we read of heroes in sport, astounding us with feats of physical supremacy. And we stand in awe, amazed by the acts of heroism that survived and defined the pathos of September 11th.           The hero educates, informs, and inspires. In surmounting adversity, the hero offers the individual a similar opportunity for transcendence, beyond the heroic ideal and into the realm of autonomous individuation, &quot;the process by which a person becomes a psychological 'in-dividual', that is, a separate, indivisible unity or 'whole'&quot; (Jung 27). In her essay &quot;I Will Be My Own Hero,&quot; Kristen E. Hughes comes to such a realization: &quot;It is not by aspiring to be a great man, or even by following one that I can find my answers. So now I am involved in a new search for a hero within me, but this time the hero will not be a bull, or a Ulysses, or even a Tudor queen&quot; (52). Through her relationship to the archetypal figure Ms. Hughes realizes the need for a heroic quest of her own, a quest in the pursuit of the ultimate knowledge, knowledge of self.           This newfound insight into individual identity, accessed through the portal of creative thought, can also serve the needs of the collective. In the aftermath of the attack on the World Trade Center, an entire city, indeed all of America itself, looked towards the heroic figure as a means to give some context to the chaos and some meaning to the immeasurable loss that we all witnessed and in some way suffered through. Heroes like NYPD Officer Moira Smith, was such a figure, a thirteen-year veteran of the department as well as a wife and mother of two who died in the collapse of the World Trade Center. A final photo of Officer Smith shows her escorting an injured man out of the Trade Center minutes before its collapse. After delivering the man to a paramedic, she returned to the building to look for more survivors, a final selfless action mirrored by hundreds of others who perished in the line of duty (&quot;Policewoman&quot; B4).           Through the story of Officer Smith we unite in not only grief but in courage, gaining through her sacrifice a new understanding and respect for the heroic ideal. As separate entities trying to cope with the magnitude of this disaster, we feel isolated and alone. By focusing on the beacon of light held by our modern day heroes, by firefighters and policemen, the individual finds strength and comfort and unity within a larger group. In Man and his Symbols , Carl Jung explains, &quot;In other words, his identity is temporarily dismembered or dissolved in the collective unconscious. From this state he is then ceremoniously rescued by the rite of the new birth. This is the first act of true consolidation of the ego with the larger group, expressed as totem, clan, tribe, or all three combined&quot; (130). In this Jungian model of ego identification we see how the individual seeks salvation through dissolution into what is commonly referred to as the collective unconscious, defined by Bem Allen in his book, Theories of Personality as &quot;a storehouse of ancestral experiences dating to the dawn of humankind and common to all humans&quot; (54). This state of grace is achieved through creative rituals and symbolic expressive figures, such as the archetypal hero. It is in this way that we come to know, understand, and survive psychic experiences that defy and confound the boundaries of rational thought. For the individual as well as the group, the hero hands us hope, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. Just as in mythology, however, such a valuable gift is never without its price.           The heroic figure owes its very existence to the adversarial forces that oppose it, a symbiotic relationship not unlike the one that exists between creativity and knowledge. Without darkness there can be no light just as there can be no appreciation for the creative without the intellectual awareness and knowledge that infuses it with meaning. The hero seeks to unite these divergent energies through his deeds and in the process must recognize and challenge the ominous shadow self that resides within him. Henderson explains, &quot;For most people the dark or negative side of the personality remains unconscious. The hero, on the contrary, must realize that the shadow exists and that he can draw strength from it. [Indeed] before the ego can triumph, it must master and assimilate the shadow&quot; (120-1). The challenge before the hero is not only to acknowledge chaos but also to embrace it, a symbolic representation of the challenge before us all.           The hero reminds us of our own inner demons, of dragons sleeping in dark places that we would rather not visit. Part of us wishes, like the knight in shining armor, to awaken the beast within and slay it while another part yearns to seduce the serpent, to slide our fingers along its silvery scales and feel its hot breath against our cheek. With either action we run the risk of unleashing a creature we may not be able to contain. Addressing this conundrum in her essay, &quot;The Process of Individuation,&quot; M.L. von Franz writes, &quot;Divining in advance whether our dark partner symbolizes a shortcoming that we should overcome or a meaningful bit of life that we should accept-this is one of the most difficult problems that we encounter on the way to individuation&quot; (175-6). And so we applaud the hero's action, amazed and inspired by her fortitude and courage while at the same time subconsciously outraged at the audacity of her endeavor. It is beyond our capacity to accept without reservation the heroic figure, a figure whose very existence confronts us with a side of our psyche we strive to keep from conscious thought. For this threat to our psychic security, the hero must pay.           When Icarus dared fly too high on waxen wings, the heat of the sun and his own hubris sent him plummeting like a rock into the roiling sea below. The landscape of the hero is littered with such warnings, cautionary tales that remind the individual of the risk one takes in challenging accepted boundaries. Kristen Hughes hints at the cost of her own self-exploration when she writes, &quot;I am finding a new Hero in myself to follow. She can be violent at times, because she can be everything, but she will always be sorry. No matter how hungry her heart, indifference will not suit her. She has an indomitable will but is never proud for long&quot; (54). Hughes acknowledges the limitlessness of the hero within her. Flying on newfound wings, much like Icarus, she can &quot;be everything.&quot; Hughes however, unlike the mythic hero, realizes the sorrow and humility that come with such freedom and knowledge. She also recognizes the violence inherent in a heroic struggle, as anything worth realizing must be worth fighting for.           Perhaps nowhere is this thought more clearly illustrated than on the actual battlefield of war, a home ground for the heroic ideal. Tim O'Brien in his essay &quot;How To Tell A True War Story,&quot; speaks of the revelatory nature of warfare and its repercussions: &quot;Though it's odd, you're never more alive than when you're almost dead. You recognize what's valuable. Freshly, as if for the first time, you love what's best in yourself and in the world, all that might be lost&quot; (447). The experiences of Hughes and O'Brien mirror that of the heroic initiate and in some way bring us a sense of comfort in their commonality. One cannot touch the face of God without consequence. For daring to dip into the well of the subconscious and stir up its dark and troubling waters, the hero may wear a laurel wreath only if it has first been dipped in his own blood. That we find some sense of satisfaction in this retribution speaks to our ambivalent relationship with not only the heroic figure but our own humanity as well. We turn to the hero for hope but with the very promise of transcendence we find ourselves pressed against our own mortality, like fading flowers in the pages of a vast and heavy book.           The heroic figure calls to us precisely because he resonates with the promise of life after death, a prospect that simultaneously enthralls and terrifies. Echoes of this theme can be heard in Kristen Hughes' search for the hero within herself when she writes, &quot;It is not by aspiring to be a great man, or even by following one that I can find my answers&quot; (52). One gets the sense that for Hughes, an ideal or dream has somehow died, opening a doorway to self-discovery. For O'Brien the very real possibility of physical death on the battlefield grants him a sensation of being &quot;more alive&quot; and aware, in communion with all of creation. In Greek mythology heroes were buried with a coin beneath their tongue, payment to be offered to the ferryman Charon for transit across the River Styx to an afterlife in the Elysian Fields. And Carl Jung, in his essay, &quot;Approaching the Unconscious,&quot; refers to arguably the most well-known heroic archetype in the Western World when he writes, &quot;The general idea of Christ the Redeemer belongs to the world-wide and pre-Christ theme of the hero and rescuer who, although he has been devoured by a monster, appears again in a miraculous way, having overcome whatever monster it was that swallowed him&quot; (72-3). Like moths to the proverbial flame, we are drawn to the concept of Death and the promise of Life Everlasting that flickers within it. Evading all empirical evidence, our belief must be built upon a foundation of faith, in and of itself a creative construct. Knowledge thwarted, still we stumble forward, desperate to find some proof, some real life experience to substantiate our conviction. Such is the fuel with which wars are waged.           More compelling than any religious or territorial or economic contention, our collective need to experience and substantiate the state of being for which the archetypal hero stands, drives us forward onto the fields of battle. Given that the dead are unable to confirm that life exists after life has been lost, mankind must console itself by marching to the brink of the abyss fortified with the belief that the end is, in actuality, just the beginning. This is the certitude that must shine in the eyes of the soldier; it is the fervor of the suicide bomber and the kamikaze pilot. It is the creative thinking that must be entertained in even the most hopeless of hearts. It is the belief that allows us to live in a world that we will always imagine more completely than we will ever know.           We reach into the caldron of creative thought, hoping to gain some kind of knowledge that will bring order and explanation to the world that exists within and without. As we pull back our hand, hoping to grasp one single solid answer, we sadly find ourselves instead with a handful of quivering questions. Mythology and the archetypal figure cannot explain our physical reality; they can only serve as creative expressions of it, with all its ambiguity and doubt. Indeed, the heroic archetype owes its very existence to the uncertainty that confounds our desire to know 'how it all turns out.' Through the heroic figure we write a story with no ending but one full of possibility. It is a tale at once uplifting and disheartening, shedding light and casting shadow. Knowledge will never answer the questions that this story poses, but it will expand our appreciation of it, uncovering nuance and meaning, adding dimension and depth to every thought we have and every action we take.           What we forget in our desire to know is that chaos and ambiguity are the very nature of creativity. It is only upon the Dionysian landscape, in the warm, wet, rich soil of imagination that the creative flower may bloom. What we also wish to forget is the fact that our physical reality, far from being removed from this chaotic energy, is merely another reflection of it. While we may live in a world governed by the familiar causal laws of science, it is a world, as Thomas Hobbes reminds us in The Leviathan , where life can be solitary, brutish and short. It is no wonder then that in the face of such insecurity the clarion call of the hero is so keenly heard.           Works Cited           Allen, Bem P. Personality Theories .

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

A storm that will swallow the children, and I will deliver them from the kingdom of pain. I will deliver the children back to their doorsteps; I'll send the monsters back to the underground. I'll send them back to a place where no one else can see them, except for me because I am Donnie Darko              Synopsis     Donnie accepts his death, understanding what his continued life would mean. Most of the film takes place in a tangent universe, where Donnie is guided by Frank and others, and shown what will happen if he survives the jet engine.    Does Donnie choose to die? To me, this is hard to answer. At one point, Donnie asks his physics teacher about free will versus following the 'path of god.' We can actually see this 'path of god' for some people when their movements are predicted by some computer graphics. On a larger scale, Donnie has been marked for death as his path, and it is debateable as to how much choice he really ever had. I think to say he accepts it after losing Gretchen and killing Frank is the most accurate perspective.    Another theme of the film is dying alone. Grandma Death says that every living creature dies alone. In a way, Gretchen, Frank, and Donnie all do die alone. Donnie thinks about this doom in questioning the existence of god. He is often a lonely guy; the idea seems unfair. I think this theme is really about having to accept our own deaths. We need to see that the destruction of ourselves is just another form of creation -- something Donnie himself points out (in his own way) in analyzing Graham Greene's story in school.      Detailed Analysis     In the beginning, Donnie wakes up in the middle of the road near the top of a mountain. He smiles in amusement at his own sleep-walking, which is how he got there.    At the dinner table we are introduced to Donnie's family. Donnie doesn't fit perfectly, but they still love him. If you include the deleted scenes, Donnie will say goodbye to each of these characters before he dies. In the final cut, we just see him kiss his older sister on the cheek before he drives away from his house with Gretchen for the last time.    Donnie, feeling guilty about fighting with his mom, starts taking his medication again. This, it seems, will induce more sleep-walking. The deleted scenes mention that they were actually placebos the entire time, and we know Donnie actually sleep-walks either way.    Donnie's dad wakes up in the middle of the night. The point is that these sleeping problems run in the family. In one of the deleted scenes, his dad says to him, \"I used to be crazy...\" implying Donnie's emotional problems are also genetic.    We see the clock strike midnight. This helps us keep track of the time left until the end of the world. Donnie probably talks to Frank on the golf  course between 1 and 2 am, which means the world ends around 8 am. We will see the clock strike midnight one more time.    \"Wake up, Donnie,\" we are introduced to Frank as he awakens the hero for the first time. Richard Kelly says this is the moment we enter the tangent universe. The writer (R. Kelly) suggests we take everything literally in a sci-fi fashion, but I prefer to think of this (the main/tangent universe) portion of the movie as a vision or dream of Donnie's.    Donnie talks to Frank in the golf course. The extended scenes on the DVD contain a longer conversation -- this is how, for example, Donnie knows that Frank's name is Frank. The end of the world can be viewed as the collapse of the tangent universe, which I like to think of as the end of Donnie's vision.    We see Elizabeth (Donnie's older sister) sneaking home. Her boyfriend, who is the pre-death Frank, drives away and honks. Watching the movie, even with the extended/ deleted scenes, I don't think you could tell that pre-death Frank was supposed to be her boyfriend. I only know this from the director's commentary.    Boom! the jet engine crashes into the house. Scary stuff, dude. No one is hurt. When we return to the real (non-tangent) universe, it is still unknown where this engine came from. Kelly says the engine is the only physical artifact which survives from the tangent universe. The website hints that in real life, the plane it came from remains unharmed, even after halloween.    Donnie is found asleep on the golf course. We meet Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze), and Donnie catches the weird vibe.      Some other Donnie Darko pages    Cellar Door    Richard-Kelly.net       Curious Facts     The pills Donnie is taking are actually placebos (from the deleted scenes).    Frank is Donnie's older sister (Elizabeth)'s boyfriend, which you can only really tell from the deleted scenes.    The red car Frank drives really is the actor (playing Frank)'s car.   The actor playing Frank (James Duval) really is the guy in the bunny suit the whole time. Richard Kelly says \"we couldn't afford anyone else.\" (Which is esp funny since they mostly didn't pay the actors at all.)    Donnie and Elizabeth Darko (Donnie's older sister) are played by Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal, siblings in reality.    The movie was shot in twenty-eight days, exactly the time-span of the movie itself, and on a budget of under five million.    Alex Greenwald (the badass from school) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie) are good friends in real life. Alex is also a singer in the band Phantom Planet along with Jason Schwartzman (from Rushmore ).    Jena Malone is pretty cute.                back to movies"}]}]
