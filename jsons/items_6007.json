The program is unique in its combination of a rigorous academic inpatient training, extensive formal primary care curriculum, and extraordinary outpatient clinical experience.   The three-year Primary Care Residency Program has 13.5 blocks of in-depth primary care block curriculum. Each primary care block, coordinated by primary care faculty, is designed to meet specific educational objectives. Blocks begin in the first year with a rigorous month long introduction to primary care, focusing on diagnosis and management of common illnesses, as well learning effective systems based practice. This block initiates the core pillars of learning that spiral through the three years. Subsequent blocks include dermatology, women's health, clinical epidemiology, geriatrics, health policy and economics, psychosocial medicine and health communication, geriatrics, neuro/musculoskeletal, learning to teach patients and others, teams, and research. The learning activities are highly interactive and include annual independent projects and a variety of resident lead conferences. During ward months, residents are seamlessly integrated into the inpatient rotations. The inpatient experience is identical to that of the categorical residency in content and in expectations.   The keystone of the Primary Care Residency Program is the clinic continuity experience. Residents are precepted by dedicated primary care faculty. There is a one-to-three ratio of faculty to residents to ensure outstanding supervision and teaching. Residents serve as the primary physicians for an amazing ethnic, cultural, and linguistic diversity of medically underserved people at Bellevue Hospital and Gouverneur Diagnostic and Treatment Center. The program is notable for unsurpassed camaraderie among house staff and open communication between faculty and house staff.   Graduates of the program are highly valued and sought after following their training. They contribute to the practice, teaching, and scholarship in general internal medicine and are active, informed citizens of their professions and communities. Graduates are nationally recognized for their clinical preparation and have outstanding careers in academic medicine, public sector and private practice, community-based practice, and public service.   \u00a0                                                                               NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}]},

The program is unique in its combination of a rigorous academic inpatient training, extensive formal primary care curriculum, and extraordinary outpatient clinical experience.   The three-year Primary Care Residency Program has 13.5 blocks of in-depth primary care block curriculum. Each primary care block, coordinated by primary care faculty, is designed to meet specific educational objectives. Blocks begin in the first year with a rigorous month long introduction to primary care, focusing on diagnosis and management of common illnesses, as well learning effective systems based practice. This block initiates the core pillars of learning that spiral through the three years. Subsequent blocks include dermatology, women's health, clinical epidemiology, geriatrics, health policy and economics, psychosocial medicine and health communication, geriatrics, neuro/musculoskeletal, learning to teach patients and others, teams, and research. The learning activities are highly interactive and include annual independent projects and a variety of resident lead conferences. During ward months, residents are seamlessly integrated into the inpatient rotations. The inpatient experience is identical to that of the categorical residency in content and in expectations.   The keystone of the Primary Care Residency Program is the clinic continuity experience. Residents are precepted by dedicated primary care faculty. There is a one-to-three ratio of faculty to residents to ensure outstanding supervision and teaching. Residents serve as the primary physicians for an amazing ethnic, cultural, and linguistic diversity of medically underserved people at Bellevue Hospital and Gouverneur Diagnostic and Treatment Center. The program is notable for unsurpassed camaraderie among house staff and open communication between faculty and house staff.   Graduates of the program are highly valued and sought after following their training. They contribute to the practice, teaching, and scholarship in general internal medicine and are active, informed citizens of their professions and communities. Graduates are nationally recognized for their clinical preparation and have outstanding careers in academic medicine, public sector and private practice, community-based practice, and public service.   \u00a0                                                                               NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}, {"content": "APN: Adult-Gerontology Primary Care III | NYU College of Nursing                                Home   College Directory   Global   News                                           Menu     Search                                                      About   Academics   Admissions   Research   Our Practices   Students   Alumni                                     Sections                                          Undergraduate   Graduate   Clinical Experience   Academic Calendars   Academic Integrity   Academic Affairs   Technical Standards                                     Academics                   Home > Academics                                                                       &lt; Back  APN: Adult-Gerontology Primary Care III                      NURSE-GN 2018, 3 Credits, (Spring)  This course focuses on the assessment, diagnosis, management, and evaluation of complex health problems of adolescents and adult clients in primary care settings. Students apply critical thinking and evidence-based clinical decision-making competencies to formulate differential diagnoses and develop management plans for adult clients and their families. Students combine the advanced practice roles of clinician, educator, advocate, and leader to design and evaluate therapeutic interventions that utilize a variety of treatment modalities. Concepts include health promotion, disease prevention, cultural competence, and health policy and ethical issues. Individual, family, and community health needs are evaluated using a population-focused framework.
