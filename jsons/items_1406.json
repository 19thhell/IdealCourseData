The results, which appear in the journal Nature, also offer insights into addressing speech-related inhibitions caused by stroke or injury and lay the groundwork for better rehabilitation methods.   \u201cOur findings upend what has been universally accepted in the scientific community\u2014that we use only one side of our brains for speech,\u201d says Bijan Pesaran, an associate professor in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science and the study\u2019s senior author. \u201cIn addition, now that we have a firmer understanding of how speech is generated, our work toward finding remedies for speech afflictions is much better informed.\u201d   Many in the scientific community have posited that both speech and language are lateralized\u2014that is, we use only one side of our brains for speech, which involves listening and speaking, and language, which involves constructing and understanding sentences. However, the conclusions pertaining to speech generally stem from studies that rely on indirect measurements of brain activity, raising questions about characterizing speech as lateralized.   To address this matter, the researchers directly examined the connection between speech and the neurological process.   Specifically, the study relied on data collected at NYU ECoG , a center where brain activity is recorded directly from patients implanted with specialized electrodes placed directly inside and on the surface of the brain while the patients are performing sensory and cognitive tasks. Here, the researchers examined brain functions of patients suffering from epilepsy by using methods that coincided with their medical treatment.   \u201cRecordings directly from the human brain are a rare opportunity,\u201d says Thomas Thesen, director of the NYU ECoG Center and co-author of the study.   \u201cAs such, they offer unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution over other imaging technologies to help us achieve a better understanding of complex and uniquely human brain functions, such as language,\u201d adds Thesen, an assistant professor at NYU Langone.   In their examination, the researchers tested the parts of the brain that were used during speech. Here, the study\u2019s subjects were asked to repeat two \u201cnon-words\u201d\u2014\u201ckig\u201d and \u201cpob.\u201d Using non-words as a prompt to gauge neurological activity, the researchers were able to isolate speech from language.   An analysis of brain activity as patients engaged in speech tasks showed that both sides of the brain were used\u2014that is, speech is, in fact, bi-lateral.   \u201cNow that we have greater insights into the connection between the brain and speech, we can begin to develop new ways to aid those trying to regain the ability to speak after a stroke or injuries resulting in brain damage,\u201d observes Pesaran. \u201cWith this greater understanding of the speech process, we can retool rehabilitation methods in ways that isolate speech recovery and that don\u2019t involve language.\u201d   The study\u2019s other authors included: Gregory Cogan, a postdoctoral fellow at NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science; Chad Carlson, an associate professor of neurology at the Medical College of Wisconsin; Werner Doyle, an associate professor of neurosurgery at NYU Langone; and Orrin Devinsky, professor of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry and the director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at NYU Langone.
