Each section gives a general account of the structure of the courts and their jurisdictions, civil litigation procedures in each country concerned, the local legal profession, local specialist areas and charges, and the local judiciary. The section then traces in detail each country's procedural steps for typical kinds of commercial litigation, such as claims for breach of sale of goods contracts, claims for damages under charter parties, claims relating to bank deposits, claims to enforce foreign judgements and arbitration awards, admiralty claims, and claims for breach of copyright and trademarks. The uniform subject matter of the different national sections permits ease of same-claim comparisons between different jurisdictions.
