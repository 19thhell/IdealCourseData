As an applicant, you are expected to demonstrate your talents and mastery of subject matter to support your application and marshal your best cases for admission to NYU. As a result, NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university.   To be eligible for admission, applicants are expected to submit results from one of the following testing options:     The SAT Reasoning Test; or     The ACT with Writing Test; or     Three SAT Subject Test scores; or     Three AP exam scores; or     The International Baccalaureate Diploma; or     Three IB higher-level exam scores (if you are not an IB Diploma candidate); or     Results from a nationally accredited exam that is considered locally to signify the completion of secondary education, is administered independently of the student\u2019s school, and has been approved by the NYU Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Click here to review our list of approved national examinations .     Redesigned SAT Scores : NYU will accept current and redesigned SAT scores for admission. Applicants may submit scores from either the current SAT or the redesigned SAT (offered beginning spring 2016).                                                  If I have taken multiple examinations that meet NYU's standardized testing requirements, what does NYU recommend I submit to be eligible for admission?                               In the spirit of presenting your best case for admission, choose the examination you feel positions you more favorably and submit only that examination - as long as the results you submit meet our standardized testing requirements. You should only submit multiple test types if you want us to review additional examination results. All examinations are considered equally and you will not be placed at a disadvantage if you do not send SAT/ACT testing.   With regard to the SAT, NYU participates in Score Choice , enabling you to elect which tests you want to send to NYU. If you take the SAT multiple times, we will only review the highest Critical Reading, Math, and Writing scores you submit, regardless of test dates, creating the highest possible composite score for you in our evaluation process.   For the ACT, we will review the highest composite ACT score with Writing, regardless of test dates.                        Subject Requirements:     Students who submit SAT Subject Test, AP, or IB scores (for students not submitting an IB Diploma) must submit:   One literature or humanities score;   One math or science score;   And a score from one test of the student's choice in any subject. Click here to view the Standardized Testing Categories .       For applicants to the Stern School of Business , one of the exams above must be in mathematics.   For applicants to the Polytechnic School of Engineering , the exams above must include: one literature or humanities score; one math score; and one science score.

For other examinations, like IB or A Levels, if final results are unavailable at the time of application, predicted results may be submitted by a school official, via one of the following methods:     Naviance/Common Application website\u2028   Mailed on official school letterhead, in a sealed and signed envelope   Emailed from a clearly identifiable school email address\u2028     You may also ask a school official to submit the NYU Predicted Results Form using the above methods.   NYU reserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission if final results are not within close range of the predicted results.   Submitting Final Scores and Examination Results   Test scores or examination results should be submitted directly from the testing organization by the appropriate application deadline. If results cannot be sent by the testing organization, these should be provided by a school official.

As an applicant, you are expected to demonstrate your talents and mastery of subject matter to support your application and marshal your best cases for admission to NYU. As a result, NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university.   To be eligible for admission, applicants are expected to submit results from one of the following testing options:     The SAT Reasoning Test; or     The ACT with Writing Test; or     Three SAT Subject Test scores; or     Three AP exam scores; or     The International Baccalaureate Diploma; or     Three IB higher-level exam scores (if you are not an IB Diploma candidate); or     Results from a nationally accredited exam that is considered locally to signify the completion of secondary education, is administered independently of the student\u2019s school, and has been approved by the NYU Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Click here to review our list of approved national examinations .     Redesigned SAT Scores : NYU will accept current and redesigned SAT scores for admission. Applicants may submit scores from either the current SAT or the redesigned SAT (offered beginning spring 2016).                                                  If I have taken multiple examinations that meet NYU's standardized testing requirements, what does NYU recommend I submit to be eligible for admission?                               In the spirit of presenting your best case for admission, choose the examination you feel positions you more favorably and submit only that examination - as long as the results you submit meet our standardized testing requirements. You should only submit multiple test types if you want us to review additional examination results. All examinations are considered equally and you will not be placed at a disadvantage if you do not send SAT/ACT testing.   With regard to the SAT, NYU participates in Score Choice , enabling you to elect which tests you want to send to NYU. If you take the SAT multiple times, we will only review the highest Critical Reading, Math, and Writing scores you submit, regardless of test dates, creating the highest possible composite score for you in our evaluation process.   For the ACT, we will review the highest composite ACT score with Writing, regardless of test dates.                        Subject Requirements:     Students who submit SAT Subject Test, AP, or IB scores (for students not submitting an IB Diploma) must submit:   One literature or humanities score;   One math or science score;   And a score from one test of the student's choice in any subject. Click here to view the Standardized Testing Categories .       For applicants to the Stern School of Business , one of the exams above must be in mathematics.   For applicants to the Polytechnic School of Engineering , the exams above must include: one literature or humanities score; one math score; and one science score.     NYU Codes:   SAT, SAT Subject Test, AP, and TOEFL: 2562  ACT: 2838                                            Approved National Examinations \u00bb                                               English Language Testing Requirements for Non-Native English Speakers \u00bb                                                           Submitting Predicted Results   SAT, SAT Subject, ACT, and AP scores must be final at the time of application. For other examinations, like IB or A Levels, if final results are unavailable at the time of application, predicted results may be submitted by a school official, via one of the following methods:     Naviance/Common Application website\u2028   Mailed on official school letterhead, in a sealed and signed envelope   Emailed from a clearly identifiable school email address\u2028     You may also ask a school official to submit the NYU Predicted Results Form using the above methods.   NYU reserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission if final results are not within close range of the predicted results.   Submitting Final Scores and Examination Results   Test scores or examination results should be submitted directly from the testing organization by the appropriate application deadline. If results cannot be sent by the testing organization, these should be provided by a school official.

International transfer applicants, however, must review our English language testing requirements , which apply to both freshman and transfer candidates applying to our campus in New York.   If you have not already completed one full year of full-time college or university enrollment in liberal arts and science courses by the time you submit your application, you must meet the same standardized testing requirements that are outlined on our Standardized Tests page for Freshman Applicants.   Students who must submit standardized tests should note that the NYU Code for the SAT, SAT Subject Test, AP, and TOEFL is 2562; the NYU Code for the ACT is 2838.

Students in those countries are still waiting for their scores.   We are empathetic to any students still waiting for their scores. \u00a0Still, applicants to NYU must submit some form of standardized testing to be eligible for admission. While we have one of the most flexible testing policies in the world, we cannot offer admission without standardized test scores that meet our eligibility requirements.   In order to complete our evaluation of all Regular Decision candidates by April 1, we need test scores by mid-January at the latest.\u00a0 Students still have the option of taking November and/or December tests (either the SAT or 3 SAT Subject Tests to meet our entry requirements) &#8211; though we realize registration is now closed for November. \u00a0Additionally, the ACT (which also meets our eligibility requirements) is offered in December.   We may get scores from the January SAT test date in enough time to consider those scores for Regular Decision admission as well, but we cannot guarantee that scores will arrive in time for us to complete our evaluation process.\u00a0 As a result, we strongly encourage candidates to take either November or December tests if possible.   Early Decision I applicants who will not have scores on file by mid-November should email the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at admissions.ops@nyu.edu to change their application to either Early Decision II or Regular Decision, as we will likely not have enough time to thoughtfully consider your application materials and your testing if your scores arrive after mid-November.   Similarly, Early Decision II applicants who will not have scores on file by mid-January should only apply for Regular Decision admission, keeping in mind that the Common Application and NYU Supplement deadline for both Early Decision II and Regular Decision is January 1.                       2 Comments                Dear Mr. Abbott,   I am a student who applied to NYU for transfer. In the past, my academic performance was not good, but since last year I have worked very hard and got full GPA for two semesters, probably this semester as well. May I get a second chance? I mean whether the admission committee will pay more attention to my recent performance. Mistakes in the past cannot be changed, but I try to make each day count now. Can I have a second chance to go to a leading university?   Sincerely                             Gerrard Deng                   November 4, 2014                                                    Good Evening Mr. Abbott,   I am extremely interested in attending NYU. In your honest notion . My scores are not so great ;however , my GPA is very well . I am a wise and diligent person ; a student whose caliber exceeds those expectations -maybe too much . Will that be considered ! My purpose in this world is to make unjust just that will explain my need of becoming a HEROIC LAWYER . I believe your facility will be adequate towards that process. As the person stated above is it substantial . In hopes, of a anomalous being accelerated!   Your response is greatly appreciated !
