Film\u00a0 noir \u00a0expresses a despairing vision of the world borne of the brutality and absurdity that war forced humanity to face. The atmosphere of loss and isolation in this genre\u00a0 \u00a0has elicited a variety of readings, some emphasizing class and racial anxieties, and others the impact of suburbanization and changing gender roles. But this course also explores the relatinship between film\u00a0 noir, \u00a0and existentialist themes in literature and philosophy. Existentialism approaches enduring questions that philosophy, religion and literature have always sought to answer: Does fate, free will or chance dictate our lives? What is the proper response to atrocity and how do we assign blame or establish a moral order in the face of it? We will analyze the fallen world portrayed in\u00a0 noir \u00a0by tracing these questions in the philosophy and literature that precede and accompany the moment of classic\u00a0 noir \u00a0in the forties and fifties. We will read Sartre, Camus, Primo Levi, Eli Wiesel, Raymond Chandler, The Book of Job, genre theory, as well as specific film studies texts. Films will include Fritz Lang\u2019s\u00a0 Scarlet Street \u00a0, Howard Hawk\u2019s\u00a0 The Big sleep \u00a0, Billy Wilder\u2019s\u00a0 Double Indemnity \u00a0, Roman Polanski\u2019s\u00a0 Chinatown \u00a0, and Robert Altman\u2019s\u00a0 The Long Goodbye \u00a0.

Film\u00a0 noir \u00a0expresses a despairing vision of the world borne of the brutality and absurdity that war forced humanity to face. The atmosphere of loss and isolation in this genre\u00a0 \u00a0has elicited a variety of readings, some emphasizing class and racial anxieties, and others the impact of suburbanization and changing gender roles. But this course also explores the relatinship between film\u00a0 noir, \u00a0and existentialist themes in literature and philosophy. Existentialism approaches enduring questions that philosophy, religion and literature have always sought to answer: Does fate, free will or chance dictate our lives? What is the proper response to atrocity and how do we assign blame or establish a moral order in the face of it? We will analyze the fallen world portrayed in\u00a0 noir \u00a0by tracing these questions in the philosophy and literature that precede and accompany the moment of classic\u00a0 noir \u00a0in the forties and fifties. We will read Sartre, Camus, Primo Levi, Eli Wiesel, Raymond Chandler, The Book of Job, genre theory, as well as specific film studies texts. Films will include Fritz Lang\u2019s\u00a0 Scarlet Street \u00a0, Howard Hawk\u2019s\u00a0 The Big sleep \u00a0, Billy Wilder\u2019s\u00a0 Double Indemnity \u00a0, Roman Polanski\u2019s\u00a0 Chinatown \u00a0, and Robert Altman\u2019s\u00a0 The Long Goodbye \u00a0.
