                                                     The Silver School of Social Work provides a rich environment for the education of professional social workers\u2014offering undergraduate, master\u2019s, and doctoral degrees\u2014with a curriculum that reflects current knowledge from both research and practice. With a commitment to social justice, an emphasis on research, and a long history of excellent clinical training, the School provides a strong education for the next generation of social workers. A Silver School degree will go beyond the essentials of social work eduction\u2014it offers an extensive array of advanced and elective courses that deepens knowledge and training in one, or several, specialty areas. As part of NYU's Global Network University, the Silver School offers several global learning options to students in all degree programs. The School\u2019s BS and MSW programs are fully accredited by the Council on Social Work Education.     All MSW programs offered by the School are available on the main campus at Washington Square. In addition, we have two suburban campus sites\u2014in Rockland and Westchester Counties\u2014to make learning more accessible to MSW students living in the tri-state area. An MSW program at Shanghai and New York will start in fall 2015.
