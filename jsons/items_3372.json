Staged during the cultural revolution of the late 1960s and at the threshold of the 1968 AI-5\u2014the most violent period of Brazil's dictatorship\u2014it became a symbol for the counterculture movement. Oficina's theater house had been destroyed by a fire in 1966 and, looking for a play that would symbolize a new phase, the company decided that this avant-garde work by the Brazilian playwright provided them with the necessary elements to reflect the crisis of their cultural and historical moment. A fable about a candle maker and money lender under the pressure of loans to the North-American Imperialism, it depicts the underdeveloped condition of the country, targeted by an authoritarian mentality built upon superficialities. With strong and aggressive visual elements by H\u00e9lio Eichbauer and a song by Caetano Veloso, this production became a reference for several artists that formed the Tropicalia Movement, influencing music, cinema, visual arts, and literature.

Much of his art has been informed by the fact that his was adopted out (Native people were adopted out in alarming rates in the 1940's through the 1970's) and only met his Mohawk family later in life. Michelson frames this issue within the larger subject of Native displacement. Another theme of his work is the landscape, which the artist uses to challenge the notions of supremacy and superiority. One of the pieces Alan concentrates on, Two Row II, is a video installation which references the Two Row Wampum Belt that symbolizes the agreement under which the Iroquois/Haudenosaunee (the Six nations confederacy which Mohawk are a part of) welcomed the&#8230;          See more: AICH: Interviews                                                                                                                                                                                Interview with Alanis King (2008)           In November 2008, The Public Theater in New York City was proud to present a festival of extraordinary theater from today's Native artists.

In this interview, Taylor talks about his use of humor, the way he feels about using Native issues in his work, and they way his work is received in different communities. He also addresses writing from an Aboriginal perspective for a broader non-Native audience. By analyzing the use of Native humor in his pieces, he breaks down the universal language of his plays. Within the larger context of Aboriginal Theater, Drew looks at the development of his works as an offshoot of the work of people such as Thompson Highway and feels that he is able to go beyond the early works in this area that are primarily dark and depressing. Finally, Taylor rhapsodizes about the future of Native Theater and the translation of the classics such as Chekhov into Aboriginal settings.

Cooday also reminisces about the many prominent Native artists that have come through the AICH. This interview complements the Hemispheric Institute Digital Video Library project's American Indian Community House collection.

In this interview, Julieta Paredes underlines the centrality of a communal spirit in her work, stating that when she speaks, her voice is a resonance of the voice of her \u2018compa\u00f1eras.\u2019 She questions Western notions of what \u2018performance\u2019 is, claiming that the \u2018Pachamama\u2019 (Mother Earth) has taught her and her people a cultural performance or \u2018performance del pueblo.\u2019 She also points out that the use of the term \u2018performance\u2019 might tend to highlight an aesthetic or artistic practice, which can imply a depoliticization of the contents transmitted through actions. Paredes explains how she envisions indigenous people\u2019s communal work, working together from their bodies and sexualities, building what she calls \u2018communal feminism.\u2019 Thus, from the particularities of traditional indigenous communities, an active political participation in the public sphere can be set in motion.&#8230;          See more: Mujeres Creando Comunidad: Interviews                                                                                                                                                                                Interview with Jesusa Rodr\u00edguez (2004)           Mexican director, actress, playwright, performance artist, scenographer, entrepreneur, and social activist Jesusa Rodr\u00edguez moves seemingly effortlessly and with vigor across the spectrum of cultural forms, styles, and tones. Her 'espect\u00e1culos' (as both spectacles and shows) challenge traditional classification, crossing with ease generic boundaries: from elite to popular to mass, from Greek tragedy to cabaret, from pre-Columbian indigenous to opera, from revue, sketch and 'carpa,' to performative acts within political projects. Humor, satire, linguistic play, and the body are constants in her productions. Rodriguez's energy is intense and her commitment non-negotiable, always interrogating the nature, site, and consequences of power and its representation. In this interview the artist comments on her particular use and transformation of the genre of 'pastorela' (Nativity play) in her cabaret performances, as a tool for contesting political and religious fundamentalism in the Americas.

In this interview, Jesusa Rodr\u00edguez talks about the relationship between her experience in theater and cabaret, and her political commitment as an activist. She considers that cabaret provides improvisation as a training tool to exercise negotiation and risk. Also, the immediate response of the audience transforms the artist into a medium that conveys what the public feels and thinks; in this sense, cabaret is a space both to become aware of the current political situation and to foresee what could be upcoming, which engenders a more participative audience. Jesusa Rodr\u00edguez and her Resistencia Creativa movement organized a massive \u2018plant\u00f3n\u2019 (sit-in) in Mexico City\u2019s Z\u00f3calo (main square) to protest against the controversial results of the Presidential Elections in 2006.

In this interview, Jesusa Rodr\u00edguez talks about Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz and her poem \u2018Primero Sue\u00f1o\u2019 (\u2018First Dream\u2019), a baroque work of art that condenses the genius of the 17th-century Mexican nun. She is linked through memory, history, and feminist statements with her contemporary counterpart, Jesusa Rodr\u00edguez, who memorized the almost 1,000 verses of the poem as a part of a creative process that allowed her not only to develop a profound interpretation of its contents, but also a fully bodily internalization experience. This intense relationship with the poem helped her to survive in the everyday world, to strengthen her political struggle, and to fight oblivion. For Jesusa Rodr\u00edguez, Sor Juana\u2019s poetry is both a-temporal and contemporary, and a source of inspiration and wisdom to keep working on acts of&#8230;          See more: Jesusa Rodriguez: Interviews                                                                                                                                                                                Interview with Jill Lane: What is Performance Studies?
