You may then forward the permission email to marc.leblanc@nyu.edu to get the registration access code.    All classes are held in the 2nd floor seminar room unless indicated otherwise.  Fall 2015 Seminars    ISAW-GA 3002-001 Observation and Experiment in Ancient Physical Science Alexander Jones alexander.jones@nyu.edu Wednesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    This seminar explores the empirical elements in ancient scientific traditions that aimed at systematic description, explanation, or prediction of physical phenomena. Scientific practices of the Ancient Near East and the Greco-Roman world will figure prominently, but those of other civilizations may be investigated according to the interests and competences of participants. The evidence is largely textual; knowledge of at least one ancient language in which relevant scientific texts exist is required. Participants will choose topics, select study materials, and guide discussion for at least one session.    An initial selection of topics will include the following: the rise of systematic observation of spontaneously occurring phenomena in the context of interpretation of the phenomena as ominous signs; practices of recording and transmitting observations of astral, meteorological, and mundane events; precision, accuracy, and instruments of measurement, especially in astronomical observation records; experiment and experimental apparatus in Greek harmonic theory; empirical claims within deductive scientific texts, e.g. in optics, mechanics, and astronomy; empirical argument in Ptolemy's Optics; adjustment and fabrication of reported observations and measurements.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3007-001 Greco-Arabic Translation Movement Robert Hoyland rgh2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    This course will explore the different paths along which knowledge of Antiquity passed into Muslim intellectual culture and how it was received and interpreted.\u00a0 The focus will not just be on the so-called \u2018translation movement\u2019, but also the broader question of how pre-Islamic histories and cultures fared in the Middle East after the Arab conquests.\u00a0 We will principally look at\u00a0Greek texts translated into Arabic, which receive the most scholarly attention, because they are regarded as crucial to understanding how classical learning was conveyed to Europe and because classicists are always hoping to find lost Greek works preserved in Arabic. However, we will also give consideration to\u00a0translation from Middle Persian and Sanskrit, which may well have been substantial, though the question has been too little studied to be sure.    \u00a0 Assessment will be via a final paper which should draw upon study of original Arabic texts (or a text) and should have a research dimension to it (i.e. not be just a survey of what is known).    Permission of the instructor and knowledge of Arabic are required, and some familiarity with Greek would be an advantage.    ISAW-GA 3010-001 The Manuscripts of Early Chinese Natural Philosophy Ethan Harkness harkness@nyu.edu Fridays, 2:00-5:00pm    This course will introduce students to a variety of recently excavated Chinese technical manuscripts dating from the late Warring States, Qin, and Western Han periods (4th \u2013 1st centuries BCE).\u00a0 We will pay particular attention to the various calendrically-based divination texts promulgated in the manuscripts known as rishu (\u201cdaybooks\u201d), but the fields of astronomy, geography, medicine, and mathematics will all receive due consideration.\u00a0 When appropriate, reference will be made to connections with transmitted texts and to the later repercussions of ideas developed and refined in the years immediately surrounding the formation of the Chinese empire.\u00a0 Topics to consider will include the social function of the early technical texts; the nature of their transmission and evolution; regional idiosyncrasies; the interconnected roles of scribes and readers; and the possible function of both political ideology and private interests in shaping the texts.    Prerequisites are good reading knowledge of modern and classical Chinese and permission of the instructor.    ISAW-GA 3010-002 Advanced Study in Chinese Art &amp; Archaeology Lillian Tseng lillian.tseng@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    This course is intended to provide intensive analyses of primary sources and related scholarship in Chinese art &amp; archaeology for graduate students who have sufficient knowledge of the field. Topics to study depend on the research need of the students.    Ability to read Classical Chinese and permission of the instructor are required.    ISAW-GA 3012-001 Archaeology and Historiography: Perspectives on Time, Space, Text and Material Roderick Campbell rbc2@nyu.edu Thursdays, 2:00-5:00pm    Though treated as separate disciplines and usually housed in different departments, at the highest level history and archaeology share the common goal of understanding the human past. Nevertheless, in both theory and method, not only are archaeology and history internally diverse, but also frequently miles apart. This seminar will embark on an interdisciplinary exploration of the historical sciences: their histories, philosophies and methodologies. Special focus will be on theories of time (change, tradition, process, event, etc.), space (physical space, place, landscape, etc.), text (context, genre, discourse, memory, etc.) and material (material culture, materiality, things, actor-networks, etc.)    The reading load in this course will be heavy. Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3013-001 Production, Accumulation, Trade, and Value: Political Economy in the Ancient Mediterranean Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso and Elizabeth Murphy lda5@nyu.edu ; elizabeth.murphy@nyu.edu Mondays, 2:00-5:00pm    During the last decades, renewed attention has been devoted to the importance of market and private enterprise in the economies of the ancient Mediterranean, as exemplified by such works as A history of market performance: from ancient Babylonia to the modern world (van der Spek et al., eds., 2015), Commerce and colonization in the ancient Near East (Aubet, 2013), and The Roman market economy (Temin, 2013). On the one hand, interest in market and private enterprise enables us to traverse artificial distinctions between pre-classical and classical ancient Mediterranean civilizations and to pose cross-culturally comparative questions about ancient state economies. On the other hand, this new trend in some respects pays less attention to institutional and political impacts on ancient economies. This impact has perhaps received too much attention in the historiography of ancient western Asia, but the meaning of political intervention in the economic process acquires a different meaning when embedded in a context of private enterprises. For the Roman world, the interests of imperial institutions (e.g., military supply chains, annona redistributions, imperial monopolies) as influencing the scale and organization of economic activities has been long recognized, but recent approaches have turned to the more subtle and indirect ways that institutions affected regional economic development. In response to these academic trends, this course aims to examine the role of political economy in the ancient Mediterranean from multiple vantages.\u00a0 The first classes will focus on recent theoretical works on political economy such as Piketty\u2019s Capital , and North\u2019s Institutions, Institutional Change, and Economic Performance , as well as some of the \u2018classic\u2019 works on ancient economies, such as those by Polanyi, Finley, and Rostovtzeff. In the following classes, ideas developed through the theory classes will then be confronted with specific case studies from the protohistory of ancient western Asia and the Greco-Roman world. These thematic classes will consider issues of primary production, storage and hoarding (accumulation of surpluses and wealth), trade, and the definition of value.\u00a0    Permission of the instructors is required.    Fall 2015 Tutorials    ISAW-GA 3014-001 Texts from the Libraries of the Kingdom of Eshnunna Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm Large Conference Room, 6th Floor\u00a0    Various cities of the kingdom of Eshnunna have yielded literary texts, among them the city of Eshnunna, which seems to have housed a center for scribal training already during the Old Akkadian period, where a forerunner to The Great Revolt Against Naram-Sin has come to light; the city of Tell Harmal, ancient Shaduppum, where the only copy of Sargon in Foreign Lands has been found; and the city of Tell Haddad, ancient Meturan, which yielded a remarkable collection of tablets from a private house owned by an exorcist. In addition to Akkadian archival texts found in separate rooms, there has come to light from two areas a library containing a fragment of the Laws of Eshnunna as well as numerous lexical, liturgical, literary and magic texts (incantations), two prayers to the sun god, and the earliest attested bilingual forerunner to the hemerological series Inbu bel arhi . Among the literary texts, perhaps the most unexpected discovery is a copy of the Sumerian version of the story of Adapa and two larger fragments of the Death of  Gilgamesh . Other Gilgamesh stories represented at Meturan are Gilgamesh and the Bull of An , Gilgamesh and Huwawa , and Gilgamesh, EnkIdu and the Netherworld .    The goal of this seminar is to examine Eshnunna\u2019s role in the transmission of scholarly knowledge through an in-depth analysis of the written compositions extant from the major cities of the kingdom.    Permission of the instructor and knowledge of Akkadian and Sumerian are required.    ISAW-GA 3014-002 Advanced Akkadian: Old Babylonian Historical Texts Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Thursdays, 11:00am-1:00pm Small Conference Room, 6th Floor\u00a0    This advanced course in Akkadian will emphasize the reading of Old Babylonian texts from the sites of Mari and Eshnunna in order to investigate the rise to power and political relations of these two kingdoms during the Old Babylonian period. Primary texts read will include the treaty concluded between between Zimri-lim of Mari and Ibal-pi-el II of Eshnunna and a lengthy letter from Ibal-pi-el II to Zimri-lim offering a political alliance.\u00a0 These two texts offer insight into the form and structure as well as the terminology of international treaties during the first half of the second millennium BCE. Additional readings will include not only other historical inscriptions of the kings of Mari and of Eshnunna but also, for the purposes of comparison and contrast, inscriptions of the kings of Larsa.    Students will acquire an in-depth understanding of the variety and scope of historical and particularly royal inscriptions in the time of the competing territorial states of the Old Babylonian period.    Permission of the instructor and Intermediate Akkadian are required.    Fall 2015 Other Courses    ISAW-GA 1000-001 Intro to Ancient Egyptian I Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD    This course, in the first part of a full year course over two semesters, introduces students to the Middle Egyptian (Classical) dialect of the Ancient Egyptian language in its hieroglyphic form. The classes are structured primarily according to the lessons in J.P. Allen, Middle Egyptian. An Introduction to the Language and Culture of the Hieroglyphs . The course will usually proceed at the rate of one chapter per week, but occasionally a chapter may be skipped or two chapters will be combined. The goal of the first semester is to reach the treatment of the Egyptian verb and the infinitive in Allen\u2019s 13th and 14th chapters. The lessons will be supplemented with readings from A.H. Gardiner, Egyptian Grammar , 3rd. edition, M. Collier and B. Manley, How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs , revised edition, and occasional excerpts from Egyptian funerary stelae.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 1002-001 Advanced Ancient Egyptian I Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD    This course is based on readings from actual Egyptian hieroglyphic texts in their original form. In the early stages of the course, the readings will be presented in both a \u201cnormalized\u201d form with the individual sentences and clauses demarked as well as in the original, continuous text format. The readings will be drawn from a wide range of genres and will increase in difficulty as the course progresses. Where appropriate, photographs and line drawings will be used so that students will learn to handle hieroglyphic text as it actually appears on Egyptian objects. The readings are drawn from a text book in progress.    Permission of the instructor is required.    Spring 2016 Seminars    ISAW-GA 3007-001 Roman Law and the Papyri Roger Bagnall roger.bagnall@nyu.edu Thursdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    Ever since the first legal documents on papyrus dating to the Roman imperial period were published in the nineteenth century, it has been evident to jurists that the papyri offered a unique opportunity to look in depth at how the majestic and complex structure of Roman law that we know from the classical jurists (largely excerpted in Justinian\u2019s Digest) worked on the ground in the provinces. A sizable literature on the subject developed in the early twentieth centuy and has continued to evolve. This seminar will take a series of key issues and institutions, including marriage, the legal status of women, slavery, testation, and major contract types. For each we will examine both selections from the jurists and some representative papyrus documents.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3010-001 Shang Civilization: Text and Material Culture Roderick Campbell rbc2@nyu.edu Fridays, 2:00-5:00pm    This seminar will focus on the Shang dynasty of ancient China from the perspective of archaeology, epigraphy and transmitted texts. The archaeology will cover north China in the 2nd millennium BCE, but focus on the site of Anyang where inscribed oracle-bones and bronzes, monumental tombs and palatial buildings were discovered in the early 20th century demonstrating the historicity of the Shang dynasty. The oracle-bones and bronze inscriptions of the Anyang period will present an opportunity to glimpse a partial image of Shang royal and high elite concerns, especially concerning ritual. A study of Shang history from the perspective of transmitted texts will give both an opportunity to understand the place of the Shang dynasty in later Chinese history as well as its formation as historical subject. This course will be taught at several levels and students of non-sinological background are welcome. While the ability to read classical and modern Chinese would be an asset, neither language is a requirement for this seminar.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3012-001 Beyond China and Byzantium Robert Hoyland and S\u00f6ren Stark rgh2@nyu.edu ; \u00a0 soeren.stark@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    Permission of the instructors is required.    ISAW-GA 3014-001 Cultural Memory and the Libraries in Mesopotamia Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3023-001 Special Topics in Digital Humanities for the Ancient World: Computational Photography and 3D Modeling Sebastian Heath sh1933@nyu.edu Wednesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    The premise of this course is that virtual representations of the ancient world will become increasingly important to both research and teaching as the ability to create, work with, and share such digital resources becomes less expensive and more widely available. Accordingly, the course will combine hands-on experience with creating and using virtual representations of ancient material culture, including objects and architectural spaces, with a review of current practices being employed by projects around the world. Students will use such tools as the open-source 3d-suite Blender, the game engine Unity, and applications for making models with smartphone cameras. We will explore techniques for making richly-textured 3d models of real objects as well as create immersive virtual environments. Readings will include reports of ongoing work as well as discussions of why 3D matters and how it is being used in the classroom. Guest speakers from academia and industry will provide a broad perspective on current trends. Students will use their own computers and should be willing to apply themselves to learning the digital skills the class introduces.    Permission of the instructor is required.    Spring 2016 Tutorials    ISAW-GA 3014-002 Advanced Akkadian: Neo-Babylonian Historical Inscriptions Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Thursdays, 11:00am-1:00pm Small Conference Room, 6th Floor\u00a0    The Advanced Reading of Akkadian Class of Neo-Babylonian Inscriptions is designed to introduce into the Neo-Babylonian dialect and to familiarize the student with its particular paleography and grammar. Simultaneously, a diachronic choice of Neo-Babylonian inscriptions reaching from Nabupolassar, its founder, to Nabonidus will provide an insight into the history of the Neo-Babylonian empire.    Permission of the instructor and knowledge of Akkadian are required.    Spring 2016 Other Courses    ISAW-GA 1001-001 Intro to Ancient Egyptian II Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD  This course is a continuation of the first semester. The course will proceed at the rate of a chapter per week through J.P. Allen, Middle Egyptian. An Introduction to the Language and Culture of the Hieroglyphs . From time to time, passages from actual Egyptian texts will supplement the examples in Allen\u2019s grammar. Depending on the progress of the class, the last weeks of the course will cover the hieroglyphic transcription of The Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor , an actual Egyptian literary tale.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 1003-001 Advanced Ancient Egyptian II Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD    This is a continuation of the fall semester course, using additional sources of increasing difficulty. Depending on the progress of the class, there will be occasional readings from hieratic primarily based on sources that the students have already read in hieroglyphic transcription during this course and the previous semester.

You may then forward the permission email to marc.leblanc@nyu.edu to get the registration access code.    All classes are held in the 2nd floor seminar room unless indicated otherwise.  Fall 2015 Seminars    ISAW-GA 3002-001 Observation and Experiment in Ancient Physical Science Alexander Jones alexander.jones@nyu.edu Wednesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    This seminar explores the empirical elements in ancient scientific traditions that aimed at systematic description, explanation, or prediction of physical phenomena. Scientific practices of the Ancient Near East and the Greco-Roman world will figure prominently, but those of other civilizations may be investigated according to the interests and competences of participants. The evidence is largely textual; knowledge of at least one ancient language in which relevant scientific texts exist is required. Participants will choose topics, select study materials, and guide discussion for at least one session.    An initial selection of topics will include the following: the rise of systematic observation of spontaneously occurring phenomena in the context of interpretation of the phenomena as ominous signs; practices of recording and transmitting observations of astral, meteorological, and mundane events; precision, accuracy, and instruments of measurement, especially in astronomical observation records; experiment and experimental apparatus in Greek harmonic theory; empirical claims within deductive scientific texts, e.g. in optics, mechanics, and astronomy; empirical argument in Ptolemy's Optics; adjustment and fabrication of reported observations and measurements.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3007-001 Greco-Arabic Translation Movement Robert Hoyland rgh2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    This course will explore the different paths along which knowledge of Antiquity passed into Muslim intellectual culture and how it was received and interpreted.\u00a0 The focus will not just be on the so-called \u2018translation movement\u2019, but also the broader question of how pre-Islamic histories and cultures fared in the Middle East after the Arab conquests.\u00a0 We will principally look at\u00a0Greek texts translated into Arabic, which receive the most scholarly attention, because they are regarded as crucial to understanding how classical learning was conveyed to Europe and because classicists are always hoping to find lost Greek works preserved in Arabic. However, we will also give consideration to\u00a0translation from Middle Persian and Sanskrit, which may well have been substantial, though the question has been too little studied to be sure.    \u00a0 Assessment will be via a final paper which should draw upon study of original Arabic texts (or a text) and should have a research dimension to it (i.e. not be just a survey of what is known).    Permission of the instructor and knowledge of Arabic are required, and some familiarity with Greek would be an advantage.    ISAW-GA 3010-001 The Manuscripts of Early Chinese Natural Philosophy Ethan Harkness harkness@nyu.edu Fridays, 2:00-5:00pm    This course will introduce students to a variety of recently excavated Chinese technical manuscripts dating from the late Warring States, Qin, and Western Han periods (4th \u2013 1st centuries BCE).\u00a0 We will pay particular attention to the various calendrically-based divination texts promulgated in the manuscripts known as rishu (\u201cdaybooks\u201d), but the fields of astronomy, geography, medicine, and mathematics will all receive due consideration.\u00a0 When appropriate, reference will be made to connections with transmitted texts and to the later repercussions of ideas developed and refined in the years immediately surrounding the formation of the Chinese empire.\u00a0 Topics to consider will include the social function of the early technical texts; the nature of their transmission and evolution; regional idiosyncrasies; the interconnected roles of scribes and readers; and the possible function of both political ideology and private interests in shaping the texts.    Prerequisites are good reading knowledge of modern and classical Chinese and permission of the instructor.    ISAW-GA 3010-002 Advanced Study in Chinese Art &amp; Archaeology Lillian Tseng lillian.tseng@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    This course is intended to provide intensive analyses of primary sources and related scholarship in Chinese art &amp; archaeology for graduate students who have sufficient knowledge of the field. Topics to study depend on the research need of the students.    Ability to read Classical Chinese and permission of the instructor are required.    ISAW-GA 3012-001 Archaeology and Historiography: Perspectives on Time, Space, Text and Material Roderick Campbell rbc2@nyu.edu Thursdays, 2:00-5:00pm    Though treated as separate disciplines and usually housed in different departments, at the highest level history and archaeology share the common goal of understanding the human past. Nevertheless, in both theory and method, not only are archaeology and history internally diverse, but also frequently miles apart. This seminar will embark on an interdisciplinary exploration of the historical sciences: their histories, philosophies and methodologies. Special focus will be on theories of time (change, tradition, process, event, etc.), space (physical space, place, landscape, etc.), text (context, genre, discourse, memory, etc.) and material (material culture, materiality, things, actor-networks, etc.)    The reading load in this course will be heavy. Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3013-001 Production, Accumulation, Trade, and Value: Political Economy in the Ancient Mediterranean Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso and Elizabeth Murphy lda5@nyu.edu ; elizabeth.murphy@nyu.edu Mondays, 2:00-5:00pm    During the last decades, renewed attention has been devoted to the importance of market and private enterprise in the economies of the ancient Mediterranean, as exemplified by such works as A history of market performance: from ancient Babylonia to the modern world (van der Spek et al., eds., 2015), Commerce and colonization in the ancient Near East (Aubet, 2013), and The Roman market economy (Temin, 2013). On the one hand, interest in market and private enterprise enables us to traverse artificial distinctions between pre-classical and classical ancient Mediterranean civilizations and to pose cross-culturally comparative questions about ancient state economies. On the other hand, this new trend in some respects pays less attention to institutional and political impacts on ancient economies. This impact has perhaps received too much attention in the historiography of ancient western Asia, but the meaning of political intervention in the economic process acquires a different meaning when embedded in a context of private enterprises. For the Roman world, the interests of imperial institutions (e.g., military supply chains, annona redistributions, imperial monopolies) as influencing the scale and organization of economic activities has been long recognized, but recent approaches have turned to the more subtle and indirect ways that institutions affected regional economic development. In response to these academic trends, this course aims to examine the role of political economy in the ancient Mediterranean from multiple vantages.\u00a0 The first classes will focus on recent theoretical works on political economy such as Piketty\u2019s Capital , and North\u2019s Institutions, Institutional Change, and Economic Performance , as well as some of the \u2018classic\u2019 works on ancient economies, such as those by Polanyi, Finley, and Rostovtzeff. In the following classes, ideas developed through the theory classes will then be confronted with specific case studies from the protohistory of ancient western Asia and the Greco-Roman world. These thematic classes will consider issues of primary production, storage and hoarding (accumulation of surpluses and wealth), trade, and the definition of value.\u00a0    Permission of the instructors is required.    Fall 2015 Tutorials    ISAW-GA 3014-001 Texts from the Libraries of the Kingdom of Eshnunna Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm Large Conference Room, 6th Floor\u00a0    Various cities of the kingdom of Eshnunna have yielded literary texts, among them the city of Eshnunna, which seems to have housed a center for scribal training already during the Old Akkadian period, where a forerunner to The Great Revolt Against Naram-Sin has come to light; the city of Tell Harmal, ancient Shaduppum, where the only copy of Sargon in Foreign Lands has been found; and the city of Tell Haddad, ancient Meturan, which yielded a remarkable collection of tablets from a private house owned by an exorcist. In addition to Akkadian archival texts found in separate rooms, there has come to light from two areas a library containing a fragment of the Laws of Eshnunna as well as numerous lexical, liturgical, literary and magic texts (incantations), two prayers to the sun god, and the earliest attested bilingual forerunner to the hemerological series Inbu bel arhi . Among the literary texts, perhaps the most unexpected discovery is a copy of the Sumerian version of the story of Adapa and two larger fragments of the Death of  Gilgamesh . Other Gilgamesh stories represented at Meturan are Gilgamesh and the Bull of An , Gilgamesh and Huwawa , and Gilgamesh, EnkIdu and the Netherworld .    The goal of this seminar is to examine Eshnunna\u2019s role in the transmission of scholarly knowledge through an in-depth analysis of the written compositions extant from the major cities of the kingdom.    Permission of the instructor and knowledge of Akkadian and Sumerian are required.    ISAW-GA 3014-002 Advanced Akkadian: Old Babylonian Historical Texts Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Thursdays, 11:00am-1:00pm Small Conference Room, 6th Floor\u00a0    This advanced course in Akkadian will emphasize the reading of Old Babylonian texts from the sites of Mari and Eshnunna in order to investigate the rise to power and political relations of these two kingdoms during the Old Babylonian period. Primary texts read will include the treaty concluded between between Zimri-lim of Mari and Ibal-pi-el II of Eshnunna and a lengthy letter from Ibal-pi-el II to Zimri-lim offering a political alliance.\u00a0 These two texts offer insight into the form and structure as well as the terminology of international treaties during the first half of the second millennium BCE. Additional readings will include not only other historical inscriptions of the kings of Mari and of Eshnunna but also, for the purposes of comparison and contrast, inscriptions of the kings of Larsa.    Students will acquire an in-depth understanding of the variety and scope of historical and particularly royal inscriptions in the time of the competing territorial states of the Old Babylonian period.    Permission of the instructor and Intermediate Akkadian are required.    Fall 2015 Other Courses    ISAW-GA 1000-001 Intro to Ancient Egyptian I Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD    This course, in the first part of a full year course over two semesters, introduces students to the Middle Egyptian (Classical) dialect of the Ancient Egyptian language in its hieroglyphic form. The classes are structured primarily according to the lessons in J.P. Allen, Middle Egyptian. An Introduction to the Language and Culture of the Hieroglyphs . The course will usually proceed at the rate of one chapter per week, but occasionally a chapter may be skipped or two chapters will be combined. The goal of the first semester is to reach the treatment of the Egyptian verb and the infinitive in Allen\u2019s 13th and 14th chapters. The lessons will be supplemented with readings from A.H. Gardiner, Egyptian Grammar , 3rd. edition, M. Collier and B. Manley, How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs , revised edition, and occasional excerpts from Egyptian funerary stelae.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 1002-001 Advanced Ancient Egyptian I Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD    This course is based on readings from actual Egyptian hieroglyphic texts in their original form. In the early stages of the course, the readings will be presented in both a \u201cnormalized\u201d form with the individual sentences and clauses demarked as well as in the original, continuous text format. The readings will be drawn from a wide range of genres and will increase in difficulty as the course progresses. Where appropriate, photographs and line drawings will be used so that students will learn to handle hieroglyphic text as it actually appears on Egyptian objects. The readings are drawn from a text book in progress.    Permission of the instructor is required.    Spring 2016 Seminars    ISAW-GA 3007-001 Roman Law and the Papyri Roger Bagnall roger.bagnall@nyu.edu Thursdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    Ever since the first legal documents on papyrus dating to the Roman imperial period were published in the nineteenth century, it has been evident to jurists that the papyri offered a unique opportunity to look in depth at how the majestic and complex structure of Roman law that we know from the classical jurists (largely excerpted in Justinian\u2019s Digest) worked on the ground in the provinces. A sizable literature on the subject developed in the early twentieth centuy and has continued to evolve. This seminar will take a series of key issues and institutions, including marriage, the legal status of women, slavery, testation, and major contract types. For each we will examine both selections from the jurists and some representative papyrus documents.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3010-001 Shang Civilization: Text and Material Culture Roderick Campbell rbc2@nyu.edu Fridays, 2:00-5:00pm    This seminar will focus on the Shang dynasty of ancient China from the perspective of archaeology, epigraphy and transmitted texts. The archaeology will cover north China in the 2nd millennium BCE, but focus on the site of Anyang where inscribed oracle-bones and bronzes, monumental tombs and palatial buildings were discovered in the early 20th century demonstrating the historicity of the Shang dynasty. The oracle-bones and bronze inscriptions of the Anyang period will present an opportunity to glimpse a partial image of Shang royal and high elite concerns, especially concerning ritual. A study of Shang history from the perspective of transmitted texts will give both an opportunity to understand the place of the Shang dynasty in later Chinese history as well as its formation as historical subject. This course will be taught at several levels and students of non-sinological background are welcome. While the ability to read classical and modern Chinese would be an asset, neither language is a requirement for this seminar.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3012-001 Beyond China and Byzantium Robert Hoyland and S\u00f6ren Stark rgh2@nyu.edu ; \u00a0 soeren.stark@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    Permission of the instructors is required.    ISAW-GA 3014-001 Cultural Memory and the Libraries in Mesopotamia Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3023-001 Special Topics in Digital Humanities for the Ancient World: Computational Photography and 3D Modeling Sebastian Heath sh1933@nyu.edu Wednesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    The premise of this course is that virtual representations of the ancient world will become increasingly important to both research and teaching as the ability to create, work with, and share such digital resources becomes less expensive and more widely available. Accordingly, the course will combine hands-on experience with creating and using virtual representations of ancient material culture, including objects and architectural spaces, with a review of current practices being employed by projects around the world. Students will use such tools as the open-source 3d-suite Blender, the game engine Unity, and applications for making models with smartphone cameras. We will explore techniques for making richly-textured 3d models of real objects as well as create immersive virtual environments. Readings will include reports of ongoing work as well as discussions of why 3D matters and how it is being used in the classroom.

Infrastructure that has become \u201csecond  nature\u201d brings water and electricity to the city and carries its  waste to distant landfills. The park lands that dot the city have  become both playgrounds where New Yorkers seek green space and  battlefields where they fight over the proper ways to enjoy those  spaces.

Colloquium: Pirates and Buccaneers: Seaborne Terrorism in the Early Modern World HIST-UA 369 Offered every year. 4 points. This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.      Seminar: Topics in  Medieval History   HIST-UA 441   Bedos-Rezak, Griffiths. 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.      Seminar: Topics in  European Intellectual History   HIST-UA 443   Geroulanos, Shovlin. 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.      Seminar: Britain since  World War II   HIST-UA 451 Open to  history majors who have completed Historical Studies: Theories and  Practice (HIST-UA 101), or by permission of the instructor. Ortolano.  4 points.   Assists students in  writing archivally-based research papers about a single topic in  recent British history. Since the end of the Second World War,  Britain has faced many of the challenges typical of Western  societies, as well as more particular obstacles resulting from its  status as a recent imperial power. British history since 1945 has  thus been characterized by the creation of the welfare state, the end  of the British Empire, immigration and racial conflict, \u201cSwinging  London\u201d and 1960s second-wave feminism, labor unrest and the  decline of heavy industry, neo-liberal economics, and Tony Blair\u2019s  New Labour. We spend the first part of the seminar becoming  acquainted with these developments, while also identifying specific  topics for students to explore through primary-source-based papers of  about 20 pages.      United States History Seminar: Topics in U.S.  History      HIST-UA 413 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.    Colloquium: The Place of Regions in U.S. History HIST-UA 414 Offered every year. 4 points. In this research seminar, students will explore how the concept of region and the meanings of regional differences have changed throughout U.S. history. Course readings will move between regions and through time as we explore themes including environment, geography, economics, politics, and culture. While class discussions will focus on a series of secondary readings, students are encouraged to draw on a wide range of materials, ranging from music, films, and physical objects to political reports and historical monographs, in writing a research paper that will explore some aspect of regional history in the United States.    Seminar: Capital and Labor and the Making of Modern America   HIST-UA 416 Offered  every other year. Montoya. 4 points.   This course has two  purposes. The first is to learn the fundamentals of historical  research. By completing assignments that teach them how to conduct  archival research and engage in historical analysis, students come to  understand how historians engage in their craft, how they construct  historical narratives, and how they ensure their accuracy. The course  culminates in a 15- to 20-page research paper. The second purpose of  this course is to learn about U.S. labor history, which includes not  only the study of the workplace but also how families interacted and  reacted to labor conditions as they lived their domestic lives.      Seminar: Writing  American History   HIST-UA 417 Offered  every year. Bender. 4 points.   Explores the history of  history writing in the United States, examining national histories  written in the 19th and 20th centuries as part of American  intellectual history. Focuses on theme, interpretation, points of  view, and style in the work of past historians.    Liberalism and Conservatism since the New Deal HIST-UA 418 Offered every year. 4 points. This seminar investigates the historical development of the key ideologies of postwar American politics and their differing engagements with the central historical developments of that time period: the Cold War, civil rights movement, metropolitan development, feminism, environmentalism, and fiscal and monetary policy. It will investigate how liberalism and conservatism reshaped American society and politics at the various scales of American governance: grass-roots, state, regional, and national. As a research seminar, students will be expected to complete a piece of original research, on a topic of their choosing, over the course of the semester.    Seminar: Unbordered and Bordered Lands: North American Borderlands History HIST-UA 663 Offered every other year. 4 points. In this reading seminar, students will explore the major themes and historiographical approaches to the study of North American borderlands history. A rapidly expanding and vibrant field, borderlands history focuses on the interactions of peoples, nations, and empires across the boundaries of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, this course will explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. In the second half of the class, we will turn to the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explore how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations.      Seminar: Reading and  Writing Experimental History   HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4  points.   Investigates and  evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries  of writing history. Focuses on the relationship between historical  evidence and the writing of history in new ways; relation between  scholar and subject; connections between history and speculation; use  of unconventional voices; re-creation of past worlds and lives; and  connections between history and storytelling.      Seminar: Constructions  of Race in U.S. History   HIST-UA 680 Hodes. 4  points.   Explores the ideas of  race and how racial classifications have changed over time and across  regions and cultures in the United States. Themes include language,  color, law, science, slavery, mixed ancestries, and white identity.      Seminar: Race, Civil  War, Reconstruction   HIST-UA 683 Hodes. 4  points.   The American Civil War  punctuated the 19th century and transformed the nation. This seminar  explores the experiences of slaves and former slaves, politicians and  community leaders, civilians and families, soldiers and veterans, and  proceeds from the premise that slavery and race were central to the  war\u2019s causes and consequences.      Seminar: Ideology and  Social Change in American History   HIST-UA 684 Offered  every other year. 4 points.   Explores classical  arguments in American history concerning social behavior. Central  themes: the power of cultural conditioning, the role of schooling and  other acculturating institutions, the uses of \u201cuplifting\u201d reform  and organizational benevolence, and the intervention of professional  experts into social policymaking. Special attention to the role of  ethnic and racial leaders, proponents of success and socialization,  critical investigations of family and femininity, and analysis of  distinctive generational responses to these and related issues.      Seminar: The New Deal   HIST-UA 686 Offered  every year. Katz. 4 points.   Explores the historical  issues of the Great Depression and the New Deal years, 1933\u20131941,  by discussing several relevant works on this period. Students choose  a research project, which they report on both orally and in a seminar  paper. Colloquium: Twentieth Century U.S. History in Film HIST-UA 694 Offered every other spring. 4 points. The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema. In terms of documentaries, we will view newsreels, government-produced films, historical documentaries, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and \u201cdocu-ganda.\u201d We will not necessarily focus upon whether filmic representations are historically accurate in fine detail. Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.     History of Asia, Africa, and Latin America      Seminar: Capitalism in  South Asia   HIST-UA 327 Offered  every year. Sartori. 4 points.   Is capitalism a set of  global arrangements superimposed on a set of local cultures, a  long-term tendency of South Asian societies, or something that has  entered into the very structure of modern South Asian society? This  course explores a series of topics including the Indian Ocean trading  world; \u201cproto-industrialization\u201d in pre-colonial India; the East  India Company; deindustrialization, peasantization, and  traditionalization; continuity and transformation in peasant society;  developmentalist theories and pro-industrialization policies;  nationalism, decolonization, and political economy; and  neo-liberalism.      Seminar: Topics in  Latin American History   HIST-UA 471 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.      Seminar: Topics in  Japanese History   HIST-UA 474 Offered  every other year.

Examines 20th-century  Taiwan and China in their interrelationship and their divergent  paths. It is not a diplomatic or international history course.  Rather, it takes up crucial issues in the history of each polity and  society, focusing primarily on Taiwan, thus allowing students to gain  an understanding of the complexities of Taiwanese history and society  and of this contested region of the world. The reading and writing  load are heavy, and students are expected to participate in class.  Some background in China\u2019s or Taiwan\u2019s history is desirable and  presumed.      Seminar: Topics in  Eurasian History   HIST-UA 533 Offered  every year. 4 points.   Focuses on major  historical issues and problems in the history of Eurasia, which is  the largest landmass in the world but is rarely treated as a region  or unit of historical analysis. Responds to recent shifts in the  field of history that emphasize frameworks larger than the  \u201cnation-state\u201d for historical research and analysis. Possible  topics: The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy; Early Modern Empires:  China, Russia, and the Ottomans; Scientific and Technological  Exchanges, 1225\u20132000; Eurasian Militaries; and Nomads and Nomadism  in Eurasia.    Colloquium : Gender and  Radicalism in Modern China   HIST-UA 536 Identical  to EAST-UA 536. Offered every year. Karl. 4 points.   Examines the  interrelated rise of political, ideological, and cultural radicalisms  and of gender issues as a major subject and object of transformative  social activity in 19th- and 20th-century China. Introduces  approaches to gender theory and historical analysis through the use  of primary and secondary sources on China, as well as through films  and other visuals. Emphasis is on synthesizing contradictory material  and on historical analytical issues. Includes a heavy writing and  class-discussion component.

The period covered extends from  the New Kingdom in Egypt (1550 B.C.E.) to the forest kingdoms of West  Africa on the eve of the Atlantic slave trade in the mid-15th  century.      Seminar: Japan and  World War II in Asia   HIST-UA 710 Identical  to EAST-UA 710. Offered every other year. 4 points.   Takes up a watershed  event in Japanese history, the greatest single preoccupation of  Japanese historians. The war is dealt with in two senses: its meaning  for Japan\u2019s international history and its impact on the domestic  landscape. Readings are drawn from both primary and secondary sources  so that interpretative controversies as well as texts may be  discussed. Thematically, the course divides into sections: (1) the  great debates over Japanese fascism and ultranationalism; (2) the  China War; (3) the Pacific War; (4) the Coprosperity Sphere; (5) the  atom bomb, surrender, and occupation; and (6) issues of public memory  and war responsibility.

Global and Special  Topics Seminars    History of the Body HIST-UA 310 Offered every two years. 4 points. History of the Body from Birth to Death. Many assume that bodies are ahistorical, unchanging, but this is not true. This seminar examines historical changes in physical bodies, perception of bodies, and treatment of the body over time; how social class, race, sex and region have contributed to these changes and to bodily diversity; and how national and international inequalities have affected the human body. Colloquium: Biography and History HIST-UA 669 Offered every other fall. 4 points. In this course, we will explore the ways in which the art and craft of biography can serve the study of history. Reading critically and thoughtfully, we will explore both conventional and unconventional biographies, by both academics and non-academics, treating subjects ranging from the well-known to the unknown, and beyond. Around the seminar table, we will ask how each work illuminates the study of history, with attention to such topics as research methods, sources, evidence, argument, style, voice, and the relationship between writer and subject. Throughout the semester, students will make their own forays into biography, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts. Colloquium: Consumption and Consumer Culture in Comparative Perspective HIST-UA 671 Offered every other year. 4 points. This upper level class will explore the study of consumption and consumer culture. Readings will range from the seventeenth to the twentieth century and will focus primarily, but not exclusively on Europe and the United States. Topics will include the study of the production and consumption of particular commodities; middle-class and working-class consumer cultures in the nineteenth century; and mass production and mass consumption in the twentieth century. We will look at protests and popular movements organized around issues of consumption; examine how products from the non-European world transformed European and American consumption; and how European, and especially American patterns of consumption shaped consumption elsewhere.

You may then forward the permission email to marc.leblanc@nyu.edu to get the registration access code.    All classes are held in the 2nd floor seminar room unless indicated otherwise.  Fall 2015 Seminars    ISAW-GA 3002-001 Observation and Experiment in Ancient Physical Science Alexander Jones alexander.jones@nyu.edu Wednesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    This seminar explores the empirical elements in ancient scientific traditions that aimed at systematic description, explanation, or prediction of physical phenomena. Scientific practices of the Ancient Near East and the Greco-Roman world will figure prominently, but those of other civilizations may be investigated according to the interests and competences of participants. The evidence is largely textual; knowledge of at least one ancient language in which relevant scientific texts exist is required. Participants will choose topics, select study materials, and guide discussion for at least one session.    An initial selection of topics will include the following: the rise of systematic observation of spontaneously occurring phenomena in the context of interpretation of the phenomena as ominous signs; practices of recording and transmitting observations of astral, meteorological, and mundane events; precision, accuracy, and instruments of measurement, especially in astronomical observation records; experiment and experimental apparatus in Greek harmonic theory; empirical claims within deductive scientific texts, e.g. in optics, mechanics, and astronomy; empirical argument in Ptolemy's Optics; adjustment and fabrication of reported observations and measurements.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3007-001 Greco-Arabic Translation Movement Robert Hoyland rgh2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    This course will explore the different paths along which knowledge of Antiquity passed into Muslim intellectual culture and how it was received and interpreted.\u00a0 The focus will not just be on the so-called \u2018translation movement\u2019, but also the broader question of how pre-Islamic histories and cultures fared in the Middle East after the Arab conquests.\u00a0 We will principally look at\u00a0Greek texts translated into Arabic, which receive the most scholarly attention, because they are regarded as crucial to understanding how classical learning was conveyed to Europe and because classicists are always hoping to find lost Greek works preserved in Arabic. However, we will also give consideration to\u00a0translation from Middle Persian and Sanskrit, which may well have been substantial, though the question has been too little studied to be sure.    \u00a0 Assessment will be via a final paper which should draw upon study of original Arabic texts (or a text) and should have a research dimension to it (i.e. not be just a survey of what is known).    Permission of the instructor and knowledge of Arabic are required, and some familiarity with Greek would be an advantage.    ISAW-GA 3010-001 The Manuscripts of Early Chinese Natural Philosophy Ethan Harkness harkness@nyu.edu Fridays, 2:00-5:00pm    This course will introduce students to a variety of recently excavated Chinese technical manuscripts dating from the late Warring States, Qin, and Western Han periods (4th \u2013 1st centuries BCE).\u00a0 We will pay particular attention to the various calendrically-based divination texts promulgated in the manuscripts known as rishu (\u201cdaybooks\u201d), but the fields of astronomy, geography, medicine, and mathematics will all receive due consideration.\u00a0 When appropriate, reference will be made to connections with transmitted texts and to the later repercussions of ideas developed and refined in the years immediately surrounding the formation of the Chinese empire.\u00a0 Topics to consider will include the social function of the early technical texts; the nature of their transmission and evolution; regional idiosyncrasies; the interconnected roles of scribes and readers; and the possible function of both political ideology and private interests in shaping the texts.    Prerequisites are good reading knowledge of modern and classical Chinese and permission of the instructor.    ISAW-GA 3010-002 Advanced Study in Chinese Art &amp; Archaeology Lillian Tseng lillian.tseng@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    This course is intended to provide intensive analyses of primary sources and related scholarship in Chinese art &amp; archaeology for graduate students who have sufficient knowledge of the field. Topics to study depend on the research need of the students.    Ability to read Classical Chinese and permission of the instructor are required.    ISAW-GA 3012-001 Archaeology and Historiography: Perspectives on Time, Space, Text and Material Roderick Campbell rbc2@nyu.edu Thursdays, 2:00-5:00pm    Though treated as separate disciplines and usually housed in different departments, at the highest level history and archaeology share the common goal of understanding the human past. Nevertheless, in both theory and method, not only are archaeology and history internally diverse, but also frequently miles apart. This seminar will embark on an interdisciplinary exploration of the historical sciences: their histories, philosophies and methodologies. Special focus will be on theories of time (change, tradition, process, event, etc.), space (physical space, place, landscape, etc.), text (context, genre, discourse, memory, etc.) and material (material culture, materiality, things, actor-networks, etc.)    The reading load in this course will be heavy. Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3013-001 Production, Accumulation, Trade, and Value: Political Economy in the Ancient Mediterranean Lorenzo d\u2019Alfonso and Elizabeth Murphy lda5@nyu.edu ; elizabeth.murphy@nyu.edu Mondays, 2:00-5:00pm    During the last decades, renewed attention has been devoted to the importance of market and private enterprise in the economies of the ancient Mediterranean, as exemplified by such works as A history of market performance: from ancient Babylonia to the modern world (van der Spek et al., eds., 2015), Commerce and colonization in the ancient Near East (Aubet, 2013), and The Roman market economy (Temin, 2013). On the one hand, interest in market and private enterprise enables us to traverse artificial distinctions between pre-classical and classical ancient Mediterranean civilizations and to pose cross-culturally comparative questions about ancient state economies. On the other hand, this new trend in some respects pays less attention to institutional and political impacts on ancient economies. This impact has perhaps received too much attention in the historiography of ancient western Asia, but the meaning of political intervention in the economic process acquires a different meaning when embedded in a context of private enterprises. For the Roman world, the interests of imperial institutions (e.g., military supply chains, annona redistributions, imperial monopolies) as influencing the scale and organization of economic activities has been long recognized, but recent approaches have turned to the more subtle and indirect ways that institutions affected regional economic development. In response to these academic trends, this course aims to examine the role of political economy in the ancient Mediterranean from multiple vantages.\u00a0 The first classes will focus on recent theoretical works on political economy such as Piketty\u2019s Capital , and North\u2019s Institutions, Institutional Change, and Economic Performance , as well as some of the \u2018classic\u2019 works on ancient economies, such as those by Polanyi, Finley, and Rostovtzeff. In the following classes, ideas developed through the theory classes will then be confronted with specific case studies from the protohistory of ancient western Asia and the Greco-Roman world. These thematic classes will consider issues of primary production, storage and hoarding (accumulation of surpluses and wealth), trade, and the definition of value.\u00a0    Permission of the instructors is required.    Fall 2015 Tutorials    ISAW-GA 3014-001 Texts from the Libraries of the Kingdom of Eshnunna Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm Large Conference Room, 6th Floor\u00a0    Various cities of the kingdom of Eshnunna have yielded literary texts, among them the city of Eshnunna, which seems to have housed a center for scribal training already during the Old Akkadian period, where a forerunner to The Great Revolt Against Naram-Sin has come to light; the city of Tell Harmal, ancient Shaduppum, where the only copy of Sargon in Foreign Lands has been found; and the city of Tell Haddad, ancient Meturan, which yielded a remarkable collection of tablets from a private house owned by an exorcist. In addition to Akkadian archival texts found in separate rooms, there has come to light from two areas a library containing a fragment of the Laws of Eshnunna as well as numerous lexical, liturgical, literary and magic texts (incantations), two prayers to the sun god, and the earliest attested bilingual forerunner to the hemerological series Inbu bel arhi . Among the literary texts, perhaps the most unexpected discovery is a copy of the Sumerian version of the story of Adapa and two larger fragments of the Death of  Gilgamesh . Other Gilgamesh stories represented at Meturan are Gilgamesh and the Bull of An , Gilgamesh and Huwawa , and Gilgamesh, EnkIdu and the Netherworld .    The goal of this seminar is to examine Eshnunna\u2019s role in the transmission of scholarly knowledge through an in-depth analysis of the written compositions extant from the major cities of the kingdom.    Permission of the instructor and knowledge of Akkadian and Sumerian are required.    ISAW-GA 3014-002 Advanced Akkadian: Old Babylonian Historical Texts Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Thursdays, 11:00am-1:00pm Small Conference Room, 6th Floor\u00a0    This advanced course in Akkadian will emphasize the reading of Old Babylonian texts from the sites of Mari and Eshnunna in order to investigate the rise to power and political relations of these two kingdoms during the Old Babylonian period. Primary texts read will include the treaty concluded between between Zimri-lim of Mari and Ibal-pi-el II of Eshnunna and a lengthy letter from Ibal-pi-el II to Zimri-lim offering a political alliance.\u00a0 These two texts offer insight into the form and structure as well as the terminology of international treaties during the first half of the second millennium BCE. Additional readings will include not only other historical inscriptions of the kings of Mari and of Eshnunna but also, for the purposes of comparison and contrast, inscriptions of the kings of Larsa.    Students will acquire an in-depth understanding of the variety and scope of historical and particularly royal inscriptions in the time of the competing territorial states of the Old Babylonian period.    Permission of the instructor and Intermediate Akkadian are required.    Fall 2015 Other Courses    ISAW-GA 1000-001 Intro to Ancient Egyptian I Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD    This course, in the first part of a full year course over two semesters, introduces students to the Middle Egyptian (Classical) dialect of the Ancient Egyptian language in its hieroglyphic form. The classes are structured primarily according to the lessons in J.P. Allen, Middle Egyptian. An Introduction to the Language and Culture of the Hieroglyphs . The course will usually proceed at the rate of one chapter per week, but occasionally a chapter may be skipped or two chapters will be combined. The goal of the first semester is to reach the treatment of the Egyptian verb and the infinitive in Allen\u2019s 13th and 14th chapters. The lessons will be supplemented with readings from A.H. Gardiner, Egyptian Grammar , 3rd. edition, M. Collier and B. Manley, How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs , revised edition, and occasional excerpts from Egyptian funerary stelae.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 1002-001 Advanced Ancient Egyptian I Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD    This course is based on readings from actual Egyptian hieroglyphic texts in their original form. In the early stages of the course, the readings will be presented in both a \u201cnormalized\u201d form with the individual sentences and clauses demarked as well as in the original, continuous text format. The readings will be drawn from a wide range of genres and will increase in difficulty as the course progresses. Where appropriate, photographs and line drawings will be used so that students will learn to handle hieroglyphic text as it actually appears on Egyptian objects. The readings are drawn from a text book in progress.    Permission of the instructor is required.    Spring 2016 Seminars    ISAW-GA 3007-001 Roman Law and the Papyri Roger Bagnall roger.bagnall@nyu.edu Thursdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    Ever since the first legal documents on papyrus dating to the Roman imperial period were published in the nineteenth century, it has been evident to jurists that the papyri offered a unique opportunity to look in depth at how the majestic and complex structure of Roman law that we know from the classical jurists (largely excerpted in Justinian\u2019s Digest) worked on the ground in the provinces. A sizable literature on the subject developed in the early twentieth centuy and has continued to evolve. This seminar will take a series of key issues and institutions, including marriage, the legal status of women, slavery, testation, and major contract types. For each we will examine both selections from the jurists and some representative papyrus documents.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3010-001 Shang Civilization: Text and Material Culture Roderick Campbell rbc2@nyu.edu Fridays, 2:00-5:00pm    This seminar will focus on the Shang dynasty of ancient China from the perspective of archaeology, epigraphy and transmitted texts. The archaeology will cover north China in the 2nd millennium BCE, but focus on the site of Anyang where inscribed oracle-bones and bronzes, monumental tombs and palatial buildings were discovered in the early 20th century demonstrating the historicity of the Shang dynasty. The oracle-bones and bronze inscriptions of the Anyang period will present an opportunity to glimpse a partial image of Shang royal and high elite concerns, especially concerning ritual. A study of Shang history from the perspective of transmitted texts will give both an opportunity to understand the place of the Shang dynasty in later Chinese history as well as its formation as historical subject. This course will be taught at several levels and students of non-sinological background are welcome. While the ability to read classical and modern Chinese would be an asset, neither language is a requirement for this seminar.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3012-001 Beyond China and Byzantium Robert Hoyland and S\u00f6ren Stark rgh2@nyu.edu ; \u00a0 soeren.stark@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 9:00am-12:00pm    Permission of the instructors is required.    ISAW-GA 3014-001 Cultural Memory and the Libraries in Mesopotamia Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Tuesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 3023-001 Special Topics in Digital Humanities for the Ancient World: Computational Photography and 3D Modeling Sebastian Heath sh1933@nyu.edu Wednesdays, 2:00-5:00pm    The premise of this course is that virtual representations of the ancient world will become increasingly important to both research and teaching as the ability to create, work with, and share such digital resources becomes less expensive and more widely available. Accordingly, the course will combine hands-on experience with creating and using virtual representations of ancient material culture, including objects and architectural spaces, with a review of current practices being employed by projects around the world. Students will use such tools as the open-source 3d-suite Blender, the game engine Unity, and applications for making models with smartphone cameras. We will explore techniques for making richly-textured 3d models of real objects as well as create immersive virtual environments. Readings will include reports of ongoing work as well as discussions of why 3D matters and how it is being used in the classroom. Guest speakers from academia and industry will provide a broad perspective on current trends. Students will use their own computers and should be willing to apply themselves to learning the digital skills the class introduces.    Permission of the instructor is required.    Spring 2016 Tutorials    ISAW-GA 3014-002 Advanced Akkadian: Neo-Babylonian Historical Inscriptions Beate Pongratz-Leisten bpl2@nyu.edu Thursdays, 11:00am-1:00pm Small Conference Room, 6th Floor\u00a0    The Advanced Reading of Akkadian Class of Neo-Babylonian Inscriptions is designed to introduce into the Neo-Babylonian dialect and to familiarize the student with its particular paleography and grammar. Simultaneously, a diachronic choice of Neo-Babylonian inscriptions reaching from Nabupolassar, its founder, to Nabonidus will provide an insight into the history of the Neo-Babylonian empire.    Permission of the instructor and knowledge of Akkadian are required.    Spring 2016 Other Courses    ISAW-GA 1001-001 Intro to Ancient Egyptian II Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD  This course is a continuation of the first semester. The course will proceed at the rate of a chapter per week through J.P. Allen, Middle Egyptian. An Introduction to the Language and Culture of the Hieroglyphs . From time to time, passages from actual Egyptian texts will supplement the examples in Allen\u2019s grammar. Depending on the progress of the class, the last weeks of the course will cover the hieroglyphic transcription of The Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor , an actual Egyptian literary tale.    Permission of the instructor is required.    ISAW-GA 1003-001 Advanced Ancient Egyptian II Ogden Goelet ogden.goelet@nyu.edu Time and Location, TBD    This is a continuation of the fall semester course, using additional sources of increasing difficulty.

Infrastructure that has become \u201csecond  nature\u201d brings water and electricity to the city and carries its  waste to distant landfills. The park lands that dot the city have  become both playgrounds where New Yorkers seek green space and  battlefields where they fight over the proper ways to enjoy those  spaces.

This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.      Seminar: Topics in  Medieval History   HIST-UA 441   Bedos-Rezak, Griffiths. 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.      Seminar: Topics in  European Intellectual History   HIST-UA 443   Geroulanos, Shovlin. 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.      Seminar: Britain since  World War II   HIST-UA 451 Open to  history majors who have completed Historical Studies: Theories and  Practice (HIST-UA 101), or by permission of the instructor. Ortolano.  4 points.   Assists students in  writing archivally-based research papers about a single topic in  recent British history. Since the end of the Second World War,  Britain has faced many of the challenges typical of Western  societies, as well as more particular obstacles resulting from its  status as a recent imperial power. British history since 1945 has  thus been characterized by the creation of the welfare state, the end  of the British Empire, immigration and racial conflict, \u201cSwinging  London\u201d and 1960s second-wave feminism, labor unrest and the  decline of heavy industry, neo-liberal economics, and Tony Blair\u2019s  New Labour. We spend the first part of the seminar becoming  acquainted with these developments, while also identifying specific  topics for students to explore through primary-source-based papers of  about 20 pages.      United States History Seminar: Topics in U.S.  History      HIST-UA 413 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.    Colloquium: The Place of Regions in U.S. History HIST-UA 414 Offered every year. 4 points. In this research seminar, students will explore how the concept of region and the meanings of regional differences have changed throughout U.S. history. Course readings will move between regions and through time as we explore themes including environment, geography, economics, politics, and culture. While class discussions will focus on a series of secondary readings, students are encouraged to draw on a wide range of materials, ranging from music, films, and physical objects to political reports and historical monographs, in writing a research paper that will explore some aspect of regional history in the United States.    Seminar: Capital and Labor and the Making of Modern America   HIST-UA 416 Offered  every other year. Montoya. 4 points.   This course has two  purposes. The first is to learn the fundamentals of historical  research. By completing assignments that teach them how to conduct  archival research and engage in historical analysis, students come to  understand how historians engage in their craft, how they construct  historical narratives, and how they ensure their accuracy. The course  culminates in a 15- to 20-page research paper. The second purpose of  this course is to learn about U.S. labor history, which includes not  only the study of the workplace but also how families interacted and  reacted to labor conditions as they lived their domestic lives.      Seminar: Writing  American History   HIST-UA 417 Offered  every year. Bender. 4 points.   Explores the history of  history writing in the United States, examining national histories  written in the 19th and 20th centuries as part of American  intellectual history. Focuses on theme, interpretation, points of  view, and style in the work of past historians.    Liberalism and Conservatism since the New Deal HIST-UA 418 Offered every year. 4 points. This seminar investigates the historical development of the key ideologies of postwar American politics and their differing engagements with the central historical developments of that time period: the Cold War, civil rights movement, metropolitan development, feminism, environmentalism, and fiscal and monetary policy. It will investigate how liberalism and conservatism reshaped American society and politics at the various scales of American governance: grass-roots, state, regional, and national. As a research seminar, students will be expected to complete a piece of original research, on a topic of their choosing, over the course of the semester.    Seminar: Unbordered and Bordered Lands: North American Borderlands History HIST-UA 663 Offered every other year. 4 points. In this reading seminar, students will explore the major themes and historiographical approaches to the study of North American borderlands history. A rapidly expanding and vibrant field, borderlands history focuses on the interactions of peoples, nations, and empires across the boundaries of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, this course will explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. In the second half of the class, we will turn to the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explore how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations.      Seminar: Reading and  Writing Experimental History   HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4  points.   Investigates and  evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries  of writing history. Focuses on the relationship between historical  evidence and the writing of history in new ways; relation between  scholar and subject; connections between history and speculation; use  of unconventional voices; re-creation of past worlds and lives; and  connections between history and storytelling.      Seminar: Constructions  of Race in U.S. History   HIST-UA 680 Hodes. 4  points.   Explores the ideas of  race and how racial classifications have changed over time and across  regions and cultures in the United States. Themes include language,  color, law, science, slavery, mixed ancestries, and white identity.      Seminar: Race, Civil  War, Reconstruction   HIST-UA 683 Hodes. 4  points.   The American Civil War  punctuated the 19th century and transformed the nation. This seminar  explores the experiences of slaves and former slaves, politicians and  community leaders, civilians and families, soldiers and veterans, and  proceeds from the premise that slavery and race were central to the  war\u2019s causes and consequences.      Seminar: Ideology and  Social Change in American History   HIST-UA 684 Offered  every other year. 4 points.   Explores classical  arguments in American history concerning social behavior. Central  themes: the power of cultural conditioning, the role of schooling and  other acculturating institutions, the uses of \u201cuplifting\u201d reform  and organizational benevolence, and the intervention of professional  experts into social policymaking. Special attention to the role of  ethnic and racial leaders, proponents of success and socialization,  critical investigations of family and femininity, and analysis of  distinctive generational responses to these and related issues.      Seminar: The New Deal   HIST-UA 686 Offered  every year. Katz. 4 points.   Explores the historical  issues of the Great Depression and the New Deal years, 1933\u20131941,  by discussing several relevant works on this period. Students choose  a research project, which they report on both orally and in a seminar  paper. Colloquium: Twentieth Century U.S. History in Film HIST-UA 694 Offered every other spring. 4 points. The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema. In terms of documentaries, we will view newsreels, government-produced films, historical documentaries, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and \u201cdocu-ganda.\u201d We will not necessarily focus upon whether filmic representations are historically accurate in fine detail. Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.     History of Asia, Africa, and Latin America      Seminar: Capitalism in  South Asia   HIST-UA 327 Offered  every year. Sartori. 4 points.   Is capitalism a set of  global arrangements superimposed on a set of local cultures, a  long-term tendency of South Asian societies, or something that has  entered into the very structure of modern South Asian society? This  course explores a series of topics including the Indian Ocean trading  world; \u201cproto-industrialization\u201d in pre-colonial India; the East  India Company; deindustrialization, peasantization, and  traditionalization; continuity and transformation in peasant society;  developmentalist theories and pro-industrialization policies;  nationalism, decolonization, and political economy; and  neo-liberalism.      Seminar: Topics in  Latin American History   HIST-UA 471 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.      Seminar: Topics in  Japanese History   HIST-UA 474 Offered  every other year.

Examines 20th-century  Taiwan and China in their interrelationship and their divergent  paths. It is not a diplomatic or international history course.  Rather, it takes up crucial issues in the history of each polity and  society, focusing primarily on Taiwan, thus allowing students to gain  an understanding of the complexities of Taiwanese history and society  and of this contested region of the world. The reading and writing  load are heavy, and students are expected to participate in class.  Some background in China\u2019s or Taiwan\u2019s history is desirable and  presumed.      Seminar: Topics in  Eurasian History   HIST-UA 533 Offered  every year. 4 points.   Focuses on major  historical issues and problems in the history of Eurasia, which is  the largest landmass in the world but is rarely treated as a region  or unit of historical analysis. Responds to recent shifts in the  field of history that emphasize frameworks larger than the  \u201cnation-state\u201d for historical research and analysis. Possible  topics: The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy; Early Modern Empires:  China, Russia, and the Ottomans; Scientific and Technological  Exchanges, 1225\u20132000; Eurasian Militaries; and Nomads and Nomadism  in Eurasia.    Colloquium : Gender and  Radicalism in Modern China   HIST-UA 536 Identical  to EAST-UA 536. Offered every year. Karl. 4 points.

Seminar: Japan and  World War II in Asia   HIST-UA 710 Identical  to EAST-UA 710. Offered every other year. 4 points.   Takes up a watershed  event in Japanese history, the greatest single preoccupation of  Japanese historians. The war is dealt with in two senses: its meaning  for Japan\u2019s international history and its impact on the domestic  landscape. Readings are drawn from both primary and secondary sources  so that interpretative controversies as well as texts may be  discussed. Thematically, the course divides into sections: (1) the  great debates over Japanese fascism and ultranationalism; (2) the  China War; (3) the Pacific War; (4) the Coprosperity Sphere; (5) the  atom bomb, surrender, and occupation; and (6) issues of public memory  and war responsibility.

Global and Special  Topics Seminars    History of the Body HIST-UA 310 Offered every two years. 4 points. History of the Body from Birth to Death. Many assume that bodies are ahistorical, unchanging, but this is not true. This seminar examines historical changes in physical bodies, perception of bodies, and treatment of the body over time; how social class, race, sex and region have contributed to these changes and to bodily diversity; and how national and international inequalities have affected the human body. Colloquium: Biography and History HIST-UA 669 Offered every other fall. 4 points. In this course, we will explore the ways in which the art and craft of biography can serve the study of history. Reading critically and thoughtfully, we will explore both conventional and unconventional biographies, by both academics and non-academics, treating subjects ranging from the well-known to the unknown, and beyond. Around the seminar table, we will ask how each work illuminates the study of history, with attention to such topics as research methods, sources, evidence, argument, style, voice, and the relationship between writer and subject. Throughout the semester, students will make their own forays into biography, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts. Colloquium: Consumption and Consumer Culture in Comparative Perspective HIST-UA 671 Offered every other year. 4 points. This upper level class will explore the study of consumption and consumer culture.

The seminar will analyze how recent scholarship challenges established models and insights, and it will look to emerging areas of synthesis and narrative consensus. The seminar will also examine how the rich scholarship on the Cold War sheds light on current international issues, and what lessons historians might offer to policy-makers.

February 10, 2015: &quot;Temporality and Representation in the Heritage Constructions of Qatar&quot; (Trinidad Rico, Texas A&amp;M-Qatar)            Abstract   This discussion explores the role of chronology in constructions of the heritage fabric of Doha. Transformations in the landscapes of Qatar are subjected to intense bouts of modernization, a process that asks that inhabitants live in the present with a future-oriented gaze. The timeline of this capital city is marked by festivals and commemorations, constructions and reconstructions, destructions and inventions that navigate rapid change, emphasizing the centrality of the present in heritage perceptions and depictions.   The present in Doha takes particular significance in a constantly-shifting landscape that gives rise to interrupted lifestyles, relocated points of reference, and a blurred understanding of what is \u2018new\u2019 and \u2018old\u2019 in the heritage discourse. This discussion documents recent manifestations of this discourse particularly in urban, archaeological and cultural landscapes, with reference to global chronological points of reference and local legal instruments.    Bio   Dr Trinidad Rico is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar. She holds a PhD in Anthropology from Stanford University, an MA in Principles of Conservation from UCL and a BA in Archaeology from the University of Cambridge.   Her current research focuses on the mobilisation of Islamic values in constructions of heritage, and she is co-author of the volume \u2018Cultural Heritage in the Arabian Peninsula: Debates, Discourses and Practices\u2019 (Ashgate, 2013).                                 February 11, 2015: Research Seminar, &quot;Choreographing the Historical Imagination: Archival Mobilizations&quot; (Trajal Harrell, New York)            Abstract:   This talk confronts the history, construction, and interpretation of contemporary dance. Starting from the premise that history is always partly a fiction, Harrell works with historical imagination as a way to rethink how to process and interpret our pasts.   While working on Twenty Looks or Paris Is Burning at The Judson Church, which is an exploration of a hypothetical hybrid movement drawing both from postmodern dance and voguing, Harrell began investigating the history of butoh, a dance form created in part to resist the conservatism permeating postwar Japanese choreography. As Harrell learned more, the project transformed, focusing on the life and work of Japanese choreographer Tatsumi Hijikata (1928\u201386), a butoh pioneer. Hijikata situated butoh as an outlaw, literary, and surrealist dance form, activating themes of death, criminality, abjection, and corporeality. Harrell\u2019s extended research into the Hijikata archives culminated in Used Abused and Hung Out to Dry, which was commissioned by MoMA as part of Performing Histories: Live Artworks Examining the Past, in connection with the exhibition Tokyo: The New Avant-Garde 1945\u20131970, and was performed in The Agnes Gund Garden Lobby in 2012.   In conversation with NYUAD Assistant Professor of Theater Debra Levine and colleagues from History and other disciplines, Harrell will discuss the value of historical archives of performance for contemporary artists, and the research methodologies he has developed to engage with the historical materials and rich media stored in the Tatsumi Hijikata Archive at the Keio University Arts Center in Tokyo.   Bio:  Trajal Harrell has been a recipient of fellowships from The Saison Foundation, The Guggenheim Foundation, Art Matters Foundation, Foundation for Contemporary Arts, and the Doris Duke Foundation. He is perhaps best known for a series of works entitled Twenty Looks or Paris is Burning at The Judson Church which re-imagine a meeting between early postmodern dance and the voguing dance tradition and created in seven sizes. Antigone Sr., the large in the series, won the 2012 Bessie Award for Best Production. In Fall 2012, he premiered the last work in that series, Judson Church is Ringing in Harlem (Made-to-Measure)/Twenty Looks or Paris is Burning at The Judson Church (M2M), with the distinction of being the first dance commission of MoMA PS1.   Most recently, he created the first of a new body of work examining butoh dance from the theoretical praxis of voguing. This latest work, Used Abused and Hung Out to Dry, premiered at The Museum of Modern Art- MoMA in February 2013, where he has begun a two-year residency further developing this new body of work.   Harrell's work has been presented In New York and the U.S. at many venues including Crossing the Line Festival, The Kitchen, New York Live Arts, TBA Festival- Portland, Walker Arts Center-Minneapolis, American Realness Festival, ICA Boston, Danspace Project, DTW, P.S. 122, Cornell University, Colorado College, Philadelphia Live Arts and Los Angeles\u2019 RedCat Theater. His work has been presented internationally at festivals such as Festival d\u2019Automne (Paris), Rencontres Chor\u00e9graphiques (Paris), Festival d\u2019Avignon, Impulstanz (Vienna), TanzimAugust (Berlin), Panorama Festival (Rio de Janeiro), Festival Transmeriques (Montreal), and Holland Festival, among others.   He has also shown performance work in visual art contexts such as MoMA, MoMA PS1, Perfoma Biennial, Fondation Cartier (Paris), The New Museum (NYC), The Margulies Art Warehouse (Miami), The Bronx Museum of the Arts, Serralves Museum (Porto), Centre Pompidou- Metz, Centre Pompidou-Paris, ICA Boston and Art Basel-Miami Beach.

February 24, 2015: \u201c&#39;An African Village in the Hijaz&#39;: Slavery, Agriculture, and Malaria in Traditional Arabia&quot; (Benjamin Reilly, Carnegie Mellon-Qatar)            Abstract   In the 19th and early 20th centuries, European travelers were astounded to find entire villages of African farmers located in the midst of the Arabian Peninsula. These African agriculturalists, who were a mixture of slaves and freedmen, were found throughout Arabian Peninsula, especially in Najd and the Hijaz.   In contrast to earlier authors who have explained African slavery in terms of Arab laziness, I will argue that a better explanation lies in the geography and genetics of the Arabian Peninsula itself. African agricultural slavery in Arabia was driven by the highly malarial character of the Arabian Peninsula\u2019s arable landscapes, which tended to be moist wadi beds and other drainage basins.   Rather than exploit these unhealthy landscapes directly, Arabian townsmen employed African laborers endowed with innate and acquired resistance to malaria as proxy farmers. As a result, agricultural slavery in the Arabian Peninsula had surprising parallels to slave practices in the 17th-19th century Caribbean, where slaves were similarly employed in hot, humid lowlands in large part due to their intrinsic resistance malaria and yellow fever.      Bio   Benjamin Reilly is an Associate Teaching Professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar, where he has served since 2004. Although his doctoral work, which was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh, examined the political and intellectual history of the French Revolution, he has published several books on environmental history over the years, and is now expanding his studies to the Arabian Peninsula, which remains terra incognita from the standpoint of environmental history.   To this end, Reilly has recently published several papers describing the impact of lactase persistence on Arabia\u2019s Bedouin populations, as well as the geographic and genetic underpinnings of Arabian Peninsula slavery. His forthcoming book with Ohio University Press, which will form the basis of his talk, examines the previously unstudied phenomenon of African agricultural slavery within the traditional Arabian Peninsula.                                 March 17, 2015: Research Seminar, &quot;Between China, Iran, and Byzantium: The T\u00fcrks in Inner Asia from the 6th to the 8th Century\u201d (S\u00f6ren Stark, Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York University)            Abstract :  The \u2018World Empire\u2019 of the nomadic T\u00fcrks, arising from the Inner Asian steppes around the middle of the 6th century and spanning, during its apogee some 30 years later, from Crimea to the Hindukush and to Manchuria, remains one of the least known hegemonic polities in the history of Eurasia. In popular perception it is largely overshadowed by the later Chinggisid&amp;nbsp; \u2018World Empire,\u2019 although the Mongols owed much of their imperial ideology and structures of governance to the T\u00fcrks.  Like the Pax Mongolica some 700 years later, the unification of large parts of Eurasia under T\u00fcrk rule considerably intensified diplomatic, economic and cultural exchange across the Eurasian continent (\u201cSilk Roads\u201d). In this context much attention has been given to the role of Sogdian merchants. Instead, my presentation will shift the focus to the nomadic elites of the T\u00fcrks as agents of cultural communication, transmission, and appropriation in a framework of shared political culture and interstate competition \u2014 between China, the Iranian world, and Byzantium. In particular, I will inquire how the T\u00fcrks\u2019 active participation in this exchange network and their competition with other imperial \u2018players\u2019 of their time impacted upon and shaped their own self-representation.     Bio :  S\u00f6ren Stark is Assistant Professor of Central Asian Art and Archaeology at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University. He specializes in the political and cultural interrelations between pastoral nomads in Central and Inner Asia and their sedentary neighbors, with a monograph on the archaeology and history of the T\u00fcrks in Central and Inner Asia (published in 2008 as Die Altt\u00fcrkenzeit in Mittel- und Zentralasien. Arch\u00e4ologische und historische Studien, Nomaden und Sesshafte 6. Wiesbaden: Ludwig-Reichert-Verlag) and a major exhibition in New York and Washington on the culture of Early Iron Age nomads on the territory of present-day Kazakhstan (see the catalogue Nomads and Networks.

Approaching Global History through Marches and Street Demonstrations&quot; (Philipp Gassert, University of Mannheim)            Abstract:   Protest marches have been around for several centuries. As a means of expressing dissent they share certain basic features across time and space. The modern street rally emerged during the revolutionary upheavals of the 18th and 19th century. It was later adapted to the needs of labor unions in industrializing societies. It also became a very prominent feature in the decolonization struggles exemplified by the Ghandian marches in South Africa and India, which gained influence on protest movements in other countries as well.   Marches were also an integral part of manufacturing consent in 20th century Communist and Fascist regimes. They remained the protest means of choice when the new social movements of the 1960s and 1970s arrived. Despite the successive media revolutions of the past century, street demonstrations do not seem to have lost their usefulness today. Because of their (almost) universal nature and surprising resilience with regard to historical change, protest marches lend themselves to the study of transnational interactions and cross-cultural comparisons. They also help us to understand how the grammar of protest has evolved from 1800 to the present. This paper seeks to explore the question to what extent a fresh look at street demonstrations can help us in writing global histories on a large historical scale.

April 21, 2015: &quot;Universal Progress vs. Local Culture: Soviet Social Science and the Problems of Development in Soviet Central Asia&quot; (Artemy Kalinovsky, University of Amsterdam)            Abstract:   By the 1970s, Soviet planners were fretting that the industrialization of Central Asia launched in the 1950s was failing to bring the desired dividends to the Soviet economy or the local population. Locals tended to avoid the industrial work force and seemed to shy away from educational opportunities, while agriculture remained labor intensive and resistant to mechanization. Economists, sociologists, and demographers tried to make sense of this situation and offer policy advice. In the process, they discovered the limits of their own fields and sought out new approaches to better understand the micro-processes inhibiting modernization.   Examining the academic debates and bureaucratic struggles of these scholars will shed light on the interaction between government and scholarship under late socialism and the parallels between development thought there and in the west. It will also help us contextualize and historicize current debates about development in Central Asia.     Bio:   Artemy Kalinovsky is an Assistant Professor at the University of Amsterdam. He is the author of A Long Goodbye: The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan (Harvard University Press, 2011), and co-editor with Sergey Radchenko, of The End of the Cold War and the Third World (Routledge: 2011). His current research, supported by a Veni grant from the Dutch Science Organization (NWO), is focused on the politics and practices of modernization in Soviet Tajikistan.                                 TBD: &quot;Empire&#39;s Progeny: A Comparative Perspective on Gender, Race and Citizenship in Colonial Asia&quot; (Frances Gouda, Bowdoin College)            Abstract   In the Dutch East Indies, French Indochina, and British India the issues of gender and interracial sexuality produced divergent policy outcomes in terms of racial classifications and the prerogatives of belonging to the European community and citizenship.    In this seminar, Frances Gouda will analyze these differences in a comparative manner in order to shed light on the distinctive patterns of governance in three colonial societies in South and Southeast Asia during the heydays of European colonial culture from the later nineteenth century to 1942.

While much MENA history from below has been written under the sign of various forms of structural determinism \u2013 usually linked to the development of modern capitalism (Abrahamian; Batatu; Beinin and Lockman; Burke; Halliday; Hanna; Von Sivers) \u2013 the premise of this paper is that historians of contentious politics need to probe the possibilities and forms of creative and transgressive agency in the making of movements that mobilise to challenge multiply-determined and intersectional forms of power, subordination and \u2018instituted heteronomy\u2019 (van der Linden; Castoriadis).   To study the cross-border diffusion and appropriation of models for collective action is to contribute to the understanding of how sites of unruly collective agency are constructed and how intersectional leverage against power is acquired. This paper draws attention to how models for collective action can be \u2018pirated\u2019 (Anderson) \u2013 that is appropriated across contexts that are very different in political, economic and social terms. This form of appropriation (piracy) is not solely the fruit of long sociological preparation, or socioeconomic development, but can operate in the political field in ways that generate dynamics that are socioeconomically consequential. In other words, to study \u2018piracy\u2019 is to point to a site of change within the social order that is not simply an epiphenomena of an entirely pre-existing, structural, socioeconomic process (modernization, capitalism, or globalisation).   The paper \u2013 building on works by Khalili, Khuri-Makdisi and Lockman \u2013 examines the cross-border social life of contentious mobilising discourses \u2013 considering (1) nineteenth century popular heterodoxy, Islamic revivalism and millenarianism (2) late nineteenth century and inter-war period liberalism, Islamic modernism, and patriotism (3) post-1945 national liberation, Arab socialism, and Third Worldism, and (4) late twentieth and early twenty-first century Islamism and people power. The paper will track some of the ways in which these mobilising discourses were appropriated across borders, and how they acted to shape and coordinate the popular movements of different periods.

November 11, 2014: &quot;Competitive Emulation and the &#39;Official Mind&#39; in the Russian Conquest of Central Asia&quot; (Alexander Morrison, Nazarbayev University, Astana)            Abstract   The Russian conquest of Central Asia is usually understood either as an incidental outcome of the 'Great Game' between Britain and Russia for control of the region, or else as driven by economic considerations, principally the need of the Russian textile industry for secure markets and raw cotton.   Both of these explanations are unsatisfactory: the first because it simply reflects British preoccupations with the defence of India and largely ignores Central Asian actors; the second because it is a product of Soviet dogma (the 'Hobson-Lenin thesis') and entirely unsupported by evidence.   Using materials from archives in Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Georgia and India, this talk reveals a more complex story, one in which the British are less important, and the focus is on relations between the Russian empire, the Kazakh steppe nomads who were its nearest neighbours, and the Central Asian states of Bukhara, Khiva and Kokand. It will illuminate how the conquest of Central Asia was a very effective projection of Russian power, one that was increasingly celebrated after the Crimean War cast doubts on Russia's ability to maintain the status, the expected forms of behaviour, and the military and political repertoire, of an imperial \u2018Great Power\u2019.

November 18, 2014: &quot;Muslim Mediators, Tibetan Conflicts: Chinese Muslims and Colonial Legal Culture in Early Modern China&quot; (Max Gordon Oidtmann, School of Foreign Service in Qatar, Georgetown University)            Abstract   This presentation explores the implications of the formalization of a Chinese-Muslim gentry in northwest China in the aftermath of the Great Muslim Rebellions of 1864-1872. Prior to the rebellions, Chinese Muslims in Gansu province served as informal local brokers between Qing field officials and indigenous Tibetans and Mongols in the borderlands. For instance, they served as yamen clerks and runners, using their knowledge of Tibetan and Mongolian to gather taxes and information on behalf of the state. As the proprietors of &quot;resthouses&quot; (xiejia \u6b47\u5bb6) they also facilitated trade across the Sino-Tibetan frontier.   In the aftermath of the rebellions, these roles were formally recognized and given a sound legal footing in Qing administrative practice. Thus, paradoxically, former rebels were incorporated into the Qing colonial administration as local gentry. In this new role, Muslims acquired new positions as civil and military officials. Muslim traders and colonists were permitted to move &quot;beyond the passes&quot; into Tibetan territory and even acquired status as &quot;village elders&quot; in Tibetan communities. Thus in the legal arenas of the local government court (the yamen), it was Muslims who increasingly represented Tibetans before the magistrate and were otherwise charged with resolving conflicts both among Tibetans and between Tibetans and the state.   The impact of the gentrification of Muslims in the Sino-Tibetan borderlands was profound: Muslim gentry increasingly displaced Tibetan and Mongolian nobility, both lay and ecclesiastic, as the main interlocutors between the Qing court and Tibetan Buddhists. From the 1870s through the early 1900s, Tibetan Buddhist elites went from being &quot;allies&quot; to &quot;indigenes&quot; in the eyes of the court. The &quot;aboriginalization&quot; of Tibetans paralleled the emergence of the Hui as the key strategic partner in the governance of Inner Asia. The discovery of the Muslims during the late Qing led to a significant new role for Chinese Muslims in the national politics of the late Qing empire.   Bio   Max Oidtmann is a historian of early modern China and Inner Asia (1600s through present). He received his PhD from Harvard University in History and East Asian Languages in 2014 and is currently working on two book projects.

Drawing on archival documents of the KUTV Arabic Section and the students\u2019 personal files, it will show how students positioned themselves as temporary \u201cStalinist subjects,\u201d as \u201cforeigners,\u201d and as \u201cEasterners\u201d to achieve particular political and personal goals.   The talk will also consider cases of students\u2019 extreme deviations from party discipline in order to pursue political objectives or interests that often lay outside Soviet territorial and political boundaries. These examples of radical unbelief and wholesale rejections of the regime and its universal precepts offer a useful starting point for understanding the limits of belonging as defined by various actors in the Moscow-coordinated international communist project.

This lecture is about that transformative moment, as wartime imperatives gave way to postwar reconstruction, and the United States assumed the mantle of victor as well as cultural redeemer.   In this context, American Studies abroad has a surprising history, intertwined with the restoration or invention of a European community. This is illustrated most dramatically at the the Salzburg Seminar in American Civilization, founded in 1947 with the very tenuous approval of American occupation authorities.   In a bomb-damaged baroque castle, scholars, novelists and poets carried the American word abroad, while displaced persons, former Nazis and budding communists met on the supposedly neutral ground of American culture. This institution leads us to reconsider cultural diplomacy in the early Cold War, and to a more cosmopolitan history of \u201cAmerican exceptionalism.\u201d   Bio:      George Blaustein is assistant professor of American Studies and history at the University of Amsterdam.

Irfan Habib, National University of Educational Planning and Education, New Delhi)            Abstract:       The main focus of this lecture revolves around questioning the idea of &quot;Islamic science&quot; as proposed by several scholars in Euro-American universities and elsewhere. There is a modest attempt to question the possibility of Islamic science as a distinct epistemological category, which is being pushed by some Islamic scholars since the late seventies. I do not see Islamic science and modern science as binaries.   Modern science has a cross-civilizational character and its Eurocentricity needs to be questioned and exposed. However, it cannot be replaced by another centrism, being proposed by the Islamists, as it will be equally undemocratic.   I use the modernist Muslim reformers of the 19th century India and their pluralist perspective to question the essentialist and myopic interpretations of some of the present day Islamic interlocutors. The expressions Jihad (to struggle) and Ijtihad (independent thinking or use of reason) are not just provocatively used in the title, they are central to the arguments put forth here. Both jihad and ijtihad had been the core of Islam, unfortunately the former is the most misinterpreted and misunderstood while the latter is completely forgotten.      Bio:        S Irfan Habib has worked in the area of history of science as well as political history. After teaching history for a few years, he joined the National Institute of Science, Technology and Development Studies, New Delhi.   He spent more than thirty years looking at the intellectual and institutional foundations of modern science and technology during the colonial phase in India. Within this framework, he began investigating the role of dissemination of modern science through the local Indian languages, and how a language like Urdu, could transform itself from a language of poetry to a language skilled in communicating modern science. He later moved to the questions of interface between local Indian knowledge traditions and modern knowledge which came along with colonization.   Besides a large number of papers, he has also edited and authored several books including Situating the History of Science: Dialogues with Joseph Needham and Social History of Social History of Science in Colonial India (both edited with D Raina). He has also co-authored Domesticating Modern Science in Colonial India . His book To Make the Deaf Hear: Ideology and Programme of Bhagat Singh and his Comrades , has been translated into several Indian languages like Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam and Bengali.   His latest book is Jihad or Ijtihad: Religious Orthodoxy and Modern Science in Contemporary Islam . He has also coordinated the South and South East Asian section of history of science in UNESCO\u2019s prestigious History of Humanity series. At present he holds Maulana Azad Chair at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration, New Delhi.   Habib has been a Fulbright scholar and a visiting professor at several universities like Humboldt University Berlin, University of Cambridge, State University of New York, Maison des Sciences de l'Homme, Paris, MIT, Cambridge, and others.

To meet this need, the Collaborative for Historical Information and Analysis (CHIA) has been at work since 2011 on creating a world-historical Archive, addressing social, cultural, health, and climate issues worldwide for the past 400 years.   In three major points, this presentation demonstrates the type of world-historical information the Archive will yield; it describes the work taking place to construct the Archive; and it invites contributions of data and analysis from the Middle East region.   Bio:   Patrick Manning is Andrew W. Mellon Professor of World History at the University of Pittsburgh. He is director of the World History Center, located in the Department of History and affiliated with the Global Studies Program and the University Center of International Studies. Trained as a specialist in the economic history of Africa, he has become a specialist in world history overall.   His research has focused on demographic history (African slave trade), social and cultural history of francophone Africa, global migration, African diaspora as a dimension of global history, and an overview of the field of world history. He was educated at the California Institute of Technology (BS in Chemistry, 1963) and the University of Wisconsin - Madison (MS in History and Economics, PhD in History 1969).   Manning now directs the Collaborative for Historical Information and Analysis (CHIA), for work on creating a world-historical data resource. He is also president of the World History Network, Inc., a nonprofit corporation fostering \u2028research and international exchange in\u2028 world history.   His current research \u2028centers on creating a global historical\u2028 data resource, African populations 1650-1950, global social movements 1989-1992, and on an interdisciplinary history of early humanity in collaboration with Christopher Ehret.

April 8, 2014: &quot;Reflections on 1591 and 2013 in Songhay and Mali&quot; (Lansine Kaba, Carnegie Mellon University, Qatar)            Abstract:   The battle of Tondibi fought on the 12th of April 1591, and the French jet-and helicopter gunship intervention initiated on the 11th of January 2013 in Bamako, Mali, bespeak some of the tragedy that the land known in African Islamic historiography as the Western Sudan witnessed in its pre-colonial and post-colonial history. They were true fatidic events.   The Muslim Askiya dynasty of Gao that ruled the Songhay Empire, situated in the Middle Niger River valley and controlling a significant part of the Sahel and the Sahara between 1464 and 1591, precipitously collapsed under the blows received from the fire arms-equipped invading forces dispatched from Morocco by the Sultan Mulay Ahmed al-Mansur to boost his kingdom\u2019s position in the gold trade (see L. Kaba, \u201cArchers, Musketeers and Mosquitoes,\u201d Journal of African History, 22, 4, 1981; \u201cThe Pen, the Sword and the Crown,\u201d JAH, 1984).   In January 2013, an analogous blow was struck against the democratically-elected regime of Mali, when it was hit first by an invasion of its northern region by Touareg separatists and Arab Islamist insurgents, and then by a junior officers-led coup orchestrated in protest against the government\u2019 s inaction.   The Sahel zone has turned into a volatile region in which Islamic fundamentalism, Touareg and Black African nationalisms compete for power. With the crisis that shook in 2011 the authoritarian North African regimes, Muammar Qaddafi\u2013recruited Touareg fighters returned home to northern Mali, flush with resources and political determination. They launched a rebellion for the liberation of their region from black African rule.   While secularist, the insurgents entered in alliance of convenience \u2013that was short lived-- with the militant mostly Algerian Islamist groups long active in Mali\u2019s north. Together they set on introducing the Sharia law upon their conquest of Mali\u2019s northern garrisons and cities, including the old center of Islamic learning and trade, Timbuktu. These events triggered the coup in Bamako. A few weeks later, the jihadists advanced toward the south, thereby threatening the whole region and the Western Mediterranean with a militant Islamic state, probably a new kind of Afghanistan, according to some reporters.   France President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande decided to intervene against the Islamists, while in New York the international community was mulling an appropriate answer to the threat. French soldiers and President Hollande received a jubilant welcome in Timbuktu and other Malian cities, with the Tricolor hovering over the mosques. Does the intervention herald a new form of colonialism or a new resolve to fight Jihadism?   Still unsettled, the matter invites historians to reconsider the long history of Islam in West Africa as well as the general issues of politics in the area, including nation building (and failing), ethnicity and terrorism, French-African relations and the current global politics. I will discuss the subject in the tradition of la longue dur\u00e9e that some recent works have inappropriately considered.   Bio:   Lansin\u00e9 Kaba, Distinguished Visiting Professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar, has widely published in English and French on Islam in West Africa, French and British decolonization, and African post-colonial one-party states. His monograph, &quot;The Wahhabiyya, Islamic Reform and Politics,&quot; (Northwestern University Press, 1974) was the co-winner of the 1975 Melville Herskovits Award for the outstanding book of the year given by the African Studies Association.   Kaba received the 1978 Distinguished Teacher Award at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, was President of the African Studies Association, 1998-2001, and Dean of the Honors College at the University of Illinois at Chicago, 1996-2004.

April 15, 2014: &quot;Rethinking the Boundaries of Indian Intellectual History: Poetry as Archive in the Work of Savarkar&quot; (Janaki Bakhle, Columbia University)            Abstract:   Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (1883-1966) was India\u2019s most infamous revolutionary \u201cterrorist,\u201d dubbed an anarchist as a student by the British colonial police, a Hindu nationalist who penned the tract \u201cEssentials of Hindutva\u201d (1922). He is best known for his implication in the assassination of M.K. Gandhi.   Savarkar\u2019s prose has been dissected for its fascist under and overtones, his political career has been examined as the foundation for \u201cHindu fundamentalism\u201d, and of all the figures who populate the history of Indian nationalism he is by far the most hateful and therefore the one most reviled.     Yet, what remains to be examined is his most intellectually rigorous work of which he was most proud and with which he most identified, namely, his poetry. Difficult to understand because of the mixture of modern and archaic Marathi and Sanskrit that he used, it was the medium to which he turned to express the gamut of his emotional and political life. As such it is a crucial archive.   In his ballads we see the genre used to both teach the bare facts of history and awaken a slumbering masculine community into action. In this seminar, I will address how one might expand the boundaries of Indian intellectual history by taking seriously Savarkar\u2019s poetry as the archive of a popular conception of history at a cusp moment at the turn of the 20th century.

April 29, 2014: &quot;Women\u2019s Groups in East Germany \u2013 Knitting Groups, Feminists, Troublemakers?&quot; (Susanne Kranz, Zayed University, Dubai)            Abstract:   This talk explores the autonomous women\u2019s group Frauen f\u00fcr den Frieden (Women for Peace) that was founded in 1982 in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), a state that, in 1972, had officially declared gender equality as achieved, making all women\u2019s groups redundant. It investigates the reasons behind the foundation of the group as well as its functioning and its rather quick decline.   One reason for the establishment of an autonomous women\u2019s group was the ratification of a new military law that specified the draft of women into the military service in case of a national emergency. Opinions and views about ideology, religion and politics represented minor matters within the group yet they played a decisive role in the weakening of the group which was further facilitated by the infiltration of the organization by the Stasi.   The talk offers new insights into an important oppositional group challenging the state\u2019s power that was established as a women\u2019s organization without explicit women\u2019s issues on their agenda.

May 13, 2014: &quot;The Greek War of Independence and the Birth of the Clash of Civilizations Theory, 1821-1830&quot; (Karine Walther, School of Foreign Service in Qatar, Georgetown University)            Abstract:     Despite his claims to originality, the logical underpinnings of Samuel Huntington\u2019s theory of a &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; were embedded in the national identity of the United States as a young republic and played an influential role in shaping its relations with the wider world. This talk focuses on one specific moment in diplomatic history to illustrate the power of these \u201ccivilizational\u201d designations in shaping American foreign policy discourse in the early nineteenth century: the American response to the Greek War for Independence.   Coming forty-five years after its own independence and twenty-five years after the Barbary Wars, Americans stood at rapt attention as they witnessed what they understood as a Christian nation fighting for democracy and freedom from its Muslim oppressors. Between 1821 and 1828, thousands of Americans, led by religious organizations, philhellenes, journalists, academics, and political leaders, came together to urge the US government to act on behalf of the Greeks.   Although intervention posed no pragmatic or economic advantages to the United States, many Americans nonetheless lobbied for official involvement and privately organized to aid the Greeks.The discourse that emerged around these efforts revealed the importance of ideological, religious and cultural motivations in shaping American attitudes towards foreign policy.   This talk demonstrates that the rhetoric of intervention brought together civilizational categories that merged religious identity, enlightenment thought, and modernity with the mythos of Ancient Greece as the birthplace of Western Enlightenment thought, echoing Huntington\u2019s later arguments about a so-called \u201cclash\u201d between Islam and the West.

They weren\u2019t. Having earlier seized control of the vessel and slaughtered most of the crew, they were staging an elaborate ruse, acting as if they were humble servants. When Delano, an idealistic, anti-slavery republican, finally realized the deception, he responded with explosive violence.   Drawing on research on four continents, the talk explores the multiple forces that culminated in this extraordinary event\u2014an event that already inspired Herman Melville\u2019s masterpiece Benito Cereno. Through the lens of the dramatic happenings of that day, the talk will map a new transnational history of freedom and slavery in the Americas, capturing the clash of peoples, economies, and faiths that was the New World in the early 1800s.

It offers portrait of America in the early 1950s, using the widespread panic over polio to shed light on national obsessions and fears. Drawing on newly available papers of Jonas Salk, Albert Sabin and other key players, it paints a portrait of the race for the cure, weaving a dramatic tale centered on the furious rivalry between Salk and Sabin.     As backdrop to these competitive research endeavors, the talk will also explore the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which was founded in the 1930s by FDR and Basil O'Connor. The National Foundation revolutionized fundraising and the perception of disease in America, using &quot;poster children&quot; and the famous March of Dimes to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from a vast army of contributors (instead of a few well-heeled benefactors), creating the largest research and rehabilitation network in the history of medicine.

October 1, 2013: &quot;An Explosion of the Political: Revisiting the Meerut Conspiracy Case in Colonial India&quot; (Manu Goswami, NYU)            Abstract:   The talk is based on a larger project on colonial internationalisms in the interwar era. It centers on the stakes and significance of an infamous legal trial in late colonial India, the Meerut Conspiracy Case, brought against Indian and British trade-union leaders, communists, socialists, and workers in the late-1920s and early 1930s. The trial stands out not only for its overt procedural violations of a much heralded colonial liberal order. It significance lie not only in the fact that it was the first criminal trial that prosecuted British and Indian subjects as juridically equal, abrogating a long-standing 'rule of colonial difference'. It was the first juridical reckoning by British imperial authorities with communism as an idea and movement, anticipating later cold-war era anti-communist discourse. By treating the depositions as an example and source of an intellectual history in extremis, the talk emphasizes the novelty and heterogeneity of early communism.

October 29, 2013: &quot;Why is the UAE a Federation?&quot; (Frauke Heard-Bey, Abu Dhabi)            Abstract:   Over centuries the role of religion prohibited the area\u2019s integration into \u2018Ibadhi Oman. Tribal allegiances at times promoted at other times inhibited the formation of a larger political unit on the territory of the modern UAE. The exploitation of geographically-conditioned diverse economic resources re-enforced the tribal differences. However, it was the nature of the engagement of the various coastal tribal chiefs with an outside power, the British in India, which laid the foundations for the UAE\u2019s federal political system.

However, its port cities have played a major role both as maritime routes and in the imaginery and representation of space, as it is attested in early modern maps.   This presentation will deal with Africa in the cartographic imagination of the early modern period and will refer also to theoretical aspects of the role of Africa in global history.

French officials developed a new justification for territorial conquest by which France could claim \u201cjust indemnities\u201d for its efforts fighting tyranny and to improve its strategic position as the defender of the rights of man.     Although many accused France of chauvinistic expansion when it annexed the left bank of the Rhine, this was therefore anything but a return the ancien r\u00e9gime legal status quo. It was, rather, a unique synthesis in international law of a devotion to popular government, republican ideology, and France's geostrategic interests.   Bio:   Edward Kolla is an Assistant Professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in Qatar. He specializes in European political, diplomatic, cultural, and legal history. He is currently preparing a book manuscript on the impact and effect of the French Revolution on international law, specifically tracing the emergence of popular sovereignty as a justification for claims to territory.                                 December 15, 2013: &quot;Civilizations, Empires and World Order during the Long 19th Century, 1750-1924: A Peculiar Muslim Experience?&quot; (Cemil Aydin, UNC)            Abstract:   The political experiences of many Muslims societies during the long 19th century societies do not reflect any simple grand narrative of transition from the age of empires to a period of nationalism. Muslim intellectuals were critical of European imperial hegemony but they were not necessarily against the idea of an empire. It was not ethnic nationalism, but transnational Islamic modernism and pro-Ottoman discourses that seemed dominant in late 19th century Muslim intellectual networks.     Moreover, the aftermath of WWI did not symbolize a turning point for decolonization, but attempts at further colonization of Muslim societies and the shock of the abolishment of caliphate. Modern Muslim thought does not fit into Arnold Toynbee\u2019s civilizational world history narratives (or Samuel Huntington\u2019s Clash of Civilization thesis) either.     This seminar talk suggest that a new world history methodology can help us overcome the contradictions in the national, imperial and civilizational approaches to the long 19th century political history of Muslim societies by historicizing and contextualizing the politics of the long 19th century global \u201cMuslim world\u201d identity.
