At the same time, we are experiencing clear deficits within centralized institutions of government and civil society: deficits of agility, innovation and capacity.

New technology makes collaborative problem solving possible. In this course, we explore how we might use technology -- from big data to social media -- to redesign our systems of governance to devolve power from centralized, hierarchical institutions and evolve more robust collaboration among individuals, groups and institutions including government and the media.

A Citizen&rsquo;s Perspective on Democratic Accountability in Modern Governance    Co-sponsored by NYU Wagner, NYU&rsquo;s Office of the Provost, and The Marian B. and Jacob K. Javits Foundation       Date: Monday, May 4, 2015    Time: 5:30pm - 6:30pm Lecture | 6:30pm - 7:30pm Reception    Location: Lipton Hall | 108 West 3rd Street, NYC       Anthony M. Bertelli , NYU Wagner Professor of the Politics of Public Policy and Vice Dean for Academic Affairs and Research, will discuss when and why accountability, an important but elusive democratic value, works from a citizen&rsquo;s perspective. In the landscape of contemporary governance, it is often difficult for citizens to answer two essential questions: Who is bringing the benefit of policies to the citizen? What are they doing in the process? Popular accountability rests on those questions, and their answers have important incentives for the politicians who represent us.       About the Jacob K. Javits Visiting Professorship:   The Jacob K. Javits Visiting Professorship at NYU was established in 2008 with generous support from The Marian B. and Jacob K. Javits Foundation and its President and Chief Executive Officer, Marian B. Javits. The Professorship honors the memory and accomplishments of the four-term U.S. Republican Senator from New York, the late Honorable Jacob K. Javits, an alumnus of the NYU School of Law, and perpetuates the values and intellectual integrity for which he stood. The Visiting Professorship is awarded to a distinguished individual&mdash;an academic, lawyer, policymaker, journalist, historian, philosopher, or former elected official&mdash;whose work focuses on an issue close to the Senator&rsquo;s interests. These areas include: health, civil rights, labor, foreign policy, rights of handicapped individuals, education, and fairness in employment and economic security for working Americans.

State government is commonly described as &ldquo;systematically corrupt&rdquo; and &ldquo;dysfunctional,&rdquo; and charges against elected officials are cited as evidence of a broader breakdown of ethical and political standards. Increasingly, attention has turned to how underlying structural and institutional issues impede the State&#39;s progress. Improving governance in Albany is critical, as we depend on State government to address a set of serious issues affecting New Yorkers.         Can Albany move forward despite recent allegations of corruption and governance challenges?         Join us for an engaging day with a broad range of experts&mdash;including elected officials, nonprofit leaders, advocates, and journalists&mdash;who understand the structures, politics, values, and motivations that exist within New York State government. The panelists will engage in a grounded, nonpartisan, honest conversation about how governance in Albany can be improved from a legal, ethical, and institutional perspective.         Lunch will be served.           Hosts:      Richard Brodsky , Senior Fellow, NYU Robert F.

Focusing on the expansion of bureaucratic regulatory authority in late nineteenth century America, DeCanio&rsquo;s exhaustive archival research examines electoral politics, the Treasury Department&rsquo;s control over monetary policy, and the Interstate Commerce Commission&rsquo;s regulation of railroads, to examine how conservative politicians created a new type of bureaucratic state to insulate policy decisions from popular control.          Speaker:       Samuel DeCanio, Assistant Professor of Political Science and Resident Fellow of the Institution for Social and Policy Studies, Yale University      Dr. DeCanio studies American politics, focusing on American political development, democratic theory, representation, state formation, regulatory policy, and public opinion. He is the author of Democracy and the Origins of the American Regulatory State (forthcoming, Yale University Press), which examines popular control over the creation of the American regulatory state. His current research focuses on questions involving state formation, democratic theory, American progressivism, and how high levels of voter ignorance influence domestic and international politics. His articles have appeared in the American Journal of Political Science, Critical Review, Journal of Politics, Party Politics, and Studies in American Political Development.

This is accomplished by aligning private investment with social objectives, and has been used to address a variety of social issues including criminal recidivism, early childhood education, and family homelessness.      The Pay for Success Panel will bring together various stakeholders involved in the creation and implementation of Pay For Success projects to discuss their roles and experience. Confirmed panelists include: Dana Archer-Rosenthal, Pay for Success Program Manager at Nonprofit Finance Fund and Hanna Azemati, Director of Social Innovation Financing at New York State.

It is in community that we need to discuss our roles as public servants, and the power we have to create a positive impact in society. This conversation will be facilitated by Wagner students who feel it is important to have space to reflect.

This first meeting will focus on the ramifications of the Arab Uprisings.      The 2010 Tunisian protests that ousted then-President Ben Ali have since led to a new socio-democratic order that is neither secularist nor Islamic, all without Western intervention. But uprisings in other nations face ongoing political turmoil or devastating warfare, where violent forces of resistance have mobilized against foreign-backed calls for reform. Are old regimes living on borrowed time? Will the continued struggle for their demise give way to legitimate, stable governance in the region? \u200b            Add to Your Calendar    Add to Calendar/Outlook              Tweet                                     In Conversation with Julian Zelizer                In Conversation with Julian Zelizer            In Conversation with Julian Zelizer    Sponsored by The Tamiment Library, the John Brademas Center, and NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service       Date: Wednesday January 28    Time: 6:00pm - 7:30pm    Location: NYU Wagner, 295 Lafayette Street, 2nd Floor, NYC       The Rudin Family Forum for Civic Dialogue                          Please join us for &quot;In Conversation with Julian Zelizer.&quot; A Professor of History and Public Affairs at Princeton, Zelizer will be discussing his newly released book, The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Societ y.
