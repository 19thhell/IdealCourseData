Operational excellence is the key driver to performance in a world that is increasingly driven by information.    Operations management provides the tools to analyze, improve and position a firm's operations to achieve the best fit with the firm's competitive strategy, marketing priorities and financial constraints. It provides a link to strategy and its successful execution. It makes available metrics for managing businesses, such as, six sigma quality, order to delivery cycle, inventory turns, and capacity utilization.    Information technologies continually redefine possible business models and operations across industries, creating new markets, channels and spaces of interaction. They are an integral part of developing new products, designing new organizations, managing customer relationships, and in achieving operational excellence.    A specialization in management of technology and operations enables you to think about technology-enabled business models, and the alignment of information technology and operations with corporate strategy. Decisions about investments in IT and the design of operations have far reaching consequences for development of products and services, managing customers, and achieving operational excellence. Courses in this specialization will provide you with the following capabilities:     Linking the success and valuation of organizations with the effective design and management of its information technology assets, data and operations.    Aligning operations strategy and information technology with business models and understanding how to make investment decisions regarding information technology and operations.    Crafting operations and information technology strategies to exploit emerging opportunities enabled by digital convergence and the increasingly electronic nature of all aspects of business.    This specialization is especially suitable for careers in Consulting, Financial Services, Management of Information Technology, and Operations. Due to the extent to which the internet fuels new information technology-based opportunities, the specialization is also valuable for entrepreneurs.

Operational excellence is the key driver to performance in a world that is increasingly driven by information.    Operations management provides the tools to analyze, improve and position a firm's operations to achieve the best fit with the firm's competitive strategy, marketing priorities and financial constraints. It provides a link to strategy and its successful execution. It makes available metrics for managing businesses, such as, six sigma quality, order to delivery cycle, inventory turns, and capacity utilization.    Information technologies continually redefine possible business models and operations across industries, creating new markets, channels and spaces of interaction. They are an integral part of developing new products, designing new organizations, managing customer relationships, and in achieving operational excellence.    A specialization in management of technology and operations enables you to think about technology-enabled business models, and the alignment of information technology and operations with corporate strategy. Decisions about investments in IT and the design of operations have far reaching consequences for development of products and services, managing customers, and achieving operational excellence. Courses in this specialization will provide you with the following capabilities:     Linking the success and valuation of organizations with the effective design and management of its information technology assets, data and operations.    Aligning operations strategy and information technology with business models and understanding how to make investment decisions regarding information technology and operations.    Crafting operations and information technology strategies to exploit emerging opportunities enabled by digital convergence and the increasingly electronic nature of all aspects of business.    This specialization is especially suitable for careers in Consulting, Financial Services, Management of Information Technology, and Operations. Due to the extent to which the internet fuels new information technology-based opportunities, the specialization is also valuable for entrepreneurs.
