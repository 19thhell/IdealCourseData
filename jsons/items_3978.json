Prior to arriving at NYU, she was an ACLS New Faculty Fellow at the University of California-Santa Barbara with a joint appointment in the Departments of English and Theater/Dance. Her current book project, The People\u2019s Passion: Staging the Vernacular Passion Plays of Medieval Europe , will be the first comprehensive comparative study of the vernacular Passion plays, one of the most important elements of medieval theatre. Jesse is also beginning work on her second project, Global Moralities: Staging Morality Plays throughout the Medieval World . Global Moralities will break new ground by moving beyond the confines of Western European Christianity to analyze medieval morality plays from a global perspective. Jesse's award-winning article, \u201cThe Politics of Mysticism: Elisabeth of Spalbeek in Context,\u201d appeared in the refereed journal Church History and is the first full historical study of Elisabeth, a mid-thirteenth-century female performer of Christ\u2019s passion. Jesse has also published in Theatre Journal (on medieval acting) and in Fifteenth-Century Studies (on the importance of Englishwoman Margery Kempe to the study of theatrical spectatorship). Jesse's essay comparing the staging techniques of medieval pageants depicting the Last Supper will be included in the collection Culinary Theatres edited by Dorothy Chansky and Ann White.
