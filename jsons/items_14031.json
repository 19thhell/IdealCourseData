Atoms are basic building blocks     of matter, and cannot be chemically subdivided by ordinary means.             The word atom is derived from the Greek word atom which     means indivisible. The Greeks concluded that matter could be broken     down into particles to small to be seen. These particles were called      atoms             Atoms are composed of three type of particles: protons, neutrons,     and electron. Protons and neutrons are responsible for most of the atomic     mass e.g in a 150 person 149 lbs, 15 oz are protons and neutrons while     only 1 oz. is electrons. The mass of an electron is very small (9.108     X 10 -28 grams).    Both the protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus. Protons have     a postive (+) charge, neutrons have no charge --they are neutral. Electrons     reside in orbitals around the nucleus. They have a negative charge (-).     It is the number of protons that determines the atomic number, e.g.,     H = 1. The number of protons in an element is constant (e.g., H=1, Ur=92)     but neutron number may vary, so mass number (protons + neutrons) may     vary.     The same element may contain varying numbers of neutrons; these forms     of an element are called isotopes. The chemical properties of isotopes     are the same, although the physical properties of some isotopes may     be different. Some isotopes are radioactive-meaning they &quot;radiate&quot;     energy as they decay to a more stable form, perhaps another element     half-life: time required for half of the atoms of an element to decay     into stable form. Another example is oxygen, with atomic number of 8     can have 8, 9, or 10 neutrons.         What are elements?     All matter is made up of elements which are fundamental substances     which cannot be broken down by chemical means. There are 92 elements     that occur naturally. The elements hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen     are the elements that make up most living organisms. Some other elements     found in living organisms are: magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, sodium,     potassium.     By the late 1800's many elements had already been discovered. The scientist     Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, proposed an arrangement of know     elements based on their atomic mass. The modern arrangement of the elements     is known as the Periodic Table of Elements and is arranged according     to the atomic number of elements.              Here is an Interactive Table     of Elements where you can learn more about each of the elements.             What makes each element unique?  Every atom would like     to have an electron configuration like a noble gases. In noble gases     the outer electron shell is complete. This makes the element chemically     inert. Helium is an example of a noble (inert) gas. It is not present     in organisms because it is not chemically reactive.             Historical Models of the atom         BOHR MODEL    Bohr model shows electrons circling the nucleus at different levels     or orbitals much like planets circle the sun. Electrons move from one     energy state to another but can only exist aft defineite energy levels.     The energy absorbed or released when electrons change states is in the     form of electromagnetic radiation.         THE WAVE MODEL AND QUANTUM THEORY     The Bohr model was only able to explain the very simplest atoms, like     hydrogen. Today's modern day theory is based on mathematics and the     properties of waves. The wave model forms the basis for the     Quantum Theory     . This theory gives the probability of locating electrons in a particular     location, unlike assuming electrons orbit the nucleus as in the Bohr     model.             How are electrons organized around the nucleus?         All atoms would like to attain electron configurations like noble     gases. That is, have completed outer shells. Atoms can form stable electron     configurations like noble gases     by:         losing electrons     sharing electrons     gaining electrons.         For a stable configuration each atom must fill its outer energy level.     In the case of noble gases that means eight electrons in the last     shell (with the exception of He which has two electrons).     Atoms that have 1, 2 or 3 electrons in their outer levels will tend     to lose them in interactions with atoms that have 5, 6 or 7 electrons     in their outer levels. Atoms that have 5, 6 or 7 electrons in their     outer levels will tend to gain electrons from atoms with 1, 2 or 3 electrons     in their outer levels. Atoms that have 4 electrons in the outer most     energy level will tend neither to totally lose nor totally gain electrons     during interactions.     This     Periodic Table of Elements will show you the electron configuration     for any element you click on.         Visualizing Atomic Orbitals             The atomic orbitals of the hydrogen atom can be visualized as a cloud     around the nucleus. The orbital represents a probability of finding     the electron at a particular location. Darker regions signify a greater     probability. Shown below are the 1s (lowest orbital and the 2s orbital.             1s 2s        Atomic orbitals do not always have the shape of a sphere. Higher orbitals     have very unusual shapes.              2px 3px               These orbitals were prepared by Dr. Yue-Ling Wong from the University    of Florida for more images click    here.
