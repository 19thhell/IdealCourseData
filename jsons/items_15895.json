This 8-week course is open to all NYU undergraduate students, facilitated by graduate students or NYU professionals, and takes place in the Fall and Spring semester.   The IGD model is designed to promote positive intergroup relations among students, staff, and faculty and improve the campus climate at NYU. The model focuses specifically on intergroup dynamics within the context of an institution of higher education while promoting awareness and change in intergroup relations at the individual, cultural, and institutional levels. The guiding assumption is that diversity is an institutional asset and can be used to enhance growth of the NYU community while also achieving specific educational outcomes.   Past IGD sections include: Race, Gender, Bi/Multiracial, Spirituality, Sexuality, Jewish/Muslim, Arts based Race, Faith and Sexuality, and Jewish/Black.
