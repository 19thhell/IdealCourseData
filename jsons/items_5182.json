Through supportive networking, public education, and collective initiatives, WoCC seeks to advance the needs of women of color and thereby enrich the educational experience at the law school.   Our Goals   We believe that WoCC can serve as a critical resource to the law school community in the following ways:   Support/Mentorship : Facilitating monthly meetings for group discussion of critical issues and/or social events to promote interaction and mentorship between women of color at the law school; organizing events involving women of color alums/professionals to facilitate mentorship between students and current professionals   Education : Planning annual or biannual symposia open to the Law School on current topics relevant to the experience of women of color \u2013 specific either to the legal community or to women of color generally   Activism : Working with existing student groups to increase faculty of color recruitment and student of color admissions, to incorporate critical perspectives into class discussions, and to expand course offerings                                                  Facebook   Twitter   YouTube   Instagram   Visitor Information   Directories   Offices and Departments   Site Map   NYU School of Law                   Prospective Info   Admissions (JD) Admissions (LLM/JSD) Areas of Study Degrees Offered Faculty Profiles Campus Map  Academics   Academic Sitemap Course Descriptions Class Schedules NYU Classes Clinics Academic Calendars  Departments   Academic Services Career Services Financial Aid Graduate Affairs (LLM) Hospitality and Events Housing Human Resources Library Operations and Facilities Records and Registration Student Affairs  Tools and Resources   About the Law School Campus Map Directories Law School News Journals Picture Book                      \u00a9 2015 New York University School of Law. 40 Washington Sq.
