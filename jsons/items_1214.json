Rather than focusing exclusively on film adaptations  of texts, the course treats the problems of film, novels and theater as a  literary phenomenon. While French film plays a key part in the structure of the  course, the films to be shown and the reading assigned reflect a wider  international spectrum. There will be emphasis on the connection between  different cultures in different time frames, and stress will also be placed on  works that have a special relationship with the concerns of humanity.          The  course is interdisciplinary and uses critical methods pertinent to the media  involved. Its juxtaposition of one of the most important art forms of the 20 th   century against literature serves the needs of a contemporary liberal education  and aims to lead the student to question assumptions about both cinema and  literature. Films to be shown:     Fritz Lang's Metropolis , an  exploration of a silent masterpiece and its visual effects in relationship to  literature concerning oppression under industrialization and society's social  structure.      Alain Resnais's Hiroshima mon amour ,  among the influential New Wave films and closely related artistically to the  characteristics of the New Novel, as well as a film that entwines personal  relationships with moral questions.       Richard Boleslawski's Les Miserables ,  the classic 1935 film based on Victor Hugo's masterpiece of 19 th   century French literature that has also been adapted for musical theater.       Euzhan Palcy's Sugar Cane Alley (Rue  case Negres), a powerful drama set in 1931 and revealing the family life  and struggle of black plantation workers in Martinique during the 1930s. Based  on a novel by Joseph Zobel.       Luchino Visconti's Death in Venice, the  great Italian director's adaptation of Thomas Mann's internationally acclaimed  work and a study of the challenge for film to capture literary metaphor.       Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451, a  dramatic expression of humankind's quest for the preservation of intellectual  freedom in the face of repression. An important film selected from the works of  France's influential New Wave  director.

Rather than focusing exclusively on film adaptations  of texts, the course treats the problems of film, novels and theater as a  literary phenomenon. While French film plays a key part in the structure of the  course, the films to be shown and the reading assigned reflect a wider  international spectrum. There will be emphasis on the connection between  different cultures in different time frames, and stress will also be placed on  works that have a special relationship with the concerns of humanity.          The  course is interdisciplinary and uses critical methods pertinent to the media  involved. Its juxtaposition of one of the most important art forms of the 20 th   century against literature serves the needs of a contemporary liberal education  and aims to lead the student to question assumptions about both cinema and  literature. Films to be shown:     Fritz Lang's Metropolis , an  exploration of a silent masterpiece and its visual effects in relationship to  literature concerning oppression under industrialization and society's social  structure.      Alain Resnais's Hiroshima mon amour ,  among the influential New Wave films and closely related artistically to the  characteristics of the New Novel, as well as a film that entwines personal  relationships with moral questions.       Richard Boleslawski's Les Miserables ,  the classic 1935 film based on Victor Hugo's masterpiece of 19 th   century French literature that has also been adapted for musical theater.       Euzhan Palcy's Sugar Cane Alley (Rue  case Negres), a powerful drama set in 1931 and revealing the family life  and struggle of black plantation workers in Martinique during the 1930s. Based  on a novel by Joseph Zobel.       Luchino Visconti's Death in Venice, the  great Italian director's adaptation of Thomas Mann's internationally acclaimed  work and a study of the challenge for film to capture literary metaphor.       Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451, a  dramatic expression of humankind's quest for the preservation of intellectual  freedom in the face of repression. An important film selected from the works of  France's influential New Wave  director.

His works allow us to rethink the traditional   relationship between the author and the reader. For my research, I have   selected texts by Artaud in which the suspension of interpretation is   particularly blatant. By analyzing these different experiences of   reading, I demonstrate how the closure of interpretation takes place,   allowing to theorize a non-hermeneutical reading. Research Interests: 20th   century literature and poetry, literary theory &amp; theories of   reading, intersection of literature and philosophy, the sacred,   epistolary writing, literary reviews.
