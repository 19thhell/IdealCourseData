The faculty have active research laboratories located primarily on the \u201csuperblock\u201d of the NYU Langone Medical Center, but are also located in adjacent buildings and on the Washington Square campus. Along with their research pursuits, the faculty are also engaged in the instruction of medical and graduate students. The teaching expertise of departmental faculty ranges from molecular mechanisms in biochemistry and pharmacology, to advanced topics in genetics, neurobiology, and signal transduction and receptor biology.
