Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast, and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world's largest cities. As a result, the world's natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative, this course is being offered simultaneously in New York and Abu Dhabi, and students collaborate extensively with students from their sister campus through the duration of this course.

We will review recent peer-reviewed marine ecology studies as well as popular articles and the trade book, Ocean of Life, to familiarize ourselves with the latest research. The first half of the course focuses more on basic ecology while the second half focuses more on anthropogenic impacts, e.g., overexploitation, pollution, invasive species, and climate change, and proposed and tested solutions. New York Underground ENVST-UA 327 Prerequisite: Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100). 4 points. Every day, millions of people walk the streets of New York City. But what is happening below those city streets? This is an environmental science seminar that will investigate the life and resources underneath NYC. The course is divided into four main sections: water, energy, transportation, and biology. Over the course of the semester, we will discuss the mechanics, the history and the significance of the infrastructure and explore the biotic components of this unique and fascinating subterranean environment. This is a seminar course and there will be also be field trips scheduled throughout the semester. Students will also investigate these habitats while learning through hands-on research methods. Evidence Based Conservation ENVST-UA 330. Prerequisite: Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100). 4 points. This seminar is encouraged for students interested in learning more about the science of environmental problem-solving. The course begins with an overview the major drivers of planetary change. These problems reveal the enormity of the challenges facing environmental policy makers, conservation practitioners, and citizens. We will discuss the importance of this research, but then quickly move to the science of environmental problem-solving, starting with the rise of evidence-based conservation. This course moves beyond environmental obituaries and into the realm of available remedies, creative problem solving, and interdisciplinary research. Students will also be asked to design, implement, and measure the effectiveness of their own conservation project, as well as present the results to the class at the end of the term. In this way, the course encourages implementing the skills and ideas learned in class.    Current Topics in Earth System Science: Mass Extinctions, Geologic Processes, and Evolution   ENVST-UA 332 Identical to BIOL-UA 332. Prerequisites: Earth System Science (ENVST-UA 340) or Evolution of the Earth (ENVST-UA 210), and permission of the instructor. Offered in the spring. Rampino. 4 points.   Scientific discovery is an ongoing process, and important new findings relevant to earth system science and the evolution of life are continually reported in scientific journals. For each new scientific discovery, students read, discuss, and report on original recent journal articles (as well as articles that take conflicting views) and texts that review the subject matter as already known. The goal is to give students an understanding of the dynamic nature of scientific knowledge and a deeper understanding of current questions in earth system science and biological evolution.    Limits of the Earth: Issues in Human Ecology   ENVST-UA 333 Prerequisite: Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100). Volk. 4 points.   The growing intensity of the interaction between humanity and the natural systems of earth is leading us to a future in which we must better understand the dynamics of nature's life-support systems and the past, present, and future of our dependency on those systems. Topics covered include energy, agriculture, water, population, consumption and waste production, and indicators of sustainability. This is an inquiry-based course. There are overviews of the main topics and then student-initiated investigations of specific, focused aspects of those topics.    Earth System Science   ENVST-UA 340 Formerly ENVST-UA 200. Offered in the fall. Rampino. 4 points.   Examines our current view of the earth, in its cosmic setting, as a system involving interactions among the atmosphere, oceans, solid earth, and life. Emphasis is placed on the dynamics and evolution of these systems over time and predictions for the future. The subject matter includes new observations from space; geophysics and plate tectonics; the circulation of the oceans and atmosphere; cycles of elements essential for life; the coevolution of climate and life on earth over the past 4,500 million years; and the Gaia hypothesis. Emphasis on current global environmental problems, such as the greenhouse effect from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and other gases, the effects of deforestation, and the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer.    The Global Carbon Cycle   ENVST-UA 345 Prerequisite: Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100). Killilea, Volk. 4 points.   The most colossal environmental perturbation in human history is in the air: CO2 is rising. This course provides a look at fossil-fuel-generated CO2 and the carbon cycle that is both detailed and big-picture in scope. We examine the dynamics of marine and terrestrial ecosystems, the circulation of atmosphere and ocean, and the soil. To project the future of atmospheric CO2, we also examine relationships among wealth, energy use, and CO2 emissions and explore how the emissions are tied to the present and future trends of the global economy. This is an inquiry-based course. Students work on a number of projects, both computational and descriptive.    Energy and the Environment   ENVST-UA 350 Prerequisite: Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100). Offered in the spring. Rugg, Soter. 4 points.

An introduction to life-cycle cost estimation is included, and associated environmental-impact calculations for energy systems are presented.    Fundamental Dynamics of Earth's Atmosphere and Climate   ENVST-UA 360 Identical to MATH-UA 228. Prerequisite: Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or equivalent with a B- or higher. Recommended: General Physics I (PHYS-UA 11). Smith. 4 points.   An introduction to the dynamical processes that drive the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean, and their interaction. This is the core of climate science. Lectures are guided by consideration of observations and experiments, but the goal is to develop an understanding of the unifying principles of planetary fluid dynamics. Topics include the global energy balance, convection and radiation (the greenhouse effect), effects of planetary rotation (the Coriolis force), structure of the atmospheric circulation (the Hadley cell and wind patterns), structure of the oceanic circulation (wind-driven currents and the thermohaline circulation), and climate and climate variability (including El Nino and anthropogenic warming).    Biogeochemistry of Global Change   ENVST-UA 370 Identical to BIOL-UA 66. Prerequisite: Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100), or Principles of Biology I (BIOL-UA 11 or BIOL-UA 13 [Honors] or BIOL-UA 9011 [London]) and Principles of Biology II (BIOL-UA 12 or BIOL-UA 14 [Honors] or BIOL-UA 9012 [London]), or permission of the instructor. Killilea. 4 points.   Biogeochemistry is the study of biological controls on the chemistry of the environment and geochemical regulation of ecological structure and function. This course introduces the fundamental principles of biogeochemistry. Additionally, we utilize the scientific literature from peer-reviewed journals to explore specific case studies on the global change of biogeochemistry (e.g., acid precipitation, nitrogen deposition, eutrophication of the oceans) from the field of biogeochemistry.    At the Bench: Ecological Analysis with Geographical Information Systems   ENVST-UA 372 Identical to BIOL-UA 64. Prerequisite: Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100), or Principles of Biology I (BIOL-UA 11 or BIOL-UA 13 [Honors] or BIOL-UA 9011 [London]) and Principles of Biology II (BIOL-UA 12 or BIOL-UA 14 [Honors] or BIOL-UA 9012 [London]), or permission of the instructor. Killilea. 4 points.   Being able to organize and analyze ecological data is an essential research tool. Geographic information systems (GIS) are computerized systems for the capture, storage, management, analysis, and display of geographically referenced data and their attributes. Students learn the basic principles and applications of GIS, including coordinate systems, data transformations, spatial analysis, and accuracy assessment. Laboratory exercises use ecological data and examples to provide extensive hands-on experience with ArcGIS, a professional GIS software package.    Special Topics: Introduction to Fluid Dynamics ENVST-UA 380 Identical to PHYS-UA 800. Prerequisites: Physics I (PHYS-UA 91) and Physics II (PHYS-UA 93) and Physics III (PHYS-UA 95) and Mathematical Physics (PHYS-UA 106). Zwanziger. 4 points. Fluid dynamics is a fundamental branch of physics. Interest in this subject has increased of late, as environmental and climate issues become more pressing. The main emphasis will be on the basic principles of fluid dynamics. Prepares students for work in any of the varied fields where fluid dynamics is important, such as astrophysics, ocean-atmosphere science, blood flow, aerodynamics and many others. Ethics and the Environment   ENVST-UA 400 Identical to PHIL-UA 53. Offered in the fall. Jamieson. 4 points.   Environmental philosophy is a large subject that involves questions in metaphysics, the philosophy of science, and the history of philosophy, as well as in such normative areas as ethics, aesthetics, and political philosophy. This course is primarily devoted to these normative areas. Beginning with some basic concepts in value theory, the goal is not to arrive at definite solutions to specific environmental problems, but rather to improve students' ability to think critically, read closely, and argue well about environmental issues. The course also introduces students to some major controversies in environmental philosophy. The ultimate aim is to aid students in arriving at their own rational, clear-minded views about the matters under discussion. Climate Change and Environmental Justice ENVST-UA 405 Identical to SCA-UA 632. Ross. 4 points. Introduces students to the basic approaches to climate change, through readings from climatologists, economists, anthropologists, geographers, cultural analysts, and activists of various stripes. Consideration is given to the \u201cdebate\u201d about climate change that has been generated by deniers and advocates for the fossil fuel industries. The context for discussing the natural and social impact of global warming is further defined by examining the principles of climate justice. Modeled on the American-derived principles of environmental justice in the 1990s, the climate justice movement poses a legal and humanitarian challenge to champions of \u201cnatural capitalism\u201d who place their faith in market-driven solutions. Students look at how populations are unevenly affected by climate change, and how this imbalance is being addressed by a range of advocates of decarbonization. Economics and the Environment   ENVST-UA 410 Offered in the spring. Damon. 4 points.   Students study how the earth's scarce resources are allocated by individuals and society, and how economic tools can contribute toward solutions to environmental challenges. Broad concepts considered include market failure; sustainability; valuation of social benefits provided by the environment; estimating social costs and benefits of alternate environmental policies; determining desirable levels of pollution control and choosing policies to achieve it; and managing natural resources, both renewable (e.g., forests, fisheries, and water) and nonrenewable (e.g., oil and minerals). The course format consists of lectures, discussions, and group projects. Cooperation &amp; the Commons. ENVST-UA 412 Prerequisite: Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100). 4 points. Why do littered environments encourage people to litter more? Why do people who see they are using less energy than average often start using more? Why was the global ban on ozone-harming CFCs successful, while the Kyoto Protocol to curb greenhouse gas emissions a failure? This course examines the tragedy of the commons, with particular emphasis on environmental problems, as well as the various means to cooperate and overcome the tragedy, with particular emphasis on research into human behavior. The first half of the course focuses on theory and makes students familiar with some of the foundational literature in cooperation research while the second half focuses on applied research, as well as how to change social norms. To better understand behavioral phenomena and answer how humans share and consume resources, we will review some of the latest studies in evolutionary biology, experimental economics, and psychology. We will also turn to evolutionary biology for insights into the intricacies and origins of cooperation.    Environmental History of the Early Modern World   ENVST-UA 415 Identical to HIST-UA 115. Appuhn. 4 points.   From the perspective of environmental history, the early modern period (ca. 1500\u20131800) marks a moment of sudden and unprecedented global transformation. Rising core populations created increasing demand for food and natural resources, which in turn led to major alterations to the landscape as states and individuals sought to derive greater benefits from nature. This course analyzes the ways in which this process unfolded in different parts of the world, while familiarizing students with basic problems in environmental history, including the changing human relationship to the natural world, the relationship between environmental change and human societies, and the importance of biotic exchange in world history. The course is divided into two parts. In the first part, we consider what can be called the \"Eurasian Advantage\" or \"Biological Conquest Model\" made popular by Jared Diamond. In the second part, we consider parallel developments in other parts of the world that cast doubt on this account.    Environmental History of New York City   ENVST-UA 420 Identical to HIST-UA 275. Needham. 4 points.   This course investigates topics in the environmental history of New York City from the 17th century to the present. Environmental history is a relatively new field of history that attempts to take nature and natural forces seriously as key components of historical change. Through readings, site visits, and writing assignments, the course introduces students to the field of environmental history and investigates the history of our immediate environment. As a history-department workshop, the course also introduces students to the key elements of the discipline of history: finding and reading articles, conducting research, and evaluating primary and secondary sources.    History of Ecology and Environmentalism   ENVST-UA 425 Offered in the fall. Anker. 4 points.   Students trace the history of ecology and environmentalism back to natural history collected in the 18th century. The global history of ecological concern stays at the center of this course, which discusses environmental worries in the British, German, Scandinavian, African, and American contexts in subsequent centuries. The chief focus is on more recent U.S. experience in trying to deal with pollution, asthma, and global warming, among other issues. Various ecological understandings of human philosophy, race, gender, fear, religion, sociology, and economy are subject to critical discussion. Readings include texts by scientists such as Carolus Linnaeus, Arthur Tansley, and Julian Huxley, as well as social and philosophical writings of authors such as H. G. Wells, John Muir, Jan Smuts, and Arne Naess.    Education and the Environment   ENVST-UA 430 Offered in the spring. Schlottmann. 4 points.   This course (1) discusses major topics and schools of thought in environmental education, (2) analyzes the ethical, practical, and conceptual implications of this, and (3) assesses these various approaches for clarity and practicality. Students address four primary questions: What forms does environmental education take? What values inform environmental education? What might an ethically defensible, effective form of environmental education look like? How much do concepts and arguments matter in better understanding and implementing environmental education? The course aims to advance our integrative and practical thinking about complex and multifaceted environmental topics, as well as to understand environmental values as they relate to education.    Food, Animals, and the Environment   ENVST-UA 440 Identical to ANST-UA 440. Offered in the spring. Schlottmann, Sebo. 4 points.   Students study human interaction with both food and animals, as well as the environmental impacts and ethical issues that arise from such interaction. Focus is on the moral standing of animals, animals as food, and the environmental impacts of agriculture, transportation, and consumption. The course also surveys major thinkers in the field, including Michael Pollan, Peter Singer, Jim Mason, Wendell Berry, David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Martha Nussbaum. Students engage in collaborative research projects, and we hope to schedule field trips to local agricultural sites.    Topics in Environmental Values and Society   ENVST-UA 450 (or ENVST-UA 9450 at NYU Prague, Shanghai, and Sydney) Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101) or permission of the instructor. Offered every semester. Anker, Damon, Rademacher, Sachs, Schlottmann. 4 points.   An intermediate course for students in the major or minor in environmental studies in the environmental values and society track. The aim of the course is to advance understanding of a specific topic concerning the social aspects of environmental problems. Familiarity with social aspects of environmental problems is assumed. Topics include Thinking Globally, Acting Locally; Economics and the Environment; History of Ecology and Environmentalism; Environmental Education; and Food and Animals.    European Environmental Policy   ENVST-UA 460 (or ENVST-UA 9460 at NYU Berlin) Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101). Offered in the fall at Washington Square; offered every semester at NYU Berlin. Wazeck. 4 points.   This course offers an introduction to European environmental policy. The European Union (EU) is often seen as a leader in environmental policy, and it is a major player in international environmental policy making. But how does the EU, a unique economic and political union of 27 states, actually make and implement environmental policy? In this course, we explore these questions by focusing on different aspects of European environmental policy. The first part provides a historic overview of the emergence and development of European environmental policy and law. Who are the central actors? Which institutions are involved in policy making? What are the basic regulation principles? The second part concentrates on the EU policy-making process, and on the implementation of environmental policy in the Member States. A third part deepens these aspects by discussing case studies such as the regulation of chemicals, waste management, air pollution, and GMO. A fourth part concentrates on challenges for European environmental policy and sets it into an international context: How to cope with the enlargement of the EU? What is EU Climate Change policy, and how does the European Emissions Trading System work?    Climate and Society   ENVST-UA 470 Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101). Recommended: Climate Change (ENVST-UA 226). Offered in the fall. Schlottmann. 4 points.   An intermediate environmental studies elective about how societies understand and respond to climate change. We analyze the values, assumptions, and perceptions that contribute to our understanding of climate change. The main topics are: ethics, justice and responsibility; definitions of nature; cost-benefit analysis and the precautionary principle; geo-engineering; contrarianism; framing and communication; social engagement; and education. Central questions include: Is climate change a technical or social problem? What makes climate change uniquely challenging to understand and respond to? Which ethical and perceptual frameworks are best suited for both understanding and responding to climate change? Who is responsible, and what moral implications does this have? What assumptions about values, behavior, economics, and nature do we make when discussing climate change? How does climate change challenge our conceptions of nature, morality, society, and economics? Does climate change pose a special challenge to society, or does it simply amplify existing challenges? Introduction to Urban Political Ecology Theory and Method ENVST-UA 490 Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101). Offered every semester. Rademacher. 4 points. Few aspirations hold the global promise, and political traction, of urban sustainability. While sustainability can be defined and measured through a host of metrics, its actual lived practice often proves somewhat more elusive. This reading intensive seminar explores the gap between aspirations for, and the enactment of, urban sustainability. Drawing from theories, methods, and research techniques associated with political ecology, we consider how contests over environmental knowledge, sociocultural ideology, and discourse shape human engagement with urban nature, and in turn influence social and natural transformation. After laying the theoretical groundwork for political ecological inquiry, the course turns to methodological techniques and research approaches designed to illuminate these dimensions of urban environmental change. Toward the end of the course, each student designs a research proposal that engages an environmental problem using political ecological techniques. Journalism and Society: Covering the Earth (Journalism)   ENVST-UA 503 (or ENVST-UA 9503 at NYU Sydney and NYU Washington, D.C.) Identical to JOUR-UA 503. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. Fagin. 4 points.   As Web-based platforms increasingly dominate mass media, what specific forms should the \"new\" environmental journalism take? This course traces the development of traditional environmental journalism from John Muir to John McPhee and looks closely at how the field is adapting to a fast-changing media landscape. With the help of guests and timely readings, we confront thorny questions about environmental advocacy, citizen media, issue framing, risk balancing, and the scientific process. We produce stories that matter on the biggest news beat of all. This advanced seminar includes intensive journalistic writing assignments, as well as extensive readings for in-class discussion.    Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Ecocriticism   ENVST-UA 510 (or ENVST-UA 9510 at NYU Sydney) Identical to ENGL-UA 735. Chaudhuri. 4 points.   An introduction to the emerging field of ecocriticism and an exploration of some of its main questions, issues, methods, and texts. We trace the origins and development of key tropes of ecological thought\u2014such as wilderness, pastoralism, pollution, and catastrophe\u2014in literary and cultural texts ranging from the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh to the Hollywood eco-blockbuster Avatar. We apply the lenses of environment and species to classics like Euripides' The Bacchae, Shakespeare's The Tempest, and Thoreau's Walden, as well as to works that exemplify new conjunctions between ecological thought and contemporary discourses on globalization, environmental justice, and queer theory, such as novels like Animal's People by Indra Sinha and Lives of the Animals by J. M. Coetzee, and films like Brokeback Mountain and The Yes Men Fix the World.    Animals and Society   ENVST-UA 610 Identical to ANST-UA 200 and SOC-UA 970. Jerolmack. 4 points.   Analyzes the ways that animal and human lives intersect. Specifically, this course examines how relationships with animals both reflect and shape social life, culture, and how people think about themselves. We explore the myriad and contradictory positions that animals occupy in society (e.g., as pets, pests, mascots, and food) and deconstruct the social origins of these seemingly natural categories. (After all, one society's pet is another society's dinner.) We also take a grounded look at what actually happens when humans and animals interact, which sheds new light on the nature of human and animal consciousness and troubles some of the assumptions we make about the necessary role of language and symbols in interaction. Fundamentally, students learn how the roles that animals take on in our lives, and the ways that we think about and relate to them, are inherently social processes that are patterned by geography, culture, class, gender, and so on. Central questions include: How do ideas about, and relationships to, animals vary across time and space? What roles do science, literature, and media representations play in shaping how we think about animals? How and why did pets become honorary members of the American family? Why are some animals, but not others, granted moral status and legal protection in society? How do humans and animals coordinate interaction without language?    Animals and Public Policy   ENVST-UA 630 Identical to ANST-UA 500. No prerequisites. Offered in the fall. 4 points.   Provides an overview of public policy with respect to the somewhat contradictory treatment of animals by humans, with a focus on how public policy is created and how social change occurs. We consider what public policy consists of and what actors and factors play a role in the creation of public policy; how society views animals; the capacities of animals; how ethics relates to animal treatment; how animals are currently utilized by our society; and political and other efforts to improve or alter the current treatment of animals, including the influence of science, government, business, and nongovernmental organizations in defining and influencing animal-related policies. We focus on legislation, litigation, regulation, and ballot initiative and consumer campaigns and their effectiveness, as well as other strategies that relate to improving animal welfare. We also discuss the meaning of \"animal rights\" and the success and impact of the modern animal protection movement.

Ethics and the Environment   ENVST-UA 400 Identical to PHIL-UA 53. Offered in the fall. Jamieson. 4 points.   Environmental philosophy is a large subject that involves questions in metaphysics, the philosophy of science, and the history of philosophy, as well as in such normative areas as ethics, aesthetics, and political philosophy. This course is primarily devoted to these normative areas. Beginning with some basic concepts in value theory, the goal is not to arrive at definite solutions to specific environmental problems, but rather to improve students' ability to think critically, read closely, and argue well about environmental issues. The course also introduces students to some major controversies in environmental philosophy. The ultimate aim is to aid students in arriving at their own rational, clear-minded views about the matters under discussion. Climate Change and Environmental Justice ENVST-UA 405 Identical to SCA-UA 632. Ross. 4 points. Introduces students to the basic approaches to climate change, through readings from climatologists, economists, anthropologists, geographers, cultural analysts, and activists of various stripes. Consideration is given to the \u201cdebate\u201d about climate change that has been generated by deniers and advocates for the fossil fuel industries. The context for discussing the natural and social impact of global warming is further defined by examining the principles of climate justice. Modeled on the American-derived principles of environmental justice in the 1990s, the climate justice movement poses a legal and humanitarian challenge to champions of \u201cnatural capitalism\u201d who place their faith in market-driven solutions. Students look at how populations are unevenly affected by climate change, and how this imbalance is being addressed by a range of advocates of decarbonization. Economics and the Environment   ENVST-UA 410 Offered in the spring. Damon. 4 points.   Students study how the earth's scarce resources are allocated by individuals and society, and how economic tools can contribute toward solutions to environmental challenges. Broad concepts considered include market failure; sustainability; valuation of social benefits provided by the environment; estimating social costs and benefits of alternate environmental policies; determining desirable levels of pollution control and choosing policies to achieve it; and managing natural resources, both renewable (e.g., forests, fisheries, and water) and nonrenewable (e.g., oil and minerals). The course format consists of lectures, discussions, and group projects. Cooperation &amp; the Commons. ENVST-UA 412 Prerequisite: Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100). 4 points. Why do littered environments encourage people to litter more? Why do people who see they are using less energy than average often start using more? Why was the global ban on ozone-harming CFCs successful, while the Kyoto Protocol to curb greenhouse gas emissions a failure? This course examines the tragedy of the commons, with particular emphasis on environmental problems, as well as the various means to cooperate and overcome the tragedy, with particular emphasis on research into human behavior. The first half of the course focuses on theory and makes students familiar with some of the foundational literature in cooperation research while the second half focuses on applied research, as well as how to change social norms. To better understand behavioral phenomena and answer how humans share and consume resources, we will review some of the latest studies in evolutionary biology, experimental economics, and psychology. We will also turn to evolutionary biology for insights into the intricacies and origins of cooperation.    Environmental History of the Early Modern World   ENVST-UA 415 Identical to HIST-UA 115. Appuhn. 4 points.   From the perspective of environmental history, the early modern period (ca. 1500\u20131800) marks a moment of sudden and unprecedented global transformation. Rising core populations created increasing demand for food and natural resources, which in turn led to major alterations to the landscape as states and individuals sought to derive greater benefits from nature. This course analyzes the ways in which this process unfolded in different parts of the world, while familiarizing students with basic problems in environmental history, including the changing human relationship to the natural world, the relationship between environmental change and human societies, and the importance of biotic exchange in world history. The course is divided into two parts. In the first part, we consider what can be called the \"Eurasian Advantage\" or \"Biological Conquest Model\" made popular by Jared Diamond. In the second part, we consider parallel developments in other parts of the world that cast doubt on this account.    Environmental History of New York City   ENVST-UA 420 Identical to HIST-UA 275. Needham. 4 points.   This course investigates topics in the environmental history of New York City from the 17th century to the present. Environmental history is a relatively new field of history that attempts to take nature and natural forces seriously as key components of historical change. Through readings, site visits, and writing assignments, the course introduces students to the field of environmental history and investigates the history of our immediate environment. As a history-department workshop, the course also introduces students to the key elements of the discipline of history: finding and reading articles, conducting research, and evaluating primary and secondary sources.    History of Ecology and Environmentalism   ENVST-UA 425 Offered in the fall. Anker. 4 points.   Students trace the history of ecology and environmentalism back to natural history collected in the 18th century. The global history of ecological concern stays at the center of this course, which discusses environmental worries in the British, German, Scandinavian, African, and American contexts in subsequent centuries. The chief focus is on more recent U.S. experience in trying to deal with pollution, asthma, and global warming, among other issues. Various ecological understandings of human philosophy, race, gender, fear, religion, sociology, and economy are subject to critical discussion. Readings include texts by scientists such as Carolus Linnaeus, Arthur Tansley, and Julian Huxley, as well as social and philosophical writings of authors such as H. G. Wells, John Muir, Jan Smuts, and Arne Naess.    Education and the Environment   ENVST-UA 430 Offered in the spring. Schlottmann. 4 points.   This course (1) discusses major topics and schools of thought in environmental education, (2) analyzes the ethical, practical, and conceptual implications of this, and (3) assesses these various approaches for clarity and practicality. Students address four primary questions: What forms does environmental education take? What values inform environmental education? What might an ethically defensible, effective form of environmental education look like? How much do concepts and arguments matter in better understanding and implementing environmental education? The course aims to advance our integrative and practical thinking about complex and multifaceted environmental topics, as well as to understand environmental values as they relate to education.    Food, Animals, and the Environment   ENVST-UA 440 Identical to ANST-UA 440. Offered in the spring. Schlottmann, Sebo. 4 points.   Students study human interaction with both food and animals, as well as the environmental impacts and ethical issues that arise from such interaction. Focus is on the moral standing of animals, animals as food, and the environmental impacts of agriculture, transportation, and consumption. The course also surveys major thinkers in the field, including Michael Pollan, Peter Singer, Jim Mason, Wendell Berry, David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Martha Nussbaum. Students engage in collaborative research projects, and we hope to schedule field trips to local agricultural sites.    Topics in Environmental Values and Society   ENVST-UA 450 (or ENVST-UA 9450 at NYU Prague, Shanghai, and Sydney) Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101) or permission of the instructor. Offered every semester. Anker, Damon, Rademacher, Sachs, Schlottmann. 4 points.

Topics include Thinking Globally, Acting Locally; Economics and the Environment; History of Ecology and Environmentalism; Environmental Education; and Food and Animals.    European Environmental Policy   ENVST-UA 460 (or ENVST-UA 9460 at NYU Berlin) Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101). Offered in the fall at Washington Square; offered every semester at NYU Berlin. Wazeck. 4 points.   This course offers an introduction to European environmental policy. The European Union (EU) is often seen as a leader in environmental policy, and it is a major player in international environmental policy making. But how does the EU, a unique economic and political union of 27 states, actually make and implement environmental policy? In this course, we explore these questions by focusing on different aspects of European environmental policy. The first part provides a historic overview of the emergence and development of European environmental policy and law. Who are the central actors? Which institutions are involved in policy making? What are the basic regulation principles? The second part concentrates on the EU policy-making process, and on the implementation of environmental policy in the Member States. A third part deepens these aspects by discussing case studies such as the regulation of chemicals, waste management, air pollution, and GMO. A fourth part concentrates on challenges for European environmental policy and sets it into an international context: How to cope with the enlargement of the EU? What is EU Climate Change policy, and how does the European Emissions Trading System work?    Climate and Society   ENVST-UA 470 Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101). Recommended: Climate Change (ENVST-UA 226). Offered in the fall. Schlottmann. 4 points.   An intermediate environmental studies elective about how societies understand and respond to climate change. We analyze the values, assumptions, and perceptions that contribute to our understanding of climate change. The main topics are: ethics, justice and responsibility; definitions of nature; cost-benefit analysis and the precautionary principle; geo-engineering; contrarianism; framing and communication; social engagement; and education. Central questions include: Is climate change a technical or social problem? What makes climate change uniquely challenging to understand and respond to? Which ethical and perceptual frameworks are best suited for both understanding and responding to climate change? Who is responsible, and what moral implications does this have? What assumptions about values, behavior, economics, and nature do we make when discussing climate change? How does climate change challenge our conceptions of nature, morality, society, and economics? Does climate change pose a special challenge to society, or does it simply amplify existing challenges? Introduction to Urban Political Ecology Theory and Method ENVST-UA 490 Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101). Offered every semester. Rademacher. 4 points. Few aspirations hold the global promise, and political traction, of urban sustainability. While sustainability can be defined and measured through a host of metrics, its actual lived practice often proves somewhat more elusive. This reading intensive seminar explores the gap between aspirations for, and the enactment of, urban sustainability. Drawing from theories, methods, and research techniques associated with political ecology, we consider how contests over environmental knowledge, sociocultural ideology, and discourse shape human engagement with urban nature, and in turn influence social and natural transformation. After laying the theoretical groundwork for political ecological inquiry, the course turns to methodological techniques and research approaches designed to illuminate these dimensions of urban environmental change. Toward the end of the course, each student designs a research proposal that engages an environmental problem using political ecological techniques. Journalism and Society: Covering the Earth (Journalism)   ENVST-UA 503 (or ENVST-UA 9503 at NYU Sydney and NYU Washington, D.C.) Identical to JOUR-UA 503. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. Fagin. 4 points.   As Web-based platforms increasingly dominate mass media, what specific forms should the \"new\" environmental journalism take? This course traces the development of traditional environmental journalism from John Muir to John McPhee and looks closely at how the field is adapting to a fast-changing media landscape. With the help of guests and timely readings, we confront thorny questions about environmental advocacy, citizen media, issue framing, risk balancing, and the scientific process. We produce stories that matter on the biggest news beat of all. This advanced seminar includes intensive journalistic writing assignments, as well as extensive readings for in-class discussion.    Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Ecocriticism   ENVST-UA 510 (or ENVST-UA 9510 at NYU Sydney) Identical to ENGL-UA 735. Chaudhuri. 4 points.   An introduction to the emerging field of ecocriticism and an exploration of some of its main questions, issues, methods, and texts. We trace the origins and development of key tropes of ecological thought\u2014such as wilderness, pastoralism, pollution, and catastrophe\u2014in literary and cultural texts ranging from the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh to the Hollywood eco-blockbuster Avatar. We apply the lenses of environment and species to classics like Euripides' The Bacchae, Shakespeare's The Tempest, and Thoreau's Walden, as well as to works that exemplify new conjunctions between ecological thought and contemporary discourses on globalization, environmental justice, and queer theory, such as novels like Animal's People by Indra Sinha and Lives of the Animals by J. M. Coetzee, and films like Brokeback Mountain and The Yes Men Fix the World.    Animals and Society   ENVST-UA 610 Identical to ANST-UA 200 and SOC-UA 970. Jerolmack. 4 points.   Analyzes the ways that animal and human lives intersect. Specifically, this course examines how relationships with animals both reflect and shape social life, culture, and how people think about themselves. We explore the myriad and contradictory positions that animals occupy in society (e.g., as pets, pests, mascots, and food) and deconstruct the social origins of these seemingly natural categories. (After all, one society's pet is another society's dinner.) We also take a grounded look at what actually happens when humans and animals interact, which sheds new light on the nature of human and animal consciousness and troubles some of the assumptions we make about the necessary role of language and symbols in interaction. Fundamentally, students learn how the roles that animals take on in our lives, and the ways that we think about and relate to them, are inherently social processes that are patterned by geography, culture, class, gender, and so on. Central questions include: How do ideas about, and relationships to, animals vary across time and space? What roles do science, literature, and media representations play in shaping how we think about animals? How and why did pets become honorary members of the American family? Why are some animals, but not others, granted moral status and legal protection in society? How do humans and animals coordinate interaction without language?    Animals and Public Policy   ENVST-UA 630 Identical to ANST-UA 500. No prerequisites. Offered in the fall. 4 points.   Provides an overview of public policy with respect to the somewhat contradictory treatment of animals by humans, with a focus on how public policy is created and how social change occurs. We consider what public policy consists of and what actors and factors play a role in the creation of public policy; how society views animals; the capacities of animals; how ethics relates to animal treatment; how animals are currently utilized by our society; and political and other efforts to improve or alter the current treatment of animals, including the influence of science, government, business, and nongovernmental organizations in defining and influencing animal-related policies. We focus on legislation, litigation, regulation, and ballot initiative and consumer campaigns and their effectiveness, as well as other strategies that relate to improving animal welfare. We also discuss the meaning of \"animal rights\" and the success and impact of the modern animal protection movement.

literary scholarship and critical thinking by building on the foundations laid by the two Pathways of World Literature courses required of all undergraduates. By learning to read critically and write with analytical precision, students in this concentration prepare themselves to participate intelligently in world culture while forging a lifelong, enriching relationship with literature.   Students who elect to pursue the Concentration in Literature are required to take three courses: Literary Interpretation or Critical Theories and Methods of Literary Studies, and a minimum of two electives chosen from among the courses designated as electives and topics seminars. Students may count one course in Creative Writing towards their elective requirement.   All courses that a student wishes to count towards the concentration in Literature, including those taken at another NYU global site, must be approved in advance by the student's mentor.

We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.

We will listen to a range of women&rsquo;s voices: novelists and poets, including Emily Dickinson, Adrienne Rich, Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, and Arundhati Roy; film-makers, including Shawn Slovo (&ldquo;A World Apart&rdquo;) and Haifaa al-Mansour (&ldquo;Wadjda&rdquo;); and scholars, including Martha Nussbaum (The Fragility of Goodness) and Leila Ahmed (Border Passage). Students will be asked to consider how these readings illuminate the human condition or throw light on aspects of human experience that challenge traditional assumptions, including assumptions about women and men.

AHC-AD 135 Reading the Earth: World Literature and the Environment                                                                   This course introduces students to several genres of literature&mdash;drama, the novel, poetry, and the short story&mdash;and to some fundamental categories of literary criticism including Marxism, feminism, post-colonial theory, and eco-criticism. We will be examining conceptions of nature and how &ldquo;the natural&rdquo; is represented in texts, especially after the explosive growth of industrialization in Victorian England and its subsequent global diffusion. Each unit of the course is constructed around a particular problem that will be contextualized historically through a variety of primary and secondary readings. In an attempt to address a representative range of eco-critical dilemmas, we will examine texts from around the world not only in terms of local and regional issues, but also with an eye towards a more global perspective. In attempting to conceptualize nature and the environment, it has become difficult not to think globally. Thinking about literature is increasingly becoming a parallel kind of exercise and students will be encouraged to explore the connections between a global world of texts and the larger natural environment that both shapes and is, in turn, shaped by them.

Combining close readings of the literary source-texts with close analysis of the films, the course will simultaneously explore the &ldquo;transtextuality&rdquo; theory that treats the complex and mutating relations between any single text and all the other texts, genres, media, and discourses with which it comes into dialogue. Through these contrapuntal analyses, the course will demonstrate the myriad ways that adaptation study can illuminate both media.

Its programmatic energy derived from the desire to remember something that seemed to have been obliterated and forgotten in the course of the Middle Ages, i.e. pagan antiquity. Basing their European&mdash;national and transnational&mdash;identities on something much older than Christianity, scholars (poets, painters, architects, composers, and philosophers) revived and developed scientifically the Greek and Roman legacy and laid the founding stones for Enlightenment and Modernity.

The course compares British, Caribbean, Latin American, South Asian, and African texts, including travelogues, whose maps envision fantasies of the other; adaptations and translations of novels, in which mimicry and magical realism reveal how &ldquo;the Empire writes back&rdquo;; and memoirs and short stories, whose fragmentary and experimental forms express how memories of violence, displacement, and exile shape individuals today.

It foregrounds movement and simultaneity, blurring boundaries between &ldquo;real&rdquo; and &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; worlds. Through texts emphasizing home, homelessness, migration, diaspora, transnationalism, tourism, the course examines how literature, film, games, graphic novels, and new media guide readers in this new landscape by charting new concepts of space and place, community, and global citizenship.

We will explore the ways in which authors reflect on their experience of modernity with stories that present mysterious situations, uncanny encounters, and events that defy rationality. Their texts present a discomfort with a reality that is experienced as modern and, therefore, discomforting and threatening. Particular attention will be paid to the specific national and historical setting of each text. This course functions as both an introduction to post-Enlightenment European literature and an in-depth study of the concept of modernity.

During the semester, students will read from a wide variety of literary genres including love poetry, popular epics, travelers&rsquo; accounts, geographical works and sufi mystical treatises from many different regions of the Muslim world, ranging from West Africa to South East Asia. Exploring the movement of people, goods, and ideas within works of literature and tracing the formation, circulation and transformation of Islamicate literary genres, the course focuses on the ways that literary works mediate between local, translocal, and global identities.

Long before print and the coming of the book, every society has told stories to tackle deep questions: about the human place in the world, the origins of natural phenomena, the meaning of love and war, the mystery of death. This form of literature has been called the work of &ldquo;reasoned imagination&rdquo; (Borges). Readings from classic works (Ovid, Apuleius, as well as the above) help inspire original writing projects and tales that draw on the participants&rsquo; own cultures.

It examines the various factors that lead a work to be canonized and the politics of inclusion and exclusion that underlie the cultural mythology of &ldquo;America.&rdquo; Topics to be considered include: colonial and creole identities; the relationship between writing and empire; encounters between Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans in the &ldquo;New World&rdquo;; the nature of the &ldquo;American Renaissance&rdquo;; the meaning of American individualism; the mythology of American exceptionalism; the dialectic of freedom and slavery in American rhetoric; and the American obsession with race.

In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach literature as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory, as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests, and on their language abilities. For their final project, students collaborate in staging and performing a substantial piece of traditional narrative. Works discussed and performed include epics, romances, ballads, and short tales of various kinds, drawn from world literature. In J-term 2015, students will perform from the medieval French Arthurian romance Yvain or the Knight with the Lion by Chretien de Troyes and from the Spanish epic The Song of the Cid . Short works (in a Course Packet) will be taken from the following&mdash;and will thus represent a wide range of kinds of narrative and modes of performance: ballads from Spain and India; tales from Latin ( The Scholar&rsquo;s Guide ), medieval French (various types of tales), Turkish ( The Book of Dede Korkut ), Hebrew ( Tahkemoni ), Arabic ( Kalila and Dimna , 1001 Nights ), and Urdu ( Amir Hamza ). Students will be invited to perform in the original languages wherever possible, and an attempt will be made to include works from the students&rsquo; own traditions.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LITCW-AD 133J Tales that Travel: Storytelling and Storytellers in Eurasia, 10th-16th c.                                                        Long before modern media sent stories around the world at lightning speed, good tales traveled. This course explores the travel of tales and considers the ways in which a common culture of story and storytelling can be found throughout pre-modern Europe, Middle East, South and East Asia. Drawing on stories and scholarship from many different traditions, it examines the role of storytelling in human culture, discusses the performance and circulation of stories, and reflects on examples of the types of tales that traveled--including tales of origin, of wisdom (and folly), of trickery (and truthfulness), of success (and failure), of youth and age, of love and the battle of the sexes&mdash;and many others.

LITCW-AD 134 Literatures of Arab America                                                        The Arab presence in the Americas is a mix of history and legend, fact and fantasy. Twelfth-century geographer al-Idrisi reports that eight Arabs sailed west from Lisbon to discover what lay beyond the &ldquo;Sea of Darkness&rdquo; (the Atlantic ocean), and arrived somewhere in South America. Columbus reportedly had a copy of al-Idrisi&rsquo;s book with him when he embarked on his first voyage in 1492, and he took with him Louis de Torre, a converted Moor, to act as an Arabic interpreter once the expedition reached India. Some of the earliest slave narratives were written in Arabic by literate Muslim captives from West Africa. However, large-scale Arab immigration to the Americas did not begin until the nineteenth century, and since then those immigrants and their descendants have participated in a substantial, though little known, literature in Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. We will examine this tradition within the emergent paradigms of inter-American and hemispheric studies and discuss recent scholarship on the globalization of U.S. American studies and its interface with Latin American and Arabic studies. We will then read a selection of literary works by and about Arab immigrants and their descendants throughout the Americas.

Prerequisites: Physics I (PHYS-UA 91) and Physics II (PHYS-UA 93) and Physics III (PHYS-UA 95) and Mathematical Physics (PHYS-UA 106). Zwanziger. 4 points. Fluid dynamics is a fundamental branch of physics. Interest in this subject has increased of late, as environmental and climate issues become more pressing. The main emphasis will be on the basic principles of fluid dynamics. Prepares students for work in any of the varied fields where fluid dynamics is important, such as astrophysics, ocean-atmosphere science, blood flow, aerodynamics and many others. Ethics and the Environment   ENVST-UA 400 Identical to PHIL-UA 53. Offered in the fall. Jamieson. 4 points.   Environmental philosophy is a large subject that involves questions in metaphysics, the philosophy of science, and the history of philosophy, as well as in such normative areas as ethics, aesthetics, and political philosophy. This course is primarily devoted to these normative areas. Beginning with some basic concepts in value theory, the goal is not to arrive at definite solutions to specific environmental problems, but rather to improve students' ability to think critically, read closely, and argue well about environmental issues. The course also introduces students to some major controversies in environmental philosophy. The ultimate aim is to aid students in arriving at their own rational, clear-minded views about the matters under discussion. Climate Change and Environmental Justice ENVST-UA 405 Identical to SCA-UA 632. Ross. 4 points. Introduces students to the basic approaches to climate change, through readings from climatologists, economists, anthropologists, geographers, cultural analysts, and activists of various stripes. Consideration is given to the \u201cdebate\u201d about climate change that has been generated by deniers and advocates for the fossil fuel industries. The context for discussing the natural and social impact of global warming is further defined by examining the principles of climate justice. Modeled on the American-derived principles of environmental justice in the 1990s, the climate justice movement poses a legal and humanitarian challenge to champions of \u201cnatural capitalism\u201d who place their faith in market-driven solutions. Students look at how populations are unevenly affected by climate change, and how this imbalance is being addressed by a range of advocates of decarbonization. Economics and the Environment   ENVST-UA 410 Offered in the spring. Damon. 4 points.   Students study how the earth's scarce resources are allocated by individuals and society, and how economic tools can contribute toward solutions to environmental challenges. Broad concepts considered include market failure; sustainability; valuation of social benefits provided by the environment; estimating social costs and benefits of alternate environmental policies; determining desirable levels of pollution control and choosing policies to achieve it; and managing natural resources, both renewable (e.g., forests, fisheries, and water) and nonrenewable (e.g., oil and minerals). The course format consists of lectures, discussions, and group projects. Cooperation &amp; the Commons. ENVST-UA 412 Prerequisite: Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100). 4 points. Why do littered environments encourage people to litter more? Why do people who see they are using less energy than average often start using more? Why was the global ban on ozone-harming CFCs successful, while the Kyoto Protocol to curb greenhouse gas emissions a failure? This course examines the tragedy of the commons, with particular emphasis on environmental problems, as well as the various means to cooperate and overcome the tragedy, with particular emphasis on research into human behavior. The first half of the course focuses on theory and makes students familiar with some of the foundational literature in cooperation research while the second half focuses on applied research, as well as how to change social norms. To better understand behavioral phenomena and answer how humans share and consume resources, we will review some of the latest studies in evolutionary biology, experimental economics, and psychology. We will also turn to evolutionary biology for insights into the intricacies and origins of cooperation.    Environmental History of the Early Modern World   ENVST-UA 415 Identical to HIST-UA 115. Appuhn. 4 points.   From the perspective of environmental history, the early modern period (ca. 1500\u20131800) marks a moment of sudden and unprecedented global transformation. Rising core populations created increasing demand for food and natural resources, which in turn led to major alterations to the landscape as states and individuals sought to derive greater benefits from nature. This course analyzes the ways in which this process unfolded in different parts of the world, while familiarizing students with basic problems in environmental history, including the changing human relationship to the natural world, the relationship between environmental change and human societies, and the importance of biotic exchange in world history. The course is divided into two parts. In the first part, we consider what can be called the \"Eurasian Advantage\" or \"Biological Conquest Model\" made popular by Jared Diamond. In the second part, we consider parallel developments in other parts of the world that cast doubt on this account.    Environmental History of New York City   ENVST-UA 420 Identical to HIST-UA 275. Needham. 4 points.   This course investigates topics in the environmental history of New York City from the 17th century to the present. Environmental history is a relatively new field of history that attempts to take nature and natural forces seriously as key components of historical change. Through readings, site visits, and writing assignments, the course introduces students to the field of environmental history and investigates the history of our immediate environment. As a history-department workshop, the course also introduces students to the key elements of the discipline of history: finding and reading articles, conducting research, and evaluating primary and secondary sources.    History of Ecology and Environmentalism   ENVST-UA 425 Offered in the fall. Anker. 4 points.   Students trace the history of ecology and environmentalism back to natural history collected in the 18th century. The global history of ecological concern stays at the center of this course, which discusses environmental worries in the British, German, Scandinavian, African, and American contexts in subsequent centuries. The chief focus is on more recent U.S. experience in trying to deal with pollution, asthma, and global warming, among other issues. Various ecological understandings of human philosophy, race, gender, fear, religion, sociology, and economy are subject to critical discussion. Readings include texts by scientists such as Carolus Linnaeus, Arthur Tansley, and Julian Huxley, as well as social and philosophical writings of authors such as H. G. Wells, John Muir, Jan Smuts, and Arne Naess.    Education and the Environment   ENVST-UA 430 Offered in the spring. Schlottmann. 4 points.   This course (1) discusses major topics and schools of thought in environmental education, (2) analyzes the ethical, practical, and conceptual implications of this, and (3) assesses these various approaches for clarity and practicality. Students address four primary questions: What forms does environmental education take? What values inform environmental education? What might an ethically defensible, effective form of environmental education look like? How much do concepts and arguments matter in better understanding and implementing environmental education? The course aims to advance our integrative and practical thinking about complex and multifaceted environmental topics, as well as to understand environmental values as they relate to education.    Food, Animals, and the Environment   ENVST-UA 440 Identical to ANST-UA 440. Offered in the spring. Schlottmann, Sebo. 4 points.   Students study human interaction with both food and animals, as well as the environmental impacts and ethical issues that arise from such interaction. Focus is on the moral standing of animals, animals as food, and the environmental impacts of agriculture, transportation, and consumption. The course also surveys major thinkers in the field, including Michael Pollan, Peter Singer, Jim Mason, Wendell Berry, David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Martha Nussbaum. Students engage in collaborative research projects, and we hope to schedule field trips to local agricultural sites.    Topics in Environmental Values and Society   ENVST-UA 450 (or ENVST-UA 9450 at NYU Prague, Shanghai, and Sydney) Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101) or permission of the instructor. Offered every semester. Anker, Damon, Rademacher, Sachs, Schlottmann. 4 points.   An intermediate course for students in the major or minor in environmental studies in the environmental values and society track. The aim of the course is to advance understanding of a specific topic concerning the social aspects of environmental problems. Familiarity with social aspects of environmental problems is assumed. Topics include Thinking Globally, Acting Locally; Economics and the Environment; History of Ecology and Environmentalism; Environmental Education; and Food and Animals.    European Environmental Policy   ENVST-UA 460 (or ENVST-UA 9460 at NYU Berlin) Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101). Offered in the fall at Washington Square; offered every semester at NYU Berlin. Wazeck. 4 points.   This course offers an introduction to European environmental policy. The European Union (EU) is often seen as a leader in environmental policy, and it is a major player in international environmental policy making. But how does the EU, a unique economic and political union of 27 states, actually make and implement environmental policy? In this course, we explore these questions by focusing on different aspects of European environmental policy. The first part provides a historic overview of the emergence and development of European environmental policy and law. Who are the central actors? Which institutions are involved in policy making? What are the basic regulation principles? The second part concentrates on the EU policy-making process, and on the implementation of environmental policy in the Member States. A third part deepens these aspects by discussing case studies such as the regulation of chemicals, waste management, air pollution, and GMO. A fourth part concentrates on challenges for European environmental policy and sets it into an international context: How to cope with the enlargement of the EU? What is EU Climate Change policy, and how does the European Emissions Trading System work?    Climate and Society   ENVST-UA 470 Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101). Recommended: Climate Change (ENVST-UA 226). Offered in the fall. Schlottmann. 4 points.   An intermediate environmental studies elective about how societies understand and respond to climate change. We analyze the values, assumptions, and perceptions that contribute to our understanding of climate change. The main topics are: ethics, justice and responsibility; definitions of nature; cost-benefit analysis and the precautionary principle; geo-engineering; contrarianism; framing and communication; social engagement; and education. Central questions include: Is climate change a technical or social problem? What makes climate change uniquely challenging to understand and respond to? Which ethical and perceptual frameworks are best suited for both understanding and responding to climate change? Who is responsible, and what moral implications does this have? What assumptions about values, behavior, economics, and nature do we make when discussing climate change? How does climate change challenge our conceptions of nature, morality, society, and economics? Does climate change pose a special challenge to society, or does it simply amplify existing challenges? Introduction to Urban Political Ecology Theory and Method ENVST-UA 490 Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101). Offered every semester. Rademacher. 4 points. Few aspirations hold the global promise, and political traction, of urban sustainability. While sustainability can be defined and measured through a host of metrics, its actual lived practice often proves somewhat more elusive. This reading intensive seminar explores the gap between aspirations for, and the enactment of, urban sustainability. Drawing from theories, methods, and research techniques associated with political ecology, we consider how contests over environmental knowledge, sociocultural ideology, and discourse shape human engagement with urban nature, and in turn influence social and natural transformation. After laying the theoretical groundwork for political ecological inquiry, the course turns to methodological techniques and research approaches designed to illuminate these dimensions of urban environmental change. Toward the end of the course, each student designs a research proposal that engages an environmental problem using political ecological techniques. Journalism and Society: Covering the Earth (Journalism)   ENVST-UA 503 (or ENVST-UA 9503 at NYU Sydney and NYU Washington, D.C.) Identical to JOUR-UA 503. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. Fagin. 4 points.   As Web-based platforms increasingly dominate mass media, what specific forms should the \"new\" environmental journalism take? This course traces the development of traditional environmental journalism from John Muir to John McPhee and looks closely at how the field is adapting to a fast-changing media landscape. With the help of guests and timely readings, we confront thorny questions about environmental advocacy, citizen media, issue framing, risk balancing, and the scientific process. We produce stories that matter on the biggest news beat of all. This advanced seminar includes intensive journalistic writing assignments, as well as extensive readings for in-class discussion.    Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Ecocriticism   ENVST-UA 510 (or ENVST-UA 9510 at NYU Sydney) Identical to ENGL-UA 735. Chaudhuri. 4 points.   An introduction to the emerging field of ecocriticism and an exploration of some of its main questions, issues, methods, and texts. We trace the origins and development of key tropes of ecological thought\u2014such as wilderness, pastoralism, pollution, and catastrophe\u2014in literary and cultural texts ranging from the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh to the Hollywood eco-blockbuster Avatar. We apply the lenses of environment and species to classics like Euripides' The Bacchae, Shakespeare's The Tempest, and Thoreau's Walden, as well as to works that exemplify new conjunctions between ecological thought and contemporary discourses on globalization, environmental justice, and queer theory, such as novels like Animal's People by Indra Sinha and Lives of the Animals by J. M. Coetzee, and films like Brokeback Mountain and The Yes Men Fix the World.    Animals and Society   ENVST-UA 610 Identical to ANST-UA 200 and SOC-UA 970. Jerolmack. 4 points.   Analyzes the ways that animal and human lives intersect. Specifically, this course examines how relationships with animals both reflect and shape social life, culture, and how people think about themselves. We explore the myriad and contradictory positions that animals occupy in society (e.g., as pets, pests, mascots, and food) and deconstruct the social origins of these seemingly natural categories. (After all, one society's pet is another society's dinner.) We also take a grounded look at what actually happens when humans and animals interact, which sheds new light on the nature of human and animal consciousness and troubles some of the assumptions we make about the necessary role of language and symbols in interaction. Fundamentally, students learn how the roles that animals take on in our lives, and the ways that we think about and relate to them, are inherently social processes that are patterned by geography, culture, class, gender, and so on. Central questions include: How do ideas about, and relationships to, animals vary across time and space? What roles do science, literature, and media representations play in shaping how we think about animals? How and why did pets become honorary members of the American family? Why are some animals, but not others, granted moral status and legal protection in society? How do humans and animals coordinate interaction without language?    Animals and Public Policy   ENVST-UA 630 Identical to ANST-UA 500. No prerequisites. Offered in the fall. 4 points.   Provides an overview of public policy with respect to the somewhat contradictory treatment of animals by humans, with a focus on how public policy is created and how social change occurs. We consider what public policy consists of and what actors and factors play a role in the creation of public policy; how society views animals; the capacities of animals; how ethics relates to animal treatment; how animals are currently utilized by our society; and political and other efforts to improve or alter the current treatment of animals, including the influence of science, government, business, and nongovernmental organizations in defining and influencing animal-related policies. We focus on legislation, litigation, regulation, and ballot initiative and consumer campaigns and their effectiveness, as well as other strategies that relate to improving animal welfare. We also discuss the meaning of \"animal rights\" and the success and impact of the modern animal protection movement.

literary scholarship and critical thinking by building on the foundations laid by the two Pathways of World Literature courses required of all undergraduates. By learning to read critically and write with analytical precision, students in this concentration prepare themselves to participate intelligently in world culture while forging a lifelong, enriching relationship with literature.   Students who elect to pursue the Concentration in Literature are required to take three courses: Literary Interpretation or Critical Theories and Methods of Literary Studies, and a minimum of two electives chosen from among the courses designated as electives and topics seminars. Students may count one course in Creative Writing towards their elective requirement.   All courses that a student wishes to count towards the concentration in Literature, including those taken at another NYU global site, must be approved in advance by the student's mentor.

The novels are our guides in order to understand the multiple layers of a city, and to build knowledge about the relationship between literature and social life. We read works by Naguib Mahfouz, Sunalla Ibrahim, Huda Barakat, Hanan Al Sheikh, Tawfic Yussuf Awad, Sinan Antoun, and Ghassan Kanafani. We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.

We will listen to a range of women&rsquo;s voices: novelists and poets, including Emily Dickinson, Adrienne Rich, Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, and Arundhati Roy; film-makers, including Shawn Slovo (&ldquo;A World Apart&rdquo;) and Haifaa al-Mansour (&ldquo;Wadjda&rdquo;); and scholars, including Martha Nussbaum (The Fragility of Goodness) and Leila Ahmed (Border Passage). Students will be asked to consider how these readings illuminate the human condition or throw light on aspects of human experience that challenge traditional assumptions, including assumptions about women and men.

AHC-AD 135 Reading the Earth: World Literature and the Environment                                                                   This course introduces students to several genres of literature&mdash;drama, the novel, poetry, and the short story&mdash;and to some fundamental categories of literary criticism including Marxism, feminism, post-colonial theory, and eco-criticism. We will be examining conceptions of nature and how &ldquo;the natural&rdquo; is represented in texts, especially after the explosive growth of industrialization in Victorian England and its subsequent global diffusion. Each unit of the course is constructed around a particular problem that will be contextualized historically through a variety of primary and secondary readings. In an attempt to address a representative range of eco-critical dilemmas, we will examine texts from around the world not only in terms of local and regional issues, but also with an eye towards a more global perspective. In attempting to conceptualize nature and the environment, it has become difficult not to think globally. Thinking about literature is increasingly becoming a parallel kind of exercise and students will be encouraged to explore the connections between a global world of texts and the larger natural environment that both shapes and is, in turn, shaped by them.

FILMM-AD 154 Transtextuality: Adaptation Between Novel and Film                                                                              This course treats the theory, practice, and analysis of film adaptations of novels across a broad spectrum that includes novels by such figures as Defoe, Steinbeck, Nabokov, Flaubert, and Clarice Lispector. Combining close readings of the literary source-texts with close analysis of the films, the course will simultaneously explore the &ldquo;transtextuality&rdquo; theory that treats the complex and mutating relations between any single text and all the other texts, genres, media, and discourses with which it comes into dialogue. Through these contrapuntal analyses, the course will demonstrate the myriad ways that adaptation study can illuminate both media.

Its programmatic energy derived from the desire to remember something that seemed to have been obliterated and forgotten in the course of the Middle Ages, i.e. pagan antiquity. Basing their European&mdash;national and transnational&mdash;identities on something much older than Christianity, scholars (poets, painters, architects, composers, and philosophers) revived and developed scientifically the Greek and Roman legacy and laid the founding stones for Enlightenment and Modernity.

The course compares British, Caribbean, Latin American, South Asian, and African texts, including travelogues, whose maps envision fantasies of the other; adaptations and translations of novels, in which mimicry and magical realism reveal how &ldquo;the Empire writes back&rdquo;; and memoirs and short stories, whose fragmentary and experimental forms express how memories of violence, displacement, and exile shape individuals today.

It foregrounds movement and simultaneity, blurring boundaries between &ldquo;real&rdquo; and &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; worlds. Through texts emphasizing home, homelessness, migration, diaspora, transnationalism, tourism, the course examines how literature, film, games, graphic novels, and new media guide readers in this new landscape by charting new concepts of space and place, community, and global citizenship.

We will explore the ways in which authors reflect on their experience of modernity with stories that present mysterious situations, uncanny encounters, and events that defy rationality. Their texts present a discomfort with a reality that is experienced as modern and, therefore, discomforting and threatening. Particular attention will be paid to the specific national and historical setting of each text. This course functions as both an introduction to post-Enlightenment European literature and an in-depth study of the concept of modernity. We will be discussing the following texts, among others: Brothers Grimm, &ldquo;Bluebeard;&rdquo; Coleridge, &ldquo;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner;&rdquo; Hoffmann, &ldquo;The Sandman;&rdquo; Baudelaire, Flowers of Evil ; Dostoyevsky, Notes from Underground ; Stoker, Dracula ; Kafka, The Metamorphosis; and Saramago , The Stone Raft .

During the semester, students will read from a wide variety of literary genres including love poetry, popular epics, travelers&rsquo; accounts, geographical works and sufi mystical treatises from many different regions of the Muslim world, ranging from West Africa to South East Asia. Exploring the movement of people, goods, and ideas within works of literature and tracing the formation, circulation and transformation of Islamicate literary genres, the course focuses on the ways that literary works mediate between local, translocal, and global identities.

Long before print and the coming of the book, every society has told stories to tackle deep questions: about the human place in the world, the origins of natural phenomena, the meaning of love and war, the mystery of death. This form of literature has been called the work of &ldquo;reasoned imagination&rdquo; (Borges). Readings from classic works (Ovid, Apuleius, as well as the above) help inspire original writing projects and tales that draw on the participants&rsquo; own cultures.

LITCW-AD 131J Performative Literature: Acting Epics, Romances, Ballads and Stories                                                        This course presents narrative literature as a set of springboards to performance, rather than as a series of books simply to be read privately. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach literature as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory, as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests, and on their language abilities. For their final project, students collaborate in staging and performing a substantial piece of traditional narrative. Works discussed and performed include epics, romances, ballads, and short tales of various kinds, drawn from world literature. In J-term 2015, students will perform from the medieval French Arthurian romance Yvain or the Knight with the Lion by Chretien de Troyes and from the Spanish epic The Song of the Cid . Short works (in a Course Packet) will be taken from the following&mdash;and will thus represent a wide range of kinds of narrative and modes of performance: ballads from Spain and India; tales from Latin ( The Scholar&rsquo;s Guide ), medieval French (various types of tales), Turkish ( The Book of Dede Korkut ), Hebrew ( Tahkemoni ), Arabic ( Kalila and Dimna , 1001 Nights ), and Urdu ( Amir Hamza ). Students will be invited to perform in the original languages wherever possible, and an attempt will be made to include works from the students&rsquo; own traditions.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LITCW-AD 133J Tales that Travel: Storytelling and Storytellers in Eurasia, 10th-16th c.                                                        Long before modern media sent stories around the world at lightning speed, good tales traveled. This course explores the travel of tales and considers the ways in which a common culture of story and storytelling can be found throughout pre-modern Europe, Middle East, South and East Asia. Drawing on stories and scholarship from many different traditions, it examines the role of storytelling in human culture, discusses the performance and circulation of stories, and reflects on examples of the types of tales that traveled--including tales of origin, of wisdom (and folly), of trickery (and truthfulness), of success (and failure), of youth and age, of love and the battle of the sexes&mdash;and many others.

LITCW-AD 134 Literatures of Arab America                                                        The Arab presence in the Americas is a mix of history and legend, fact and fantasy. Twelfth-century geographer al-Idrisi reports that eight Arabs sailed west from Lisbon to discover what lay beyond the &ldquo;Sea of Darkness&rdquo; (the Atlantic ocean), and arrived somewhere in South America. Columbus reportedly had a copy of al-Idrisi&rsquo;s book with him when he embarked on his first voyage in 1492, and he took with him Louis de Torre, a converted Moor, to act as an Arabic interpreter once the expedition reached India. Some of the earliest slave narratives were written in Arabic by literate Muslim captives from West Africa. However, large-scale Arab immigration to the Americas did not begin until the nineteenth century, and since then those immigrants and their descendants have participated in a substantial, though little known, literature in Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. We will examine this tradition within the emergent paradigms of inter-American and hemispheric studies and discuss recent scholarship on the globalization of U.S. American studies and its interface with Latin American and Arabic studies. We will then read a selection of literary works by and about Arab immigrants and their descendants throughout the Americas.

Through sustained attention to formal and ideological tenets of these specific texts, we will also seek to interrogate some of the salient procedures of realism, modernism, and postcolonialism.

From a variety of critical theoretical discourses, our discussions focus on the theatrical practices demanded by the texts, along with the intersections and divergences of structures and topics shared by continental plays, such as blackness and race, exile, colonialism and post-colonialism, violence, gender inequality, family, moral and social values, interraciality, religion, and political resistance. The plays from North Africa that align with the Arab world will serve as a bridge to introduce noteworthy works from the African diaspora, with plays written by Africans or those of African ancestry living in the Middle East, Europe, and the United States.

                                       Literature has been central to the formation of collective identities across cultures, nations, and historical epochs. Though literary works are anchored in a particular time and place, many of them are read widely in other times and other places and by cultures to which they would seem not to belong. The Literature and Creative Writing major at NYUAD is uniquely organized around problems presented by translation, adaption, and circulation. Unlike many college literary curricula that restrict majors to the study of works in a single language or from a specific national tradition, this major aims to engage students in critical conversations that cut across fields and in doing so help to rethink the very foundations of literary studies.   The Literature and Creative Writing major fosters students\u2019 skills as interpreters of literature and as analysts of culture, history, and politics. Creative writing seminars\u2014open to the entire NYUAD student body\u2014include instruction in poetry, fiction, non-fiction, literary journalism, and writing for stage and screen.   Though most course materials are written in or translated into English, they are drawn from an array of cultural traditions. Students with fluency in other languages are encouraged to read assigned texts in the original. All majors take at least one course in creative writing; In advanced coursework, students may pursue a specialization in either literary studies or creative writing, culminating in a capstone thesis or creative project.                                            Major in Literature   A major in Literature and Creative Writing prepares students for careers that require critical thinking, forceful and lucid writing, and the ability to undertake discerning research, to read deeply and creatively, and to be receptive to the perspectives of others. The major might lead to graduate school in literature but could just as readily form a strong foundation for work in journalism, publishing, international relations, law, public policy, or media.   Students pursue one of two tracks:     Literary Scholarship;     Creative Writing.

The transformation of poetic form and the emergence of modern genres, such as drama, the novel, and the short story, will be examined in relation to classical Arabic and European genres. We will also discuss the relationship between aesthetic developments and their historical, political, and intellectual contexts.

The novels are our guides in order to understand the multiple layers of a city, and to build knowledge about the relationship between literature and social life. We read works by Naguib Mahfouz, Sunalla Ibrahim, Huda Barakat, Hanan Al Sheikh, Tawfic Yussuf Awad, Sinan Antoun, and Ghassan Kanafani. We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.

We will listen to a range of women&rsquo;s voices: novelists and poets, including Emily Dickinson, Adrienne Rich, Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, and Arundhati Roy; film-makers, including Shawn Slovo (&ldquo;A World Apart&rdquo;) and Haifaa al-Mansour (&ldquo;Wadjda&rdquo;); and scholars, including Martha Nussbaum (The Fragility of Goodness) and Leila Ahmed (Border Passage). Students will be asked to consider how these readings illuminate the human condition or throw light on aspects of human experience that challenge traditional assumptions, including assumptions about women and men.

AHC-AD 135 Reading the Earth: World Literature and the Environment                                                                   This course introduces students to several genres of literature&mdash;drama, the novel, poetry, and the short story&mdash;and to some fundamental categories of literary criticism including Marxism, feminism, post-colonial theory, and eco-criticism. We will be examining conceptions of nature and how &ldquo;the natural&rdquo; is represented in texts, especially after the explosive growth of industrialization in Victorian England and its subsequent global diffusion. Each unit of the course is constructed around a particular problem that will be contextualized historically through a variety of primary and secondary readings. In an attempt to address a representative range of eco-critical dilemmas, we will examine texts from around the world not only in terms of local and regional issues, but also with an eye towards a more global perspective. In attempting to conceptualize nature and the environment, it has become difficult not to think globally. Thinking about literature is increasingly becoming a parallel kind of exercise and students will be encouraged to explore the connections between a global world of texts and the larger natural environment that both shapes and is, in turn, shaped by them.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project.

Combining close readings of the literary source-texts with close analysis of the films, the course will simultaneously explore the &ldquo;transtextuality&rdquo; theory that treats the complex and mutating relations between any single text and all the other texts, genres, media, and discourses with which it comes into dialogue. Through these contrapuntal analyses, the course will demonstrate the myriad ways that adaptation study can illuminate both media.

Beginning with recordings of oral tradition originating in the early empire of Mali to novels addressing the roles of African colonial intermediaries to music protesting apartheid in South Africa, students will engage with a variety of sources of cultural and artistic nature. The course will focus on historical developments such as the Atlantic and internal slave trades, the process of European colonization, religious practice, decolonization, genocide and migration, urbanization, and AIDS. We will also examine various themes, such as local and imposed notions of race and ethnicity, lived experiences of and Africans&rsquo; responses to colonialism on the continent, issues of gender and class, and political resistance. Our broad goal is to investigate to what extent long-term historical dynamics determine the present. Students will not only watch films, listen to music, and read literature, but also read reflections on the methods of using these sources as a way of studying the history of Africa. Course requirements provide students with a language and historical framework for understanding the dynamic history of the continent.

Drawing upon a long history of theoretical approaches, the course considers such questions as: What is literature? What is a text? What does a literary critic or scholar do? What does it mean to read literature in translation? How does language shape meaning? How do we construct meaning from a text&mdash;and why does that meaning matter? And, crucially: What is at stake in why we ask and how we answer these questions? This class will engage these questions by reading widely, from primary theoretical and critical texts to examples from print and digital material, and by exploring particular practices of literary scholarship&mdash;from archival research to work in digital humanities&mdash;that offer necessary skills for effective critical practice.

Its programmatic energy derived from the desire to remember something that seemed to have been obliterated and forgotten in the course of the Middle Ages, i.e. pagan antiquity. Basing their European&mdash;national and transnational&mdash;identities on something much older than Christianity, scholars (poets, painters, architects, composers, and philosophers) revived and developed scientifically the Greek and Roman legacy and laid the founding stones for Enlightenment and Modernity.

The course compares British, Caribbean, Latin American, South Asian, and African texts, including travelogues, whose maps envision fantasies of the other; adaptations and translations of novels, in which mimicry and magical realism reveal how &ldquo;the Empire writes back&rdquo;; and memoirs and short stories, whose fragmentary and experimental forms express how memories of violence, displacement, and exile shape individuals today.

It foregrounds movement and simultaneity, blurring boundaries between &ldquo;real&rdquo; and &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; worlds. Through texts emphasizing home, homelessness, migration, diaspora, transnationalism, tourism, the course examines how literature, film, games, graphic novels, and new media guide readers in this new landscape by charting new concepts of space and place, community, and global citizenship.

We will explore the ways in which authors reflect on their experience of modernity with stories that present mysterious situations, uncanny encounters, and events that defy rationality. Their texts present a discomfort with a reality that is experienced as modern and, therefore, discomforting and threatening. Particular attention will be paid to the specific national and historical setting of each text. This course functions as both an introduction to post-Enlightenment European literature and an in-depth study of the concept of modernity. We will be discussing the following texts, among others: Brothers Grimm, &ldquo;Bluebeard;&rdquo; Coleridge, &ldquo;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner;&rdquo; Hoffmann, &ldquo;The Sandman;&rdquo; Baudelaire, Flowers of Evil ; Dostoyevsky, Notes from Underground ; Stoker, Dracula ; Kafka, The Metamorphosis; and Saramago , The Stone Raft .

During the semester, students will read from a wide variety of literary genres including love poetry, popular epics, travelers&rsquo; accounts, geographical works and sufi mystical treatises from many different regions of the Muslim world, ranging from West Africa to South East Asia. Exploring the movement of people, goods, and ideas within works of literature and tracing the formation, circulation and transformation of Islamicate literary genres, the course focuses on the ways that literary works mediate between local, translocal, and global identities.

Long before print and the coming of the book, every society has told stories to tackle deep questions: about the human place in the world, the origins of natural phenomena, the meaning of love and war, the mystery of death. This form of literature has been called the work of &ldquo;reasoned imagination&rdquo; (Borges). Readings from classic works (Ovid, Apuleius, as well as the above) help inspire original writing projects and tales that draw on the participants&rsquo; own cultures.

It examines the various factors that lead a work to be canonized and the politics of inclusion and exclusion that underlie the cultural mythology of &ldquo;America.&rdquo; Topics to be considered include: colonial and creole identities; the relationship between writing and empire; encounters between Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans in the &ldquo;New World&rdquo;; the nature of the &ldquo;American Renaissance&rdquo;; the meaning of American individualism; the mythology of American exceptionalism; the dialectic of freedom and slavery in American rhetoric; and the American obsession with race.

With the Art of Memory as the organizing principle, our material will include works by Virginia Woolf, E.M. Forster, Joseph Conrad, John Fowles, John Berger, Margaret Atwood and Andre Aciman as well as films directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Pedro Almodovar. The course combines discussion seminars and writing workshops with one-on-one conferences with the professor. Students work on honing their own narrative voices and aim to produce honors level work by the end of the semester.

Better question: Where can we go, and what can we do, as creative writers? Our course begins with the nuts and bolts &mdash; learning the tools, acquiring the skills, understanding the architecture of story telling. Then, together, we build. We&rsquo;ll also play, debate, and experiment: discovering the line between news articles and fiction; creating characters using social media conventions; writing more vividly by unlocking our senses; declaring our manifestos; understanding publishing; examining censorship; and looking over the edge into the abyss with growing confidence. For writing should never be solitary: we&rsquo;ll learn from the works of published writers; more importantly, we&rsquo;ll learn from each other&mdash;not just how to write but why we write. And we&rsquo;ll stride forward with the fictionist&rsquo;s creativity, the journalist&rsquo;s rigor, and the critic&rsquo;s understanding. Fiction, and you, will never be the same.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LITCW-AD 131J Performative Literature: Acting Epics, Romances, Ballads and Stories                                                        This course presents narrative literature as a set of springboards to performance, rather than as a series of books simply to be read privately. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach literature as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory, as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests, and on their language abilities. For their final project, students collaborate in staging and performing a substantial piece of traditional narrative. Works discussed and performed include epics, romances, ballads, and short tales of various kinds, drawn from world literature. In J-term 2015, students will perform from the medieval French Arthurian romance Yvain or the Knight with the Lion by Chretien de Troyes and from the Spanish epic The Song of the Cid . Short works (in a Course Packet) will be taken from the following&mdash;and will thus represent a wide range of kinds of narrative and modes of performance: ballads from Spain and India; tales from Latin ( The Scholar&rsquo;s Guide ), medieval French (various types of tales), Turkish ( The Book of Dede Korkut ), Hebrew ( Tahkemoni ), Arabic ( Kalila and Dimna , 1001 Nights ), and Urdu ( Amir Hamza ). Students will be invited to perform in the original languages wherever possible, and an attempt will be made to include works from the students&rsquo; own traditions.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LITCW-AD 133J Tales that Travel: Storytelling and Storytellers in Eurasia, 10th-16th c.                                                        Long before modern media sent stories around the world at lightning speed, good tales traveled. This course explores the travel of tales and considers the ways in which a common culture of story and storytelling can be found throughout pre-modern Europe, Middle East, South and East Asia. Drawing on stories and scholarship from many different traditions, it examines the role of storytelling in human culture, discusses the performance and circulation of stories, and reflects on examples of the types of tales that traveled--including tales of origin, of wisdom (and folly), of trickery (and truthfulness), of success (and failure), of youth and age, of love and the battle of the sexes&mdash;and many others.

Twelfth-century geographer al-Idrisi reports that eight Arabs sailed west from Lisbon to discover what lay beyond the &ldquo;Sea of Darkness&rdquo; (the Atlantic ocean), and arrived somewhere in South America. Columbus reportedly had a copy of al-Idrisi&rsquo;s book with him when he embarked on his first voyage in 1492, and he took with him Louis de Torre, a converted Moor, to act as an Arabic interpreter once the expedition reached India. Some of the earliest slave narratives were written in Arabic by literate Muslim captives from West Africa. However, large-scale Arab immigration to the Americas did not begin until the nineteenth century, and since then those immigrants and their descendants have participated in a substantial, though little known, literature in Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. We will examine this tradition within the emergent paradigms of inter-American and hemispheric studies and discuss recent scholarship on the globalization of U.S. American studies and its interface with Latin American and Arabic studies. We will then read a selection of literary works by and about Arab immigrants and their descendants throughout the Americas.

Through sustained attention to formal and ideological tenets of these specific texts, we will also seek to interrogate some of the salient procedures of realism, modernism, and postcolonialism.

LITCW-AD 139 Early Modern English Drama: Staging the World                                              Doomed lovers, military conquest, imported luxury goods, political treachery, religious conversion, spectacular bodies&mdash;and pirates. These are some of the plot elements that figured stereotypes and represented transnational movement of people, objects, and stories around the globe in English Renaissance drama. This course will read English plays preoccupied with staging otherness&mdash;from the 1580s to the 1640s&mdash;in genres from city comedy to revenge tragedy to ask how these imaginative constructions draw upon the world to consider what it meant to be &ldquo;English.&rdquo; We will examine the intersection of identity and nation as these ideas are insisted upon&mdash;and fractured&mdash;in the popular imagination of the theater. We will ask: how is the self constructed in relation to the world? Which figures of the &ldquo;Other&rdquo; become particularly important to notions of English identity? How is the English body imagined, and what happens to English bodies when they venture elsewhere? Likely texts include Christopher Marlowe, Tamburlaine the Great; William Shakespeare, The Comedy of Errors ; Thomas Dekker, The Shoemaker&rsquo;s Holiday ; Ben Jonson, Volpone ; Thomas Heywood, The English Traveller ; William Rowley, The Birth of Merlin ; Robert Daborne, A Christian Turned Turk ; John Webster, The White Devil ; and Richard Brome, The Antipodes .    *Prerequite: or instructor approval.

The basic spread of subjects treated is poetry and prose narrative; but there will be a nuancing of literary genres and categories (especially of those peculiar to the Arabic tradition). Students will be introduced to main approaches to the study of this broad and deep literary tradition. Texts will include selections from: Pre-Islamic heroic poetry; Umayyad love poetry; Abbasid courtly poetry and its influence on the Andalus; libertine poetry in all its registers from the early Abbasid to the Mamluke period. Prose literature will include The Qur&#39;an; Hadith; Apocrypha of the Prophets; Picaresque Maqamahs; the Arabian Nights; and proto-novels from the 19th century.

Students will write poetry as well as learn terms for critical analysis. Some of the threads of inquiry and inspiration that will run through the workshop include: What is poetry? What does it do? What is the state of poetry now? What does it mean to write and read poems in English if it is not your home or only language? In addition to workshopping peers&rsquo; poetry, participants will learn about the chapbook tradition, make their own small books of between 15 and 25 pages, and organize readings to experiment with various performance-based approaches to poetry.

From a variety of critical theoretical discourses, our discussions focus on the theatrical practices demanded by the texts, along with the intersections and divergences of structures and topics shared by continental plays, such as blackness and race, exile, colonialism and post-colonialism, violence, gender inequality, family, moral and social values, interraciality, religion, and political resistance. The plays from North Africa that align with the Arab world will serve as a bridge to introduce noteworthy works from the African diaspora, with plays written by Africans or those of African ancestry living in the Middle East, Europe, and the United States.

THEAT-AD 153 African Women Playwrights                                                        African Women Playwrights&rdquo; is a reading intensive course that focuses on the structurally and narratively diversified theatrical texts written by women from the continent in the 20th and 21st century. We&rsquo;ll critique the plays as both literature and dramatic texts intended for production. What is clearly evident in African women playwrights&rsquo; writing is its focus on women&rsquo;s agency; generational legacies; tradition, colonialism, and modernism; tribal and national identities; family relationships; intimacy and commitment; the spirit world of rituals, polytheism, and monotheism; the challenging coexistence between Christianity and Islam; the impact of the global diaspora on African identity; and the intersecting issues of blackness, Africanness, and womanhood. The course will address these various foci through the works of Andiah Kisia (Kenya), Nathalie Etoke, Werewere Liking (Cameroon), Tsitsi Dangarembga (Zimbabwe), Fatima Gallaire (Algeria), Penina Mlama, Amadina Lihamba (Tanzania), Ama Ata Aidoo, Efua Sutherland (Ghana), Osonye Tess Onwueme, Zulu Sofola, Julie Okoh (Nigeria), Sindiwe Magona, Malika Ndlovu, Gcina Mhlope (South Africa), Violet Barungi, and Deborah Asiimwe (Uganda). The foundational critical theories for the course are postcolonialism, feminism, critical race theory, and diasporic studies. We will also engage the new plays by African women that are produced at the 2nd Annual Kampala International Theatre Festival (Nov 25-29, 2015) through the assistance of award-winning Ugandan playwright, Deborah Asiimwe, who is co-director of this East African theatre festival (as well as the representative for the Sundance Institute East Africa).
