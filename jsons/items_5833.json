They include: acute traumatic injuries (fractures and dislocations of the wrist and hand, and lacerations of tendons, nerves and arteries), reconstruction for chronic post-traumatic problems, arthritic conditions of the wrist and hand (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, etc.), acquired conditions (nerve compressions that most commonly involve carpal tunnel syndrome, and tumors and tumor like masses such as ganglions), congenital deformities, and neuromuscular disorders in children (cerebral palsy) and the elderly (after strokes).   Our board-certified and fellowship-trained hand specialists evaluate and treat thousands of patients each year. The most effective treatment is often non-operative measures including hand therapy and the use of different types of splints fabricated by our Certified Hand Therapists. When surgery is necessary, the latest and most sophisticated techniques are used; over 5,000 operative procedures are performed each year at our five locations .   In 2013, the Department established a Hand Center at NYU Langone\u2019s Tisch Hospital. The Hand Center at NYU Langone Medical Center offers the full spectrum of hand services for patients of all ages.   Read more about the Conditions &amp; Procedures we address, Our Hand Specialists , and Clinical Trials .   Residency and Fellowship Training   Resident and fellowship training is fully integrated across the five hospitals that constitute the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, under the direction of Martin Posner, MD, Chief of the Division. The other faculty members in charge of training are:   Nader Paksima, DO (Jamaica Hospital)   Anthony Sapienza, MD (Bellevue Hospital)   Steven Green, MD and Susan Scott, MD (VA Hospital)   John T. Capo, MD (Jersey City Medical Center)   Our physicians provide excellent training for the next generation of hand specialists.

They include: acute traumatic injuries (fractures and dislocations of the wrist and hand, and lacerations of tendons, nerves and arteries), reconstruction for chronic post-traumatic problems, arthritic conditions of the wrist and hand (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, etc.), acquired conditions (nerve compressions that most commonly involve carpal tunnel syndrome, and tumors and tumor like masses such as ganglions), congenital deformities, and neuromuscular disorders in children (cerebral palsy) and the elderly (after strokes).   Our board-certified and fellowship-trained hand specialists evaluate and treat thousands of patients each year. The most effective treatment is often non-operative measures including hand therapy and the use of different types of splints fabricated by our Certified Hand Therapists. When surgery is necessary, the latest and most sophisticated techniques are used; over 5,000 operative procedures are performed each year at our five locations .   In 2013, the Department established a Hand Center at NYU Langone\u2019s Tisch Hospital. The Hand Center at NYU Langone Medical Center offers the full spectrum of hand services for patients of all ages.
