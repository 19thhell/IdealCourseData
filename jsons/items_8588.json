He will officially take up his duties in January 2016.   Professor Hamilton\u2019s selection follows an eight-month, international search process conducted by a Search Committee of trustees, faculty, students, and administrators. The Committee\u2014which began the search with over 200 nominees\u2014unanimously recommended Professor Hamilton to the Board of Trustees.   He will assume the presidency of one of the largest private universities in the U.S., with approximately 50,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In addition to its campus in New York\u2019s historic Greenwich Village neighborhood\u2014which the University has called home since the early 1830\u2019s\u2014NYU has an unrivaled global network, including degree-granting, liberal arts, research university campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, as well as 11 additional Study Away sites throughout the world. NYU both educates more international students than any other U.S. college or university, and sends more students to study abroad.   In addition to his duties as president, Professor Hamilton plans to maintain an active program of teaching and research.   Martin Lipton, chair of the Board of Trustees said, \u201cNew York University is very pleased and excited to welcome Andrew Hamilton. NYU\u2014which has done so much over the previous four decades to transform itself into the world-class university it is today and remains committed to sustaining that academic trajectory \u2014demands much of a potential president: wisdom, intelligence, courage, energy, perseverance, stellar credentials as a scholar, and academic leadership of the highest caliber. Andrew Hamilton brings all these qualities and more. We know he will be a superb president and that he will advance NYU\u2019s teaching and research missions to a new level of excellence. My fellow Board members and I are completely confident we have found the right person to lead NYU and its global network, and we are proud and glad to have him join our community.   \u201cOn behalf of the entire Board, I would like to thank the members of the Search Committee\u2014and particularly its chair, my fellow trustee William Berkley\u2014for their dedication, hard work, and discernment. Thanks to their excellent judgment and great efforts, we found the ideal candidate. The University owes them a debt of great gratitude.\u201d   William Berkley, chair of the Search Committee and Chair-Designate of the Board of Trustees, said, \u201cThe Search Committee\u2014aided by the guidance we received from the more than two dozen listening sessions we attended\u2014worked together seamlessly on our shared goal: to find the best possible president for NYU. What focused us on Andrew Hamilton and set him apart from a formidable field of candidates was the unusual combination of his outstanding scholarship in his field, his record of achievement in leadership posts at top universities, his commitment to academic excellence and support for the faculty, his commitment to teaching and undergraduate education, his accomplishments in fundraising at Oxford, and his global background and outlook. We were also struck by his great intelligence, personal warmth, energy and entrepreneurial spirit, and natural feel for complex institutions. Everywhere he has served has benefited from the quality and style of his leadership. And it was clear to us that he understood NYU\u2014our urban character, our distinctive global presence, our vibrancy, our focus on the future, our innovative spirit, our sense of being on the move, and our habit of exceeding others\u2019 expectations.   \u201cIn short, the committee believed that Andrew Hamilton was the just the right person at this moment in NYU\u2019s history to build on the University\u2019s academic momentum and lead it to even greater achievements.\u201d   NYU President-Designate Hamilton said, \u201cI am delighted to be selected as NYU\u2019s 16th president. I have been a keen observer of NYU, its accomplishments, its trajectory, and its renowned president, John Sexton, for some time. It is difficult not to take notice of an institution that has proven itself again and again to be a game-changer in a field in which that is uncommon. So when the search began, I was very glad to be included, as I am honored now to have been named president of such a wonderful university. I am looking forward with great eagerness to working with NYU\u2019s faculty, students, administrators, and staff, and to joining a university that is so manifestly energetic, innovative, and successful.\u201d   Andrew Hamilton has been Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford since 2009. Prior to that, he was the Provost of Yale University, where he was also the Benjamin Silliman Professor of Chemistry and Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry; he joined the Yale faculty in 1997. He joined the University of Pittsburgh in 1988, where was a tenured Professor of Chemistry and Chair of the Chemistry Department. Before joining the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh, he was an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Princeton University.   His area of scholarly interest lies at the intersection of organic and biologic chemistry, with particular focus on the use of synthetic design for the understanding, mimicry, and potential disruption of biological processes. He is widely published and the recipient of numerous awards and honors. A list of his publications can be found here . Among his many honors and awards, he is the recipient of the Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award from the American Chemical Society, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2004, he was elected a member of American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and he was the 2011 winner of the International Izatt-Christiansen Award for Macrocyclic Chemistry.   Professor Hamilton received a first class BSc from the University of Exeter, his master\u2019s degree from the University of British Columbia, and his doctorate from the University of Cambridge. He did post-doctoral work at the Universit\u00e9 Louis Pasteur.   Professor Hamilton is married. He and his wife, Jennie, have three adult children who all live in the United States\u2014in New York, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles.   NYU President John Sexton said, \u201cI love NYU, and I could not be more thrilled with the selection of Andrew Hamilton. I know and admire him, and I am certain he will do great things for the University. For my own part, I have had no higher calling in my life than to be a teacher and to contribute to building strong institutions. For nearly 35 years, I have had the exceptional privilege of being able to do both those things at NYU. I want to thank the trustees, faculty, students, and administrators for permitting me to serve as their president and for doing so much to improve the university during my tenure.\u201d   Mr. Lipton\u2014speaking of NYU\u2019s current president, John Sexton\u2014said, \u201cWe could not announce the happy news of Andrew Hamilton\u2019s appointment without remarking on his predecessor. That NYU could attract an academic leader of Andrew Hamilton\u2019s stature is proof of how far NYU has come. Many people had a hand in building this great university over the decades\u2014faculty, trustees, deans, alumni/ae, students, administrators\u2014but arguably none more so than John Sexton. Doubling the applicants for freshman admission, more than doubling the financial aid budget, improving student diversity, expanding the tenured and tenure-track faculty, launching new areas of scholarly inquiry, growing our international stature, opening new campuses abroad, raising some $5 billion, and tripling the endowment \u2014it seems hard to believe all this and more was accomplished in just a single presidency. John always said to the Board that the highest role he saw for himself was to leave the University in better shape for his successor than when he took on the presidency. In that noble goal, he was eminently successful, and for his more than 30 years of distinguished and dedicated service to this University, he has the unflagging thanks of the NYU community.\u201d   The Search Committee was assisted by the executive recruitment firm Isaacson Miller and its principal, John Isaacson.

He will officially take up his duties in January 2016.   Professor Hamilton\u2019s selection follows an eight-month, international search process conducted by a Search Committee of trustees, faculty, students, and administrators. The Committee\u2014which began the search with over 200 nominees\u2014unanimously recommended Professor Hamilton to the Board of Trustees.   He will assume the presidency of one of the largest private universities in the U.S., with approximately 50,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In addition to its campus in New York\u2019s historic Greenwich Village neighborhood\u2014which the University has called home since the early 1830\u2019s\u2014NYU has an unrivaled global network, including degree-granting, liberal arts, research university campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, as well as 11 additional Study Away sites throughout the world. NYU both educates more international students than any other U.S. college or university, and sends more students to study abroad.   In addition to his duties as president, Professor Hamilton plans to maintain an active program of teaching and research.   Martin Lipton, chair of the Board of Trustees said, \u201cNew York University is very pleased and excited to welcome Andrew Hamilton. NYU\u2014which has done so much over the previous four decades to transform itself into the world-class university it is today and remains committed to sustaining that academic trajectory \u2014demands much of a potential president: wisdom, intelligence, courage, energy, perseverance, stellar credentials as a scholar, and academic leadership of the highest caliber. Andrew Hamilton brings all these qualities and more. We know he will be a superb president and that he will advance NYU\u2019s teaching and research missions to a new level of excellence. My fellow Board members and I are completely confident we have found the right person to lead NYU and its global network, and we are proud and glad to have him join our community.   \u201cOn behalf of the entire Board, I would like to thank the members of the Search Committee\u2014and particularly its chair, my fellow trustee William Berkley\u2014for their dedication, hard work, and discernment. Thanks to their excellent judgment and great efforts, we found the ideal candidate. The University owes them a debt of great gratitude.\u201d   William Berkley, chair of the Search Committee and Chair-Designate of the Board of Trustees, said, \u201cThe Search Committee\u2014aided by the guidance we received from the more than two dozen listening sessions we attended\u2014worked together seamlessly on our shared goal: to find the best possible president for NYU. What focused us on Andrew Hamilton and set him apart from a formidable field of candidates was the unusual combination of his outstanding scholarship in his field, his record of achievement in leadership posts at top universities, his commitment to academic excellence and support for the faculty, his commitment to teaching and undergraduate education, his accomplishments in fundraising at Oxford, and his global background and outlook. We were also struck by his great intelligence, personal warmth, energy and entrepreneurial spirit, and natural feel for complex institutions. Everywhere he has served has benefited from the quality and style of his leadership. And it was clear to us that he understood NYU\u2014our urban character, our distinctive global presence, our vibrancy, our focus on the future, our innovative spirit, our sense of being on the move, and our habit of exceeding others\u2019 expectations.   \u201cIn short, the committee believed that Andrew Hamilton was the just the right person at this moment in NYU\u2019s history to build on the University\u2019s academic momentum and lead it to even greater achievements.\u201d   NYU President-Designate Hamilton said, \u201cI am delighted to be selected as NYU\u2019s 16th president. I have been a keen observer of NYU, its accomplishments, its trajectory, and its renowned president, John Sexton, for some time. It is difficult not to take notice of an institution that has proven itself again and again to be a game-changer in a field in which that is uncommon. So when the search began, I was very glad to be included, as I am honored now to have been named president of such a wonderful university. I am looking forward with great eagerness to working with NYU\u2019s faculty, students, administrators, and staff, and to joining a university that is so manifestly energetic, innovative, and successful.\u201d   Andrew Hamilton has been Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford since 2009. Prior to that, he was the Provost of Yale University, where he was also the Benjamin Silliman Professor of Chemistry and Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry; he joined the Yale faculty in 1997. He joined the University of Pittsburgh in 1988, where was a tenured Professor of Chemistry and Chair of the Chemistry Department. Before joining the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh, he was an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Princeton University.   His area of scholarly interest lies at the intersection of organic and biologic chemistry, with particular focus on the use of synthetic design for the understanding, mimicry, and potential disruption of biological processes. He is widely published and the recipient of numerous awards and honors. A list of his publications can be found here . Among his many honors and awards, he is the recipient of the Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award from the American Chemical Society, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2004, he was elected a member of American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and he was the 2011 winner of the International Izatt-Christiansen Award for Macrocyclic Chemistry.   Professor Hamilton received a first class BSc from the University of Exeter, his master\u2019s degree from the University of British Columbia, and his doctorate from the University of Cambridge. He did post-doctoral work at the Universit\u00e9 Louis Pasteur.   Professor Hamilton is married. He and his wife, Jennie, have three adult children who all live in the United States\u2014in New York, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles.   NYU President John Sexton said, \u201cI love NYU, and I could not be more thrilled with the selection of Andrew Hamilton. I know and admire him, and I am certain he will do great things for the University. For my own part, I have had no higher calling in my life than to be a teacher and to contribute to building strong institutions. For nearly 35 years, I have had the exceptional privilege of being able to do both those things at NYU. I want to thank the trustees, faculty, students, and administrators for permitting me to serve as their president and for doing so much to improve the university during my tenure.\u201d   Mr. Lipton\u2014speaking of NYU\u2019s current president, John Sexton\u2014said, \u201cWe could not announce the happy news of Andrew Hamilton\u2019s appointment without remarking on his predecessor. That NYU could attract an academic leader of Andrew Hamilton\u2019s stature is proof of how far NYU has come. Many people had a hand in building this great university over the decades\u2014faculty, trustees, deans, alumni/ae, students, administrators\u2014but arguably none more so than John Sexton. Doubling the applicants for freshman admission, more than doubling the financial aid budget, improving student diversity, expanding the tenured and tenure-track faculty, launching new areas of scholarly inquiry, growing our international stature, opening new campuses abroad, raising some $5 billion, and tripling the endowment \u2014it seems hard to believe all this and more was accomplished in just a single presidency. John always said to the Board that the highest role he saw for himself was to leave the University in better shape for his successor than when he took on the presidency. In that noble goal, he was eminently successful, and for his more than 30 years of distinguished and dedicated service to this University, he has the unflagging thanks of the NYU community.\u201d   The Search Committee was assisted by the executive recruitment firm Isaacson Miller and its principal, John Isaacson.

The painting (Oil on canvas transferred to pressed wood and measuring 254.6 x 205.7 cm or 100 \u00bc x 81 in) is considered to be one of the finest examples of high Renaissance altarpieces and the most important painting by the artist in North America. The altarpiece will be on view April 5, 6, and 7 from 1 to 5 p.m. daily in the Loeb Room at the Institute, located at 1 East 78th Street. The exhibition is free and open to the public. Following the exhibition, the painting will be returned to The San Francisco Museum of Art in time for its reopening, slated for late 2005. For more information, please visit: www.ifa.nyu.edu .  Dianne Dwyer Modestini, Paintings Conservator for the Kress Program in Paintings Conservation and Institute Lecturer, carried out the restoration. Assisting her in the project were Nica Gutman, associate conservator, and IFA graduates Monica Griesbach and Matthew Hayes. \u201cWe are delighted to play host to this unique opportunity being offered to New Yorkers to glimpse a magnificent example of high Renaissance painting before its return to San Francisco,\u201d said Michele Marincola, Sherman Fairchild Chairman of the Conservation Center at the Institute of Fine Arts. \u201cDianne and her team have completed a challenging restoration with wonderful results. We are excited to have the opportunity to exhibit an important painting and celebrate its successful treatment.\u201d A lecture will be held on Tuesday, April 5 at the IFA, with presentations by Colin Eisler, Robert Lehman Professor of Fine Arts, and Dianne Dwyer Modestini, to be followed by a reception. (The lecture and reception are by invitation only.)  The Madonna and Child with Saint John the Baptist and Saint George was painted for a group of Genoese merchants for their Oratory attached to the church of St. Dominic in Messina, Sicily early in the second decade of the 16th century but before 1515. The Oratory was torn down in the late 18th century and the altarpiece sold to Sir John Acton, prime minister of the Kingdom of Naples under Ferdinand IV. Acquired by Samuel H. Kress in 1949, the painting was donated to the San Francisco Museum of Art by the Kress Foundation. Cesare da Sesto was a Milanese painter, born in 1477, perhaps in Sesto Calende, not far from the city, and his death is recorded in Milan on July 27, 1523. Cesare was a close follower of Leonardo da Vinci and traveled to Rome in 1508 to work in the Vatican for Pope Julius II. While in Rome, he was an assistant to Baldassare Peruzzi and developed a friendship with Raphael, who had a great influence on his work. Da Sesto was also influenced by the Venetians, particularly evident in this altarpiece from the Kress collection with its reminiscences of Giorgione\u2019s Castelfranco Madonna .  Founded in 1960, the Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts is dedicated to the study of the technology and conservation of works of art and historic artifacts. It prepares students for careers in conservation through a four-year program that combines practical experience in conservation with historical, archaeological, curatorial, and scientific studies of the materials and construction of works of art. Students complete a Master\u2019s degree in Art History at the Institute of Fine Arts, one of the premier centers of graduate education in art history in the United States, and receive an Advanced Certificate in Conservation.  Established in 1992, through the generosity of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, the Kress Program in Paintings Conservation is an advanced training program in the conservation of Old Master paintings at the Center. This unique program, which provides expert instruction in the treatment of paintings to graduate students, draws on the large number of Kress Collection paintings that are housed in institutions without resident conservation departments. As Kress Conservator, Dianne Dwyer Modestini carefully selects pictures that are suitable as student projects. In addition, Professor Modestini identifies a smaller number of paintings with more complex condition problems for treatment by her and Associate Conservator Nica Gutman.
