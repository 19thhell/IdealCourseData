Course Level: Intermediate No prerequisite    This course provides a broad overview of world cinema from its origins until the emergence of modern cinema in the 1960's. It addresses numerous national cinemas (French, German, Italian, Japanese, Scandinavian, Soviet, British, Indian) and examines both how representative films from each country emerges out of its national culture and also negotiates with the dominant aesthetic of Hollywood film. The approach will be stylistic, including the development of narrative, various cinematic modernisms, and technological advances such as the introduction of sound; industrial, including the formation of the studio system and the creation of national film cultures in response; and social, including propaganda and political (leftist) films and documentaries. Whenever possible, this course emphasizes the cross-pollination of film styles across national cultures such as the mutual influence of 1920's avant-garde movements, the concentration of political filmmaking in the 1930's, or the influence of neorealism on post-war cinema. Some films to be screened: Strike, L'age d'or, M, Housing Problems, Umberto D, Tokyo Story , and Pather Panchali.
