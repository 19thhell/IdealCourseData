All first year CLACS MA students must register for this course. Others are also welcome.  Course Description:     Course Description: Part II of the required introductory course sequence begins with the independence era. Students learn about contending paradigms of sovereignty, patrimony, liberalism, citizenship, and development. The course explores continuing problems of inequality and the impact of pressure by other countries and international organizations on political and economic arrangements in the region. Alongside such issues, students are introduced to expressive culture and the arts, to competing paradigms of formal and commemorative memory and history, and to the emergence of tourism and the UNESCO-associated \u201cculture industry.\u201d The course ends with in-depth analysis of the impact of globalization, neoliberal policies, emerging social movements, increased political participation and decentralization of governance, and the rise of populist governments.  Back to top      Colloquium Course     LATC-GA 2590 \u2013 Latin American Independence in the Age of Revolution (same as HIST-GA 2800) Day/Time: Monday 2:00pm - 4:45pm, plus Monday evening lectures Prof. Sibylle Fischer and Prof. Sinclair Thomson Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Description: This interdisciplinary seminar explores Latin American independence through readings in political history, political theory, and cultural studies. We will pay special attention to primary sources (including chronicles, philosophical disquisitions, pamphlets and propaganda, speeches, constitutions, travelers\u2019 accounts) and the distinctive and complementary aspects of historiographic and literary approaches. Concepts to be discussed include \u201crevolution,\u201d \u201csovereignty,\u201d \u201croyalism,\u201d \u201cnationalism,\u201d \u201cconstituent/constituted power,\u201d \u201crepublicanism,\u201d \u201cemancipation,\u201d and \u201cfree soil doctrine.\u201d One unit of the class will focus on the cults and myth-making surrounding independence heroes. The seminar will tackle some of the controversial issues of recent years and explore their implications for an understanding of the revolutionary age: Do the events of Latin American independence pertain to the history of the revolutionary Atlantic? Were the causes of independence structural and internal to Latin America, or rather contingent and derived from the political crisis in the metropolis? How did contemporaries conceive of sovereignty and the political relationship between the Americas and Europe? What was the role of slavery and anti-slavery in the struggle for independence? What role did subaltern actors play? Discussion will be in English, but reading knowledge of Spanish is required. The seminar will be accompanied by a Distinguished Speakers lecture series. view a previous syllabus here.    Back to top      Seminars     LATC-GA 1014 \u2013 The Color of Race in the Americas (same as ANTH-GA 3396)    Day/Time: Monday, 5:00pm - 7:45pm Prof: Aisha Khan Location: tba    Course Description:   The problems of identity\u2014what they are made of, why they are significant, and who gets to claim (or decline) them\u2014have been vital issues in human history, not the least being the past half a millennium in the Americas. Such distinctions as \u201cself\u201d/\u201cother,\u201d \u201cus\u201d/\u201cthem\u201d comprise notions of similarity and difference that are fundamental to the way social relations are organized. From about the 16th century, however, with the rise of European colonialism, capitalism, the encounters among peoples unfamiliar to each other, the development of the sciences and scientific forms of knowledge, and new ideas about modernity, notions of identity distinctions took on new debates and in some cases more diverse expressions. This seminar will look in particular at race and color as fundamental social and epistemological building blocks of the Americas. Emphasizing ethnographic approaches, but also drawing on a variety of interdisciplinary sources (classics and recent works of non-fiction, film, and fiction), this course will explore such key questions as:   *If race and color are ways of categorizing identity rather than being inherited essences of identity(according to most scholars and activists), then how and why are race and color still so powerful in shaping social life and experience? *Do race and color signify the same things? Are they mutually dependent classifications?      *What is the relationship of race and color to other kinds of social differentiation, such as gender, class,sexuality, or citizenship?   *How do race and color become embedded parts of the cultural landscape of countries, regions, and hemispheres? *Do \u201cmixed race\u201d and \u201ccolor continuums\u201d democratize social hierarchies?   *Does a \u201cpost-racist\u201d world require a \u201cpost-racial\u201d world?         LATC-GA 1017 \u2013 Government and Politics of Latin America Day/Time: Tuesday, 5:00pm - 7:00pm Prof. Patricio Navia Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Description: As a social science, political science differs from other disciplines in that its basic object of study is the State and the way individuals and groups of individuals relate, interact and respond to the State. Political parties, institutions and collective behavior of individuals are central components in the field. Thus, political science will often focus more on political parties, the military, government bureaucracies and revolutionary forces than on labor unions, peasants or disposed groups. In short, political science tends to show a bias towards elite studies. Perhaps as a signal that traditionally disposed groups are acquiring greater political power, non-elite studies have grown and enriched the field in recent years. Yet, the primary research focus continues to be the State and how different groups influence (or seek to influence) the State.    Past Syllabus      LATC-GA 1048 \u2013Human Rights in Latin America same as DRAP-GA 1048 Day/Time: Thursday, 6:00pm - 9:00pm Prof. Peter Lucas Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: In this graduate seminar, students will examine human rights case studies in Latin America, popular resistance and social movements in Latin America, the role of media and representation in reporting and promoting human rights, and educational initiatives for human rights. We will especially study the many choices society has after collective violence. Latin America remains a fascinating region to study human rights as the last two decades have stood out as a period of reckoning and bearing witness of past atrocities. In the wake of serious violence, countries continue to struggle with issues of justice, reconciliation, truth, remembering, and healing. Over the years there have been many different responses to collective violence in Latin America and these strategies continue to evolve and change. This course will study the range of these responses not only to reconcile human rights violations of the past but also to build a culture of human rights and peace in the future.      LATC-GA 1020 \u2013 Citizenships from Below (Latin America & The Caribbean) Day/Time: Tuesday, 10:00am - 12:30pm Prof. Edgardo P\u00e9rez Morales Location: 404W KJCC See Syllabus Course Description: This seminar will critically approach three paradigms that have shaped the construction of the nation-state and the emergence of citizenships in Latin America and the Caribbean: the Enlightenment, Emancipation and Multiculturalism. These intersecting political paradigms have been more clearly articulated by privileged individuals such as Bol\u00edvar, Mart\u00ed or Freyre. However, we will study the social processes behind these paradigms, highlighting the role, challenges and contradictions of collective action, and the interplay between political discourse and everyday life experiences. This seminar will examine citizenship not merely as a political category but as a dynamic social process of political belonging. Students will read bibliography regarding different but interconnected places such as Brazil, Mexico, Cuba, Colombia, and even intensely Caribbean New Orleans.    LATC-GA 1030 - Legal Pluralisms and Racial Politics in Early Modern Iberian Empires (same as HIST-GA1002)    Day/Time: R 2:00pm - 4:45pm Location: tba Prof. Jean-Frederic Schaub Course description: In studying the societies of the late Middle Ages and the Early Modern era, the question arises of the incompatibility between, on the one hand, Saint Paul's message (\"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" Galatians [3-28]\"), and rules of segregation founded upon an assertion of natural inferiority and the inability of people to change, on the other. The most salient case in Early Modern Europe was the fate of the descendants of converts in Iberian societies, branches of families that had been Jewish or Muslim, before those faiths were outlawed. The conversion created a situation in which families that had previously been denied all access to statuses, offices, and advantages reserved for Christians alone, could integrate into society as converts. The success of this transformation, however, provoked a counter-reaction from the social majority. This took the form of institutions of various kinds--universities, schools, religious and military orders, brotherhoods, courts, municipalities, etc--adopting statutes of blood purity. The purpose of these rules was to deny access to Christians descended from converted Jews or Muslims, no matter how far back the conversion of their ancestors.Such a series of rules provided a framework to face the social complexity of colonial societies in the Iberian colonies as well. Full course description LATC-GA 2030 \u2013 Ethnographic Methods in Latin America and the Caribbean Day/Time: T 2:00pm - 4:30pm Location: KJCC 404W Prof. Katherine Smith     Course Description: This course will introduce students to ethnographic methods, offer an overview of different types of ethnography, and reflect critically on the practice of ethnography. Through a series of fieldwork exercises and readings students will learn practical skills related to fieldwork, such as note-taking and interviewing. The course readings will also survey different ethnographic perspectives--such as feminist ethnography, thick description, visual ethnography, and historical ethnography--each of which engenders certain critiques of the limits of qualitative research and empiricism.        Quechua Courses  No permissions are required to register for a Quechua course    LATC-GA 10 - Beginning Quechua I (same as SPAN - UA 81) Day/Time: MTR, 9:30am - 10:45am Prof. Odi Gonzales Location: tba Course Syllabus Course Description: Quechua is the most important and most widely distributed indigenous language in South America, with about 10 million speakers living from the high mountains to the tropical lowlands in Colombia (where the language is called Ingano), Ecuador (where it is called kichwa or runa shimi, \"human speech\"), Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina (where it is usually spelled Quechua and called, by its speakers, runa simi). Studying Quechua opens a window onto alternative ways of thinking about social worlds, about space and time, family, and humans' relationship with the natural world. Quechua is recommended for students anticipating travel to the Andean region, those interested in language and linguistics, and those interested in indigenous literatures and cultures. Students who satisfactorily complete introductory Quechua will be well-prepared for intensive summer study at one of many summer study abroad programs in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia that will put them in closer contact with the indigenous world.

All first year CLACS MA students must register for this course. Others are also welcome.  Course Description:     Course Description: Part II of the required introductory course sequence begins with the independence era. Students learn about contending paradigms of sovereignty, patrimony, liberalism, citizenship, and development. The course explores continuing problems of inequality and the impact of pressure by other countries and international organizations on political and economic arrangements in the region. Alongside such issues, students are introduced to expressive culture and the arts, to competing paradigms of formal and commemorative memory and history, and to the emergence of tourism and the UNESCO-associated \u201cculture industry.\u201d The course ends with in-depth analysis of the impact of globalization, neoliberal policies, emerging social movements, increased political participation and decentralization of governance, and the rise of populist governments.  Back to top      Colloquium Course     LATC-GA 2590 \u2013 Latin American Independence in the Age of Revolution (same as HIST-GA 2800) Day/Time: Monday 2:00pm - 4:45pm, plus Monday evening lectures Prof. Sibylle Fischer and Prof. Sinclair Thomson Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Description: This interdisciplinary seminar explores Latin American independence through readings in political history, political theory, and cultural studies. We will pay special attention to primary sources (including chronicles, philosophical disquisitions, pamphlets and propaganda, speeches, constitutions, travelers\u2019 accounts) and the distinctive and complementary aspects of historiographic and literary approaches. Concepts to be discussed include \u201crevolution,\u201d \u201csovereignty,\u201d \u201croyalism,\u201d \u201cnationalism,\u201d \u201cconstituent/constituted power,\u201d \u201crepublicanism,\u201d \u201cemancipation,\u201d and \u201cfree soil doctrine.\u201d One unit of the class will focus on the cults and myth-making surrounding independence heroes. The seminar will tackle some of the controversial issues of recent years and explore their implications for an understanding of the revolutionary age: Do the events of Latin American independence pertain to the history of the revolutionary Atlantic? Were the causes of independence structural and internal to Latin America, or rather contingent and derived from the political crisis in the metropolis? How did contemporaries conceive of sovereignty and the political relationship between the Americas and Europe? What was the role of slavery and anti-slavery in the struggle for independence? What role did subaltern actors play? Discussion will be in English, but reading knowledge of Spanish is required. The seminar will be accompanied by a Distinguished Speakers lecture series. view a previous syllabus here.    Back to top      Seminars     LATC-GA 1014 \u2013 The Color of Race in the Americas (same as ANTH-GA 3396)    Day/Time: Monday, 5:00pm - 7:45pm Prof: Aisha Khan Location: tba    Course Description:   The problems of identity\u2014what they are made of, why they are significant, and who gets to claim (or decline) them\u2014have been vital issues in human history, not the least being the past half a millennium in the Americas. Such distinctions as \u201cself\u201d/\u201cother,\u201d \u201cus\u201d/\u201cthem\u201d comprise notions of similarity and difference that are fundamental to the way social relations are organized. From about the 16th century, however, with the rise of European colonialism, capitalism, the encounters among peoples unfamiliar to each other, the development of the sciences and scientific forms of knowledge, and new ideas about modernity, notions of identity distinctions took on new debates and in some cases more diverse expressions. This seminar will look in particular at race and color as fundamental social and epistemological building blocks of the Americas. Emphasizing ethnographic approaches, but also drawing on a variety of interdisciplinary sources (classics and recent works of non-fiction, film, and fiction), this course will explore such key questions as:   *If race and color are ways of categorizing identity rather than being inherited essences of identity(according to most scholars and activists), then how and why are race and color still so powerful in shaping social life and experience? *Do race and color signify the same things? Are they mutually dependent classifications?      *What is the relationship of race and color to other kinds of social differentiation, such as gender, class,sexuality, or citizenship?   *How do race and color become embedded parts of the cultural landscape of countries, regions, and hemispheres? *Do \u201cmixed race\u201d and \u201ccolor continuums\u201d democratize social hierarchies?   *Does a \u201cpost-racist\u201d world require a \u201cpost-racial\u201d world?         LATC-GA 1017 \u2013 Government and Politics of Latin America Day/Time: Tuesday, 5:00pm - 7:00pm Prof. Patricio Navia Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Description: As a social science, political science differs from other disciplines in that its basic object of study is the State and the way individuals and groups of individuals relate, interact and respond to the State. Political parties, institutions and collective behavior of individuals are central components in the field. Thus, political science will often focus more on political parties, the military, government bureaucracies and revolutionary forces than on labor unions, peasants or disposed groups. In short, political science tends to show a bias towards elite studies. Perhaps as a signal that traditionally disposed groups are acquiring greater political power, non-elite studies have grown and enriched the field in recent years. Yet, the primary research focus continues to be the State and how different groups influence (or seek to influence) the State.    Past Syllabus      LATC-GA 1048 \u2013Human Rights in Latin America same as DRAP-GA 1048 Day/Time: Thursday, 6:00pm - 9:00pm Prof. Peter Lucas Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: In this graduate seminar, students will examine human rights case studies in Latin America, popular resistance and social movements in Latin America, the role of media and representation in reporting and promoting human rights, and educational initiatives for human rights. We will especially study the many choices society has after collective violence. Latin America remains a fascinating region to study human rights as the last two decades have stood out as a period of reckoning and bearing witness of past atrocities. In the wake of serious violence, countries continue to struggle with issues of justice, reconciliation, truth, remembering, and healing. Over the years there have been many different responses to collective violence in Latin America and these strategies continue to evolve and change. This course will study the range of these responses not only to reconcile human rights violations of the past but also to build a culture of human rights and peace in the future.      LATC-GA 1020 \u2013 Citizenships from Below (Latin America & The Caribbean) Day/Time: Tuesday, 10:00am - 12:30pm Prof. Edgardo P\u00e9rez Morales Location: 404W KJCC See Syllabus Course Description: This seminar will critically approach three paradigms that have shaped the construction of the nation-state and the emergence of citizenships in Latin America and the Caribbean: the Enlightenment, Emancipation and Multiculturalism. These intersecting political paradigms have been more clearly articulated by privileged individuals such as Bol\u00edvar, Mart\u00ed or Freyre. However, we will study the social processes behind these paradigms, highlighting the role, challenges and contradictions of collective action, and the interplay between political discourse and everyday life experiences. This seminar will examine citizenship not merely as a political category but as a dynamic social process of political belonging. Students will read bibliography regarding different but interconnected places such as Brazil, Mexico, Cuba, Colombia, and even intensely Caribbean New Orleans.    LATC-GA 1030 - Legal Pluralisms and Racial Politics in Early Modern Iberian Empires (same as HIST-GA1002)    Day/Time: R 2:00pm - 4:45pm Location: tba Prof. Jean-Frederic Schaub Course description: In studying the societies of the late Middle Ages and the Early Modern era, the question arises of the incompatibility between, on the one hand, Saint Paul's message (\"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" Galatians [3-28]\"), and rules of segregation founded upon an assertion of natural inferiority and the inability of people to change, on the other. The most salient case in Early Modern Europe was the fate of the descendants of converts in Iberian societies, branches of families that had been Jewish or Muslim, before those faiths were outlawed. The conversion created a situation in which families that had previously been denied all access to statuses, offices, and advantages reserved for Christians alone, could integrate into society as converts. The success of this transformation, however, provoked a counter-reaction from the social majority. This took the form of institutions of various kinds--universities, schools, religious and military orders, brotherhoods, courts, municipalities, etc--adopting statutes of blood purity. The purpose of these rules was to deny access to Christians descended from converted Jews or Muslims, no matter how far back the conversion of their ancestors.Such a series of rules provided a framework to face the social complexity of colonial societies in the Iberian colonies as well. Full course description LATC-GA 2030 \u2013 Ethnographic Methods in Latin America and the Caribbean Day/Time: T 2:00pm - 4:30pm Location: KJCC 404W Prof. Katherine Smith     Course Description: This course will introduce students to ethnographic methods, offer an overview of different types of ethnography, and reflect critically on the practice of ethnography. Through a series of fieldwork exercises and readings students will learn practical skills related to fieldwork, such as note-taking and interviewing. The course readings will also survey different ethnographic perspectives--such as feminist ethnography, thick description, visual ethnography, and historical ethnography--each of which engenders certain critiques of the limits of qualitative research and empiricism.        Quechua Courses  No permissions are required to register for a Quechua course    LATC-GA 10 - Beginning Quechua I (same as SPAN - UA 81) Day/Time: MTR, 9:30am - 10:45am Prof. Odi Gonzales Location: tba Course Syllabus Course Description: Quechua is the most important and most widely distributed indigenous language in South America, with about 10 million speakers living from the high mountains to the tropical lowlands in Colombia (where the language is called Ingano), Ecuador (where it is called kichwa or runa shimi, \"human speech\"), Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina (where it is usually spelled Quechua and called, by its speakers, runa simi). Studying Quechua opens a window onto alternative ways of thinking about social worlds, about space and time, family, and humans' relationship with the natural world. Quechua is recommended for students anticipating travel to the Andean region, those interested in language and linguistics, and those interested in indigenous literatures and cultures. Students who satisfactorily complete introductory Quechua will be well-prepared for intensive summer study at one of many summer study abroad programs in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia that will put them in closer contact with the indigenous world.

All first year CLACS MA students must register for this course. Others are also welcome.  Course Description:     Course Description: Part II of the required introductory course sequence begins with the independence era. Students learn about contending paradigms of sovereignty, patrimony, liberalism, citizenship, and development. The course explores continuing problems of inequality and the impact of pressure by other countries and international organizations on political and economic arrangements in the region. Alongside such issues, students are introduced to expressive culture and the arts, to competing paradigms of formal and commemorative memory and history, and to the emergence of tourism and the UNESCO-associated \u201cculture industry.\u201d The course ends with in-depth analysis of the impact of globalization, neoliberal policies, emerging social movements, increased political participation and decentralization of governance, and the rise of populist governments.  Back to top      Colloquium Course     LATC-GA 2590 \u2013 Latin American Independence in the Age of Revolution (same as HIST-GA 2800) Day/Time: Monday 2:00pm - 4:45pm, plus Monday evening lectures Prof. Sibylle Fischer and Prof. Sinclair Thomson Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Description: This interdisciplinary seminar explores Latin American independence through readings in political history, political theory, and cultural studies. We will pay special attention to primary sources (including chronicles, philosophical disquisitions, pamphlets and propaganda, speeches, constitutions, travelers\u2019 accounts) and the distinctive and complementary aspects of historiographic and literary approaches. Concepts to be discussed include \u201crevolution,\u201d \u201csovereignty,\u201d \u201croyalism,\u201d \u201cnationalism,\u201d \u201cconstituent/constituted power,\u201d \u201crepublicanism,\u201d \u201cemancipation,\u201d and \u201cfree soil doctrine.\u201d One unit of the class will focus on the cults and myth-making surrounding independence heroes. The seminar will tackle some of the controversial issues of recent years and explore their implications for an understanding of the revolutionary age: Do the events of Latin American independence pertain to the history of the revolutionary Atlantic? Were the causes of independence structural and internal to Latin America, or rather contingent and derived from the political crisis in the metropolis? How did contemporaries conceive of sovereignty and the political relationship between the Americas and Europe? What was the role of slavery and anti-slavery in the struggle for independence? What role did subaltern actors play? Discussion will be in English, but reading knowledge of Spanish is required. The seminar will be accompanied by a Distinguished Speakers lecture series. view a previous syllabus here.    Back to top      Seminars     LATC-GA 1014 \u2013 The Color of Race in the Americas (same as ANTH-GA 3396)    Day/Time: Monday, 5:00pm - 7:45pm Prof: Aisha Khan Location: tba    Course Description:   The problems of identity\u2014what they are made of, why they are significant, and who gets to claim (or decline) them\u2014have been vital issues in human history, not the least being the past half a millennium in the Americas. Such distinctions as \u201cself\u201d/\u201cother,\u201d \u201cus\u201d/\u201cthem\u201d comprise notions of similarity and difference that are fundamental to the way social relations are organized. From about the 16th century, however, with the rise of European colonialism, capitalism, the encounters among peoples unfamiliar to each other, the development of the sciences and scientific forms of knowledge, and new ideas about modernity, notions of identity distinctions took on new debates and in some cases more diverse expressions. This seminar will look in particular at race and color as fundamental social and epistemological building blocks of the Americas. Emphasizing ethnographic approaches, but also drawing on a variety of interdisciplinary sources (classics and recent works of non-fiction, film, and fiction), this course will explore such key questions as:   *If race and color are ways of categorizing identity rather than being inherited essences of identity(according to most scholars and activists), then how and why are race and color still so powerful in shaping social life and experience? *Do race and color signify the same things? Are they mutually dependent classifications?      *What is the relationship of race and color to other kinds of social differentiation, such as gender, class,sexuality, or citizenship?   *How do race and color become embedded parts of the cultural landscape of countries, regions, and hemispheres? *Do \u201cmixed race\u201d and \u201ccolor continuums\u201d democratize social hierarchies?   *Does a \u201cpost-racist\u201d world require a \u201cpost-racial\u201d world?         LATC-GA 1017 \u2013 Government and Politics of Latin America Day/Time: Tuesday, 5:00pm - 7:00pm Prof. Patricio Navia Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Description: As a social science, political science differs from other disciplines in that its basic object of study is the State and the way individuals and groups of individuals relate, interact and respond to the State. Political parties, institutions and collective behavior of individuals are central components in the field. Thus, political science will often focus more on political parties, the military, government bureaucracies and revolutionary forces than on labor unions, peasants or disposed groups. In short, political science tends to show a bias towards elite studies. Perhaps as a signal that traditionally disposed groups are acquiring greater political power, non-elite studies have grown and enriched the field in recent years. Yet, the primary research focus continues to be the State and how different groups influence (or seek to influence) the State.    Past Syllabus      LATC-GA 1048 \u2013Human Rights in Latin America same as DRAP-GA 1048 Day/Time: Thursday, 6:00pm - 9:00pm Prof. Peter Lucas Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: In this graduate seminar, students will examine human rights case studies in Latin America, popular resistance and social movements in Latin America, the role of media and representation in reporting and promoting human rights, and educational initiatives for human rights. We will especially study the many choices society has after collective violence. Latin America remains a fascinating region to study human rights as the last two decades have stood out as a period of reckoning and bearing witness of past atrocities. In the wake of serious violence, countries continue to struggle with issues of justice, reconciliation, truth, remembering, and healing. Over the years there have been many different responses to collective violence in Latin America and these strategies continue to evolve and change. This course will study the range of these responses not only to reconcile human rights violations of the past but also to build a culture of human rights and peace in the future.      LATC-GA 1020 \u2013 Citizenships from Below (Latin America & The Caribbean) Day/Time: Tuesday, 10:00am - 12:30pm Prof. Edgardo P\u00e9rez Morales Location: 404W KJCC See Syllabus Course Description: This seminar will critically approach three paradigms that have shaped the construction of the nation-state and the emergence of citizenships in Latin America and the Caribbean: the Enlightenment, Emancipation and Multiculturalism. These intersecting political paradigms have been more clearly articulated by privileged individuals such as Bol\u00edvar, Mart\u00ed or Freyre. However, we will study the social processes behind these paradigms, highlighting the role, challenges and contradictions of collective action, and the interplay between political discourse and everyday life experiences. This seminar will examine citizenship not merely as a political category but as a dynamic social process of political belonging. Students will read bibliography regarding different but interconnected places such as Brazil, Mexico, Cuba, Colombia, and even intensely Caribbean New Orleans.    LATC-GA 1030 - Legal Pluralisms and Racial Politics in Early Modern Iberian Empires (same as HIST-GA1002)    Day/Time: R 2:00pm - 4:45pm Location: tba Prof. Jean-Frederic Schaub Course description: In studying the societies of the late Middle Ages and the Early Modern era, the question arises of the incompatibility between, on the one hand, Saint Paul's message (\"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" Galatians [3-28]\"), and rules of segregation founded upon an assertion of natural inferiority and the inability of people to change, on the other. The most salient case in Early Modern Europe was the fate of the descendants of converts in Iberian societies, branches of families that had been Jewish or Muslim, before those faiths were outlawed. The conversion created a situation in which families that had previously been denied all access to statuses, offices, and advantages reserved for Christians alone, could integrate into society as converts. The success of this transformation, however, provoked a counter-reaction from the social majority. This took the form of institutions of various kinds--universities, schools, religious and military orders, brotherhoods, courts, municipalities, etc--adopting statutes of blood purity. The purpose of these rules was to deny access to Christians descended from converted Jews or Muslims, no matter how far back the conversion of their ancestors.Such a series of rules provided a framework to face the social complexity of colonial societies in the Iberian colonies as well. Full course description LATC-GA 2030 \u2013 Ethnographic Methods in Latin America and the Caribbean Day/Time: T 2:00pm - 4:30pm Location: KJCC 404W Prof. Katherine Smith     Course Description: This course will introduce students to ethnographic methods, offer an overview of different types of ethnography, and reflect critically on the practice of ethnography. Through a series of fieldwork exercises and readings students will learn practical skills related to fieldwork, such as note-taking and interviewing. The course readings will also survey different ethnographic perspectives--such as feminist ethnography, thick description, visual ethnography, and historical ethnography--each of which engenders certain critiques of the limits of qualitative research and empiricism.        Quechua Courses  No permissions are required to register for a Quechua course    LATC-GA 10 - Beginning Quechua I (same as SPAN - UA 81) Day/Time: MTR, 9:30am - 10:45am Prof. Odi Gonzales Location: tba Course Syllabus Course Description: Quechua is the most important and most widely distributed indigenous language in South America, with about 10 million speakers living from the high mountains to the tropical lowlands in Colombia (where the language is called Ingano), Ecuador (where it is called kichwa or runa shimi, \"human speech\"), Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina (where it is usually spelled Quechua and called, by its speakers, runa simi). Studying Quechua opens a window onto alternative ways of thinking about social worlds, about space and time, family, and humans' relationship with the natural world. Quechua is recommended for students anticipating travel to the Andean region, those interested in language and linguistics, and those interested in indigenous literatures and cultures. Students who satisfactorily complete introductory Quechua will be well-prepared for intensive summer study at one of many summer study abroad programs in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia that will put them in closer contact with the indigenous world.

An introduction to the disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to Latin American and Caribbean studies, with emphasis on pre-invasion Americas, the production of the imperial/colonial world. The course explores the genesis of plantation societies in throughout the Americas, studying the contrasting colonial projects of Spanish America, Portuguese Brazil, and the British, French, and Dutch Caribbean. Introduction to Latin American and Caribbean Studies II: Hemispheric and Postcolonial Perspectives LATC-GA 2001 Calla. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014\u201315. Part II of the required introductory course sequence begins with the independence era, and studies the emergence of a hemispheric axis for Latin America and the Caribbean in which relations with the United States loom large. Readings revolve around themes of class, race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality, with particular emphasis on the day-to-day processes of state formation and issues of governance. In this course, students are also prepared in research methods for fieldwork or archival research in preparation for their master's project. Elective Courses CLACS Topics: Beginning Quechua I LATC-GA 10 Gonzales. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. CLACS Topics: Beginning Quechua II LATC-GA 11 Gonzales. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. Intermediate Quechua LATC-GA 0020 Gonzales, Odi. 4 points. 2011-12, 2012-13. Government and Politics of Latin America LATC-GA 1017 Navia. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. In the 1990s, most Latin American countries embraced\u2014with different levels of enthusiasm\u2014the Washington Consensus neo-liberal economic reforms and electoral democracy became the norm in the region. Many believed Latin American had finally left behind a past of political instability, military coups, populism, revolutionary movements and radical political change. However, consolidating democracy proved to be much more difficult than attaining electoral democracy. In this course we explore the reasons why, and consider Latin America's capacity to develop strong institutions and a strong civil society\u2014two characteristics that often associated with consolidated democracies. International Human Rights in Latin America LATC-GA 1048 Lucas. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. In this graduate seminar, students will study the international human rights standards and principals, topical case studies in Latin America, the role of international and local NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in the human rights movement, popular resistance and social movements in the Latin American human rights movement, and the role of media and representation in reporting and promoting human rights. U.S.-Latin American Relations: WWI to the Present LATC-GA 2145 Casta\u00f1eda. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The course seeks to analyze the dynamics and issues that describe relations between the United States and Latin America since the end of World War II. A complete picture of the current state of affairs in the hemisphere and the reasons that led to it require an analysis in three different\u2014but related\u2014dimensions. To cover the first one, the course analyzes historical benchmarks that contextualize particular overt American interventions in the region, dissecting its causes, operation and consequences. In a second dimension, the course looks at topics that have permeated the relationship between the United States and Latin America over this period. Because of their typically cross-national nature, they illustrate a different set of dynamics and concerns that have fueled tensions in the relationship. A third and final dimension concerns recent developments in Latin America that affect and have been affected by U.S. foreign policy. CLACS Interdisciplinary Seminar LATC-GA 2590 Robbins, Fischer. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course is a co-taught, interdisciplinary seminar taught in both fall and spring semesters on themes related to Latin America and the Caribbean. The course runs in conjunction with a themed Colloquium speaker series, held on Monday evenings. Recent topics have been: What's Left of Cuba?, New Approaches to Colonial Latin America, Latin American Independence. Contemporary Racisms in the Americas LATC-GA 2590 Calla. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This seminar explores emergent forms of racism in the Americas and considers their impact on intercultural relations, racial and economic justice, and democracy. The emergence of these \"new racisms\" is largely uncharted terrain in the social sciences; we explore this phenomenon in relation to what some have called a \"post racial\" present defined by larger processes of economic and cultural globalization and transnational migration.
