Doctoral students take advanced courses in their areas of  specialization, followed by a period of research and the preparation  and defense of the doctoral thesis.       The Graduate Department of Mathematics at the Courant Institute  offers balanced training in mathematics and its applications in the  broadest sense. The Department occupies a leading position in  pure and applied mathematics, especially in ordinary and partial  differential equations, probability theory and stochastic processes,  differential geometry, numerical analysis and scientific computation,  mathematical physics, material science, fluid dynamics, math biology,  Atmosphere and Ocean science, and Computational Biology.       Areas where there are special funding opportunities are:       Mathematics,  Mechanics and Materials Sciences       Number  Theory       Probability       Scientific Computing       The Ph.D. in Mathematics    Degree Requirements    A candidate for the Ph.D. degree in mathematics must fulfill a  number of different departmental requirements:       &#187; 72 points of credit;    &#187; a written comprehensive examination;    &#187; an oral preliminary examination;    &#187; an oral defense of the dissertation.       Coursework    All students in the Ph.D. program must complete 72 points of credits  (24 courses of 3 points each). It is possible, with departmental  permission, to take courses, relevant to students' course of study, in  other departments at NYU or at other universities. A base minimum of 32  points of credits must be completed at the Department of Mathematics.  Information on potential transfer of credit is contained in the  forthcoming section on GSAS and Departmental Policies and Procedures.    The Written Comprehensive  Examination    The examination tests the basic knowledge required for any serious  mathematical study. It consists of the three following sections:  Advanced Calculus, Complex Variables, and Linear Algebra. The  examination is given on two consecutive days, twice a year, in early  September and early January. Each section is allotted three hours and  is written at the level of a good undergraduate course. Samples of  previous examinations are available in the departmental office.  Cooperative preparation is encouraged, as it is for all examinations.  In the fall term, the Department offers a workshop, taught by an  advanced Teaching Assistant, to help students prepare for the written  examinations.    Entering students with a solid preparation are encouraged to  consider taking the examination in their first year of full-time study.  All students must take the examinations in order to be allowed to  register for coursework beyond 36 points of credit; it is recommended  that students attempt to take the examinations well before this  deadline. Graduate Assistants are required to take the examinations  during their first year of study.    For further details, consult the section on the Written  Comprehensive Examinations .    The Oral Preliminary Examination    This examination is usually (but not invariably) taken after two  years of full-time study. The purpose of the examination is to  determine if the candidate has acquired sufficient mathematical  knowledge and maturity to commence a dissertation. The phrase  \"mathematical knowledge\" is intended to convey rather broad  acquaintance with the basic facts of mathematical life, with emphasis  on a good understanding of the simplest interesting examples. In  particular, highly technical or abstract material is inappropriate, as  is the rote reproduction of information. What the examiners look for is  something a little different and less easy to quantify. It is conveyed  in part by the word \"maturity.\" This means some idea of how mathematics  hangs together; the ability to think a little on one's feet; some  appreciation of what is natural and important, and what is artificial.  The point is that the ability to do successful research depends on more  than formal learning, and it is part of the examiners' task to assess  these less tangible aspects of the candidate's preparation.    The orals are comprised of a general section and a special section,  each lasting one hour, and are conducted by two different panels of  three faculty members. The examination takes place three times a year:  fall, mid-winter and late spring. Cooperative preparation of often  helpful and is encouraged. Over-preparation is a common trap and your  advisor can provide perspective on this. The general section consists  of five topics, one of which may be chosen freely. The other four  topics are determined by field of interest, but often turn out to be  standard: complex variables, real variables, ordinary differential  equations, and partial differential equations. Here, the level of  knowledge that is expected is equivalent to that of a one or two term  course of the kind Courant normally presents. A brochure containing the  most common questions on the general oral examination, edited by  Courant students, is available at the Department Office.    The special section is usually devoted to a single topic at a more  advanced level and extent of knowledge. The precise content is  negotiated with he candidate's faculty advisor. Normally, the chosen  topic will have a direct bearing on the candidate's Ph.D. dissertation.    All students must take the oral examinations in order to be allowed  to register for coursework beyond 60 points of credit. It is  recommended that students attempt the examinations well before this  deadline.    The Dissertation Defense    The oral defense is the final examination on the student's  dissertation. The defense is conducted by a panel of five faculty  members (including the student's advisor) and generally lasts one to  two hours. The candidate presents his/her work to a mixed audience,  some expert in the student's topic, some not. Often, this presentation  is followed by a question-and-answer period and mutual discussion of  related material and directions for future work.    Summer Internships and Employment    The Department encourages Ph.D. students at any stage of their  studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment  opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the  past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the  National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Woods  Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly  expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them  possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their  career options. The Director of Graduate Studies and members of the  faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist  students in finding appropriate summer employment.    The Ph.D. in Atmosphere Ocean Science  and Mathematics    Coursework    The curriculum for the program provides a balance between  mathematics and physical science, and aims at preparing students for  research and teaching in all aspects of applied mathematics.   Please refer to the Center for  Atmosphere Ocean Science Graduate Program for further  information on coursework (including a detailed list of courses and  sample distribution of courses by term), degree examinations and other  aspects of the program.    The Ph.D in   Computational Biology    NYU now offers a Ph.D. program in Computational Biology.  Students can apply through one of the following departments:  Mathematics, Computer Science, Biology, Chemistry, and the Center for  Neural Sciences. For further information about the program, click here      Visiting Doctoral Students    Advanced doctoral students at other universities who wish to spend a  term at the Courant Institute's Department of Mathematics need to  provide the following documentation:      - a letter from the student's advisor requesting that the  student spend at term at the Courant Institute to conduct  research under the supervision of a faculty mentor;      - confirmation from the Courant Institute faculty in question  that he or she are willing to work with the visiting student;        - official documentation showing financial support of at least  $2,000 U.S. per month for the term of stay.       These students will have to submit an application for non-degree  studies to NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science for the semeter  for their proposed visit. The application can be  downloaded from the Graduate Admission web page at  http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication, and sent in with  all transcripts, a statement of purpose and the application fee (GRE  tests or letters of recommendation are not required for non-degree  applications).       With this documentation, New York University will be able to sponsor  a J-1 visa for a visiting student.

The course requirement is to construct three computer models during the semester, to report on results to the class, and to hand in a writeup describing each project. These projects can be done individually, or as part of a team. Topics discussed in class are the circulation of the blood, gas exchange in the lung, electrophysiology of neurons and neural networks, the renal countercurrent mechanism, cross-bridge dynamics in muscle, and the dynamics of epidemic and endemic diseases. Projects are normally chosen from this list, but may be chosen otherwise by students with other interests.

(This text describes MATLAB programs which can be downloaded from the internet and used as a starting point for student projects.)    It is also recommended but not required to purchase a book on MATLAB, for example, Hunt BR et al., A Guide to MATLAB: For Beginners and Experienced Users. Second Edition. Cambridge University Press , 2006.             Homework and Exams    The sole requirement of the course is to do the three computing projects mentioned in the course description. There will be no other homework, and no exam. Students may work on these projects individually or as part of a team.              Grading policy    Grades will be based on the oral presentations and written reports on the projects. When a project is done by a team, all members of the team receive the same grade for that project. The three projects have equal weight in determining the final grade.
