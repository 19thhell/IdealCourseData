However some of the older browser versions are less powerful than newer versions, so the appearance of certain screens and printed documents may be slightly askew.   The site also requires you to have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed. This is a free download available at www.adobe.com .   It is recommended that you do not use your browser's \"Back\", \"Forward\" or \"Refresh\" buttons to navigate the site, or open a new browser window from your existing window. This may cause unexpected results, including loss of data or being logged out of the system. Please use the navigational buttons within the site.

Everyone who applies for a position is required to create an application which includes certain information. Any required information is denoted with an asterisk (*). However, the more information you provide, the easier it will be to effectively evaluate your skills, abilities and qualifications.

If you close your browser prior to clicking SAVE AND CONTINUE TO NEXT or SAVE AND STAY ON THIS PAGE your application and account will be saved, but you will lose the information on the last page that was not saved.                                                                                                                                                                            How do I go about submitting my cover letter and my resume?                                                       You will be able to submit a resume and cover letter each time you apply for a position. There will be directions prompting you how and when to attach your documents. Please note that attaching a resume does not substitute for completing the application form.

Yes; for example, you can copy and paste the information from a Word or WordPerfect document directly into the appropriate fields in the application form.

Your resume is accessible immediately upon completion of your online submission.                                                                                                                                                                            How can I confirm that I applied online successfully?                                                       Once you have successfully completed the online application process, a confirmation number will appear for your reference. You may view the status of your application(s) at any time. To do this, you need to go to your candidate home page and click on the application status tab.                                                                                                                                                                            What happens after I submit my application and resume in the system?                                                       Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                            How long do you keep applications on file?                                                       Your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for job opportunities for one year.                                                                                                                                                                            What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.                                                                                                                                                                            How do I apply for faculty or research positions?                                                       Academic positions (faculty and research scientists) are advertised in a variety of venues (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, professional journals) by individual schools and/or academic departments within NYU. Therefore, all inquiries should be directed specifically to the appropriate school or department.

The Employment Application System is designed to run in a web browser over the Internet. The system supports browser versions of Netscape 4.7 and above and Internet Explorer 4.0 and above. However some of the older browser versions are less powerful than newer versions, so the appearance of certain screens and printed documents may be slightly askew.   The site also requires you to have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed. This is a free download available at www.adobe.com .   It is recommended that you do not use your browser's \"Back\", \"Forward\" or \"Refresh\" buttons to navigate the site, or open a new browser window from your existing window. This may cause unexpected results, including loss of data or being logged out of the system. Please use the navigational buttons within the site.

What happens after I submit my application and resume in the system?                                                       Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.

What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.

Academic positions (faculty and research scientists) are advertised in a variety of venues (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, professional journals) by individual schools and/or academic departments within NYU. Therefore, all inquiries should be directed specifically to the appropriate school or department.
