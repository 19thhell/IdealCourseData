                          During the 19th and 20th centuries, the period preceding the European expansion into the Muslim world was portrayed as one of decline and stasis. Recent scholarship has shown that this narrative obscured a rich series of developments in the Muslim world during the 17th and 18th centuries. This workshop brings together scholars working on North Africa and the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal empires to explore the state of the Muslim world on the eve of European colonialism.

The conclusion examines the historiographical lessons of Safavid decline, and what today\u2019s rulers and citizens of the region might learn from this example.
