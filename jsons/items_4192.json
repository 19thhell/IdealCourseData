The  program leads to an EAS humanities major in one of two ways:      Language and Civilization Major :  Students must complete 8 points in a language (Chinese, Korean, or  Japanese) at the advanced level or above. Elementary and intermediate  courses do not count toward the major point total. No compromise on  language levels will be permitted.      In addition to the fulfillment of the  language component, students must take 28 civilization course points  from among the Department of East Asian Studies offerings.        4 of these points (one course) must  be one of the following MAP Cultures and Contexts courses:      Cultures and  Contexts: The Chinese and Japanese Traditions (MAP-UA 506) Cultures and  Contexts: Japan\u2014A Cultural History (MAP-UA 507) Cultures and  Contexts: China (MAP-UA 512) Cultures and  Contexts: Korea (MAP-UA 543)            No other Cultures and Contexts courses  will be considered as fulfilling this prerequisite, including Eastern  Civilization or equivalent in Liberal Studies. Transfer students from  Liberal Studies must take one of the above-listed courses.    Students must have at least one  course in each of the three areas: China, Japan, and Korea. At least 16 of the 28 civilization  points must be taken at the New York NYU campus.             Civilization Major : Students must  complete 36 points of civilization East Asian Studies courses. In  this version, no language course points will count toward the major.      4 of these points (one course) must  be one of the following MAP Cultures and Contexts courses:   Cultures and  Contexts: The Chinese and Japanese Traditions (MAP-UA 506) Cultures and  Contexts: Japan\u2014A Cultural History (MAP-UA 507) Cultures and  Contexts: China (MAP-UA 512) Cultures and  Contexts: Korea (MAP-UA 543)              No other Cultures and Contexts courses  will be considered as fulfilling this prerequisite, including Eastern  Civilization or equivalent in Liberal Studies. Transfer students from  Liberal Studies must take one of the above-listed courses.    Students must have at least one  course in each of the three areas: China, Japan, and Korea. At least 24 of the 36 points must  be taken at the New York NYU campus.          Notes (applying to both major tracks):      Courses must have an East Asian  Studies course number (EAST-UA) to count toward the EAS major.    An upper limit of 16 points can be  transferred from outside NYU and applied to the major. This includes  non-NYU study abroad credits, as well as credits from other  universities in the United States. Transfer students from other  universities should meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies  (DUS) to discuss the number of points they can transfer from their  previous institution toward the major.    Cantonese, Vietnamese, and Tibetan  languages may not be counted toward either major or minor  requirements. NYU Shanghai and Beijing  civilization courses are counted toward the major only contingently.  Students must contact the DUS to discuss the courses before or during  the process of applying. The director gives final approval for major  points after the course has been successfully completed and the  student's work is reviewed. Courses listed as \"electives\"  on the EAS departmental website course listings do not count toward  the major; Freshman Honors Seminars may count toward the major,  although the specific seminar must be approved by the DUS. No double-counting of courses will  be permitted. Courses to be counted toward the EAS major must be  exclusive to the EAS major, whether or not they are cross-listed with  another department.    Minor    The minor consists of 16 points. The  program leads to a Department of East Asian Studies humanities minor  in one of four ways:      Civilization minor: 16 civilization  course points in the Department of East Asian Studies. Chinese minor: 16 Chinese language  course points through the Advanced II level. Elementary I and II do  not count toward fulfilling the minor requirements. Typical plan of  study: Intermediate I , Intermediate II , Advanced I , and Advanced II . Japanese minor: 16 Japanese language  course points through the Advanced II level. Elementary I and II do  not count toward fulfilling the minor requirements. Typical plan of  study: Intermediate I , Intermediate II , Advanced I , and Advanced II . Korean minor: 16 Korean language  course points through the Advanced II level. Elementary I and II do  not count toward fulfilling the minor requirements. Typical plan of  study: Intermediate I , Intermediate II , Advanced I , and Advanced II .            Notes (applying to the minor):    If Advanced II of the target  language is reached prior to fulfilling the 16 points, fourth-year  language courses (i.e., past Advanced II ) must be taken to fulfill  the remaining points. No more than two transfer courses  (8 points) may be accepted toward the minor, subject to review by and  approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies. NYU Shanghai and Beijing  civilization courses are counted toward the minor only contingently.  Students must contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) to  discuss the courses before or during the process of applying. The Director gives final approval for minor points after the course has  been successfully completed and the student's work is reviewed. No double-counting of courses will  be permitted. Courses to be counted toward the EAS minor must be  exclusive to the EAS minor, whether or not they are cross-listed with  another department.                Honors Program    Eligibility: Students must spend at  least two full years in residence at the College of Arts and Science,  completing at least 64 points of graded work in the College. Students  must maintain a general GPA of 3.65 and a major average of 3.7 .      Requirements: (1) Substantial  completion of the major requirements (24 to 28 points), (2) GPA of  3.7 or better, and (3) the student must register in his or her senior  year for two semesters of independent study, at 4 points per semester  (a total of 8 points), under the supervision of a departmental  faculty member (or affiliate). This total of 8 points is in addition  to the 32 points of the major. The 8-point honors sequence must  result in a substantively researched thesis, normally 30 to 50 typed  pages. The faculty supervisor and the subject of the honors thesis  are chosen by the student in consultation with the director of  undergraduate studies, who must approve the topic/adviser in the  first semester of the honors sequence.
