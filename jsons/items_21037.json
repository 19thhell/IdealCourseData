Students receive a set of tools and experiences that allow them to understand both the delivery of health care services and the broader social, cultural, and economic factors that influence health outcomes. Our students experience firsthand the importance of health care delivery and health promotion in one of the most interesting, diverse, and complex cities in the world, and our graduates work in every sector of the health care system.

We will discuss the distribution of health and disease in society, the organization of the U.S. health care system   and roles and behaviors of its key actors, the historical context for developments in public health and medicine, the quality and accessibility of health care services, and current events in health care reform. We will examine major themes in health care policy and   practice using an interdisciplinary approach that employs sociological, political, economic and ethical perspectives on health and disease, characteristics of health care in the U.S., and the complexity of achieving high quality and affordability given the varied (and sometimes conflicting) motivations of policy-makers, payers, providers and patients.

Integrating public service and medicine, the dual MD/MPA program crosses traditional boundaries, linking management, finance, and policy, and provides students with the cutting-edge concepts and skills needed to shape the future of health policy and management. Students graduate with a set of tools and experiences that allow them to understand both the delivery of health care services and the broader social, cultural, and economic factors that influence health outcomes. They work in every sector of the health care system, and experience firsthand the importance of health care delivery and health promotion in one of the most interesting, diverse, and complex cities in the world.   The Wagner School and the NYU School of Medicine offer a joint degree program for medical students to earn the Master of Public Administration and the Medical Doctor degree within five years of full-time study. The combined degree program allows students who are interested in medicine and health management, policy, or finance issues to pursue an integrated and comprehensive course of study. Graduates will be uniquely poised to pursue careers in hospital management, nonprofits, consulting firms, managed care organizations, and government health agencies throughout the world.   Eligibility   Typically, students applying have already been accepted to, and matriculated in, the School of Medicine. Students will generally apply to the program in their third year of medical school with course work leading to the MPA beginning at the end of the third year (see Special Considerations below for modifications to this outline). Students will postpone beginning their fourth year medical school requirements to take a dedicated year of full-time course work within the MPA program. Upon returning to Medical school, students will continue to take any remaining courses toward the MPA degree while concurrently completing medical school requirements.   Timeline   The MPA is a 60 credit program. Medical students accepted to the dual degree program will be granted a transfer of 12 credits taken from the School of Medicine. The remaining 48 credits toward the MPA could be completed in the following way:    \u00a0   Fall   Spring   Summer   1st Year   Medical School Curriculum   Medical School Curriculum   \u00a0   2nd Year   Medical School Curriculum   Medical School Curriculum   \u00a0   3rd Year   Medical School Curriculum   Medical School Curriculum   Wagner Curriculum   4th Year   Wagner Curriculum   Wagner Curriculum   Medical School Curriculum   5th Year   Combined Medical/Wagner Curriculum-Capstone   Combined Medical/Wagner Curriculum-Capstone   \u00a0    Special Considerations   I. Application Timing: Some prospective students may have a special interest in obtaining a dual degree as part of their consideration to attend the NYU School of Medicine. In these instances, they may apply to both the School of Medicine and MPA program concurrently. Upon acceptance to both programs, students will develop a curricular timeline in consultation with both the School of Medicine and Wagner based on the availability of courses, timing within the curriculum, and other considerations. Start of the MPA will typically be deferred for three years.   II. Research Component: All students in this dual degree are required to complete a Capstone Project during the final year. Students may want to consider developing a research project in consultation with the School of Medicine. The Director of Dual MD/Master's Programs may be able to provide referrals to School of Medicine faculty with whom students can work.   Tuition and Funding   Currently, each program has individual tuition requirements. The Wagner School of Health Policy and Management provides scholarship assistance to medical students accepted to the dual degree.\u00a0 However, students should inquire with the respective schools regarding current tuition costs and financial assistance as these are subject to change.   Application Process   Applicants are required to apply to each school individually, and must meet the respective admission standards and deadlines for each program. Once admitted to both schools, a student will qualify for the joint degree program and be eligible to complete both the MD and MPA within five years of full-time study.   Current medical students applying to the program should register their intent to apply with the Director of Dual MD/Master's Programs prior to the application deadline.   Students applying to both the School of Medicine and the Wagner School concurrently should alert the Medical School Admissions Office of their intent to do so.
