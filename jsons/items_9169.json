Newspaper clippings          of reviews of Emma Thursby's performances are included. The folders pertaining to          some of Emma Thursby's most successful pupils include correspondence, programs, and          clippings of announcements and reviews. A typed list of attendees at Emma Thursby's          Friday salons is included, as is a handwritten list of her 1891 engagements (a complete          listing of each concert given by Emma Thursby can be found in Gipson's biography.)                  The 'Clippings' folder contains clippings about Emma Thursby. 'Biographical Notes'          consist of typed and handwritten biographical details.

Emma Thursby possessed a Russian amulet, given to her by Emilia Rudersdorff,          which was lost in 1919. Sketches of the amulet and information about its origins and          loss are included here.                  After Emma Thursby's death, Ina Thursby worked hard to assure that her sister's memory          would be preserved. She organized a radio broadcast of tributes to Emma on what would          have been Emma's 90th birthday, and commissioned a mosaic to be created in memory          of Emma. This mosiac, which featured St. Cecilia, the patron saint of music and Emma's          namesake, was donated to and installed at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Information          and clippings about both ventures is included in this series.

'Geneological Information' includes information on Thursby, Van Cott, and          Bennett family ancestors. Much of the Thursby information comes from the Thursby family          members in England whom Emma met during her time there in 1878.                  The Mynah bird material includes an issue of           The Phrenological Journal and Phrenological Magazine with an article about Emma and the mynah bird in which it was purported that the          two had similar shaped skulls; thus accounting for their musical exploits. It also          includes information about how to care for the bird and a letter from the Pullman's          Palace Car Company giving permission for the bird to travel on the train with Emma          Thursby.

Folders are devoted to Emma Thursby's close friends Ole Bull and Sarah Farmer. The          material on Sarah Farmer also includes correspondence pertaining to Ms. Farmer's illness          in the 1910s, and subsequent attempts to raise money to continue the colony Green          Acre in Eliot, Maine. Material devoted specifically to Green Acre, such as programs          of lectures and clippings, are housed separately. A blueprint of the Green Acre property          is housed in the oversize folder.                  The folder 'Old Brooklyn' contains mainly clippings about and sketches of churches          Emma Thursby attended or was engaged by early in her career. A separate folder is          dedicated to items pertaining to Henry Ward Beecher, the pastor of Plymouth Church          in Brooklyn. This includes information on Beecher, and his church after the time of          his pastorship. The folder entitled 'Clippings' contains information about friends          of Emma Thursby, and other articles that do not fall under a more specific heading.                  Emma Thursby spent much of the later part of her life engaged with inquiries into          philosophy and religion, as evidenced by her support of and attendance at Green Acre          programs and lectures, as well as her correspondence and friendship with the Swami          Vivekananda. Notes taken by Emma from lectures given by Vivekananda, as well as clippings          on pertinent topics and pamphlets detailing Eastern religious philosophies, are included          in this series. Some of Emma's notes describe yogic practices of breathing, others          are transcriptions of prayers.                  Many amateur poets were inspired by Emma Thursby, judging from the volume of poetry          found in the collection. As well as those poems directly dedicated to her, Emma collected          clippings of poems from newspapers and magazines, and copied other poems herself.          These are all collected here.

Emma Thursby possessed a Russian amulet, given to her by Emilia Rudersdorff,          which was lost in 1919. Sketches of the amulet and information about its origins and          loss are included here.                  After Emma Thursby's death, Ina Thursby worked hard to assure that her sister's memory          would be preserved. She organized a radio broadcast of tributes to Emma on what would          have been Emma's 90th birthday, and commissioned a mosaic to be created in memory          of Emma. This mosiac, which featured St. Cecilia, the patron saint of music and Emma's          namesake, was donated to and installed at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Information          and clippings about both ventures is included in this series.

'Geneological Information' includes information on Thursby, Van Cott, and          Bennett family ancestors. Much of the Thursby information comes from the Thursby family          members in England whom Emma met during her time there in 1878.                  The Mynah bird material includes an issue of           The Phrenological Journal and Phrenological Magazine with an article about Emma and the mynah bird in which it was purported that the          two had similar shaped skulls; thus accounting for their musical exploits. It also          includes information about how to care for the bird and a letter from the Pullman's          Palace Car Company giving permission for the bird to travel on the train with Emma          Thursby.

Folders are devoted to Emma Thursby's close friends Ole Bull and Sarah Farmer. The          material on Sarah Farmer also includes correspondence pertaining to Ms. Farmer's illness          in the 1910s, and subsequent attempts to raise money to continue the colony Green          Acre in Eliot, Maine. Material devoted specifically to Green Acre, such as programs          of lectures and clippings, are housed separately. A blueprint of the Green Acre property          is housed in the oversize folder.                  The folder 'Old Brooklyn' contains mainly clippings about and sketches of churches          Emma Thursby attended or was engaged by early in her career. A separate folder is          dedicated to items pertaining to Henry Ward Beecher, the pastor of Plymouth Church          in Brooklyn. This includes information on Beecher, and his church after the time of          his pastorship. The folder entitled 'Clippings' contains information about friends          of Emma Thursby, and other articles that do not fall under a more specific heading.                  Emma Thursby spent much of the later part of her life engaged with inquiries into          philosophy and religion, as evidenced by her support of and attendance at Green Acre          programs and lectures, as well as her correspondence and friendship with the Swami          Vivekananda. Notes taken by Emma from lectures given by Vivekananda, as well as clippings          on pertinent topics and pamphlets detailing Eastern religious philosophies, are included          in this series. Some of Emma's notes describe yogic practices of breathing, others          are transcriptions of prayers.                  Many amateur poets were inspired by Emma Thursby, judging from the volume of poetry          found in the collection. As well as those poems directly dedicated to her, Emma collected          clippings of poems from newspapers and magazines, and copied other poems herself.          These are all collected here.

Folders are devoted to Emma Thursby's close friends Ole Bull and Sarah Farmer. The          material on Sarah Farmer also includes correspondence pertaining to Ms. Farmer's illness          in the 1910s, and subsequent attempts to raise money to continue the colony Green          Acre in Eliot, Maine. Material devoted specifically to Green Acre, such as programs          of lectures and clippings, are housed separately. A blueprint of the Green Acre property          is housed in the oversize folder.                  The folder 'Old Brooklyn' contains mainly clippings about and sketches of churches          Emma Thursby attended or was engaged by early in her career. A separate folder is          dedicated to items pertaining to Henry Ward Beecher, the pastor of Plymouth Church          in Brooklyn. This includes information on Beecher, and his church after the time of          his pastorship. The folder entitled 'Clippings' contains information about friends          of Emma Thursby, and other articles that do not fall under a more specific heading.                  Emma Thursby spent much of the later part of her life engaged with inquiries into          philosophy and religion, as evidenced by her support of and attendance at Green Acre          programs and lectures, as well as her correspondence and friendship with the Swami          Vivekananda. Notes taken by Emma from lectures given by Vivekananda, as well as clippings          on pertinent topics and pamphlets detailing Eastern religious philosophies, are included          in this series. Some of Emma's notes describe yogic practices of breathing, others          are transcriptions of prayers.                  Many amateur poets were inspired by Emma Thursby, judging from the volume of poetry          found in the collection. As well as those poems directly dedicated to her, Emma collected          clippings of poems from newspapers and magazines, and copied other poems herself.          These are all collected here.

Administrative Information              Provenance        The William J. Benners Papers were acquired by Edward G. Levy, the dime novel collector       who made large donations of dime novels to Fales, from Ralph Adimari, editor and historian,       in November 1964. Adimari had obtained Benners's letters and notes throughout the       1950s from Ralph F. Cummings, the         Dime Novel Round-Up editor who nursed Benners at the end of his life. Levy also purchased parts of Benners's       dime novel collection directly from Cummings. In 1970 Levy wrote to dime novel historian       J. Edward Leithead: \"As you may know, I wound up with most of William J. Benners's       literary estate--about 2/3 of the items in my gift [to Fales] came from that source.\"       Levy donated the Benners Papers to Fales in 1966.
