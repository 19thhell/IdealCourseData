We will look at these two practices through presentations, lectures, and site visits, and readings. We will speak with visiting funders, planners, and artists, and explore evaluation criteria and critical dialogue in recent publications. For their final project, students may choose between creating their own proposal or evaluating a project which has been created in the larger world.

Students initially move through foundational skills in layout, digital rendering and typography, employing industry standard tools and technologies. Additional courses are then taken in more advanced and experimental design utilizing the department&rsquo;s digital imaging, design, and fabrication studios, which are equipped with 2-D and 3-D design software, 3-D printers, laser cutters, and CNC routers. Courses also offer historical and theoretical components and examine current and emerging applications in the fields of design and technology.    Required courses include Introduction to Design I and II (8 points), modular courses which may be taken in any order or concurrently. Followed by Topics in Design courses (8 points). After completing Design I and II, along with one Topics course, a course may be taken outside of the Department of Art &amp; Art Professions to complete the minor. Sample course offerings from NYU Gallatin and NYU School of Engineering are listed below. Courses: ART-UE 401 Introduction to Design I (4 points): This course uses formal exercises of the Bauhaus to teach core digital foundations skills, including software-based design and digital fabrication strategies. Core techniques in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign will be explored, as will modeling strategies using digital sculpting and CAD based tools. Students will be introduced to and will experiment with digital fabrication technologies and techniques across a range of materials and processes. ART-UE 402 Introduction to Design II (4 points): This course provides the basic framework and principles for design across a wide range of media and design fields. Students will be introduced to critical observation and documentation techniques and will learn to conduct design-based research, conceptualize ideas, produce prototypes, and express and present design concepts. The class is primarily studio based though students will also examine the history, theory, and analysis of design and design practices. ART-UE 1430 Topics in Design (4 points): Topics vary from semester to semester and are chosen as a result of both faculty and student interest. Multiple &ldquo;Topics in Design&rdquo; courses will be offered each Fall and Spring semesters. Sample topics: Digital Fabrication This class connects 2D and 3D design processes to the physical world. Through the use of 2D/3D modeling software and additive and subtractive manufacturing processes, including laser cutting, CNC milling, and 3D printing, students will move from design conception to final product. Students will study the emergence of various digital fabrication tools and techniques and will be asked to consider the implications of these technologies on the social, cultural, environmental, and economic worlds. Typography This course serves to introduce the student to the topic of typography, both as letterform design and as a tool for creating larger text based design projects. Typography forms the basis of much of our contemporary communication. Whether a student wants to be a Graphic Designer, an Artist, an Industrial Designer, a FashionDesigner, a Web Designer, an Interactive Designer he/she will need to use typography. By understanding the basic building blocks of typography students will gain the tools to create stronger artwork and design both visually and conceptually.    Fashionable Technology and Wearable Computing In this course, students will study how technology can be used in fashion contexts as a means to complement the functions of the human body and enhance personal expression. The course covers product design, fashion design and prototype production. The course offers a theoretical introduction and foundation, which is iterated through practical course elements in the form of concept development and prototyping. Readings emphasize theoretical discourse on the relationships of the body, technology, fashion, social interactions, and environment. Interaction Design This course will provide students with an understanding of interaction design as an academic and creative discipline. Weekly readings and class discussions will focus on the study of interaction design principles across a variety of media application spaces and contexts. Projects will combine audio, video, imaging, animation, and other media formats and students will be asked to prototype and construct interactive products and systems. Environmental Art and Design Students in this course will use the local urban street as a primary site of ecological analysis, intervention and exhibition. Students will work on projects that re-imagine our relationship to natural systems. A special focus will be placed on design interventions in urban ecosystems involving both human institutions and infrastructure, and the work of other non human organisms. Color Theory Introduces contemporary color theory and its significance to art and design. A series of exercises using individual subjectivity demonstrates the role of color in personal expression. The interrelatedness of color and meaning is emphasized along with effective graphic and digital communication.    Sample courses offered outside of the Department of Art &amp; Art Professions: DM 1143 Ideation and Prototyping In this class, the creative process will be investigated in order to generate ideas for art, design, technology, and business endeavors. The course will show how ideation, design research and thinking, and prototyping can inspire, inform, and bring depth to what one ultimately creates. Students will expand their arsenal of design research skills, learn how to think critically about their audience, content, form, and processes, as well as, understand the importance of utilizing more than one research and design strategy.    DM 2173 Motion Graphics Studio Motion graphics can be found in a wide range of media: broadcast, web, animation, and film to name a few. This course will allow students to explore the elements of time and space to convey messages and meaning through type, image, and sound for the screen. Individual creativity will be stressed as well as the understanding and use of industry-standard software for developing motion graphics.    DM 4193 Mobile Application Development Today's applications are increasingly mobile. This course teaches students how to build mobile apps for Android or iOS devices, as well as how to deploy them in app stores. The history of mobile computing is also explored.    DM 3153 Media in Game Design and Development This class moves into advanced technological implementations of 2D games. Taking designs from DM 2153 and working in teams, students create a complete game. Students are assigned individually to work in production areas ranging from sprite creation, mapping and level design to engine coding and interaction scripting. Students complete their assignments as if they were members of a professional game- development team.    IDSEM-UG1627 Green Design: From Geddes to Gore Students will explore the designers, cultures, and suppositions about the contemporary environmental movement. Who are the key figures that first ignited the green design revolution and its ensuing agenda? Who effectively promoted maxims such as \"energy crisis,\" \"climate change,\" and \"sustainability?\" Many books, films, projects, and actions contributed to the irresistible success of mainstream eco-values. Which readings initially established the core underpinning of this environmental debate&mdash;Hiroshima by John Hersey, Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, or Ecology of Freedom by Murray Bookchin--and how are they linked today? The class will review architecture and art, and unpack texts by thinkers such as Patrick Geddes, Henry David Thoreau, Ebenezer Howard, John Muir, Louis Sullivan, Ivan Illich, Buckminster Fuller, Sim Van der Ryn, Victor Papanek, Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, William McDonough, Marc Reisner, Jared Diamond, and Al Gore. In tandem, we acutely review seminal designs and works by Antoni Gaudi, Norman Bel Geddes, Bruce Goff, Rudolf Steiner, Samuel Mockbee, and others. The overall objective is twofold: to survey the lager historical context of ecological design and define specific contributions to the green movement.    For further information on Art Minors: Students are encouraged to meet with the Student Services Counselor, Alex Jovanovich, for advisement; it is helpful to bring artwork to this meeting. Students should first check with their major advisor to determine how these minors fit into their undergraduate curriculum.
