It has an economy that is in desperate need of modernization, yet it is an economic powerhouse of Eurasia. It is at once an Asian and a European power. It has the institutions of democracy, yet many of the instincts of authoritarianism.    Moscow, with its mix of tsarist palaces, Stalinist skyscrapers and modern financial centers, is a perfect reflection of these paradoxes, a high-energy global city still shadowed by its Soviet past. This global field intensive course will explore the politics of contemporary Russia and its role in the world through the prism of security, conceptualized broadly. How far do concerns about domestic and international security drive the political evolution of the country? Does its role as an oil and gas exporter to the world provide it with security and leverage or is it a threat to the country's long-term development? Is the Russian military a bulwark of national and regional security or a threat to its neighborhood? Is Russia a police state, or a haven of transnational criminality? While it is especially relevant for students in the Transnational Security and IR concentrations, there is ample scope for those in other fields.    Students will engage with policy makes, journalists, diplomats, businesspeople, academics, NGO staff and the rich history of Moscow and Russia, in both formal meetings and personal field research on their own projects.    A representative example of site visits would include:        Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Internal Affairs    Foreign embassies    Moscow Higher School of Economics    Think-tanks including Moscow Carnegie Center    NGOs    A Russian energy corporation    Russian and foreign media outlets       Excursions and activities may include:       City Tour    The Kremlin &amp; Armory    Historical Museum, Gulag Museum, Military Museum    Novodevichy Convent    The Bolshoi    Izmailovsky Market          Pre-Departure Sessions    There will be a single orientation meeting in December (Saturday 12/7) and then pre-departure classes and one-on-one discussions online through the Spring semester. During that time, students will not only begin to develop their research topics, they will also write one or more posts for a class blog to develop skills in writing short research- and think-pieces for publication and professional audiences.    Site    The program will be conducted in partnership with the Moscow Higher School of Economics. HSE facilities are ideally located to take advantage of the present day political excitement and historical imagery of the city.\u00a0    Accommodations    Program participants will be accommodated in double rooms in student housing of HSE.       Faculty    MARK GALEOTTI, CLINICAL PROFESSOR   Dr. Mark Galeotti is a specialist in transnational organized crime, security affairs and modern Russia. He started his academic career concentrating on conventional security issues, including the impact of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the implications of the disintegration of the USSR. However, in his fieldwork he encountered the rising new generation of gangsters carving out their portions of the decaying Soviet Union and was one of the first Western academics to recognize this as an emerging security concern. Since then, he has become increasingly interested in the transnationalisation of not just Russian but all forms of organized crime and their impact on the international order and development as a shadowy opposite to the global citizenship at the heart of the CGA\u2019s mission. He first visited Moscow when it was still the capital of the Soviet Union, carried out his PhD fieldwork there and has visited as regularly as he can, watching the city nearly implode in the early 1990s and since develop to become an energetic and confident global center today.
