As diverse a city New York is so are the offerings in the NYC school system. Some public schools offer special programs and small environments that are similar to private schools while other schools are bustling with crowded classrooms.   Like other communities across the country, children are typically assigned to schools based on their home address. These schools, known as zoned schools, serve all children in the designated catchment area. You can find your zoned school on the NYC Department of Education's website .   The quality and tone of zoned schools vary widely. However, during the elementary school years, the majority of families are comfortable with their children attending their zoned neighborhood school. Some families however seek other options and have their children evaluated for public gifted and talented programs, identify bi-lingual or dual language programs, or consider charter schools in their neighborhoods or elsewhere.     Elementary School   Elementary schools typically house grades Pre-K to 5 or Pre-K to 6th grade. Traditional middle schools (also referred to as Intermediate Schools, Junior High Schools) house children in grades 6-8 and high schools serve student in 9th through 12th grade. There are however both well-established and new schools that are structured differently and serve children in grades K-8, 6-12, K-12; one school on the Upper West Side offers a successful program educating students in 5th to 8th grade.     Middle and High School   At the middle school level, school choice is much more prevalent with students applying to schools within their home school district or in other districts. The choice process brings with it an admission process that is varied. Some schools invest hours to meet with student candidates and administer and review locally developed assessment tests while others accept students based on a review of the school documents.     Gifted and Talented Programs   There are many schools throughout the city that offer gifted and talented programs with one or more classes per grade for identified gifted and talented students. In addition, there are a handful of schools which are dedicated entirely to serving gifted and talented students.     Bi-Lingual/Dual Language Schools   Dual Language programs in NYC public schools teach children the usual curriculum in English as well as in a second language. Dual language programs are available in Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Korean, Haitian Creole or French. Your child can be a native English speaker or an English Language Learner (ELL) to enroll in a dual language program. Most programs do some type of screening to be sure that a dual language program will be an appropriate fit for your child. You should contact schools you are interested in to find out whether they accept students who are not zoned for that school.     Charter Schools   Charter schools operate as independent and autonomous public schools and typically rely on an active parent body. They are awarded a &quot;charter&quot; and are operated according to an approved plan that outlines how they will function pedagogically, administratively, and fiscally. In NYC charter schools are newly established schools and in some cases existing schools that convert to charter status.   Charter schools receive some funding from federal, state and public local funds, and typically must raise additional funds from individuals, foundations, and the private sector. A charter school must comply with all laws regulating public schools therefore any student that is eligible to attend a public school is also qualified for admission to a charter school. A school's charter and their autonomy is dependent upon their meeting educational performance standards, and maintaining sound fiscal and management practices. Charter schools are subject to oversight by the NYC Chancellor.     Public School Assistance within the Greater NY Metro Area   Carebridge Life Resources , NYU's Employee Assistance Program, is available by phone (800-437-0911) to assist you in gaining a better understanding of schools in your home community or a community in which you are planning to move.

As diverse a city New York is so are the offerings in the NYC school system. Some public schools offer special programs and small environments that are similar to private schools while other schools are bustling with crowded classrooms.   Like other communities across the country, children are typically assigned to schools based on their home address. These schools, known as zoned schools, serve all children in the designated catchment area. You can find your zoned school on the NYC Department of Education's website .   The quality and tone of zoned schools vary widely. However, during the elementary school years, the majority of families are comfortable with their children attending their zoned neighborhood school. Some families however seek other options and have their children evaluated for public gifted and talented programs, identify bi-lingual or dual language programs, or consider charter schools in their neighborhoods or elsewhere.     Elementary School   Elementary schools typically house grades Pre-K to 5 or Pre-K to 6th grade. Traditional middle schools (also referred to as Intermediate Schools, Junior High Schools) house children in grades 6-8 and high schools serve student in 9th through 12th grade. There are however both well-established and new schools that are structured differently and serve children in grades K-8, 6-12, K-12; one school on the Upper West Side offers a successful program educating students in 5th to 8th grade.     Middle and High School   At the middle school level, school choice is much more prevalent with students applying to schools within their home school district or in other districts. The choice process brings with it an admission process that is varied. Some schools invest hours to meet with student candidates and administer and review locally developed assessment tests while others accept students based on a review of the school documents.     Gifted and Talented Programs   There are many schools throughout the city that offer gifted and talented programs with one or more classes per grade for identified gifted and talented students. In addition, there are a handful of schools which are dedicated entirely to serving gifted and talented students.     Bi-Lingual/Dual Language Schools   Dual Language programs in NYC public schools teach children the usual curriculum in English as well as in a second language. Dual language programs are available in Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Korean, Haitian Creole or French. Your child can be a native English speaker or an English Language Learner (ELL) to enroll in a dual language program. Most programs do some type of screening to be sure that a dual language program will be an appropriate fit for your child. You should contact schools you are interested in to find out whether they accept students who are not zoned for that school.     Charter Schools   Charter schools operate as independent and autonomous public schools and typically rely on an active parent body. They are awarded a &quot;charter&quot; and are operated according to an approved plan that outlines how they will function pedagogically, administratively, and fiscally. In NYC charter schools are newly established schools and in some cases existing schools that convert to charter status.   Charter schools receive some funding from federal, state and public local funds, and typically must raise additional funds from individuals, foundations, and the private sector. A charter school must comply with all laws regulating public schools therefore any student that is eligible to attend a public school is also qualified for admission to a charter school. A school's charter and their autonomy is dependent upon their meeting educational performance standards, and maintaining sound fiscal and management practices. Charter schools are subject to oversight by the NYC Chancellor.     Public School Assistance within the Greater NY Metro Area   Carebridge Life Resources , NYU's Employee Assistance Program, is available by phone (800-437-0911) to assist you in gaining a better understanding of schools in your home community or a community in which you are planning to move.

Education and Social Policy Faculty Members Publish \"Not Just for Poor Kids: The Impact of Universal Free School Breakfast on Meal Participation and Student Outcomes\"    Education and Social Policy Faculty Member, Sean Corcoran, Publishes Paper on School Choices and Placements of Low-Achieving Students       Program Description    The M.A. program in Education and Social Policy addresses the growing demand for professionals who can use up-to-date methods, data, and research results to formulate, implement, and evaluate education policies, ranging from the national No Child Left Behind Act to local or state policies such as New York City's Children First initiative. As the national and international concern with the quality of education grows, local, state and federal education agencies, think tanks, and nonprofit organizations are seeking individuals with the skills and knowledge to help craft education reforms that improve the effectiveness and fairness of educational outcomes.    Based in the social science disciplines of economics and sociology , the program teaches you to use statistics, large datasets, and research designs to analyze education policies for grades K-12 and higher education.     The curriculum is designed to assure that you master appropriate analytical methods as well as develop knowledge of issues in a specific education policy area, such as higher education, race and class, international education, or K-12 education issues. No previous knowledge of education policy or statistics is required.    The degree is distinguished from other master&rsquo;s degrees in education policy by its strong emphasis on using quantitative methods to ascertain causal effects of programs and policies. You begin your studies with a first course in statistics and progress through more rigorous analytical courses, including regression and econometrics. The sequence of methods courses culminates in a final directed group research project in which groups produce a professional study of an educational intervention or policy of their choosing.    Throughout the course of study, you gain experience:       in working with large longitudinal education databases    with using economic and sociological principles to analyze K-16 education, and    with principles of management, planning, and policy making in the public and nonprofit sectors, which draw on the expertise of faculty in NYU&rsquo;s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service .       The curriculum places a strong emphasis on understanding the context, purpose, unintended effects, and finally the actual impact of alternative education policies and programs. You will use elective choices, which you&rsquo;ll choose in consultation with your adviser, to gain knowledge of policy issues.    Students gain experience through the required Capstone course, as well, where they work in teams to design and perform a research study. Projects are designed and written for a particular &ldquo;clientele&rdquo; in the policy community. Throughout the tenure of their capstone project, students are expected to consult with faculty who have relevant expertise in appropriate fields of research specialization. See right for an example of a capstone poster.    Graduates are prepared to work in a wide variety of organizations that have a role in policymaking and implementation in the education area, including local, state and federal education departments, foundations, think tanks, and consulting, grant-giving and public-relations departments in selected private organizations. Students in the Education and Social Policy program learn about education policy in New York City--one of the best urban laboratories in the nation. Through this experience, alumni of the Education and Social Policy program are prepared to work in education policy throughout the country, and even in major cities in other nations like China and Japan.    View and download our PDF Brochure to learn more about the Education and Social Policy Program.     Mission Statement    The M.A. program in Education and Social Policy prepares graduates to become professionals who use statistics, large datasets, and research designs to formulate and evaluate education policies in grades kindergarten through twelve and higher education.    The program provides an opportunity to specialize in specific areas of education policy, such as higher education, race and class, international education, or K-12 education issues.    Student Learning Objectives       Students will apply principles of economics and sociology to formulate and analyze K-12 and higher education policies.    Students will conduct descriptive and inferential statistical analyses using large longitudinal education databases to interpret and identify causal effects of programs and policies and to apply conclusions to make policy recommendations.    Students will understand the policies already implemented as well as needs for additional policies in their chosen areas. They will be able to participate in quantitative studies to further evaluate existing policies and to provide evidence on the possible effects of new policies.       Other Options to Study Education and Policy in Steinhardt    In addition to the M.A. Program in Education and Social Policy, the Steinhardt School offers students two other options to study education and policy and to prepare for a career in this field. We encourage you to explore these options further to find the program that best matches your personal interests and career goals.
