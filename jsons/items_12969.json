Doctoral students take advanced courses in their areas of  specialization, followed by a period of research and the preparation  and defense of the doctoral thesis.       The Graduate Department of Mathematics at the Courant Institute  offers balanced training in mathematics and its applications in the  broadest sense. The Department occupies a leading position in  pure and applied mathematics, especially in ordinary and partial  differential equations, probability theory and stochastic processes,  differential geometry, numerical analysis and scientific computation,  mathematical physics, material science, fluid dynamics, math biology,  Atmosphere and Ocean science, and Computational Biology.       Areas where there are special funding opportunities are:       Mathematics,  Mechanics and Materials Sciences       Number  Theory       Probability       Scientific Computing       The Ph.D. in Mathematics    Degree Requirements    A candidate for the Ph.D. degree in mathematics must fulfill a  number of different departmental requirements:       &#187; 72 points of credit;    &#187; a written comprehensive examination;    &#187; an oral preliminary examination;    &#187; an oral defense of the dissertation.       Coursework    All students in the Ph.D. program must complete 72 points of credits  (24 courses of 3 points each). It is possible, with departmental  permission, to take courses, relevant to students' course of study, in  other departments at NYU or at other universities. A base minimum of 32  points of credits must be completed at the Department of Mathematics.  Information on potential transfer of credit is contained in the  forthcoming section on GSAS and Departmental Policies and Procedures.    The Written Comprehensive  Examination    The examination tests the basic knowledge required for any serious  mathematical study. It consists of the three following sections:  Advanced Calculus, Complex Variables, and Linear Algebra. The  examination is given on two consecutive days, twice a year, in early  September and early January. Each section is allotted three hours and  is written at the level of a good undergraduate course. Samples of  previous examinations are available in the departmental office.  Cooperative preparation is encouraged, as it is for all examinations.  In the fall term, the Department offers a workshop, taught by an  advanced Teaching Assistant, to help students prepare for the written  examinations.    Entering students with a solid preparation are encouraged to  consider taking the examination in their first year of full-time study.  All students must take the examinations in order to be allowed to  register for coursework beyond 36 points of credit; it is recommended  that students attempt to take the examinations well before this  deadline. Graduate Assistants are required to take the examinations  during their first year of study.    For further details, consult the section on the Written  Comprehensive Examinations .    The Oral Preliminary Examination    This examination is usually (but not invariably) taken after two  years of full-time study. The purpose of the examination is to  determine if the candidate has acquired sufficient mathematical  knowledge and maturity to commence a dissertation. The phrase  \"mathematical knowledge\" is intended to convey rather broad  acquaintance with the basic facts of mathematical life, with emphasis  on a good understanding of the simplest interesting examples. In  particular, highly technical or abstract material is inappropriate, as  is the rote reproduction of information. What the examiners look for is  something a little different and less easy to quantify. It is conveyed  in part by the word \"maturity.\" This means some idea of how mathematics  hangs together; the ability to think a little on one's feet; some  appreciation of what is natural and important, and what is artificial.  The point is that the ability to do successful research depends on more  than formal learning, and it is part of the examiners' task to assess  these less tangible aspects of the candidate's preparation.    The orals are comprised of a general section and a special section,  each lasting one hour, and are conducted by two different panels of  three faculty members. The examination takes place three times a year:  fall, mid-winter and late spring. Cooperative preparation of often  helpful and is encouraged. Over-preparation is a common trap and your  advisor can provide perspective on this. The general section consists  of five topics, one of which may be chosen freely. The other four  topics are determined by field of interest, but often turn out to be  standard: complex variables, real variables, ordinary differential  equations, and partial differential equations. Here, the level of  knowledge that is expected is equivalent to that of a one or two term  course of the kind Courant normally presents. A brochure containing the  most common questions on the general oral examination, edited by  Courant students, is available at the Department Office.    The special section is usually devoted to a single topic at a more  advanced level and extent of knowledge. The precise content is  negotiated with he candidate's faculty advisor. Normally, the chosen  topic will have a direct bearing on the candidate's Ph.D. dissertation.    All students must take the oral examinations in order to be allowed  to register for coursework beyond 60 points of credit. It is  recommended that students attempt the examinations well before this  deadline.    The Dissertation Defense    The oral defense is the final examination on the student's  dissertation. The defense is conducted by a panel of five faculty  members (including the student's advisor) and generally lasts one to  two hours. The candidate presents his/her work to a mixed audience,  some expert in the student's topic, some not. Often, this presentation  is followed by a question-and-answer period and mutual discussion of  related material and directions for future work.    Summer Internships and Employment    The Department encourages Ph.D. students at any stage of their  studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment  opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the  past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the  National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Woods  Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly  expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them  possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their  career options. The Director of Graduate Studies and members of the  faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist  students in finding appropriate summer employment.    The Ph.D. in Atmosphere Ocean Science  and Mathematics    Coursework    The curriculum for the program provides a balance between  mathematics and physical science, and aims at preparing students for  research and teaching in all aspects of applied mathematics.   Please refer to the Center for  Atmosphere Ocean Science Graduate Program for further  information on coursework (including a detailed list of courses and  sample distribution of courses by term), degree examinations and other  aspects of the program.    The Ph.D in   Computational Biology    NYU now offers a Ph.D. program in Computational Biology.  Students can apply through one of the following departments:  Mathematics, Computer Science, Biology, Chemistry, and the Center for  Neural Sciences. For further information about the program, click here      Visiting Doctoral Students    Advanced doctoral students at other universities who wish to spend a  term at the Courant Institute's Department of Mathematics need to  provide the following documentation:      - a letter from the student's advisor requesting that the  student spend at term at the Courant Institute to conduct  research under the supervision of a faculty mentor;      - confirmation from the Courant Institute faculty in question  that he or she are willing to work with the visiting student;        - official documentation showing financial support of at least  $2,000 U.S. per month for the term of stay.       These students will have to submit an application for non-degree  studies to NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science for the semeter  for their proposed visit. The application can be  downloaded from the Graduate Admission web page at  http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication, and sent in with  all transcripts, a statement of purpose and the application fee (GRE  tests or letters of recommendation are not required for non-degree  applications).       With this documentation, New York University will be able to sponsor  a J-1 visa for a visiting student.

MATH-GA       2111 Linear Algebra (one-term) is a substitute for MATH-GA 2110       and 2120 Linear Algebra I and II.      A substitute one-term course may     be taken after the first term of its equivalent two-term     course, but may not be taken after the equivalent two-term     sequence is completed. Resolution of conflicts will require     the approval of the Director of Graduate Studies. Only the credits of the completed     courses will count toward the degree.      Please note that master's and     non-degree students in their first year of study are generally     not permitted to register for any Advanced Topics     courses. In further semesters, students are allowed to     register for such courses with permission of both the course     instructor and the Director of Graduate Studies for the M.S.     Program.                The Written Comprehensive Examinations      Students choosing the first option,      must pass, with the grade of B, the three-part Written     Comprehensive Examination administered by the Department twice     a year, in early September and early January. Most master's     students tend to take exam toward the end of their graduate     studies.           Students are permitted to take the written examinations     twice, with no special permission. A third and final     attempt may be granted by the Department on a case-by-case     basis.           The examinations, in advanced calculus, complex variables     and linear algebra, may include some of the following     material:      Advanced Calculus: Real numbers. Functions of one     variable: continuity, mean-value, differentiability, maxima     and minima, integrals, fundamental theorem of calculus,     inequalities, estimation of sums and integrals, elementary     functions and their power series. Funtions of several     variables: partial derivatives, chain rule, MacLaurin     expansion, critical points, Lagrange multipliers, inverse and     implicit function theorems, jacobian, divergence and curl,     theorems of Green and Stokes.      Complex Variables: Complex numbers, analytical    functions, Cauchy-Riemann equations, Cauchy's integral and    applications, power series, maximum principle, Liouville's    theorem, elementary functions and their conformal maps, bilinear    transformation, classification of singularities, residue theorem    and contour integration, Laurent series, Rouche's theorem,    number of zeros and poles.      Linear Algebra: Vector spaces, linear dependence,     basis, dimension, linear transformation, inner product,     systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, ranks,     eigenvalues, diagonalization of matrices, quadratics forms,     symmetric and orthogonal transformations.      Cooperative preparation is encouraged, as it is for all     examinations. Students may also find the following books     helpful:      Buck, Advanced Calculus ; Courant and John, Introduction to       Calculus and Analysis ; Strang, Linear Algebra ;     Churchill, Complex Variables and Applications .           Master's Thesis      Students choosing the second option will work on a master's     thesis under the supervision of a mathematics faculty member     acting as their thesis advisor. In certain cases involving     interdisciplinary research, a second advisor outside the     Department of Mathematics may be approved by the Director of     Graduate Studies. A proposal outlining the program for the     thesis will be submitted to the Director of Graduate Studies     for approval. Upon completion, a master's thesis must be     approved by the thesis advisor and a second reader of his/her     choice.           Applying for the Ph.D. program     Continuing M.S. students who wish to apply for the Ph.D. program    must first earn the grade of A on the Written Comprehensive    Examinations. As part of the application process, such    students will also be required to prepare and give a    presentation on a mathematical topic to a specially appointed    faculty committee. Ideally, the presentation should take    place during the semester in which the written examinations were    passed. Please note that earning the grade of A in the    written examinations and giving the scientific presentation do    not constitute in themselves an offer of admission to the Ph.D.    program.                Academic Standards      To continue registering for courses in the Department of     Mathematics, a student must be in a good academic standing,     fulfilling the following requirements:           Students must maintain an average of B or better (3.0) in     their first 12 credits. Students failing to achieve this     will not be permitted to continue in the program. Students     cannot obtain an M.S. degree unless they have maintained an     overall average of at least B           Students will be allowed no more than four no-credit     grades, withdrawals, or unresolved incomplete grades during     their academic tenure, and no more than two such grades in     the first six courses for which they have registered.           Credit will be given for up to two core courses taken     elsewhere, subject to the normal GSAS restrictions on     transfer of credit and the approval of the Program     Coordinator. At least 30 course points must be taken at New     York University.
