Together with Africana Studies, Latino Studies, Metropolitan Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, and American Studies, we offer one of the most cutting-edge programs of study at NYU, dedicated to advancing progressive interdisciplinary scholarship.    As part of the Department of Social &amp; Cultural Analysis, we cross disciplines and communities with even greater depth than we had in the past. We now also offer a major in A/P/A Studies -- a goal since our founding in 1996 -- and we are in the process of hiring a fourth full-time faculty member.    The A/P/A Major and Minor    Students interested in majoring or minoring in A/P/A Studies should read through the information on our Program of Study page and and then the instructions on the Declare a Major or Minor page. Join the growing number of A/P/A majors and minors today!    Faculty    A/P/A Studies' faculty come from diverse backgrounds. All are exemplary in their respective fields, and all active members of their communities outside of academia. What does that entail for the students taking their courses? The short answer: a progressive education on the cutting edge of research, grounded in the reality that sources it. The long answer: find out by reading about our faculty list .    Courses    The Program in Asian/Pacific/American Studies offers NYU undergrads a range of exciting courses exploring the histories, experiences and cultural production of Asian/Pacific Americans. A/P/A Studies classes cross boundaries between literature, history, film criticism, art history, urban studies, legal studies, and gender/sexuality studies. Our courses debunk and critique prevailing representations of Asians, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders and connect the lives and concerns of local communities to national and global dynamics. A/P/A's classes are progressive, experiential, and dynamic.               Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
