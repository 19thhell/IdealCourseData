The essays place Shahn&rsquo;s work in context, providing an interdisciplinary analysis of the artist&rsquo;s images of race, social class, and urban street life during the Great Depression. The astounding images introduce contemporary viewers to the infamous speakeasies of Greenwich Village, the street orators of Union Square, and the produce merchants of the Lower East Side, confirming Shahn&rsquo;s active participation in these &ldquo;scenes of living theater,&rdquo; as the artist&rsquo;s first published photographs of the city were appropriately titled. These photographs inspired many of his most important paintings, and established a photographic aesthetic and working process that would characterize his art for decades."}]}]
