New York University is a charter member of Internet2, and      has used the network to collaborate on a variety of multi-site      performances and events.           related pages            NYU Digital Studio       Internet2 Website                       NYU-NET: NYU's Data Network   Internet2: Advanced Internet Services   Advanced Networking Publications      NYU-NET: NYU's Data Network   In addition to interconnecting University facilities, the NYU data network, NYU-NET, enables a great many research and High Performance Computing (HPC) initiatives on campus, and provides campus access to external research and educational resources . NYU-NET has high speed connections to the Internet, the Internet2 network, and NYSERNet .    NYU is a founding board member of NYSERNet, a not-for-profit organization that promotes networking and computing within New York State, and is the local New York RON (Regional Optical Network service provider) for access to Research and Education networks throughout the world. NYSERNet is the host of MANLAN, a growing and significant hub of R&E communications in the northeastern U.S., and in partnership with NYSERNet, NYU has acquired direct fiber optic communications to MANLAN and has co-located network communications equipment within the facility. Through MANLAN, NYU has obtained a 1 Gbps connection to the CERN Physics Research Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland ( www.cern.ch ) and the UltraLight hybrid optical research network ( ultralight.caltech.edu ). Access to the National Lambda Rail (NLR, www.nlr.net ) is also made possible via MANLAN, and NYU is currently deploying DWDM (Dense Wave Division Multiplexing) optical network infrastructure which can support campus connections to NLR.   Additional NYU-NET Information     NYU was an early adopter of the IPv6 communications technology, and, in 2005, became the first university in the United States to provide global IPv6 connectivity to a supercomputer.   NYU-NET support multicast network services that enable one computer to communicate with many others simultaneously while sending only one network transmission.   The NYU-NET Core currently has a bandwidth-carrying capacity of 480 Gbps, or almost .5 terabits per second, capable of supporting the most demanding network applications.   High Performance Computing systems offered by ITS are provided high-speed Gigabit Ethernet connections in order to transfer large data sets at high rate, both within the campus network and externally via the University connections to the Internet and Internet2 networks.   For additional information about NYU-NET, see www.nyu.edu/its/nyunet/ .     Internet2: Advanced Internet Services     Internet2 is a consortium led by 206 universities, including NYU, that work in partnership   with industry and government to develop and deploy advanced network applications and technologies, accelerating the creation of tomorrow's Internet. NYU was a participant in the early planning of NewNet, Internet2's next-generation hybrid optical network, which is a nationwide DWDM network that can provide private high-speed network connections on demand between capable Internet2 members. With its DWDM infrastructure deployment and presence in MANLAN, NYU is also positioned to support research activities that might require NewNet access. Interconnections with other institutions and networks, known as peerings, are similarly also possible, and can be explored as needed with research groups or departments to further University endeavors.    ITS networking and NYU Digital Studio staff are available to facilitate the use of NYU's Internet2 high-speed connection for education, collaboration, and scholarship.

TSS is involved in high-impact incidents such as emergency response, sensitive data disclosures, serious network events, and, when appropriate, participation in investigations conducted by either NYU Public Safety or external law enforcement agencies.    Vulnerability Scans   TSS continuously evaluates New York University's computers, networks, data, and personal workstations through a variety of methods, including general network scans. Upon request by systems administrators, our group will scan computers and networks to test for vulnerabilities and exploits.    Education   The TSS group actively seeks to develop greater security awareness by educating the NYU community on how to safely use a variety of technologies. We identify, research, and promote \"best practices\" regarding the security of data and systems.    Through various means, the TSS group alerts the general NYU community of security issues and instructs users on computer security best practices. These methods include, but are not limited to, the Security Alerts mailing list, the Security Alerts section on NYU Home, and the Computer Security Alerts and Computer Security News web pages. The TSS group also publishes important security articles in Connect magazine.    As a result of research and development, we also implement new concepts for security training sessions and broader security initiatives.    Research and Development   TSS reviews existing and innovative communications applications and assesses secure applications for use at the University and in University projects. We also assist in instituting campus standards for security and review applicable policies and procedures in the context of these standards.    What We Can Do for Your NYU Department     Sensitive Data   Security Applications   Consultations   Vulnerability Scanning   Product Review   Training   Systems Administrators      Sensitive Data   Do you have systems that house sensitive data such as student or financial information? You can check with us on making and keeping this data secure. We can also answer questions about compliance with federal security requirements.    Security Applications   We have security applications such as anti-spyware and antivirus software available for you to protect your system. If there is other software you would like to use, feel free to contact us for advice.

New York University is a charter member of Internet2, and      has used the network to collaborate on a variety of multi-site      performances and events.           related pages            NYU Digital Studio       Internet2 Website                       NYU-NET: NYU's Data Network   Internet2: Advanced Internet Services   Advanced Networking Publications      NYU-NET: NYU's Data Network   In addition to interconnecting University facilities, the NYU data network, NYU-NET, enables a great many research and High Performance Computing (HPC) initiatives on campus, and provides campus access to external research and educational resources . NYU-NET has high speed connections to the Internet, the Internet2 network, and NYSERNet .    NYU is a founding board member of NYSERNet, a not-for-profit organization that promotes networking and computing within New York State, and is the local New York RON (Regional Optical Network service provider) for access to Research and Education networks throughout the world. NYSERNet is the host of MANLAN, a growing and significant hub of R&E communications in the northeastern U.S., and in partnership with NYSERNet, NYU has acquired direct fiber optic communications to MANLAN and has co-located network communications equipment within the facility. Through MANLAN, NYU has obtained a 1 Gbps connection to the CERN Physics Research Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland ( www.cern.ch ) and the UltraLight hybrid optical research network ( ultralight.caltech.edu ). Access to the National Lambda Rail (NLR, www.nlr.net ) is also made possible via MANLAN, and NYU is currently deploying DWDM (Dense Wave Division Multiplexing) optical network infrastructure which can support campus connections to NLR.   Additional NYU-NET Information     NYU was an early adopter of the IPv6 communications technology, and, in 2005, became the first university in the United States to provide global IPv6 connectivity to a supercomputer.   NYU-NET support multicast network services that enable one computer to communicate with many others simultaneously while sending only one network transmission.   The NYU-NET Core currently has a bandwidth-carrying capacity of 480 Gbps, or almost .5 terabits per second, capable of supporting the most demanding network applications.   High Performance Computing systems offered by ITS are provided high-speed Gigabit Ethernet connections in order to transfer large data sets at high rate, both within the campus network and externally via the University connections to the Internet and Internet2 networks.   For additional information about NYU-NET, see www.nyu.edu/its/nyunet/ .     Internet2: Advanced Internet Services     Internet2 is a consortium led by 206 universities, including NYU, that work in partnership   with industry and government to develop and deploy advanced network applications and technologies, accelerating the creation of tomorrow's Internet. NYU was a participant in the early planning of NewNet, Internet2's next-generation hybrid optical network, which is a nationwide DWDM network that can provide private high-speed network connections on demand between capable Internet2 members. With its DWDM infrastructure deployment and presence in MANLAN, NYU is also positioned to support research activities that might require NewNet access. Interconnections with other institutions and networks, known as peerings, are similarly also possible, and can be explored as needed with research groups or departments to further University endeavors.    ITS networking and NYU Digital Studio staff are available to facilitate the use of NYU's Internet2 high-speed connection for education, collaboration, and scholarship.
