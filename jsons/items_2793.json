Religion,  Sexuality, and Public Life    RELST-UA  646 Offered  periodically. Pellegrini. 4 points.    The  U.S. was founded on the promise of religious freedom, yet laws and policies  regulating sexual life draw on specifically religious notions of \"good\" versus  \"bad\" sex, what bodies are \"for,\" and what kinds of human relationships are  valuable. Considers this apparent contradiction and the implications, for both  sexual and religious freedom, of treating sexual life as a special case.  Utilizes critical approaches to the study of religion in society and engages  with important work in the interdisciplinary field of gender and sexuality  studies.

Offered in the spring. 4 points. Complements and develops the methodological and theoretical emphasis encountered in Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion, albeit with a higher level of specificity and sophistication. The focus is on a specific thematic motif with cross-cultural applicability (for example, ritual, the body, sacrifice, religion and the state). Students can explore the import of the motif in question for their own area of specialization, as well as examine its manifestations in other traditions. Students are expected to make formal presentations to the class. What Is Islam? RELST-UA 85 Identical to MEIS-UA 691, HIST-UA 85. Offered yearly. 4 points. An introductory course dealing with the life of the Prophet Muhammad and the origins of Islam; the beliefs and practices of the Islamic community; differences between Sunni and Shi\u2019ite Islam; Sufism; the spiritual, intellectual, and artistic life of the Islamic commonwealth; and modern Islamic revival.

Judaism, Christianity, and Islam RELST-UA 102 Identical to MEDI-UA 25, MEIS-UA 800, HBRJD-UA 160. Offered yearly. 4 points. This course seeks to uncover the differences and similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as religious traditions, and to assess their roles and interactions in the formation and functions of human societies. We will examine the ancient origins and contemporary relevance of these monotheistic traditions through the methodological and theoretical frameworks of the academic discipline of religious studies to gain an understanding of their connections to culture, society, and politics. We will root our study in consideration of ancient and medieval sources of each religion, while simultaneously reflecting upon the significance of their development for modern societies. We will emphasize the immense variety of expression found among Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Indeed, our study will uncover the existence of Judaisms, Christianities, and Islams, rather than a trio of theological monoliths. Such variation will be placed in tension with the strong similarities\u2014family resemblances\u2014shared among these religions.

Belief and Social Life in China RELST-UA 351 Identical to ANTH-UA 351, EAST-UA 351. Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points . The Chinese word for religion means \u201cteaching.\u201d \u201cTeaching\u201d immediately implies at least two people, and belief in China has always been theorized and practiced as mediated by the presence of others, miraculous and mundane. The course explores what Chinese people \u201ctaught\u201d themselves about the person, society, and the natural world and thus how social life was constructed and maintained. It examines in historical perspective the classic texts of the Taoist and Confucian canon and their synthesis; and Buddhism and the synthesis of the \u201cThree Teachings.\u201d We will introduce modern religious life in Taiwan and in the People\u2019s Republic.

Confessional Culture from Augustine to Oprah RELST-UA 561 Offered every other year. Pellegrini. 4 points. Traces the different uses and forms \u201cthe confession\u201d has taken in Western culture. How has the confession evolved from a specifically religious practice to become a genre of self-making in a putatively secular modernity? A consistent concern is the way confessional practices have increasingly become linked to sex and sexuality. The range of texts and genres surveyed includes philosophical and religious treatises, political pamphlets, legal history of confession, psychoanalytic case studies, feminist consciousness-raising, coming-out stories, self-help literature, tell-all celebrity autobiographies, TV talk shows, YouTube, and film/video. What can we learn from the differences and similarities between these confessional modes, their cultural locations, their historical moments, and their ideological effects?

Jews and Christians in the Ancient World RELST-UA 611 Identical to CLASS-UA 611, HBRJD-UA 128. Offered periodically. Becker. 4 points. Students acquire a basic knowledge of the early history of Judaism and Christianity. However, on the theoretical level, the course aims to provide students with a forum for asking some of the questions most relevant to religious studies: Are we to use self-definition, typology, or both in our formulating religious categories? How do certain categories help and hinder our understanding of religious and other social phenomena? What is the relationship between ideology and the social world? How do we learn about the \u201creal\u201d world from literary evidence? Religion, State, and Politics RELST-UA 613 Offered periodically. 4 points. Introduces students to the debate on secularism by following a comparative approach. Students first gain basic knowledge related to the emergence and development of the secularization paradigm. In a second step, they confront it with empirical data. Concretely, this course introduces different examples of state-religion relationships and discusses the impact of the respective historical experiences and religio-cultural backgrounds on them. This agenda serves to develop a critical overview on the scope and limits of secularization theory and provides students with basic tools to situate current debates on religion in a broader theoretical frame. Religious Bodies RELST-UA 642 Identical to ANTH-UA 29. No prerequisites. Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Human physicality is something that we share in our \u201cnatures,\" yet constantly elaborate differently in our \u201ccultures.\" This course explores some of the rich and often conflicted relationships between cultures of religious practices and the human body: the body as medium both for ritual and religious experience; the body as locus for virtue and sin; the split between mind and body. We look at the body in various situations\u2014gendered, sexualized, covered, naked, suffering, disabled, altered, missing\u2014and interrogate notions of representations and ideals\u2014from the religious ban on representing the human body to divine anthropomorphism. This course examines a variety of religions and practices. Religion and Media RELST-UA 645 Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Introduces the long-standing and complex connection between religious practices and various media. Analyzes how human hearing, vision, and the performing body have been used historically to express and maintain religious life through music, voice, images, words, and rituals. Attention is then devoted to more recent electronic media such as radio, film, television, video, and the Internet. An anthropological/historical perspective on studying religion is pursued. Prior course work in religious studies, anthropology, or media studies would be helpful, but it is not necessary if you are willing to work hard. Religion, Sexuality, and Public Life RELST-UA 646 Offered periodically. Pellegrini. 4 points. This country was founded on the promise of religious freedom, and yet U.S. laws and policies regulating sexual life derive much of their rationale from specifically religious notions of \u201cgood\u201d versus \u201cbad\u201d sex, what bodies are \u201cfor,\u201d and what kinds of human relationships are valuable. How are we to understand this apparent contradiction? If sexual life is a special case, what makes it so? Finally, what are the implications, for both sexual and religious freedom, of treating sexual life as a special case? Course materials are designed to introduce students to critical approaches to the study of religion in society, as well as to familiarize them with important work in the interdisciplinary areas of gender and sexuality studies. Topics in Religious Studies RELST-UA 650 4 points. The emphasis of this course varies each year and is designed to allow flexibility in course offerings from visiting scholars and specialists in particular fields.

Christian evangelicals makes up over a quarter of the American population\u2014by some estimates number up to 100 million people\u2014and have held central leadership positions in government, business, and entertainment. But where did they come from, and what do they believe? This course traces the history of modern evangelicalism from its roots in the transatlantic awakenings of the 18th century through to the present. Along the way, we cover colonial America and religion in the new nation, evangelical reform in the nineteenth century, the clash between fundamentalists and modernists, holiness and Pentecostal movements, African American evangelicalism and the civil rights movement, the Christian right, youth movements, and neo-evangelicalism. We address variations in theology and religious practice with particular attention to how evangelicals have negotiated, revised, or defined central tenets of modern Western culture, including contemporary understandings of gender, race and ethnicity, performance, nation, sexuality, and economies.

This course in the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \u201cIslamic society\u201d is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. The emphasis in the premodern period is first on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search for religious identity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic societies in the words of their own writings."}, {"content": "Undergraduate Courses Fall 2015    | Classics | NYU                                                          Back to  previous page                  Undergraduate Courses Fall 2015   CLASS-UA 003 , Elementary Latin I 001.

CLASS-UA 202, The Body in Antiquity , M&amp;W 2:00-3:15, Claire Bubb This course considers the body in the ancient world. It will focus on scientific understanding of physiological function as well as contemporary cultural, religious, and legal attitudes to the corpse and the living body. We will begin with mummies and the medical texts of Ancient Egypt and move chronologically through Greek and Roman periods, ending with Arabic transmission and interpretation of Classical thought. Scientific topics will include the developing understanding of the vascular system and the so-called \u201cfailure\u201d to discover circulation, philosophical and physiological discussions of cognitive function and the soul-body interface, and the ongoing debate between head- and heart-centric theories. Cultural topics will include burial practices, the early Christian view of the body, the body as class signifier in Roman law, and the body in literature from Homer to Greek and Arabic novels. CLASS-UA242, identical to HIST-UA 200, HEL-UA 242 Greek History from the Bronze Age to Alexander, T&amp;Th 12:15-1:145, Barbara Kowalzig Until a few decades ago, Greek history began with Homer and dealt narrowly with the Greek world. Thanks to archaeology, the social sciences, and other historical tools, the chronological and geographical horizons have been pushed back. The history of the Greeks now starts in the third millennium B.C.E. and is connected to the civilization that lay to the east, rooted in Egypt and Mesopotamia. This course traces Greek history from the Greeks' earliest appearance to the advent of Alexander. CLASS-UA 292, History of Ancient Law , M&amp;W 11:00-12:15, Michael Peachin Examines the development of law and legal systems and the relationships of these to the societies that created them, starting with some ancient Near Eastern systems and working down to the Roman period.

This course will cover these and many others questions concerning going to school in antiquity, from Plato to late Roman times. It will cover the three basic levels from elementary to grammatical and rhetorical education. Particular emphasis will be put on rhetorical education and students will learn to compose declamations. The course will be based on literary and archaeological sources, and on the educational material from Greco-Roman Egypt. Most of the readings will be posted on Blackboard. Attendance is mandatory. There will be midterm and final exams and a short paper. CLASS-UA 351, Archaeologies of Rome and the Empire , T&amp;TH 9:30-10:45, Sebastian Heath In this course we examine the visual and material culture of ancient Rome - including objects, images, buildings and sculpture - in order to gain a better understanding of how it functioned as an imperial system. The chronological range is the later centuries BCE, when Rome took control of overseas lands, through the fourth century CE, by which time military pressure and Christianity are changing the nature of the Roman state. In this long timespan, Rome created a spectacularly successful territorial empire that is expressed in material forms. The course will progress chronologically while pausing on particular topics, such as the effect on the capital of Rome's first conquests, the role of imperial propaganda and economic integration in cities such as Pompeii and Troy, and the creation of multi-cultural societies on Rome's eastern frontier. We'll look at large-scale art such as imperial portraits while also taking account of archaeological finds, such as Roman pottery on the shores of the Indian Ocean. Our goal is to let the objects speak for themselves while making use of our modern vocabulary of imperial hegemony and the response of conquered peoples. CLASS-UA 700, identical to PHIL-UA 122, HEL-UA 700, Greek Thinkers , M&amp;W 3:30-4:45, David Sider Western theorizing begins with the Greeks, who can be said to have invented or introduced all manner of thinking about the universe and human nature.Illustrative texts from the presocratics, mathematicians, philosophers, historians, and tragedians will be read. CLASS-UA 701, identical to COLIT-UA 852, Socrates and His Critics , T&amp;TH 11:00-12:15, Vincent Renzi Despite having written nothing himself, Socrates is\u2014if not the most influential\u2014certainly one of the most influential intellectual figures in the Western tradition, for it is with Socrates, we are told, that \u201cphilosophy\u201d seems first to move from natural history to an explicit concern for human affairs. Indeed, so great is the magnitude of this change that we continue to term earlier thinkers \u201cpre-Socratic philosophers.\u201d His stature is marked again in the name given to a distinctive form of philosophical literature, the Socratic discourse, and an approach to philosophical inquiry and instruction, the so-called Socratic method. In antiquity, importantly, he inspired Plato, Xenophon, the Stoics, the Skeptics, and the Cynics, beyond those thinkers stretching to influence in Rome and Judea...and four centuries before the presumed time of Jesus, Socrates had already suffered martyrdom for his idiosyncratic political and religious views. In modernity, his life both fascinates and repels the attention, notably, of Nietzsche; though criticisms of his mode of existence he had already endured in his own time at the hands of the comedian Aristophanes, among others. Given the state of the evidence, one can look only to the history of the reception of his thought to try to recover any sense of the \u201chistorical Socrates\u201d; but we must likewise ask whether he does not perhaps exert a greater influence as a result of the reception of the doxography itself than for his actual intellectual contributions. In short, had Socrates never existed, would not the tradition essentially have had to create him, in its move from its origins to ethics and political philosophy? Even given that he did actually live, is what we have of him really just such a necessary fiction?  CLASS-UA 876, Advanced Latin: Confessions, M&amp;W 9:30-10:145, Adam Becker This course will consist of close reading in Latin of selections from Augustine\u2019s Confessions . Composed in the late fourth century, the Confessions provides an excellent introduction to the cultural world of the later Roman Empire. We will examine Augustine\u2019s ideas and the idiosyncrasies of his language, and also consider how his text is in conversation with Classical literature. Through supplementary readings and occasional lectures students will learn about the background and context of the author and his work. Broader topics will include the early Christian reception of Classical Antiquity, Neoplatonism, Manichaeism, the cult of the saints, the emergence of monasticism, early Christian notions of the body and sexuality, Christian interpretation of scripture, and the creation of a new Christian literary culture. CLASS-UA 973, Advanced Greek: Sophocles' Trachiniae, T&amp;TH 9:30-10:45, Anne Carson A study of Sophokles' Trachiniai with attention to different modes and styles of translation. I am interested in having the class create (communally) a new translation to be presented as a staged reading at the end of term, perhaps for the delectation of the rest of the department.

This course seeks to uncover the differences and similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as religious traditions, and to assess their roles and interactions in the formation and functions of human societies. We will examine the ancient origins and contemporary relevance of these monotheistic traditions through the methodological and theoretical frameworks of the academic discipline of religious studies to gain an understanding of their connections to culture, society, and politics. We will root our study in consideration of ancient and medieval sources of each religion, while simultaneously reflecting upon the significance of their development for modern societies. We will emphasize the immense variety of expression found among Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Indeed, our study will uncover the existence of Judaisms, Christianities, and Islams, rather than a trio of theological monoliths. Such variation will be placed in tension with the strong similarities\u2014family resemblances\u2014shared among these religions.

The course explores what Chinese people \u201ctaught\u201d themselves about the person, society, and the natural world and thus how social life was constructed and maintained. It examines in historical perspective the classic texts of the Taoist and Confucian canon and their synthesis; and Buddhism and the synthesis of the \u201cThree Teachings.\u201d We will introduce modern religious life in Taiwan and in the People\u2019s Republic. Classical Mythology RELST-UA 404 Identical to CLASS-UA 404. Meineche. 4 points. See description under Classics in this Bulletin. Jewish Responses to Modernity: Religion and Nationalism RELST-UA 470 Identical to HBRJD-UA 719. 4 points. See description under Hebrew and Judaic Studies in this Bulletin. Confessional Culture from Augustine to Oprah RELST-UA 561 Offered every other year. Pellegrini. 4 points. Traces the different uses and forms \u201cthe confession\u201d has taken in Western culture. How has the confession evolved from a specifically religious practice to become a genre of self-making in a putatively secular modernity? A consistent concern is the way confessional practices have increasingly become linked to sex and sexuality. The range of texts and genres surveyed includes philosophical and religious treatises, political pamphlets, legal history of confession, psychoanalytic case studies, feminist consciousness-raising, coming-out stories, self-help literature, tell-all celebrity autobiographies, TV talk shows, YouTube, and film/video. What can we learn from the differences and similarities between these confessional modes, their cultural locations, their historical moments, and their ideological effects? The History of Religions of Africa RELST-UA 566 Identical to HIST-UA 566, SCA-UA 0790. Hull. 4 points. See description under History in this Bulletin.

Jews in the Islamic World in the Modern Period RELST-UA 610 Identical to MEIS-UA 616, HBRJD-UA 114. 4 points. See description under Hebrew and Judaic Studies in this Bulletin. Jews and Christians in the Ancient World RELST-UA 611 Identical to CLASS-UA 611, HBRJD-UA 128. Offered periodically. Becker. 4 points. Students acquire a basic knowledge of the early history of Judaism and Christianity. However, on the theoretical level, the course aims to provide students with a forum for asking some of the questions most relevant to religious studies: Are we to use self-definition, typology, or both in our formulating religious categories? How do certain categories help and hinder our understanding of religious and other social phenomena? What is the relationship between ideology and the social world? How do we learn about the \u201creal\u201d world from literary evidence? Religion, State, and Politics RELST-UA 613 Offered periodically. 4 points. Introduces students to the debate on secularism by following a comparative approach. Students first gain basic knowledge related to the emergence and development of the secularization paradigm. In a second step, they confront it with empirical data. Concretely, this course introduces different examples of state-religion relationships and discusses the impact of the respective historical experiences and religio-cultural backgrounds on them. This agenda serves to develop a critical overview on the scope and limits of secularization theory and provides students with basic tools to situate current debates on religion in a broader theoretical frame. Religious Bodies RELST-UA 642 Identical to ANTH-UA 29. No prerequisites. Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Human physicality is something that we share in our \u201cnatures,\" yet constantly elaborate differently in our \u201ccultures.\" This course explores some of the rich and often conflicted relationships between cultures of religious practices and the human body: the body as medium both for ritual and religious experience; the body as locus for virtue and sin; the split between mind and body. We look at the body in various situations\u2014gendered, sexualized, covered, naked, suffering, disabled, altered, missing\u2014and interrogate notions of representations and ideals\u2014from the religious ban on representing the human body to divine anthropomorphism. This course examines a variety of religions and practices. Religion and Media RELST-UA 645 Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Introduces the long-standing and complex connection between religious practices and various media. Analyzes how human hearing, vision, and the performing body have been used historically to express and maintain religious life through music, voice, images, words, and rituals. Attention is then devoted to more recent electronic media such as radio, film, television, video, and the Internet. An anthropological/historical perspective on studying religion is pursued. Prior course work in religious studies, anthropology, or media studies would be helpful, but it is not necessary if you are willing to work hard. Religion, Sexuality, and Public Life RELST-UA 646 Offered periodically. Pellegrini. 4 points. This country was founded on the promise of religious freedom, and yet U.S. laws and policies regulating sexual life derive much of their rationale from specifically religious notions of \u201cgood\u201d versus \u201cbad\u201d sex, what bodies are \u201cfor,\u201d and what kinds of human relationships are valuable. How are we to understand this apparent contradiction? If sexual life is a special case, what makes it so? Finally, what are the implications, for both sexual and religious freedom, of treating sexual life as a special case? Course materials are designed to introduce students to critical approaches to the study of religion in society, as well as to familiarize them with important work in the interdisciplinary areas of gender and sexuality studies. Topics in Religious Studies RELST-UA 650 4 points. The emphasis of this course varies each year and is designed to allow flexibility in course offerings from visiting scholars and specialists in particular fields. Past examinations have included Christianity and culture, American evangelicalism, religion and violence, and postcolonialism. Martyrdom, Ancient and Modern RELST-UA 660 Identical to CLASS-UA 646. Offered every other year. Becker. 4 points. Examines the theory and practice of martyrdom in the West. Begins with a close study of the development of the martyrological discourse in classical, early Christian, early Jewish, and Muslim literature and culture. Also traces how the concept of martyrdom is deployed in modern culture in various phenomena, such as the \u201cColumbine martyrs,\u201d \u201cmartyrdom operations\u201d (\u201csuicide bombers\u201d), political martyrdom, and modern notions of holy war.

Christian evangelicals makes up over a quarter of the American population\u2014by some estimates number up to 100 million people\u2014and have held central leadership positions in government, business, and entertainment. But where did they come from, and what do they believe? This course traces the history of modern evangelicalism from its roots in the transatlantic awakenings of the 18th century through to the present. Along the way, we cover colonial America and religion in the new nation, evangelical reform in the nineteenth century, the clash between fundamentalists and modernists, holiness and Pentecostal movements, African American evangelicalism and the civil rights movement, the Christian right, youth movements, and neo-evangelicalism. We address variations in theology and religious practice with particular attention to how evangelicals have negotiated, revised, or defined central tenets of modern Western culture, including contemporary understandings of gender, race and ethnicity, performance, nation, sexuality, and economies. Anthropology of Religion RELST-UA 829 Identical to ANTH-UA 30. 4 points. See description under Anthropology in this Bulletin. Introduction to Buddhism RELST-UA 832 Identical to EAST-UA 832. Offered periodically. 4 points. An introduction to this complex religion, emphasizing its history, teachings, and practices. Discusses its doctrinal development in India, then emphasizes certain local practices: Buddhism and the family in China; Buddhism, language, and hierarchy in Japan; the politics of Buddhist Tibet; and Buddhist art. Finally, the course touches on Buddhism in the United States. Tibetan Buddhism RELST-UA 835 Identical to EAST-UA 835. Offered periodically. 4 points. An introduction to Tibetan Buddhism doctrine and practice. Approaches the subject from historical and thematic perspectives, beginning with a close study of one of the classic Tibetan guides to Tibetan Buddhism for a solid foundation in the principles of the tradition. Proceeds along a historical track, beginning with the seventh-century arrival of Buddhism in Tibet to the present-day encounter with Western devotees of exiled Tibetan lamas. Topics include doctrinal innovation, ritual, myth, art, sacred geography, revelation, and the role of Buddhism in Tibet\u2019s relationship with its neighbors. Readings consist of primary texts in translation and secondary literature on the study of religion and Tibetan Buddhism. The Sufis: Mystics of Islam RELST-UA 863 Identical to MEIS-UA 863. Chelkowski. 4 points. See description under Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies in this Bulletin. Internship RELST-UA 980, 981 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 1 to 4 points per term. Independent Study RELST-UA 997, 998 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 1 to 4 points per term. Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Societies MAP-UA 502 Offered every year. 4 points. This course in the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \u201cIslamic society\u201d is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. The emphasis in the premodern period is first on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search for religious identity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic societies in the words of their own writings."}, {"content": "Undergraduate Courses Fall 2015    | Classics | NYU                                                          Back to  previous page                  Undergraduate Courses Fall 2015   CLASS-UA 003 , Elementary Latin I 001. M-Th 9:30-10:45 TBA 002. M-Th 3:30-4:45, TBA Introduction to the essentials of Latin, the language of Vergil, Caesar, and Seneca. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Latin rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 006, Intermediate Latin I: Reading Prose 001. M, T, Th 9:30-10:45, TBA 002. M, T, W 3:30-4:45, TBA Teaches second-year students to read Latin prose through comprehensive grammar review; emphasis on the proper techniques for reading (correct phrase division, the identification of clauses, and reading in order); and practice reading at sight. Authors may include Caesar, Cicero, Cornelius Nepos, Livy, Petronius, or Pliny, at the instructor's discretion. CLASS-UA 007, Elementary Ancient Greek I, M-Th 11:00-12:15, TBA Introduction to the complex but highly beautiful language of ancient Greece--the language of Homer, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Plato. Students learn the essentials of ancient Greek vocabul ary, morphology, and syntax. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Greek rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 009, Intermediate Ancient Greek I: Plato , M,T,W 2:00-3:15, David Sider Reading of Plato\u2019s Apology and Crito and selections from the Republic. The purpose of the course is to develop facility in reading Attic prose. Supplements readings in Greek with lectures on Socrates and the Platonic dialogues. CLASS-UA 202, The Body in Antiquity , M&amp;W 2:00-3:15, Claire Bubb This course considers the body in the ancient world. It will focus on scientific understanding of physiological function as well as contemporary cultural, religious, and legal attitudes to the corpse and the living body. We will begin with mummies and the medical texts of Ancient Egypt and move chronologically through Greek and Roman periods, ending with Arabic transmission and interpretation of Classical thought. Scientific topics will include the developing understanding of the vascular system and the so-called \u201cfailure\u201d to discover circulation, philosophical and physiological discussions of cognitive function and the soul-body interface, and the ongoing debate between head- and heart-centric theories. Cultural topics will include burial practices, the early Christian view of the body, the body as class signifier in Roman law, and the body in literature from Homer to Greek and Arabic novels. CLASS-UA242, identical to HIST-UA 200, HEL-UA 242 Greek History from the Bronze Age to Alexander, T&amp;Th 12:15-1:145, Barbara Kowalzig Until a few decades ago, Greek history began with Homer and dealt narrowly with the Greek world. Thanks to archaeology, the social sciences, and other historical tools, the chronological and geographical horizons have been pushed back. The history of the Greeks now starts in the third millennium B.C.E. and is connected to the civilization that lay to the east, rooted in Egypt and Mesopotamia. This course traces Greek history from the Greeks' earliest appearance to the advent of Alexander. CLASS-UA 292, History of Ancient Law , M&amp;W 11:00-12:15, Michael Peachin Examines the development of law and legal systems and the relationships of these to the societies that created them, starting with some ancient Near Eastern systems and working down to the Roman period. The main focus is on the fully developed system of Roman law. CLASS-UA 291.000, Teachers, Students, and the Curriculum in the Greek and Roman World , T&amp;TH 2:00-3:15, Raffaella Cribiore                           Was ancient education open to all? Did ancient students have homework, vacations, and report cards? How was the curriculum of a liberal art education? This course will cover these and many others questions concerning going to school in antiquity, from Plato to late Roman times. It will cover the three basic levels from elementary to grammatical and rhetorical education. Particular emphasis will be put on rhetorical education and students will learn to compose declamations. The course will be based on literary and archaeological sources, and on the educational material from Greco-Roman Egypt. Most of the readings will be posted on Blackboard. Attendance is mandatory. There will be midterm and final exams and a short paper. CLASS-UA 351, Archaeologies of Rome and the Empire , T&amp;TH 9:30-10:45, Sebastian Heath In this course we examine the visual and material culture of ancient Rome - including objects, images, buildings and sculpture - in order to gain a better understanding of how it functioned as an imperial system. The chronological range is the later centuries BCE, when Rome took control of overseas lands, through the fourth century CE, by which time military pressure and Christianity are changing the nature of the Roman state. In this long timespan, Rome created a spectacularly successful territorial empire that is expressed in material forms. The course will progress chronologically while pausing on particular topics, such as the effect on the capital of Rome's first conquests, the role of imperial propaganda and economic integration in cities such as Pompeii and Troy, and the creation of multi-cultural societies on Rome's eastern frontier. We'll look at large-scale art such as imperial portraits while also taking account of archaeological finds, such as Roman pottery on the shores of the Indian Ocean. Our goal is to let the objects speak for themselves while making use of our modern vocabulary of imperial hegemony and the response of conquered peoples. CLASS-UA 700, identical to PHIL-UA 122, HEL-UA 700, Greek Thinkers , M&amp;W 3:30-4:45, David Sider Western theorizing begins with the Greeks, who can be said to have invented or introduced all manner of thinking about the universe and human nature.Illustrative texts from the presocratics, mathematicians, philosophers, historians, and tragedians will be read. CLASS-UA 701, identical to COLIT-UA 852, Socrates and His Critics , T&amp;TH 11:00-12:15, Vincent Renzi Despite having written nothing himself, Socrates is\u2014if not the most influential\u2014certainly one of the most influential intellectual figures in the Western tradition, for it is with Socrates, we are told, that \u201cphilosophy\u201d seems first to move from natural history to an explicit concern for human affairs. Indeed, so great is the magnitude of this change that we continue to term earlier thinkers \u201cpre-Socratic philosophers.\u201d His stature is marked again in the name given to a distinctive form of philosophical literature, the Socratic discourse, and an approach to philosophical inquiry and instruction, the so-called Socratic method. In antiquity, importantly, he inspired Plato, Xenophon, the Stoics, the Skeptics, and the Cynics, beyond those thinkers stretching to influence in Rome and Judea...and four centuries before the presumed time of Jesus, Socrates had already suffered martyrdom for his idiosyncratic political and religious views. In modernity, his life both fascinates and repels the attention, notably, of Nietzsche; though criticisms of his mode of existence he had already endured in his own time at the hands of the comedian Aristophanes, among others. Given the state of the evidence, one can look only to the history of the reception of his thought to try to recover any sense of the \u201chistorical Socrates\u201d; but we must likewise ask whether he does not perhaps exert a greater influence as a result of the reception of the doxography itself than for his actual intellectual contributions. In short, had Socrates never existed, would not the tradition essentially have had to create him, in its move from its origins to ethics and political philosophy? Even given that he did actually live, is what we have of him really just such a necessary fiction?  CLASS-UA 876, Advanced Latin: Confessions, M&amp;W 9:30-10:145, Adam Becker This course will consist of close reading in Latin of selections from Augustine\u2019s Confessions . Composed in the late fourth century, the Confessions provides an excellent introduction to the cultural world of the later Roman Empire. We will examine Augustine\u2019s ideas and the idiosyncrasies of his language, and also consider how his text is in conversation with Classical literature. Through supplementary readings and occasional lectures students will learn about the background and context of the author and his work. Broader topics will include the early Christian reception of Classical Antiquity, Neoplatonism, Manichaeism, the cult of the saints, the emergence of monasticism, early Christian notions of the body and sexuality, Christian interpretation of scripture, and the creation of a new Christian literary culture. CLASS-UA 973, Advanced Greek: Sophocles' Trachiniae, T&amp;TH 9:30-10:45, Anne Carson A study of Sophokles' Trachiniai with attention to different modes and styles of translation. I am interested in having the class create (communally) a new translation to be presented as a staged reading at the end of term, perhaps for the delectation of the rest of the department.
