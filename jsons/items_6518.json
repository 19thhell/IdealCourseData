Syllabus: 2012           Offers intensive individual and group work in the practice of expository writing for those students whose competency examination reveals the need for additional, foundational writing instruction. The course aims to better prepare admitted transfer students for the rigorous work they will have to complete in either Writing the Essay or an International Writing Workshop . The course concentrates on foundational work (grammar, syntax, paragraph development) leading to the creation of compelling essays (idea conception and development, effective use of evidence, understanding basic forms, and the art of persuasion).

Variously known as the I, the self, the persona (performed or feigned) or the identity we make or somehow possess, subjectivity as a subject suits writing because it is never fixed. Concern for the self is not, however, a self-centered pursuit. It has served as a medium through which readers and writers have been able to live deeply as historical agents and spiritual beings. Respect for self has flourished since antiquity. The ancients thought self-knowledge was fundamental to everything else, and conscientiousness is understood today as a cornerstone of citizenship. In this seminar we will acquaint ourselves with some landmark texts in the history of the mutable I, observing many artful variations made by key writers in the tradition of reflective autobiography. We will learn how to read these predecessors by moving with their rhythms or by accompanying them in cinematic time. Readings and visual materials have been chosen to be fun, challenging and various. They provide a selective foundation for what might be called the tradition of the individual person as he or she comes to self-awareness. Our readings serve as occasions for written imitation, reflection and improvisation. We will also rely on them as touchstones for our own writing practice.           While readings and films about the self often operate through closeness and disclosure, the best of them are also philosophical and scientific, thereby supporting our balanced objective of working reflectively and working interpretively. Our writing projects will span a variety of positions between a greater self beyond our own selfs mere self (what the poet Paul Valry once called some self miraculously superior to Myself ), and a more distanced assessment of selected, constructed selves from history and literary history.           Some of our readings are already known to us faintly, thanks to the diligent passivity of our cultural subconscious: Augustines Confessions, the first book of Prousts multi-volume oeuvre , Swanns Way ; Nella Larsens slender masterpiece from the Harlem Renaissance period, Passing; literary innovations by modern masters such as Luigi Pirandello, J.L. Borges, Natalia Ginzburg, and John Barth; and thoughtful analyses of performed and counterfeited selves by Judith Butler and R.D. Laing. Beguiling cinematic visions of erased, unreal, elusive, split, vague and plural selves come to us through Bernardo Bertolucci, Ingmar Bergman and Luis Buuel and in Stan Brakhages cinematic adventures into our inner, psychic life.

EXPOS-UA 15 A Spectrum of Essays: Reconceiving Artfulness and its Risks           Credits: 4 Instructor: Bruce Bromley, EWP Prequisite: Portfolio review           At the height of her fame as a mind that reimagines what essays and novels can do, Virginia Woolf presses her fellow makers and readers to consider that every moment is the centre and meeting place of an extraordinary number of perceptions which have not yet been expressed, showing us how life is always and inevitably much richer than we who try to express it. Like Woolf and her contemporaries, we belong to a world where feelings which used to come simple and separate do so no longer, where beauty is part ugliness; amusement part disgust; pleasure part pain. Emotions which used to enter the mind whole are now broken up on the threshold. These claims mean that we need to reconceive the very notion of threshold, along with the forms by which makers, in the disciplines available to us, structure the experience of living in relation to any boundary. How we ponder artfulness, Woolf implies, requires expansion, as so many influences which play . . . a large part in life have thus far escaped the novelist and her colleaguesamong them,the power of music, the stimulus of light, the effect on us of the shape of trees or the play of colour. To re-see the shapes whereby we express our contact with life will blur the boundaries between customarily separate art forms, Woolf implies, and involve us in the risks inherent in any attempt to make over, to make again, to make anew. What can the risks in play here teach us? At the service of contemplating that question, we will read work by Jennifer Egan, Rainer Maria Rilke, W.G. Sebald, and Woolf herself. We will listen to music that rethinks what sound, ordered into patterns, can make manifest. We will watch films by Pedro Almodvar, Fran&#1195;ois Ozon, Grant Gee, and Fran&#1195;ois Girard. And we will work at crafting essays that honor our attempts to amplify what shaped thinking can communicate. By November 8, 2014, please email Bruce Bromley at bdb2@nyu.edu to inquire how to submit what you think of as your finest essay, which will function as your portfolio review. Notice of selection will occur within eight days of your first contact.

What are sonnets trying to do? Who is speaking, and to whom? How does the form of the sonnet\u2014its rhyme scheme, metre, and the set of rhetorical expectations it engenders\u2014enable rather than constrict forms of passionate expression and persuasion. Why should we still be interested in this strange form today? What invites us to imagine ourselves as the speaker or recipient of the sonnets powerful speech acts? Why does it continue to speak to us, not only about love, desire, and the force of argument, but also of language itself? This course will examine the language of the sonnets of Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser and William Shakespeare from the perspective of a variety of philosophers and theorists who have had a significant impact on literary criticism, including Plato, Locke, Saussure, Benveniste, Bakhtin, Wittgenstein, Austin, Derrida and Lacan. It aims to reveal the continuing power of the sonnet in the twenty-first century, and its abiding influence in our discourses of desire, love and personal identity.

Variously known as the I, the self, the persona (performed or feigned) or the identity we make or somehow possess, subjectivity as a subject suits writing because it is never fixed. Concern for the self is not, however, a self-centered pursuit. It has served as a medium through which readers and writers have been able to live deeply as historical agents and spiritual beings. Respect for self has flourished since antiquity. The ancients thought self-knowledge was fundamental to everything else, and conscientiousness is understood today as a cornerstone of citizenship. In this seminar we will acquaint ourselves with some landmark texts in the history of the mutable I, observing many artful variations made by key writers in the tradition of reflective autobiography. We will learn how to read these predecessors by moving with their rhythms or by accompanying them in cinematic time. Readings and visual materials have been chosen to be fun, challenging and various. They provide a selective foundation for what might be called the tradition of the individual person as he or she comes to self-awareness. Our readings serve as occasions for written imitation, reflection and improvisation. We will also rely on them as touchstones for our own writing practice.           While readings and films about the self often operate through closeness and disclosure, the best of them are also philosophical and scientific, thereby supporting our balanced objective of working reflectively and working interpretively. Our writing projects will span a variety of positions between a greater self beyond our own selfs mere self (what the poet Paul Valry once called some self miraculously superior to Myself ), and a more distanced assessment of selected, constructed selves from history and literary history.           Some of our readings are already known to us faintly, thanks to the diligent passivity of our cultural subconscious: Augustines Confessions, the first book of Prousts multi-volume oeuvre , Swanns Way ; Nella Larsens slender masterpiece from the Harlem Renaissance period, Passing; literary innovations by modern masters such as Luigi Pirandello, J.L. Borges, Natalia Ginzburg, and John Barth; and thoughtful analyses of performed and counterfeited selves by Judith Butler and R.D. Laing. Beguiling cinematic visions of erased, unreal, elusive, split, vague and plural selves come to us through Bernardo Bertolucci, Ingmar Bergman and Luis Buuel and in Stan Brakhages cinematic adventures into our inner, psychic life.

EXPOS-UA 15 A Spectrum of Essays: Reconceiving Artfulness and its Risks           Credits: 4 Instructor: Bruce Bromley, EWP Prequisite: Portfolio review           At the height of her fame as a mind that reimagines what essays and novels can do, Virginia Woolf presses her fellow makers and readers to consider that every moment is the centre and meeting place of an extraordinary number of perceptions which have not yet been expressed, showing us how life is always and inevitably much richer than we who try to express it.

In 2006 she earned her LLB at Queen\u2019s Law School after having previously graduated from Queen\u2019s University in Politics and Philosophy. After two years of litigation practice in Toronto, Emily entered the International Legal Studies LLM program at New York University School of Law. She graduated from this program in 2009 with the Jerome Lipper Prize for distinction. From 2009-2011, Emily held a research fellowship at the Jean Monnet Center for Regional and International Economic Law and Justice at New York University School of Law. During this time, Emily served as the Associate Editor of the European Journal of International Law and also as the teaching assistant for the Institute for International Law and Justice . \u2028\u2028Emily\u2019s areas of interest are in legal theory, international law and comparative human rights. Her JSD project draws upon the philosophy of emotion to examine judicial reasoning in human rights and constitutional cases that involve dignity claims.     Research:   The dissertation examines the role of emotions in judicial interpretations of the concept of human dignity. Human dignity holds a central place in international human rights and domestic constitutional law. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights places the concept at the foundation of its rights regime, as do international covenants and a great many national constitutions. In countries where the concept is not explicitly adopted into the constitutional framework, it is increasingly read into existing rights. Yet theoretical accounts of human dignity fail to consider the important role that emotions play in judicial understandings of its infringement. Emily\u2019s dissertation addresses this gap by investigating how the concept helps rights claimants expose the injustice of a legislative scheme or government act through the admission of evidence detailing suffering and degradation.   Legal theory has itself deep and old commitments to weeding out emotions from evaluative judgment, most especially from the evaluative judgments of judges and jurists. This makes it a particularly exciting and fertile starting point for Emily's central claim, which is that to adjudicate properly the evaluative legal concept of human dignity, legal reasoning must both draw on certain social emotions and keep negative emotions at bay. The dissertation offers a methodology for approaching the study of emotions in the law and an argument showing how particular emotions come to play an important role the evaluative judgments of judges and jurists. Emily\u2019s research stands to enrich our understanding of the concept of human dignity and that of the role of emotions in legal reasoning.
