M-TH 9:30-10:45, Randolph Ford 002. M-TH 3:30-4:45, Ari Zatlin \u2028Introduction to the essentials of Latin, the language of Vergil, Caesar, and Seneca. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Latin rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 005, Intermediate Latin I: Reading Prose 001. M, T, TH 9:30-10:45, Benjamin Sammons 002. M, T, TH 3:30-4:45, Stefano Rebeggiani Teaches second-year students to read Latin prose through comprehensive grammar review; emphasis on the proper techniques for reading (correct phrase division, the identification of clauses, and reading in order); and practice reading at sight. Authors may include Caesar, Cicero, Cornelius Nepos, Livy, Petronius, or Pliny, at the instructor's discretion. CLASS-UA 007, Elementary Ancient Greek I , M-TH, 11:00-12:15, Benjamin Sammons Introduction to the complex but highly beautiful language of ancient Greece--the language of Homer, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Plato. Students learn the essentials of ancient Greek vocabulary, morphology, and syntax. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Greek rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 009, Intermediate Ancient Greek I: Plato , M, T, W, 2:00-3:15, Raffaella Cribiore\u2028 Reading of Plato\u2019s Apology and Crito and selections from the Republic . The purpose of the course is to develop facility in reading Attic prose. Supplements readings in Greek with lectures on Socrates and the Platonic dialogues. CLASS-UA 146, Greek and Roman Epic , M&amp;W, 3:30-4:45, David Konstan The epic tales of Achilles, Odysseus, Jason and the Argo, Aeneas and the founding of Rome, are among the enduring works of classical literature. They reflect and transform ancient traditions of folk tale, comment on the social and political life of their own times, and offer descriptions of character and human conflict that speak to us across the ages. In this course, we shall read, in modern translations, Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey , Apollonius\u2019 Voyage of the Argo , Virgil\u2019s Aeneid , Lucan\u2019s Civil War , and Statius Thebaid , on the war for control of Thebes between the two sons of Oedipus. CLASS-UA 210 (same as SCA-UA 818.001), Sexuality and Gender in Greece and Rome , M&amp;W, 12:30-1:45, David Sider In this course we shall examine the various ways the sex lives of women and men were socially constructed from birth to death, primarily in ancient Greece, with some attention paid to Rome. Most of the ancient texts on the subject were written by men, but we shall also be sure to study some of the few texts that have come down to us written by women. All of these issues will be examined primarily through original sources such as ancient documents, graffiti, legal sources, and literary texts, as well as painting and sculpture. A term paper is required. CLASS-UA 291.001 (same as RELST-UA 293.001), Belief and Practice in Greek Religion , TH, 2:00-4:45, Barbara Kowalzig The religions of ancient Greece and Rome are often regarded as highly pragmatic: they are thought to focus on \u2018practice\u2019, that is to say on ritual activity, ceremony and performance. Religious practice and social life, it is held, are so intertwined that the question of \u2018belief\u2019 did not really matter to them. As a result, historians of these ancient religions have neglected the emotional and intellectual dimensions of ancient belief-systems. Our course challenges the artificial separation of belief from practice by examining both ancient evidence and modern theory. We will take a close look at the evidence of ancient ritual in the light of contemporary ritual theory; we will also study self-reflexive attitudes and philosophical approaches to religious practice and the divine, and follow the academic debate on belief versus practice from its beginnings to the exciting recent approaches informed by the cognitive sciences. We will discuss a wide variety of ancient evidence, ranging from literary texts such as ancient hymns, tragedy and historiography, to inscriptions and the archaeology of ancient shrines and religious imagery. Accompanied by readings from social and cultural anthropology, religious sociology, philosophy and performance studies, all ancient texts will be read in translation. CLASS-UA 316 (same as ARTH-UA 150), The Parthenon , M, 4:55-7:25, Joan Connelly This colloquium traces the history of the Parthenon and its reception through its transformations from the temple of Athena, to Christian church, to mosque, to ruin, to icon of Western art and culture. The landscape, topography, and topology of the Athenian Acropolis are examined with an eye toward understanding the interrelation of place, myth, cult, and ritual. The architectural phases of the Parthenon, its program of sculptural decoration, its relationship to other monuments on the Acropolis, and the foundation myths that lie behind its meaning are scrutinized. Issues of reception, projection, and appropriation are considered, as well as interventions through conservation and reconstruction. Efforts to secure the repatriation of the Parthenon sculptures are reviewed within the broader context of global cultural heritage law and the opening of the New Acropolis Museum. CLASS-UA 352, Archaeologies of Greece , M&amp;W, 12:30-1:45, Joan Connelly This survey of Greek landscapes, sites, monuments, and images presents the art and archaeology of the Greek world from the Neolithic to the late antique period. Architecture, painting, sculpture, and decorative arts are studied within their full social, cultural, and religious contexts. From the palaces of the Aegean Bronze Age; to the Panhellenic sanctuaries at Olympia, Delphi, Nemea, and Isthmia; to the city of Athens and the monuments of the Athenian Acropolis; to the great Hellenistic cities of Asia Minor, special focus is placed on landscape, myth, memory, materials, and ritual in shaping the visual culture of ancient Greece. The formation of the city-state and its political, economic, and religious institutions are explored within their full urban settings. The development and history of classical archaeology as a discipline are reviewed, along with issues of reception, connoisseurship, critical theory, and methods. CLASS-UA 409 (same as RELST-UA 409), Ancient Religion: The Divine and the Diviners , M&amp;W, 11:00-12:15, David Levene The study of ancient religion is one of the most rapidly changing in classical scholarship, as increasingly sophisticated theoretical models are brought to bear on it: this module will provide an opportunity to study Roman religion in the period 200 B.C.-A.D. 150 in the light of these. It will examine the ancient development and significance of Roman religion in two key areas: that of the Greek philosophers, from whom the Romans derived most of their theoretical arguments; and the Romans\u2019 own religious ideas, traditions, and practices, which played a central part in their social and political life. We will study a large range of Roman religious ideas and religious practices, illustrating them from numerous literary and archaeological sources. We will link this practical material to a study of the religious views of the main philosophical schools at Rome, in particular the Stoics and Epicureans; here we will focus particularly on two texts of religious theory by Cicero: The Nature of the Gods and On Divination . CLASS-UA 873, Advanced Latin: Ovid, Metamorphoses , M&amp;W, 4:55-6:10, Alessandro Barchiesi Ovid's Latin is ideal for empowering your reading skills in Latin, and his style is a good introduction to all the later tradition of writing in Latin (Imperial, Medieval, and early modern). At the same time the poem is a portal to Greek myth, and the only fictional Latin text that provides names and heroes to psychoanalisis (Narcissus) and gender studies. Reading Ovid therefore has both a futuristic and a retrospective kind of reward.\u2028The class is designed for those who want to improve their Latin while at the same time learning about ancient culture and in particular its imaginary and the sensual world of mythological fiction. CLASS-UA 971, Advanced Greek: Herodotus , T&amp;TH, 11:00-12:15, Barbara Kowalzig This course of Advanced Greek focuses on passages across Herodotus\u2019 Histories that discuss the interrelationship of religion and society in Greek and non-Greek cultures, such as Lydia, Persia, Egypt, the peoples of the Ancient Near East, Libya and the Black Sea populations. We will read chapters concerning Herodotus\u2019 views of the role of religion in history; on the origins of the gods, on the workings of polytheism, on transcultural mythologies, on ritual and social customs and how they influence the course of history and the Persian Wars in particular. Emphasis will be laid on fluency in reading, on morphology, syntax and vocabulary; and on gaining an insight into relevant scholarship on Herodotus.
