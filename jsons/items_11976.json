It is driven by a passion for discovering previously unseen connections between premodern and postmodern thinking, both conscious and unconscious, and the conflicts and desires that help to shape it. Increasingly I have also become interested in how the Middle Ages are literally in the middle between antique culture and that of modernity. I have written on courtly literature as poised between antique logic and the logic of psychoanalysis, and on didactic poetry as illuminated both by scholastic views of universality and singularity, and by their postmodern re-articulations. My current work on medieval bestiaries is inspired equally by contemporary animal studies and by antique and medieval natural philosophy. At the heart of my inquiry is the material reality of the parchment pages on which almost all bestiaries were copied. Made from animal skin, parchment closely resembles human skin, and this ambiguity both affects the meaning of texts in which humans are invited to learn from other animals, and interferes in the experience of reading them.
