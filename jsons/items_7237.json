The GGFUP program transcends traditional international service learning models. Based on a vision of establishing long term partnerships with organizations that work on urban social justice issues, the fellowship emphasizes research, which the students co-design with organizations. Final projects are produced collectively, in dialogue with other fellows, and are made public in an on-line forum.   A Year-Long Program   Spring Semester       Fellows are required to attend and participate actively in a two-credit seminar during which they will engage in background reading on their topics and study cities, as well as learn research methods. The seminar will culminate in a week-to-week research plan devised in collaboration with faculty mentors and sponsor organizations.   Summer Term   Fellows must commit 8-10 weeks of full-time work on a summer project with a partnering community organization. This means living on-site for the entire fellowship period.   Fall Semester   Fellows will learn how to adapt their research to a digital platform and their final projects will be presented in a public forum.   Application Procedures       The program is open to all undergraduate and graduate Gallatin students. All fellows must plan to be in residence at NYU Washington Square in Spring 2015, and undergraduate fellows must plan to graduate no earlier than January 2016.   Please note that intermediate/advanced language proficiency in German for Berlin fellows and Spanish for Madrid fellows is preferred.   After reading about the program, interested students should:     Propose a viable research project that will benefit not only from on-the-ground fieldwork related to the sites described, but will build upon a critical understanding of issues facing contemporary urban populations; see the Gallatin Global Fellowship in Urban Practice Application form for specific instructions and requirements.   Commit to participate in all elements of the program as outlined above, including the spring seminar, summer collaboration, and final project.
