The internship program is open to juniors and seniors and requires an interview and permission of the director of internships.      Elective Courses    Asian American Literature    SCA-UA 306 Identical to ENGL-UA 716, COLIT-UA 301. Offered every year. 4 points.   This overview course examines the production of Asian American writing and literary/cultural criticism up to the present. Focuses on significant factors affecting the formation of Asian American literature and criticism, such as changing demographics of Asian American communities and the influence of ethnic, women's, and gay/lesbian/bisexual studies. Included is a variety of genres (poetry, plays, fiction and nonfiction, literary/cultural criticism, and nontraditional forms) by writers from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Explores the ways in which the writers treat issues such as racial and ethnic identity, immigration and assimilation, gender, class, sexuality, nationalism, culture and community, history and memory, and art and political engagement.    Cinema of Asia America    SCA-UA 310 Identical to EAST-UA 314, CINE-UT 315. Offered every other year. 4 points.   Begins with a critical history of misrepresentation and discrimination of Asians in Hollywood, then creates an arc of study that documents resistance and ultimately an undeniable and empowered presence. The second half of the semester focuses on a critical appreciation of contemporary Asian and Asian American film. Uses both screenings and readings and is divided into four areas of concentration: the history of misrepresentation in Hollywood films; the appropriation of Asian paradigms by Hollywood; the achievements of contemporary Asian American films; and the achievements of exemplary Asian filmmakers who have transcended regional and artistic borders.    History and Literatures of the South Asian Diaspora    SCA-UA 313 Identical to HIST-UA 326. Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduction to the history of the South Asian diaspora in the United States. Highlights work on South Asian immigrant communities in the United States and the little-known history of South Asian immigrants on the east coast of the United States in the context of historical migration to the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. Offers a multidisciplinary perspective and uses classic as well as new works on South Asians in the United States from history, anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies.    Asian/Pacific American Popular Culture    SCA-UA 320 Offered every third year. 4 points.   Examines the ways in which Asian/Pacific Americans have constituted and positioned their identities through various mediums of popular culture from the 1930s to the present. In particular, emphasizes popular institutions of representation, including music, theatre, fashion, television, and film, to examine the complex relationship between Asian/Pacific American representational practices and their material experiences in sociopolitical locations. In addition, considers the multiple and differentiated interpretive strategies of Asian American consumers of popular culture. How are Asian/Pacific American consumption and reception practices constituted differently across lines of class, gender, and sexuality?    Multiethnic New York    SCA-UA 363 Offered every two years. 4 points.   As a global city, New York is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse places in the world. In particular, the growth of migrant populations from Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean is driving the transformation of New York's economic, social, and political landscape. This course both explores the global socioeconomic conditions that facilitate and sustain these migrations and examines the cultural practices, imaginaries, and strategies of migrants as they become part of the city.    The Constitution and People of Color    SCA-UA 366 Identical to POL-UA 801, LWSOC-UA 327. Offered every year. 4 points.   Examines how the American legal system decided constitutional challenges affecting the empowerment of African, Latino, and Asian American communities from the 19th century to the present. Topics include the denial of citizenship and naturalization to slaves and immigrants, government-sanctioned segregation, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the prison industry, police brutality, post-9/11 detention issues, and voting rights. Course requirements include attendance at a community function involving constitutional issues, a midterm, and an interactive oral and written final project comparing a present-day issue affecting racial minorities in New York City and proposing measures to collectively address the issue.    Reading Race and Representation    SCA-UA 368 Parikh. Offered every year. 4 points.   Much contemporary public discourse characterizes race as a problem that some individuals \"have,\" or, even, a \"card\" that some people \"play.\" It is rarely recognized as a structural or material dimension that comprises everyday experience and knowledge. In this course, we ask what it means to \"read\" race in objects, spaces, and events that for the most part do not seem to be \"about\" race per se. The course is organized around a series of such topics, which we consider from an interdisciplinary perspective, engaging historical and legal texts, literature, and film, as well as scholarship from anthropology, sociology, and history. Over the course of the semester, we address concepts and themes related to U.S. ethnic studies and critical race theory, including citizenship, rights, segregation, whiteness, colonialism, labor, migration, and alienness. The course provides an introduction to critical American studies as a field of scholarship that challenges our sense of the nation as socially and politically exceptional by asking what is forgotten or excluded in such a self-image.    \"Chinatown\" and the American Imagination: A Field Research Course    SCA-UA 370 Identical to IDSEM-UG 1229. Offered every other year. 4 points.   What is a \"Chinatown\"? The word alone evokes many images, sounds, smells, and tastes from many different sensibilities. For recent immigrants, it can be a home away from home; for \"outsiders,\" an exotic place for cheap eats; for male action-flick fans, Chow Yun-Fat (or Mark Wahlberg) in The Corruptor; and for you? (Fill in the blank.) We explore the nooks and crannies of Chinatown in the American imagination and in its New York real-time, nonvirtual existence. How do we know what we know and do not know? What does Chinatown have to do with the formation of normative \"American\" identities? What are the possibilities (and limits) of crossing cultural divides? Class members individually and/or in groups research, experience, and document a chain of persons, places, and/or events, creating their own narrative \"tour\" of this place's meanings. Novels, history books, tourist guides, films, and pop culture supplement the primary \"text\" of New York's Chinatown. This is a collaborative, discussion-intensive, field-research-driven class.    The Immigrant Imagination    SCA-UA 371 Offered every year. 4 points.   Examines contemporary immigration through the lens of visual culture. Explores a variety of expressive forms produced by migrant subjects\u2014including film, photography, art, and fashion\u2014and considers how these work to narrate the experiences of travel and displacement; home and exile; leisure and labor. In doing so, students consider how these visual representations seek to express the conditions of contemporary immigration in ways that co-exist with and counter dominant depictions. We ask: How do visual practices\u2014from filmmaking to graffitiing\u2014operate within immigrant communities as a mode of story-telling or world-making? How have immigrants employed visual culture to narrate their cross-cultural movements, community-building efforts, political struggles, and cultural memories?    Topics in A/P/A Studies    SCA-UA 380 Offered every semester. 4 points.   Specific topics vary from semester to semester. Former topics have included \"Yellow Peril\": Documenting and Understanding Xenophobia; Transnational Feminism; Cultural Politics of Food; and Politics of Fashion in the Asian Diaspora.

Latinos' role in the continually redefined realm of music, the extensive history of Latina/o contributions to the artistic vitality of the Lower East Side, and the wider performance context of Latina cultural production represent a few of the areas that are explored. Students consider contemporary Latino art, and the institutions that support it, from the perspective of the changing Latino demographic of New York City. Furthermore, students examine and analyze the specific ways that artists utilize the city as a site for artistic possibility. This course brings together both an investigation of the aesthetics of Latino performance and an investigation of democratic possibilities of urban space. In addition to the weekly seminar meeting, students are required to attend several performances, visit art galleries, and execute a research project profiling a particular artist or institution.    Latino/a Popular Culture   SCA-UA 534 4 points.   Latinos are at the heart of numerous genres of popular culture production: music, film, graphic novels, performance. This course examines contemporary popular culture products by and for Latinos, looking in particular at issues of production, circulation, and consumption. Is popular culture a site of Latino/a cultural expression, how and in what ways? How is it circulated and consumed, how is it mediated by different culture industries? What do we even mean by Latino/a popular culture? These and more questions are considered through a range of interdisciplinary studies.    Latino/a Sexualities   SCA-UA 536 4 points.   Examines the study of sexuality as it pertains to the production and representation of Latino/a identities. Students consider the integral roles scholarship and literature on/about Latino/a sexuality have played in the history of the broader U.S. feminist movement, feminist theory, and GLBTQ studies. The course begins with the examination of classic Chicana feminist texts and the anthropological study of Latino sexual practices in light of their influential interventions in U.S. studies on gender and sexuality since the 1980s and early 1990s. Students then explore more recent contributions by Latino scholars that disrupt the simplistic ways in which Latino/a sexuality has been taken up as an exotic and radical departure from foundational work on sexuality. Students engage sexuality in its plurality, examining multiple imaginings of Latino/a sexuality through fiction, performance theory, queer Latino/a critiques, and studies on emerging Latino masculinities.    The Latinized City, New York and Beyond   SCA-UA 540 Prerequisite: Approaches to Latino Studies (SCA-UA 501), an introductory course in the social sciences, or a MAP Cultures and Contexts course. Davila. Offered every year. 4 points.   Examines the Latinization of urban landscapes in New York City and beyond. Considers the economic and political factors that have historically fueled the immigration of Latin American peoples to U.S. cities, their incorporation into U.S. society and culture, and the impact of global economic restructuring of U.S. cities on urban race/ethnic relations and cultural politics. Other topics include the contestation of space and power in the global cities, issues of immigration and citizenship, and the politics of languages. Students also develop fieldwork projects geared to discovering the history and present-day landscapes of Latino New York.    Topics in Latino Studies   SCA-UA 541 4 points.   Possible issues, which vary from semester to semester, include race and racism, politics, migration and immigration, language, assimilation, education, labor, citizenship, social movements, and expressive culture. Latino Politics in the U.S. SCA-UA 542 Offered every fall. 4 points. Examines the history, status, and political behavior of Latinos as a minority group in the U.S. political system. Begins with a historical analysis of Latino political incorporation, followed by an analysis of the various activities and efforts in which Latinos have engaged to gain political power and influence. Also examines identity-based social movements of the 1960s and \u201970s, depictions of Latinos as a pan-ethnic voting bloc during the 1980s and into today, the politics of transnationalism and globalization, and the recent political activism surrounding immigration. Looks at sub-group populations hailing from Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Central and South America, utilizes case studies, historical and theoretical monographs, primary documents, and recent poll data surveying Latino political behavior and opinions. Class Warfare SCA-UA 545 Offered every other year. 4 points. \u201cClass warfare\u201d became the political buzzword of the 2012 presidential election and in response to the 2008 financial crisis, and has continued to signal the primacy of inequality as the abiding public issue of our times. For social theorists, the \u201cclass warfare\u201d card is an open invitation to re-visit Marxist and other uses of the concept of class and its relevance to contemporary society. We will study how class conflict plays out in international and institutional settings or \u201ccomplexes\u201d of present-day society, such as neo-liberal politics, incarceration, educational apartheid, and mass deportation of immigrants, Discussion will be based on readings from classical and recent social analysis by a range of authors from Rousseau, Marx and Gramsci to Barbara Ehrenreich, Michelle Alexander and Naomi Klein, as well as important documentary films by Michael Moore, Charles Ferguson and Stephanie Black. We will end the course by examining a range of strategies for change and engagement in contemporary class warfare, with a focus on the Occupy Movement and its consequences. Latina Feminisms SCA-UA 548 4 points. Designed as seminar on contemporary cultural production by Latina feminist artists. Theory/cultural criticism paired with corresponding object of study, i.e. film, fiction, poetry, visual and performance art. First half of course models rigorous scholarship for student, offering different theoretical perspectives for interpreting cultural objects as social and political texts. Advanced seminar, experience with theoretical reading recommended. Second half of the course focuses on cultural production (film, fiction, poetry, visual and performance art). We will critically analyze recurrent tropes and themes\u2014the borderlands as geographical and psychic boundary; the \"mestiza\" or \"mulata\" body as metaphor; assimilation experiences and familial relations; racism and education; revolution and political violence as theme; the literature of exile; the figure of the Malinche/la llorona as race traitor or victim; the domestic/maquiladora worker as virgin or whore\u2014that occur throughout aesthetics of contemporary Latina artists in order to better understand the racial politics within post-nationalist movements for social justice.    Cultural Spaces of Latinidad   SCA-UA 557 4 points.   Examines the contemporary production and meanings of Latino/Hispanic identities in the United States. Looks at the spaces and institutions where this identity is produced and contested and explores how its definition has changed since it was first felt and then officially recognized by the U.S. census. Also examines representations of Latino/a identity in relation to the very real Latino/a populations that now make up the largest \"minority\" in the United States. For most of the course, explores differences and similarities in the politics of Latinidad in four important, yet not exclusive, \"spaces\" involved in the production and representation of Latinidad: the culture industries, urban politics, transnational processes, and contemporary polemics that reach the \"mainstream.\" In other words, this course is designed to theorize Latinidad, in particular \"fields of cultural production,\" whether geographic, institutional, or imaginary. Discusses students' individual research projects for the remainder of the course. Asks students to select a particular \"space\" involved in the production of Latinidad for further study. NAFTA and Narcos SCA-UA 562 Colloquium. Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines political and economic consequences of NAFTA on Mexican and U.S. foreign direct investment, industrialization, labor formation, and immigration. Traces flow of drugs, arms and profits of the drug economy, as well as relationship between rise in violence, militarization of the Americas, and changes in drug war policy in Mexico and the U.S. Considers gender dynamics of both free trade and the drug economy and critically examines the figure of the narco or drug trafficker in popular culture.    Afro-Latino Culture and History   SCA-UA 565 Offered every fall. 4 points.   Examines the profound sociological and cultural implications of the growing Afro-Latino presence in light of recent theorizing on race and diasporas. After an overview of the historical background of African-descended peoples in the Spanish-speaking Americas, we then trace the longstanding social experience of black Latinos in the United States. Along with a discussion of migration patterns and community formations, we focus on narrative accounts of Afro-Latino life and on the traditions of cultural expression. Special attention is paid to Afro-Latino poetry and to the rich history of Afro-Latino music through the generations, from rumba, mambo, and Cubop to salsa, Latin soul, and hip-hop. Finally, we turn to the possible theoretical and political consequences of this increasingly self-conscious transnational identity formation.    Caribbean Women Writers   SCA-UA 570 4 points.   Focuses on texts by Latinas of Caribbean origin whose work explores the intersections between history, gender, nation, and sexuality. Analyzing how contemporary Caribbean-origin literature by Latinas can be read as a manifestation of the complex histories of colonialism, military intervention, and political maneuverings between the United States and the Caribbean in the 20th century, the course considers the ways in which the \"tropicalized\" Latina body came to represent an insidious and seductive threat to the U.S. domestic landscape. The course addresses questions such as, What are the politics behind demeaning, fetishizing, and vilifying Latinas in the U.S. media? What role do women of Caribbean origin play in propagating, preserving, or undermining U.S. domestic life? Readings include prose, poetry, film, and music by authors and artists of Cuban, Dominican, Haitian, and Puerto Rican origin, emphasizing the diverse ways in which Caribbean-origin Latinas affect and are affected by the United States. This course is based on students' active participation in class discussion, weekly response papers, presentations, and a research paper.    Postmodern Travel Fictions   SCA-UA 572 Offered in the spring. 4 points.   This is a study of travel narratives by post\u2013World War II authors/filmmakers of the Americas. Designed to investigate relationships existing between travel narratives and legacy of colonialism in the Americas; between the concept of \"freedom\" embodied in travel writing and the ideology of conquest engraved in historical memory; and between lost idealism of youth and melancholic romps across continents; and between literary representation and the perpetuation of racialized myths about North and South America. Emphasis on gendered dynamic of travel writing. How are notions of freedom and mobility tied to sexuality? Why do the protagonists of novels and films\u2014white, black, Latino, Asian American, or indigenous\u2014\"go West,\" South, East, or North? Why do they ping-pong among these geographic and symbolic poles? What are the evaluative meanings assigned to the cartographically given spaces these protagonists choose to visit and these authors/directors choose to revise in their novels and films?
