The stated goal of this initiative is to raise awareness about EU policies and institutions, the EUs role as an international actor in the economic and political field, and the value of the EU-US relationship. As such, the New Europe project will work to promote greater knowledge of Europe both in the New York metro area and throughout the U.S. at FRN member institutions. This project will be run in partnership with NYUs Center for Global Affairs.    At the center of this project are three faculty seminars, each focusing on an issue of crucial importance in contemporary Europe. The first seminar, which took place June 2013, examined the question of immigration, and its socioeconomic and political effects on the whole of Europe. The second, which was held in Athens, Greece in January 2014, provided participants with the opportunity to learn more about the history, structure, and politics of the European Union while residing briefly in an EU country. The third, scheduled for June 2014, will focus on the Europe and its role in the world economy. These three seminars provide participants with a strong foundation from which to build public programs on Europe in their own communities.    Our project began in January 2013 with a competitive process to select institutions from FRN membership that were committed to becoming Flagship Campuses in the project. These 20 Flagship Campuses have agreed to send faculty members as Institutional Ambassadors to the three faculty development seminars based on the faculty members area of expertise. These institutions also will provide faculty members with the infrastructure and support for organizing public events on their own campuses.    After a highly competitive process, we are delighted to announce that 20 FRN member institutions have been awarded Flagship Campus status:        Chaminade University of Honolulu, Hawaii     Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina     Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana     Farmingdale State College, Farmingdale, New York     Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas     Marymount Manhattan College, New York, New York     Paine College, Augusta, Georgia     Ramapo College, Mahwah, New Jersey     The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey     Saint Peter's University, Jersey City, New Jersey     Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina     Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia     Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, New York     Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama     Tougaloo College, Tougaloo, Mississippi     University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras     University of the Sacred Heart, Santurce, Puerto Rico     University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont     Wagner College, Staten Island, New York     Wiley College, Marshall, Texas        FRN Seminar Information    Our first seminar took place during Network Summer 2013, \"Understanding the New Europe: Immigration.\" It was convened by Dr. Sylvia Maier, a faculty member at the NYU Center for Global Affairs. Participants in the seminar explored one of the most exciting and controversial public policy issues in contemporary Europe and the United States: the politics of immigration, integration, culture and religion. Focusing primarily on the immigrant experience of Muslims in France, Britain, the Netherlands, and Italy, and the Roma minority in Hungary, the seminar drew on anthropology, sociology, literature, law, and political science to explore key questions related to immigration in the European Union A main goal of the seminar was to shatter existing stereotypes of immigrants and minorities as being passive objects of state policies and to highlight their social and political agency. Throughout the seminar, participants examined how immigrants create new spaces of citizenship for themselves and increasingly use the Internet and social media as tools for community organizing, mobilization, political lobbying, and identity construction.    The second seminar took place from January 13-17, 2014 in Athens, Greece. Our European host was the American College of Greece, where colleagues helped the Network arrange meeting space and housing for faculty members. This onsite seminar, entitled \"Understanding the New Europe: Democracy and Politics,\" allowed faculty members to learn firsthand about the government and policymaking of the European Union, and, in particular, the history of Greeces connection to the European Union. The seminar was convened by Sophia Kalantzakos, a distinguished professor of environmental studies and public policy at New York University, who knows well the politics of both Greece and the EU. In 2000, she was elected Member of the Hellenic Parliament, as the first woman representative from the State of Messinia. Understanding the New Europe: Politics touched upon key issues that shed light on the building of the European Union, its institutions and goals, its leadership and economic strength, its vision for a low carbon world, its international goals and interests, and the serious challenges posed by the persisting debt crisis that threatens not only the Eurozone but the political solidarity shown between member states over the last six decades.    Our third faculty seminar will take place from June 9-13, 2014, and is entitled \"Understanding the New Europe 2014: Economic Dilemmas and Options.\" This seminar will be led by Dr. Christine Shaw, a faculty member at CGA. Dr. Shaw worked for the United Nations for almost 40 years, where she was engaged in analytical work geared toward both the diplomatic and academic communities. In the Global Affairs Program at New York University, she has been teaching courses on Globalization, Developing Countries, International Political Economy and, most recently, Economics for Global Affairs. For the June 2014 seminar, she has designed a syllabus that will provide participants with a deep understanding of the economic issues affecting the EU."}]},

With the support of the Center, I   was able to juggle full-time coursework, internship experiences with   Human Rights Watch and the Institute for International Humanitarian   Affairs, in addition to employment alongside the Center\u2019s dedicated and   experienced staff.
