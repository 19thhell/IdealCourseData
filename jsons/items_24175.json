Description       One of the hallmarks of our contemporary commonsense is that everything we do in our everyday life is political\u2014the food we eat, the music we listen to, the clothes we wear, the poetry we read. Yet, we also continue to view certain people (i.e. elected officials, street protestors) and certain practices (ie voting and throwing rocks at police) as properly the domain of politics. Further still, dominant western conceptions of politics assert that only certain kinds of cultures can produce democracy, for example one that is \u201cmodern\u201d, \u201cwesternized\u201d and \u201csecular\u201d. Each of these assertions assume a relationship between something called \u201cculture\u201d and something called \u201cpolitics\u201d\u2014fundamental concepts within a range of disciplines and theories that seek to understand how societies reproduce and are transformed. This interdisciplinary seminar will examine the following questions: What is culture and how has it been defined in different texts and disciplines? What is politics and how has it been defined in a range of texts and disciplines? How and why have scholars and activists sought to put the cultural and the political in some dynamic relationship to each other? The seminar will not only include a range of texts across disciplines but will enact an interdisciplinary perspective by having four instructors from a range of disciplines (anthropology, political theory, cultural studies/sociology/media studies, and literary studies).

Course start date is Monday, Sept. 9th; no classes week of Sept. 2nd. This course is taught by Sinan Antoon, Steve Duncombe, Ritty Lukose, and George Shulman. In order to register,    students must enroll in one of the recitations, IDSEM-UG 800 002-005, which then automatically enrolls them in    the lecture, IDSEM-UG 800 001.                    Description       One of the hallmarks of our contemporary commonsense is that everything we do in our everyday life is political\u2014the food we eat, the music we listen to, the clothes we wear, the poetry we read. Yet, we also continue to view certain people (i.e. elected officials, street protestors) and certain practices (ie voting and throwing rocks at police) as properly the domain of politics. Further still, dominant western conceptions of politics assert that only certain kinds of cultures can produce democracy, for example one that is \u201cmodern\u201d, \u201cwesternized\u201d and \u201csecular\u201d. Each of these assertions assume a relationship between something called \u201cculture\u201d and something called \u201cpolitics\u201d\u2014fundamental concepts within a range of disciplines and theories that seek to understand how societies reproduce and are transformed. This interdisciplinary seminar will examine the following questions: What is culture and how has it been defined in different texts and disciplines? What is politics and how has it been defined in a range of texts and disciplines? How and why have scholars and activists sought to put the cultural and the political in some dynamic relationship to each other? The seminar will not only include a range of texts across disciplines but will enact an interdisciplinary perspective by having four instructors from a range of disciplines (anthropology, political theory, cultural studies/sociology/media studies, and literary studies).

Description       One of the hallmarks of our contemporary commonsense is that everything we do in our everyday life is political\u2014the food we eat, the music we listen to, the clothes we wear, the poetry we read. Yet, we also continue to view certain people (i.e. elected officials, street protestors) and certain practices (ie voting and throwing rocks at police) as properly the domain of politics. Further still, dominant western conceptions of politics assert that only certain kinds of cultures can produce democracy, for example one that is \u201cmodern\u201d, \u201cwesternized\u201d and \u201csecular\u201d. Each of these assertions assume a relationship between something called \u201cculture\u201d and something called \u201cpolitics\u201d\u2014fundamental concepts within a range of disciplines and theories that seek to understand how societies reproduce and are transformed. This interdisciplinary seminar will examine the following questions: What is culture and how has it been defined in different texts and disciplines? What is politics and how has it been defined in a range of texts and disciplines? How and why have scholars and activists sought to put the cultural and the political in some dynamic relationship to each other? The seminar will not only include a range of texts across disciplines but will enact an interdisciplinary perspective by having four instructors from a range of disciplines (anthropology, political theory, cultural studies/sociology/media studies, and literary studies).

Course start date is Monday, Sept. 9th; no classes week of Sept. 2nd. This course is taught by Sinan Antoon, Steve Duncombe, Ritty Lukose, and George Shulman. In order to register,    students must enroll in one of the recitations, IDSEM-UG 800 002-005, which then automatically enrolls them in    the lecture, IDSEM-UG 800 001.                    Description       One of the hallmarks of our contemporary commonsense is that everything we do in our everyday life is political\u2014the food we eat, the music we listen to, the clothes we wear, the poetry we read. Yet, we also continue to view certain people (i.e. elected officials, street protestors) and certain practices (ie voting and throwing rocks at police) as properly the domain of politics. Further still, dominant western conceptions of politics assert that only certain kinds of cultures can produce democracy, for example one that is \u201cmodern\u201d, \u201cwesternized\u201d and \u201csecular\u201d. Each of these assertions assume a relationship between something called \u201cculture\u201d and something called \u201cpolitics\u201d\u2014fundamental concepts within a range of disciplines and theories that seek to understand how societies reproduce and are transformed. This interdisciplinary seminar will examine the following questions: What is culture and how has it been defined in different texts and disciplines? What is politics and how has it been defined in a range of texts and disciplines? How and why have scholars and activists sought to put the cultural and the political in some dynamic relationship to each other? The seminar will not only include a range of texts across disciplines but will enact an interdisciplinary perspective by having four instructors from a range of disciplines (anthropology, political theory, cultural studies/sociology/media studies, and literary studies).
