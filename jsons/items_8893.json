Next the surface is wiped clear, leaving ink only in the incised lines. The width of each line depends on the size of the burin, allowing for a variety of lines and tones. After it is inked, the metal plate is pressed against a sheet of lightly dampened paper to produce a print. Engraving is most commonly associated with Old Master prints. Before the invention of photography, it was often used to reproduce works of art.   Etching  Another form of intaglio printing, etching produces lines with the freedom and fluidity of drawing\u2014closely reproducing the marks of the artist\u2019s hand. After coating the surface of the metal plate with a soft, sticky material, such as wax, the artist uses a sharp tool to cut down to the metal plate, which is then placed in an acid bath. The acid bites into the areas of the plate exposed by the incised lines. The printmaker controls the etching\u2019s tones not only via the width of the lines, but also by varying the length of time the plate remains in the acid bath. After the plate is bitten, it is inked and printed in the same manner as an engraving.   Linocut  A relief technique, linocut starts with a linoleum sheet mounted on wood. After removing areas with a chisel, the artist applies ink to the remaining surface with a roller and then prints the image. Unlike woodcuts, linocuts lack wood-grain texture, instead displaying flat patches of color. Linocut artists, like woodcut artists, may achieve multiple colors either by employing a separate block for each, or by progressively re-cutting the original block.   Lithography  Invented by Alois Senefelder in Bohemia in 1876, lithography\u2014a term deriving from the German words for \u201cstone drawing\u201d\u2014is a planographic print technique that depends on the fact that oil and water don\u2019t mix. To create a lithograph, the printmaker draws or paints on a stone tablet with a water-resistant medium such as waxy crayon or liquid wash. After the image is created on the stone, a solution of gum arabic and nitric acid is applied and penetrates into the uncovered parts, creating areas that repel ink. Using turpentine, the printer removes the greasy drawing material, leaving a thin film on the surface that accepts the oily ink. Finally the stone is inked and run through a press, transferring the image to paper. A lithograph may incorporate multiple colors, each requiring its own stone and a separate impression.           Offset Lithography  Today the most commonly used printmaking technique, offset lithography appears in a great variety of products, from posters, maps, books, magazines, brochures, and newspapers to packaging. Dependent on photography, offset lithography uses flexible plates of aluminum, polyester, or paper instead of stone. These are covered with a photosensitive emulsion that is placed in contact with a photographic negative of the image to be printed and exposed to ultraviolet light. The flexible plate is then attached to a cylinder on a printing press. After the plate is wetted, water-resistant ink is applied, adhering only to the emulsion in the image areas. Next the plate rolls against a rubber-covered cylinder, which removes the water, picks up the ink, and transfers it to paper, reversing the image to positive. Offset lithography takes its name from the fact that the image is first transferred, or offset, to the rubber drum.   Screenprint  A planographic technique, screenprint (also known as silkscreen or serigraph) is grounded in the same process as stencil. Masking parts of a mesh screen with impermeable material, the artist employs a squeegee to push ink or paint through the exposed areas onto a sheet of paper below. Multiple colors are printed sequentially using a series of screens. Often associated with 1960s counterculture, screenprint can produce bold, DIY (do-it-yourself) results.   Woodcut  One of the oldest printmaking techniques, woodcut appeared in China as early as the ninth century and was later adopted by both Japanese and European artists. After sketching the image on a wood surface, the artist uses a chisel to remove areas that are not to receive ink. Then ink is applied with a roller, remaining on the surface. Next the image is transferred to paper using a mechanical press or by hand; the inked areas may create slight indentations on the paper. For prints with multiple colors, the printmaker either employs additional wood blocks or re-carves the same block after printing each color. The latter technique, known as the reductive process, limits the printmaker to a single edition."}]},

Intaglio&#58; a type of printmaking technique in which the image is incised into a surface and the ink applied to the grooves. Intaglio allows for depth of color based on depth of line. Other forms of intaglio printmaking include engraving, drypoint, aquatint and mezzotint.    Edition&#58; a group of identical impressions printed for the same matrix. Also called a run.             Brief History&#58;    Etching was first used by European metal-workers in the Middle Ages to decorate items such as guns, armor, cups, plates, etc. The technique may go back to antiquity, but it is difficult to know for sure. The process as applied to printmaking is believed to have been invented by a German decorator or armor named Daniel Hopfer &#40;circa 1470-1536&#41;. Many of his etched plates still exist.    As a mode of mass-production of imagery, etching flourished during the second half of the 17th century, became wide-spread during the 18th century, and was revived during the mid-1800's.         Engraving vs. Etching&#58;      It was common in the 18th century for printing shops to employ professional, skilled engravers to recreate images onto copper plates for mass production. Engravers were skilled craftsmen, artists in their own right, and often well-known. As such, printed images from this period were generally attributed to both an engraver and the artist that conceived of the composition.   An engraver has to recreate an image on metal using very few guides. The exactness of an engraving's likeness to the original work is completely dependent on the engraver's skill. An etcher, on the other hand, produces a facsimile by tracing the original image in soft lead pencil &#8211; either directly onto the existing image or via tracing paper. The tracing is then placed on a grounded plate, face-down, and the two items are run through the printing press. A reverse image of the tracing adheres to the soft wax. These lines are then etched away.    Etching required less training and less artistic skill. The labor was therefore cheaper, so during the 18th century, etchers began to replace the more expensive and slow-working engravers.          Associated techniques&#58;          Aquatint&#58; An etching technique that creates finely textured areas of tone through the use of powdered resin sprinkled on the etching plate prior to being bitten by the acid bath. The term reflection the fact that this technique was originally celebrated for its effectiveness in imitating the look of watercolor wash.    Drypoint&#58; An intaglio method often used concurrently with etching, whereby lines are scratched directly into a plate using hard needles which raise burrs on either side of the incised line. These burrs hold large amounts of ink and create a printed impression which is characteristically fuzzy in appearance. The burrs are very delicate unless the plate is steel-faced, so drypoint editions tend to be rather small.    Lithograph&#58; A printing technique, invented in 1798, and based on the principle that oil and water do not mix. In lithography, the image is drawn onto a polished slab of limestone or a specially prepared metal plate &#40;generally aluminum&#41; with 'crayons' made of a greasy ink. The plate or slab is then treated with chemicals and dampened with water so that the oil-based printing ink, when rolled on, will adhere only where the crayons have been applied. Lithography can be used to produce a variety of lines and painterly effects.    Mezzotint&#58; An intaglio process invented in 1642 and popularized in the 18th century, whereby the entire surface of a metal plate is densely and evenly pitted, using serrated tools called rockers or roulettes, and then burnished to various degrees of smoothness by the artist to create an image in tones of light and dark dots. The mode is discernable by its soft gradation in tone.    Photogravure&#58; A process developed in the late 19th century through which a photographic image can be etched onto a metal plate. In photogravure, a previously created photographic negative is projected onto a sensitized gelatin film or tissue. The gelatin is applied to the copper plate and exposed to UV light several times in succession. The gelatin hardens in proportion to the degree of light exposure projected onto it by the original negative. To etch the image into the plate, it is put through a series of ferric chloride baths, using a slightly more dilute solution each time. The ferric chloride migrates through the gelatin, etching the shadows and blacks under the thinnest areas first. This process creates an exact photo-replica.    Soft-ground&#58; Soft-ground etching uses a special softer ground. The artist places a piece of paper over the ground and draws on it. The print resembles a drawing.            Video&#58;    The following video provides an idea of how laborious the etching process was during its height of popularity in the eighteenth century. The process was certainly no mean feat.

As borders between media shift, contemporary sculpture and installation work may include new uses of video, ceramics, architecture, fabric, drawing, or performance, as well as classic skills such as woodworking, welding, or moldmaking.    The sculpture facility covers a full floor of the Barney building. It is divided into a wood and metal shop which includes a panel saw, Sawstop table saw, compound miter saw, vertical and horizontal bandsaws for both metal/woodworking, an air compressor system and downdraft table for sanding. In addition, we have a 800 sq/ft critique space for the presentation of student art work, as well as a plaster and moldmaking studio with a self contained spray booth room. Shop technicians are available for information and oversight of the studio. The sculpture faculty includes Area Director Sue De Beer, Beverly Semmes, Rico Gatson, Curtis Mitchell, Dave Hardy, Ian Cooper, and other innovative practitioners.    Craft Sculpture: Ceramics, Metalsmithing, Fabric, and Glass    The renewed connection between fine arts and craft media has become the focus of a new cross-disciplinary movement in contemporary art. Courses in ceramics, mixed media sculpture, metalsmithing, jewelry, and sewn fabrics allow artists to expand their ideas and practices through a wide range of materials and skills in the Art Department&rsquo;s studio facilities. Through a unique liaison with Urban Glass, the largest facility in the world dedicated to glass as an art form, students can expand their creative vocabulary in this medium, as well. Area Director Judith Schwartz is on of the world&rsquo;s leading authors and curators in ceramics. Faculty including Matt Nolen, Beverly Semmes, Klaus Burgel, Shida Kuo, and discuss work within a historical and contemporary framework, designed to help students gain both technical and critical skills.    Photography    Our darkroom, on the second floor of Barney Building, is complete with a 30&rdquo; Colex color processor, group black &amp; white and color darkrooms, as well as eight individual color darkrooms. There are two classrooms, equipped with iMacs, video and slide projectors, digital photo printers, flatbed scanners and negative scanners. Each classroom can also be converted into a photo studio, each with black, white and grey seamless backdrop rolls. We have a large selection of equipment for loan, which includes, but not limited to, 35mm cameras, medium and large format cameras, digital SLRs, HD video cameras, sound recorders, tungsten lighting kits, strobe lighting kits, tripods and a green screen kit.

HD projection and HD television allow instructors and students to share, explore and adapt to the rapid cultural and technological innovation the world faces today.    Painting and Drawing    The skills of painting and drawing enable the artist-student to transform ideas, be they internal or external, to the planarity of a piece of paper or canvas. This process of converting thoughts and signs into visually accessible shapes is complex and, at times, very direct. For this reason, painting and drawing will always be considered by many to be at the heart and soul of the visual arts.    The recent resurgence of interest in traditional hand made media speaks to many issues in contemporary life, and the demand for courses in these areas is higher than ever. Our painting and drawing faculty, led by Area Director Maureen Gallace, with the support of John Torreano, Jesse Bransford, Ross Bleckner, Peter Rostovsky, and Jason Tomme reflects the broad range of acclaimed artists working in classical materials.    Print    Print provides contemporary artists with a extensive array of possibilities and working methods, from photocopy to etching to digital 3-D printing, from unique to multiple to installation. The NYU Print Studio is dedicated to an environment where this range is encouraged along with experimentation and personal exploration.    The print studio, with 14' high ceilings and northern light, is equipped to realize ideas in multiple techniques, including silkscreen (photo-process darkroom), etching (two Charles Brand etching presses), relief print, book arts and letterpress (Vandercook UNI-1 press), digital imaging/printing (Epson 4900 Archival Printer, Epson scanner, AccuRIP software, Xante PostScript large formate laser printer), as well as Departmental facilities for laser cutting and 3-D printing. New York City at large provides a unique context for the study of print, which includes numerous special print exhibitions, vast museum collections, the annual New York City Print Week, and a vibrant diy, zine, and street art scene. The print area faculty, led by Area Head Mark Johnson, includes Kiki Smith, Valerie Hammond, Noah Breuer, and Ruby Sky Stiler.    Environmental Activism    Faculty member Natalie Jeremijenko, one of the most visible and dynamic forces working at the intersection of art, technology, engineering, and environmental studies, has established the Environmental Health Clinic, a laboratory to diagnose environmental ills and create prescriptions for a greener tomorrow. Working with designers, gardeners, and computer scientists, Jeremikenko, who is herself an engineer as well as an artist, is establishing a cross-disciplinary team of artists and researchers to contribute to a slate of poetic and political project                        This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;        by New York University.
