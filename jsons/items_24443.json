Course materials stress primary over secondary sources and may include multimedia. In their first year, students choose from one of the Global Cultures courses described below.  African Cultures This course is an introduction to modern African history and culture. The configurations and problems of modern African society are examined in the context of, and as a product of, a rich history and tradition. The social, political, economic, and intellectual dimensions of African life are approached through a wide variety of readings from the disciplines of history, political science, anthropology, and literature. Middle Eastern Cultures This is a general, inter-disciplinary introduction to the societies, cultures, politics and history of the contemporary Middle East and Islamic North Africa. Texts on sociological, historical and political topics, as well as artistic expressions, films and literary works, may be utilized to examine the region's rich historical legacy and current complexity. Topics may include the historical and cultural relations between the Middle East and the West and the impact of historical, economic, and political change on the region's cultures, societies and contemporary problems. East Asian Cultures This course surveys the civilizations of Japan and China, concentrating on their last 200 years and their position in today\u2019s world. Each country\u2019s unique culture and civilization provides the backdrop against which modern events are viewed. Major topics include the imperialist conquests of the 19th century, the nationalist movements and revolutions of the 20th century, and the impact of modernization on traditional Asian societies. South Asian Cultures This course examines the historical and cultural roots of political and social change in 19th- and 20th-century South Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal). The course explores the complex interaction of ancient traditions, colonialism, and independence movements. It also examines a number of post-independence issues such as development and modernization, hierarchy and democracy, and continuing religious strife. Latin American Cultures This course examines major literary texts in the context of political and social change in post-independence Latin America. Genres including the novel, the essay, and poetry are read in light of the emerging nations\u2019 quest to consolidate their identities vis-\u00e0-vis Spain, Europe, and 20th-century United States. The course explores how Latin American texts address the challenges of establishing viable politics across class and racial divides; the transition from monocultural and agricultural economies to industrialization and mass urbanization; responses to economic and ideological neocolonialism; the opportunities and crises created by integration into a global economy; the impact of the global media; and the struggle for civil rights.  Advanced Global Cultures Students take an Advanced Global Cultures course in either fall or spring semester at their global sites. These courses, which concern a wide variety of topics, connect the site experience with wider regional, national, or global phenomena; for instance, a student in Paris might choose a course on France and Islam, while a student at Buenos Aires might choose one on Latin American cinema. Students take an two-semester experiential learning sequence to immerse them in the current and historical character of the site; as a component of the class, they pursue an independent internship or equivalent with an on-site faculty director and work online with a GLS faculty member and students with similar interests from different sites to craft an independent research project, an important preparation for the senior thesis. Junior year also features foreign language courses in each term, and electives geared toward the particular academic emphases and geographic advantages of the site. Students thus attain a thorough working knowledge of the historical and contemporary culture and society of the site at which they study.

The CORE is comprised of four areas of the liberal arts:       Expository Writing    Foreign Language    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry       Descriptions of these areas and courses which fulfill the requirements are listed below. Some of these requirements can also be fulfilled through Advanced Placement test scores.    Expository Writing    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two courses in expository writing and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination.    Freshmen students who complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay, with a grade of \"C\" or better are certified as proficient, and are not required to sit for the exam. In addition, students must enroll in and successfully complete ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay: Education and the Professions.    Students enrolled in the Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP) completing 0005 and 0006 (Prose Writing I and II) with grades of \"C\" or better are deemed proficient.    Transfer students entering the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development must pass the Proficiency Examination administered by the Expository Writing Program. This exam determines whether additional coursework in Expository Writing will be required for proficiency certification and is given during orientation. Transfer students who pass the examination and transfer in two courses in writing composition or the equivalent will not be required to complete additional course work in expository writing.    If the students pass and transfer in only one course, they will be required to complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay. The course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students have taken at two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    If the students fail and have received transfer credit for either one or two courses in expository writing or the equivalent, they will be required to complete at least one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013 (Writing Tutorial), or EXPOS-UA 0004 (International Writing Workshop 1) as determined by the Expository Writing Program.    Placement may vary depending on the writing issues present in the examination. Students who achieve a letter grade of \"C\" or above in Writing Tutorial are certified as proficient. Students who do not achieve a \"C\" or above must take the Proficiency Exam.    International Students completing EXPOS-UA 0004/0009 (International Writing Workshop 1/International Writing Workshop 2) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. If the students fail, they will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013, Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Languages    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two semesters of foreign language. MCC students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores .    Students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual) are required to take a placement examination to determine which level is appropriate.    Placement exams are offered during the first week of classes as well as once a month throughout the semester. The placement test schedule is available at nyu.edu/cas/placementexams .    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes offered through the CORE plan in the College of Arts and Science or options in Steinhardt's Liberal Arts Core (see course listings below). The four course headings are: Texts and Ideas, Cultures and Contexts, Societies and the Social Sciences, and Expressive Cultures.    Texts and Ideas This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:       AP American History, European History or World History with a score of 4 or 5       NYUSteinhardt courses that will satisfy the Texts and Ideas requirement:       PHED-UE 10 / LIBAR-UE 501 Learning and the Meaning of Life       All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's College Core Curriculum .

Foundations of Scientific Inquiry    The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reasoning and the natural sciences. The three areas are Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Sciences I, and Natural Sciences II. Together, these courses ensure that every student gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through other coursework, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the need of non-science students. Within each of the three offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes.

Course materials stress primary over secondary sources and may include multimedia. In their first year, students choose from one of the Global Cultures courses described below.  African Cultures This course is an introduction to modern African history and culture. The configurations and problems of modern African society are examined in the context of, and as a product of, a rich history and tradition. The social, political, economic, and intellectual dimensions of African life are approached through a wide variety of readings from the disciplines of history, political science, anthropology, and literature. Middle Eastern Cultures This is a general, inter-disciplinary introduction to the societies, cultures, politics and history of the contemporary Middle East and Islamic North Africa. Texts on sociological, historical and political topics, as well as artistic expressions, films and literary works, may be utilized to examine the region's rich historical legacy and current complexity. Topics may include the historical and cultural relations between the Middle East and the West and the impact of historical, economic, and political change on the region's cultures, societies and contemporary problems. East Asian Cultures This course surveys the civilizations of Japan and China, concentrating on their last 200 years and their position in today\u2019s world. Each country\u2019s unique culture and civilization provides the backdrop against which modern events are viewed. Major topics include the imperialist conquests of the 19th century, the nationalist movements and revolutions of the 20th century, and the impact of modernization on traditional Asian societies. South Asian Cultures This course examines the historical and cultural roots of political and social change in 19th- and 20th-century South Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal). The course explores the complex interaction of ancient traditions, colonialism, and independence movements. It also examines a number of post-independence issues such as development and modernization, hierarchy and democracy, and continuing religious strife. Latin American Cultures This course examines major literary texts in the context of political and social change in post-independence Latin America. Genres including the novel, the essay, and poetry are read in light of the emerging nations\u2019 quest to consolidate their identities vis-\u00e0-vis Spain, Europe, and 20th-century United States. The course explores how Latin American texts address the challenges of establishing viable politics across class and racial divides; the transition from monocultural and agricultural economies to industrialization and mass urbanization; responses to economic and ideological neocolonialism; the opportunities and crises created by integration into a global economy; the impact of the global media; and the struggle for civil rights.  Advanced Global Cultures Students take an Advanced Global Cultures course in either fall or spring semester at their global sites. These courses, which concern a wide variety of topics, connect the site experience with wider regional, national, or global phenomena; for instance, a student in Paris might choose a course on France and Islam, while a student at Buenos Aires might choose one on Latin American cinema. Students take an two-semester experiential learning sequence to immerse them in the current and historical character of the site; as a component of the class, they pursue an independent internship or equivalent with an on-site faculty director and work online with a GLS faculty member and students with similar interests from different sites to craft an independent research project, an important preparation for the senior thesis.

The CORE is comprised of four areas of the liberal arts:       Expository Writing    Foreign Language    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry       Descriptions of these areas and courses which fulfill the requirements are listed below. Some of these requirements can also be fulfilled through Advanced Placement test scores.    Expository Writing    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two courses in expository writing and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination.    Freshmen students who complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay, with a grade of \"C\" or better are certified as proficient, and are not required to sit for the exam. In addition, students must enroll in and successfully complete ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay: Education and the Professions.    Students enrolled in the Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP) completing 0005 and 0006 (Prose Writing I and II) with grades of \"C\" or better are deemed proficient.    Transfer students entering the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development must pass the Proficiency Examination administered by the Expository Writing Program. This exam determines whether additional coursework in Expository Writing will be required for proficiency certification and is given during orientation. Transfer students who pass the examination and transfer in two courses in writing composition or the equivalent will not be required to complete additional course work in expository writing.    If the students pass and transfer in only one course, they will be required to complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay. The course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students have taken at two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    If the students fail and have received transfer credit for either one or two courses in expository writing or the equivalent, they will be required to complete at least one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013 (Writing Tutorial), or EXPOS-UA 0004 (International Writing Workshop 1) as determined by the Expository Writing Program.    Placement may vary depending on the writing issues present in the examination. Students who achieve a letter grade of \"C\" or above in Writing Tutorial are certified as proficient. Students who do not achieve a \"C\" or above must take the Proficiency Exam.    International Students completing EXPOS-UA 0004/0009 (International Writing Workshop 1/International Writing Workshop 2) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. If the students fail, they will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013, Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Languages    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two semesters of foreign language. MCC students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores .    Students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual) are required to take a placement examination to determine which level is appropriate.    Placement exams are offered during the first week of classes as well as once a month throughout the semester. The placement test schedule is available at nyu.edu/cas/placementexams .    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes offered through the CORE plan in the College of Arts and Science or options in Steinhardt's Liberal Arts Core (see course listings below). The four course headings are: Texts and Ideas, Cultures and Contexts, Societies and the Social Sciences, and Expressive Cultures.    Texts and Ideas This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:       AP American History, European History or World History with a score of 4 or 5       NYUSteinhardt courses that will satisfy the Texts and Ideas requirement:       PHED-UE 10 / LIBAR-UE 501 Learning and the Meaning of Life       All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's College Core Curriculum .

Foundations of Scientific Inquiry    The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reasoning and the natural sciences. The three areas are Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Sciences I, and Natural Sciences II. Together, these courses ensure that every student gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through other coursework, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the need of non-science students. Within each of the three offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes. Quantitative Reasoning/Mathematics Requirement This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores. **Please note that students in the Global Public Health/MCC major must take UGPH-GU 20 Biostatistics for Public Health.

As French chefs from Car&ecirc;me to Escoffier and Bocuse (and the countless chefs who followed) codified the rules of their national cuisine, they remade the culinary world and developed an ideal for food production and consumption that still reverberates throughout the Western World. To what extent is this performance of French identity simply a myth, a perception perpetuated through movies, songs, cookbooks, and restaurants, and to what extent is this performance a reality?    GFC: Paris will explore the Performance of French Identity through the lens of food, juxtaposing US and French ideals of identity to unpack how issues of gender, race, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity appear when everyday lived reality clashes with espoused national ideals such as the French &ldquo;Libert&eacute;, Egalit&eacute;, Fraternit&eacute;&rdquo; and the American &ldquo;Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.&rdquo; Food&mdash;in its production, distribution, and consumption&mdash;allows an especially intimate means of exploring identity. Through visits to markets, restaurants, wholesale and retail outlets, farms, and cooperatives, we explore the material culture that makes possible acquiescence and resistance to these ideals of identity, and ultimately will discover the limits and possibilities implicit in our own ideals.

If the students fail and have received transfer credit for either one or two courses in expository writing or the equivalent, they will be required to complete at least one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013 (Writing Tutorial), or EXPOS-UA 0004 (International Writing Workshop 1) as determined by the Expository Writing Program.    Placement may vary depending on the writing issues present in the examination. Students who achieve a letter grade of \"C\" or above in Writing Tutorial are certified as proficient. Students who do not achieve a \"C\" or above must take the Proficiency Exam.    International Students completing EXPOS-UA 0004/0009 (International Writing Workshop 1/International Writing Workshop 2) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. If the students fail, they will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013, Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Languages    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two semesters of foreign language. MCC students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores .

The CORE is comprised of four areas of the liberal arts:       Expository Writing    Foreign Language    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry       Descriptions of these areas and courses which fulfill the requirements are listed below. Some of these requirements can also be fulfilled through Advanced Placement test scores.    Expository Writing    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two courses in expository writing and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination.    Freshmen students who complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay, with a grade of \"C\" or better are certified as proficient, and are not required to sit for the exam. In addition, students must enroll in and successfully complete ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay: Education and the Professions.    Students enrolled in the Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP) completing 0005 and 0006 (Prose Writing I and II) with grades of \"C\" or better are deemed proficient.    Transfer students entering the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development must pass the Proficiency Examination administered by the Expository Writing Program. This exam determines whether additional coursework in Expository Writing will be required for proficiency certification and is given during orientation. Transfer students who pass the examination and transfer in two courses in writing composition or the equivalent will not be required to complete additional course work in expository writing.    If the students pass and transfer in only one course, they will be required to complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay. The course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students have taken at two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    If the students fail and have received transfer credit for either one or two courses in expository writing or the equivalent, they will be required to complete at least one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013 (Writing Tutorial), or EXPOS-UA 0004 (International Writing Workshop 1) as determined by the Expository Writing Program.    Placement may vary depending on the writing issues present in the examination. Students who achieve a letter grade of \"C\" or above in Writing Tutorial are certified as proficient. Students who do not achieve a \"C\" or above must take the Proficiency Exam.    International Students completing EXPOS-UA 0004/0009 (International Writing Workshop 1/International Writing Workshop 2) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. If the students fail, they will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013, Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Languages    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two semesters of foreign language. MCC students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores .    Students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual) are required to take a placement examination to determine which level is appropriate.    Placement exams are offered during the first week of classes as well as once a month throughout the semester. The placement test schedule is available at nyu.edu/cas/placementexams .    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes offered through the CORE plan in the College of Arts and Science or options in Steinhardt's Liberal Arts Core (see course listings below). The four course headings are: Texts and Ideas, Cultures and Contexts, Societies and the Social Sciences, and Expressive Cultures.

These courses introduce aspects of one particular region\u2019s cultural development to help students understand societies that have long histories and enormous diversity within themselves\u2014societies and cultures that intersect across the globe. \u201cCulture\u201d is broadly defined as including, but not being limited to, the historical, philosophical, artistic, political, and social dimensions of the region. Course materials stress primary over secondary sources and may include multimedia. In their first year, students choose from one of the Global Cultures courses described below.  African Cultures This course is an introduction to modern African history and culture. The configurations and problems of modern African society are examined in the context of, and as a product of, a rich history and tradition. The social, political, economic, and intellectual dimensions of African life are approached through a wide variety of readings from the disciplines of history, political science, anthropology, and literature. Middle Eastern Cultures This is a general, inter-disciplinary introduction to the societies, cultures, politics and history of the contemporary Middle East and Islamic North Africa. Texts on sociological, historical and political topics, as well as artistic expressions, films and literary works, may be utilized to examine the region's rich historical legacy and current complexity. Topics may include the historical and cultural relations between the Middle East and the West and the impact of historical, economic, and political change on the region's cultures, societies and contemporary problems. East Asian Cultures This course surveys the civilizations of Japan and China, concentrating on their last 200 years and their position in today\u2019s world. Each country\u2019s unique culture and civilization provides the backdrop against which modern events are viewed. Major topics include the imperialist conquests of the 19th century, the nationalist movements and revolutions of the 20th century, and the impact of modernization on traditional Asian societies. South Asian Cultures This course examines the historical and cultural roots of political and social change in 19th- and 20th-century South Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal). The course explores the complex interaction of ancient traditions, colonialism, and independence movements. It also examines a number of post-independence issues such as development and modernization, hierarchy and democracy, and continuing religious strife. Latin American Cultures This course examines major literary texts in the context of political and social change in post-independence Latin America. Genres including the novel, the essay, and poetry are read in light of the emerging nations\u2019 quest to consolidate their identities vis-\u00e0-vis Spain, Europe, and 20th-century United States. The course explores how Latin American texts address the challenges of establishing viable politics across class and racial divides; the transition from monocultural and agricultural economies to industrialization and mass urbanization; responses to economic and ideological neocolonialism; the opportunities and crises created by integration into a global economy; the impact of the global media; and the struggle for civil rights.  Advanced Global Cultures Students take an Advanced Global Cultures course in either fall or spring semester at their global sites. These courses, which concern a wide variety of topics, connect the site experience with wider regional, national, or global phenomena; for instance, a student in Paris might choose a course on France and Islam, while a student at Buenos Aires might choose one on Latin American cinema. Students take an two-semester experiential learning sequence to immerse them in the current and historical character of the site; as a component of the class, they pursue an independent internship or equivalent with an on-site faculty director and work online with a GLS faculty member and students with similar interests from different sites to craft an independent research project, an important preparation for the senior thesis. Junior year also features foreign language courses in each term, and electives geared toward the particular academic emphases and geographic advantages of the site. Students thus attain a thorough working knowledge of the historical and contemporary culture and society of the site at which they study.

The CORE is comprised of four areas of the liberal arts:       Expository Writing    Foreign Language    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry       Descriptions of these areas and courses which fulfill the requirements are listed below. Some of these requirements can also be fulfilled through Advanced Placement test scores.    Expository Writing    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two courses in expository writing and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination.    Freshmen students who complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay, with a grade of \"C\" or better are certified as proficient, and are not required to sit for the exam. In addition, students must enroll in and successfully complete ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay: Education and the Professions.    Students enrolled in the Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP) completing 0005 and 0006 (Prose Writing I and II) with grades of \"C\" or better are deemed proficient.    Transfer students entering the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development must pass the Proficiency Examination administered by the Expository Writing Program. This exam determines whether additional coursework in Expository Writing will be required for proficiency certification and is given during orientation. Transfer students who pass the examination and transfer in two courses in writing composition or the equivalent will not be required to complete additional course work in expository writing.    If the students pass and transfer in only one course, they will be required to complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay. The course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students have taken at two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    If the students fail and have received transfer credit for either one or two courses in expository writing or the equivalent, they will be required to complete at least one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013 (Writing Tutorial), or EXPOS-UA 0004 (International Writing Workshop 1) as determined by the Expository Writing Program.    Placement may vary depending on the writing issues present in the examination. Students who achieve a letter grade of \"C\" or above in Writing Tutorial are certified as proficient. Students who do not achieve a \"C\" or above must take the Proficiency Exam.    International Students completing EXPOS-UA 0004/0009 (International Writing Workshop 1/International Writing Workshop 2) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. If the students fail, they will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013, Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Languages    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two semesters of foreign language. MCC students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores .    Students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual) are required to take a placement examination to determine which level is appropriate.    Placement exams are offered during the first week of classes as well as once a month throughout the semester. The placement test schedule is available at nyu.edu/cas/placementexams .    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes offered through the CORE plan in the College of Arts and Science or options in Steinhardt's Liberal Arts Core (see course listings below). The four course headings are: Texts and Ideas, Cultures and Contexts, Societies and the Social Sciences, and Expressive Cultures.    Texts and Ideas This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:       AP American History, European History or World History with a score of 4 or 5       NYUSteinhardt courses that will satisfy the Texts and Ideas requirement:       PHED-UE 10 / LIBAR-UE 501 Learning and the Meaning of Life       All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's College Core Curriculum .

Foundations of Scientific Inquiry    The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reasoning and the natural sciences. The three areas are Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Sciences I, and Natural Sciences II. Together, these courses ensure that every student gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through other coursework, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the need of non-science students. Within each of the three offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes.

These courses introduce aspects of one particular region\u2019s cultural development to help students understand societies that have long histories and enormous diversity within themselves\u2014societies and cultures that intersect across the globe. \u201cCulture\u201d is broadly defined as including, but not being limited to, the historical, philosophical, artistic, political, and social dimensions of the region. Course materials stress primary over secondary sources and may include multimedia. In their first year, students choose from one of the Global Cultures courses described below.  African Cultures This course is an introduction to modern African history and culture. The configurations and problems of modern African society are examined in the context of, and as a product of, a rich history and tradition. The social, political, economic, and intellectual dimensions of African life are approached through a wide variety of readings from the disciplines of history, political science, anthropology, and literature. Middle Eastern Cultures This is a general, inter-disciplinary introduction to the societies, cultures, politics and history of the contemporary Middle East and Islamic North Africa. Texts on sociological, historical and political topics, as well as artistic expressions, films and literary works, may be utilized to examine the region's rich historical legacy and current complexity. Topics may include the historical and cultural relations between the Middle East and the West and the impact of historical, economic, and political change on the region's cultures, societies and contemporary problems. East Asian Cultures This course surveys the civilizations of Japan and China, concentrating on their last 200 years and their position in today\u2019s world. Each country\u2019s unique culture and civilization provides the backdrop against which modern events are viewed. Major topics include the imperialist conquests of the 19th century, the nationalist movements and revolutions of the 20th century, and the impact of modernization on traditional Asian societies. South Asian Cultures This course examines the historical and cultural roots of political and social change in 19th- and 20th-century South Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal). The course explores the complex interaction of ancient traditions, colonialism, and independence movements. It also examines a number of post-independence issues such as development and modernization, hierarchy and democracy, and continuing religious strife. Latin American Cultures This course examines major literary texts in the context of political and social change in post-independence Latin America. Genres including the novel, the essay, and poetry are read in light of the emerging nations\u2019 quest to consolidate their identities vis-\u00e0-vis Spain, Europe, and 20th-century United States. The course explores how Latin American texts address the challenges of establishing viable politics across class and racial divides; the transition from monocultural and agricultural economies to industrialization and mass urbanization; responses to economic and ideological neocolonialism; the opportunities and crises created by integration into a global economy; the impact of the global media; and the struggle for civil rights.

Bio &amp; Publications                  About the course   You may think you know ancient Israel quite well, or you may be sure you know nothing. In either case, this course is designed to make the acquaintance from scratch. My ancient Israel is strange, sometimes shocking, diverse, and mostly hidden. It can be approached from archaeology and non-biblical writing as well as from the Bible as its most famous artifact. I am a biblical scholar and student of ancient literature, so this class will lean toward what is written, embracing the Bible as a source. In a broadly chronological framework, we will ask what I hope to be unfamiliar questions, trying to get you to see things you had not considered before. The course assumes no prior knowledge, and all knowledge is built from the ground up based on \u201cprimary evidence,\u201d the actual material from the ancient world \u2013 including the Bible. Every full-class meeting will involve conversation in response to some piece of primary evidence, with expectation that students have as much right as any scholar to figure out who these people are for themselves.             Study this course with others   Connect with other around the world   Meet others studying the same NYU courses as you. Help them or get help yourself if you need it.   Get help when you need it   Ask a question and get matched with someone who can answer it immediately and in real time.   Work on assignments together   There's no need to take an Open Education course alone. Learn together!
