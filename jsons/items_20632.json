Oscilloscope and EKG sensor                       In this lab, the students become familiar with 2 oscilloscopes and EKG sensor. The oscilloscope that you will be using is made by BK Precision. You will also become familiar on the use of the DataStudio scope and you will use the EKG sensor in conjunction with the DataStudio scope.

Voltage, Current, and Resistance (Parts I and II)                              The purpose of this experiment is to learn how voltage and currents are generated and measured in   the laboratory, and to investigate how voltage and current are related in resistors. This lab will be completed in two classes.

RC Circuit                           This lab is concerned with the characteristics of capacitors and circuits with resistors and capacitors connected in series (RC circuits). The primary focus will be on the response of a RC Circuit to a step voltage and a voltage square wave.

Current Balance                              In this experiment, the students verify that the force between two wires are proportional to the product of the currents, and estimate the proportionality constant involved.

Charge to mass ratio of Electron                           In this experiment e/m of the electron is determined from the relationship between the electric potential used to accelerate the electron to a given speed, the strength of the magnetic field that influences the electron's motion, and the radius of the circular path which the electron follows.

Electromagnetic Induction                              In this experiment an emf will be induced in one coil by moving a magnet near the coil. Also, by moving a second coil with a current in it near the first coil, and by changing the current in the second coil.

The Human Eye                              In this experiment, students will learn about lenses and their properties by working with a   model of the human eye. Astigmatism, near, and far sightedness are discussed.                                     Download: Human Eye.pdf                                                             11. Diffraction and Interference                              In this experiment students examine what happens when a plane coherent monochromatic beam of light from a laser is incident on single slits of various widths, and double slits of various widths and separations.
