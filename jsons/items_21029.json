Common methodologies used to study finance issues are multivariate statistical analysis, techniques of managerial accounting and finance and case studies. Students in the public finance and financial management field must complete the modules in microeconomic analysis and in applied statistics and econometrics.     Research in the areas of public finance and financial management often requires depth of knowledge in a specific area, such as education finance, financial management of nonprofit organizations or tax policy. Such depth of knowledge involves both a foundation gained from coursework, as well as significant study of literature beyond the material covered in coursework.   \u00a0                                                                                    \u00a9 NYU Wagner   295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604   212.998.7400   Copyright and Fair Use   Contact Us   Sitemap   New York University"}]},

Students in the public finance and financial management field must complete the modules in microeconomic analysis and in applied statistics and econometrics.     Research in the areas of public finance and financial management often requires depth of knowledge in a specific area, such as education finance, financial management of nonprofit organizations or tax policy. Such depth of knowledge involves both a foundation gained from coursework, as well as significant study of literature beyond the material covered in coursework.   \u00a0                                                                                    \u00a9 NYU Wagner   295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604   212.998.7400   Copyright and Fair Use   Contact Us   Sitemap   New York University"}, {"content": "Public Finance and Financial Management | NYU Wagner                                    Jump to navigation                                                         Login &nbsp          Students       Student Applicants               Faculty &amp; Staff             Alumni       Employers                 About      FAQ      Donate      Contact Us                                                                                                                                                                  Faculty &amp; Research Faculty, Visiting Scholars &amp; Practitioners   Faculty Research   Faculty Projects and Initiatives   Seminars at NYU     Centers &amp; Institutes Centers &amp; Institutes Financial Access Initiative   The Furman Center for Real Estate &amp; Urban Policy   Institute for Civil Infrastructure Systems   Institute for Education and Social Policy   John Brademas Center for the Study of Congress   Center for Global Public Service and Social Impact   Research Center for Leadership in Action   Rudin Center for Transportation Policy &amp; Management   Initiatives The Governance Lab   Innovation Labs   M.L.
