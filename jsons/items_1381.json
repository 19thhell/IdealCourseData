Please refer to the undergraduate economics website for information on economics courses:  Information on Economics Courses .   *Students may double-count no more than two courses towards both the Joint Major in Mathematics and Economics and the requirements of another major or minor.   * Courses taken under the pass/fail option are not counted toward the major.    * A grade of C or better is required in all these courses to fulfill the major requirement.      REQUIREMENTS FOR STUDENTS WHO ENROLLED IN CAS BEFORE FALL 2012    The math requirements are the same. The economics requirements (nine courses) are ECON-UA 5, 6, 11, 13, 20, 266, plus any three economics elective courses, at least two of which must be theory electives numbered ECON-UA 300-399. Please refer to the undergraduate economics website for information on economics courses:   Information on Economics Courses .   Mathematics Minor    The requirement for a mathematics minor is four 4-credit courses in the department numbered MATH-UA 120 or higher. Of these four courses MATH-UA 211, 212 or 213 may not be used if you have taken Calculus. Although courses transferred from other colleges may count towards the minor, at least two courses for the minor must be taken at NYU. Students pursuing majors that require mathematics courses may follow this minor, as long as two of the four courses do not apply simultaneously to the requirements for their major.      * Courses taken under the pass/fail option are not counted toward the minor.   * A grade of C or better is required in all courses to count toward the minor.      Joint Mathematics and Computer Science Minor    The requirements are the following four courses:       MATH-UA 121 Calculus I    MATH-UA 122 Calculus II    CSCI-UA 101 Introduction to Computer Science    CSCI-UA 102 Data Structures    *Students who wish to double-count courses for the math portion of the minor and another requirement may count at most two such courses toward the minor.   * Courses taken under the pass/fail option are not counted toward the minor.   * A grade of C or better is required in all courses to count toward the minor.     Advanced Mathematical Methods Minor   The mathematical methods minor will consist of four distinct components. Students will be required to take at least one Stern course to fulfill this minor.   1.Linear Algebra MATH-UA 140 (Formerly V63.0140) or equivalent 4 units.  2.Introduction to the Theory of Probability STAT-UB 14 (Formerly C22.0014) 3 units.  3.Numerical Analysis MATH-UA 252 (Formerly V63.0252) 4 units.  OR Numerical Methods I MATH-GA 2010 (Formerly G63.2010) 3 units.  4. One course from the advanced course list below:      -Ordinary Differential Equations MATH-UA 262 (Formerly V63.0262) 4 units.    -Partial Differential Equations MATH-UA 263 (Formerly V63.0263) 4 units.    -Statistical Inference and Regression Analysis STAT-UB 15 (Formerly C22.0015) 3 units.    -Introduction to Stochastic Processes STAT-UB 21 (Formerly C22.0021) 3 units.    -Analysis MATH-UA 325 (Formerly V63.0325) 4 units.      Notes  All students must take at least one Stern course in order to meet minor requirements. If a student has completed the CAS version of Probability, STAT-UB 14 should not be taken. Instead, please select one of the following:     - Statistical Inference and Regression Analysis STAT-UB 15 (Formerly C22.0015)  3 units.   - Introduction to Stochastic Processes STAT-UB 21 (Formerly C22.0021) 3 units.   - Students who have the equivalent of MATH-UA 140 should substitute a more advanced course from the list above.    Mathematics Education Minor for Math Majors   The Mathematics Education Minor (for Mathematics Majors) enables you to complete course work as an undergraduate in CAS that will reduce the number of credits required of a Steinhardt School of Education M.A. degree in Teachers of Mathematics, Grades 7-12 that will fulfill the requirements for Initial teacher certification. The master's degree will require 30 credits including student teaching internships beyond the bachelor's degree.    Ideally you would want to declare the minor and begin taking these courses during your first semester of junior year. Please be advised that most of these courses require a field work component consisting of classroom observation and participation. For course descriptions, please see the current Steinhardt School of Education's Undergraduate Bulletin at http://www.steinhardt.nyu.edu/bulletin.              \u00a9 NEW YORK UNIVERSITY"}]}]
