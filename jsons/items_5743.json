We developed a competency-based instructional model based on thinking skills and built the first program to provide clinical training and experiences to predoctoral students in esthetic oriented orthodontic treatment using clear aligners.   Our postgraduate orthodontic program has been designed as an intensive and exciting three-year journey which aims not only to develop orthodontists but to develop leaders in our field, pioneers of a new generation of orthodontists.   The department is also pioneering research in orthodontics and tooth movement through CTOR, the Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research. Numerous animal and clinical studies are underway, investigating ways to move teeth faster and safer and strengthen the bones of the jaws.                    meet our faculty & staff Read More                    alumni: connecting, events, fundraising Read More                    CTOR Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   Comprehensive care requires the general dentist to recognize, identify, and manage all aspects of oral and dental diseases and disorders, including orthodontic and dentofacial problems. General dentists must have an understanding of the etiology and management of acquired and developmental occlusal abnormalities and dentofacial deformities for patients of all ages. The general dentist should also be able to counsel patients and consult with specialists to coordinate total oral health care. The curriculum emphasizes critical thinking and problem-solving skills and the distinction between limited and comprehensive orthodontic treatment. The department works closely with the Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR) , the only center of its kind dedicated to the rapid translation of research finding in to novel clinic applications and improved therapies.                                                  First Year                               Foundational information concerning postnatal facial growth, tooth eruption patterns and timing is presented with clinical applications. This unit is integrated with the basic science curriculum.                                                              Second Year                               Foundational information concerning diagnosis is presented. Students begin to apply this in the context of patient examination toward developing sub-skills for competence:     Reporting: Recognizing normal and abnormal conditions, identifying, analyzing information   Interpreting: Synthesizing information, investigating etiology, making decisions/ judgments based in reason and/or evidence   Managing: Deciding care strategies in the best interest of the patient, including no treatment, observation, or treatment   Educating: Counseling the patient about problems, management objectives, care options, risks and benefits of care options     Foundational information and experiences support knowledge and skills in esthetic oriented orthodontic treatment using clear aligners.   Students are also presented with interdisciplinary controversies in dental healthcare and explore disagreements and make/ defend decisions.                                                              Third Year                               Students participate in a series of small group seminars where diagnostic topics introduced in the second year are further developed and reinforced. By reviewing the components of patient diagnosis in the context of simulated clinical case histories, students demonstrate competence in developing problem lists, treatment objectives, sequential treatment plans and alternative treatment plans. Specific attention is given to occlusal examination, evaluation of facial form and proportion, cephalometric analysis, diagnostic study cast analysis, and radiographic interpretation. Foundational information concerning topics that pertain to concepts and practice are presented. Topics include: biology of tooth movement, biomechanics, mechanotherapy and a variety of appliances used during and after orthodontic treatment.   Students diagnose and treat patients who could benefit from esthetic oriented clear aligner therapy under faculty supervision.                                                              Fourth Year                               Students with patients who could benefit from esthetic oriented clear aligner therapy have active clinical experiences under faculty supervision. Students are assessed for competence in management of malocclusion and skeletal problems and credentialed for graduation.   A select group of fourth year students participate in an Orthodontic Honors program. Through conferences, seminars, and clinical experiences, students develop more advanced knowledge and skills in managing orthodontic and dentofacial problems.

Objectives     Upon successful completion of the Advanced Program in Orthodontics, international program participants will have the ability to recognize patients requiring orthodontic therapy. They will develop the clinical skill to achieve, through orthodontic treatment, esthetic and functionally acceptable occlusion for patients with moderately severe malocclusion.     Faculty   Participants treat a variety of patients under the close guidance of a diverse and experienced faculty comprised of top practitioners in the field of orthodontics and related areas.     Course Components   A variety of lectures, seminars and conferences are incorporated into the program. Areas of focus include an overview of the biological basis and biomechanical principles of orthodontic theory and practice. Principles, issues and diverse subjects are explored and applied to clinical care and research. Participants are exposed to complex and interesting cases, such as orthognathic surgery, in a forum designed to enhance the ability to interact successfully with professionals with a variety of educational backgrounds. There are opportunities to participate in elective experiences such as teaching, research and society meetings. Ample time is made available for these and other individual student interests.

What is orthodontics?                                            Orthodontics is devoted to building beautiful smiles by bringing teeth, lips, and jaws into proper alignment. Straight teeth function better, are easier to clean, and are more likely to last your lifetime.                                                                    How do braces work?                               The brackets are made of either metal or ceramic. Each bracket is attached in a very precise position onto the tooth by a bonding glue. An archwire held to your brackets by a rubber ring, applies pressure on the teeth moving them into the correct position.                            Early Treatment   The first phase of treatment also called Phase I, usually occurs when the patient is a child and still has his/her baby teeth. At this stage early growth modification therapy can allow correction of severe crowding and jaw discrepancies.   The American Association of Orthodontics recommends that the initial orthodontic evaluation should occur no later than the age of 7. At the age of 7, first adult molars erupt which create a back bite. At this time, orthodontists can evaluate front-to-back and side-to-side tooth relationships, and determine if there is going to be enough space for the larger adult teeth.                                                  Appliances used                                                     During earlier treatment, the orthodontist uses intra-oral removal or temporarily fixed appliances such as palatal expanders, lip bumpers, bionators, or extra-oral appliances such as headgears and facemasks. These appliances allow development of space in the jaws and modification of growth. We typically expect to see patients in the clinic at 4-6 week intervals.                                                                    Advantages of early treatment                                                        Creating room for crowded teeth and adult erupting teeth                  Reducing risks of trauma to protruding front teeth                  Reducing the need for tooth removal                  Reducing treatment time with braces, or avoiding braces altogether                         Once all permanent teeth erupt the orthodontist evaluates the need for Phase II        treatment with braces.                            Comprehensive Orthodontic Treatment   Orthodontists can move teeth at any age even after growth is complete. However adults sometimes experience worn, damaged, missing teeth and/or loss of the bone that supports the teeth. For these reasons, adults treatments normally require coordination between the orthodontist, oral surgeon, periodontist, endodontist and family dentist to assure complete rehabilitation of the bite.                                                  Types of braces                                            Metal braces are the most commonly used. Today metal braces        are smaller, comfortable and more attractive. You can use ceramic braces        made of translucent material. They are the most popular with adult patients. In cases where bite and crowding problems are less severe Invisalign, a series of clear aligners can be used to gradually move the teeth into position.                                                                    Mini Implants                                            One of the new advances in Orthodontics is mini implants or temporary anchorage devices (TADs). These can be placed temporarily in the upper and lower jaw to help tooth movement that previously was impossible or very difficult to achieve.                                                                    Retainers and Appliances                                            Your orthodontic treatment does not end when your braces are removed. Retention is an important part of the treatment. A retainer is designed to hold your teeth in position. They can be glued to the inside of your teeth or they can be removable and made of clear or pink plastic.                            Research: Advances in Orthodontics   Our department is pioneering research in orthodontics and tooth movement through CTOR, the Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research . Numerous animal and clinical studies are underway, investigating ways to move teeth faster and strengthen the bones of the jaws.   We have recently introduced a new method shown to accelerate tooth movement as much as 50% in early-phase clinical studies, safely and effectively.     If you are interested in participating in one of our clinical trials please contact your orthodontist in the department and find out if you qualify.                              What to Expect on the First Appointment                                                  Initial consultation                                            The initial consultation takes approximately 30 minutes. It consists of a comprehensive oral examination, diagnosis and an explanation of recommended treatment.                                                              Records                                            Records allow us to analyze your bite accurately.  They include:                          Impressions, which are plaster models of the teeth                  Digital photographs of your face and teeth                  X-rays of the teeth, jaws and head                         Our orthodontists will formulate a detailed treatment plan using the information from the initial consultation and records.                       Our treatment coordinator will then discuss with you financial options available before scheduling an appointment to start treatment.                      Emergencies   There are very few true orthodontic emergencies. Most problems are able to be remedied at home. However, if you have a situation that you are unable to resolve on your own then visit us as soon as possible. We will treat walk-in patients with emergencies.                                                  Soreness                               Every person reacts differently during the first week of treatment. You may feel general soreness while you adjust to your new braces. You may take pain relievers without anti-inflamatory activity. A warm wash cloth, heating pad or warm salt water rinses may reduce soreness in your jaws.                                                               Loose wire/wire irritation                                                      If your wires are causing irritation you should try moving the wire away from the irritated area with a cotton swab or an eraser. If the wire does not move then try covering the end of the wire with a small piece of cotton or a small amount of hard or soft wax.

We developed a competency-based instructional model based on thinking skills and built the first program to provide clinical training and experiences to predoctoral students in esthetic oriented orthodontic treatment using clear aligners.   Our postgraduate orthodontic program has been designed as an intensive and exciting three-year journey which aims not only to develop orthodontists but to develop leaders in our field, pioneers of a new generation of orthodontists.   The department is also pioneering research in orthodontics and tooth movement through CTOR, the Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research. Numerous animal and clinical studies are underway, investigating ways to move teeth faster and safer and strengthen the bones of the jaws.                    meet our faculty & staff Read More                    alumni: connecting, events, fundraising Read More                    CTOR Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   Comprehensive care requires the general dentist to recognize, identify, and manage all aspects of oral and dental diseases and disorders, including orthodontic and dentofacial problems. General dentists must have an understanding of the etiology and management of acquired and developmental occlusal abnormalities and dentofacial deformities for patients of all ages. The general dentist should also be able to counsel patients and consult with specialists to coordinate total oral health care. The curriculum emphasizes critical thinking and problem-solving skills and the distinction between limited and comprehensive orthodontic treatment. The department works closely with the Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR) , the only center of its kind dedicated to the rapid translation of research finding in to novel clinic applications and improved therapies.                                                  First Year                               Foundational information concerning postnatal facial growth, tooth eruption patterns and timing is presented with clinical applications. This unit is integrated with the basic science curriculum.                                                              Second Year                               Foundational information concerning diagnosis is presented. Students begin to apply this in the context of patient examination toward developing sub-skills for competence:     Reporting: Recognizing normal and abnormal conditions, identifying, analyzing information   Interpreting: Synthesizing information, investigating etiology, making decisions/ judgments based in reason and/or evidence   Managing: Deciding care strategies in the best interest of the patient, including no treatment, observation, or treatment   Educating: Counseling the patient about problems, management objectives, care options, risks and benefits of care options     Foundational information and experiences support knowledge and skills in esthetic oriented orthodontic treatment using clear aligners.   Students are also presented with interdisciplinary controversies in dental healthcare and explore disagreements and make/ defend decisions.                                                              Third Year                               Students participate in a series of small group seminars where diagnostic topics introduced in the second year are further developed and reinforced. By reviewing the components of patient diagnosis in the context of simulated clinical case histories, students demonstrate competence in developing problem lists, treatment objectives, sequential treatment plans and alternative treatment plans. Specific attention is given to occlusal examination, evaluation of facial form and proportion, cephalometric analysis, diagnostic study cast analysis, and radiographic interpretation. Foundational information concerning topics that pertain to concepts and practice are presented. Topics include: biology of tooth movement, biomechanics, mechanotherapy and a variety of appliances used during and after orthodontic treatment.   Students diagnose and treat patients who could benefit from esthetic oriented clear aligner therapy under faculty supervision.                                                              Fourth Year                               Students with patients who could benefit from esthetic oriented clear aligner therapy have active clinical experiences under faculty supervision. Students are assessed for competence in management of malocclusion and skeletal problems and credentialed for graduation.   A select group of fourth year students participate in an Orthodontic Honors program. Through conferences, seminars, and clinical experiences, students develop more advanced knowledge and skills in managing orthodontic and dentofacial problems.

Numerous animal and clinical studies are underway, investigating ways to move teeth faster and safer and strengthen the bones of the jaws.   Our most recent innovation is our newly patented method which is shown to accelerate tooth movement as much as 50% in early-phase clinical studies, safely and effectively.

Objectives     Upon successful completion of the Advanced Program in Orthodontics, international program participants will have the ability to recognize patients requiring orthodontic therapy. They will develop the clinical skill to achieve, through orthodontic treatment, esthetic and functionally acceptable occlusion for patients with moderately severe malocclusion.     Faculty   Participants treat a variety of patients under the close guidance of a diverse and experienced faculty comprised of top practitioners in the field of orthodontics and related areas.     Course Components   A variety of lectures, seminars and conferences are incorporated into the program. Areas of focus include an overview of the biological basis and biomechanical principles of orthodontic theory and practice. Principles, issues and diverse subjects are explored and applied to clinical care and research. Participants are exposed to complex and interesting cases, such as orthognathic surgery, in a forum designed to enhance the ability to interact successfully with professionals with a variety of educational backgrounds. There are opportunities to participate in elective experiences such as teaching, research and society meetings. Ample time is made available for these and other individual student interests.

What is orthodontics?                                            Orthodontics is devoted to building beautiful smiles by bringing teeth, lips, and jaws into proper alignment. Straight teeth function better, are easier to clean, and are more likely to last your lifetime.                                                                    How do braces work?                               The brackets are made of either metal or ceramic. Each bracket is attached in a very precise position onto the tooth by a bonding glue. An archwire held to your brackets by a rubber ring, applies pressure on the teeth moving them into the correct position.                            Early Treatment   The first phase of treatment also called Phase I, usually occurs when the patient is a child and still has his/her baby teeth. At this stage early growth modification therapy can allow correction of severe crowding and jaw discrepancies.   The American Association of Orthodontics recommends that the initial orthodontic evaluation should occur no later than the age of 7. At the age of 7, first adult molars erupt which create a back bite. At this time, orthodontists can evaluate front-to-back and side-to-side tooth relationships, and determine if there is going to be enough space for the larger adult teeth.                                                  Appliances used                                                     During earlier treatment, the orthodontist uses intra-oral removal or temporarily fixed appliances such as palatal expanders, lip bumpers, bionators, or extra-oral appliances such as headgears and facemasks. These appliances allow development of space in the jaws and modification of growth. We typically expect to see patients in the clinic at 4-6 week intervals.                                                                    Advantages of early treatment                                                        Creating room for crowded teeth and adult erupting teeth                  Reducing risks of trauma to protruding front teeth                  Reducing the need for tooth removal                  Reducing treatment time with braces, or avoiding braces altogether                         Once all permanent teeth erupt the orthodontist evaluates the need for Phase II        treatment with braces.                            Comprehensive Orthodontic Treatment   Orthodontists can move teeth at any age even after growth is complete. However adults sometimes experience worn, damaged, missing teeth and/or loss of the bone that supports the teeth. For these reasons, adults treatments normally require coordination between the orthodontist, oral surgeon, periodontist, endodontist and family dentist to assure complete rehabilitation of the bite.                                                  Types of braces                                            Metal braces are the most commonly used. Today metal braces        are smaller, comfortable and more attractive. You can use ceramic braces        made of translucent material. They are the most popular with adult patients. In cases where bite and crowding problems are less severe Invisalign, a series of clear aligners can be used to gradually move the teeth into position.                                                                    Mini Implants                                            One of the new advances in Orthodontics is mini implants or temporary anchorage devices (TADs). These can be placed temporarily in the upper and lower jaw to help tooth movement that previously was impossible or very difficult to achieve.                                                                    Retainers and Appliances                                            Your orthodontic treatment does not end when your braces are removed. Retention is an important part of the treatment. A retainer is designed to hold your teeth in position. They can be glued to the inside of your teeth or they can be removable and made of clear or pink plastic.                            Research: Advances in Orthodontics   Our department is pioneering research in orthodontics and tooth movement through CTOR, the Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research . Numerous animal and clinical studies are underway, investigating ways to move teeth faster and strengthen the bones of the jaws.   We have recently introduced a new method shown to accelerate tooth movement as much as 50% in early-phase clinical studies, safely and effectively.     If you are interested in participating in one of our clinical trials please contact your orthodontist in the department and find out if you qualify.                              What to Expect on the First Appointment                                                  Initial consultation                                            The initial consultation takes approximately 30 minutes. It consists of a comprehensive oral examination, diagnosis and an explanation of recommended treatment.                                                              Records                                            Records allow us to analyze your bite accurately.  They include:                          Impressions, which are plaster models of the teeth                  Digital photographs of your face and teeth                  X-rays of the teeth, jaws and head                         Our orthodontists will formulate a detailed treatment plan using the information from the initial consultation and records.                       Our treatment coordinator will then discuss with you financial options available before scheduling an appointment to start treatment.                      Emergencies   There are very few true orthodontic emergencies. Most problems are able to be remedied at home. However, if you have a situation that you are unable to resolve on your own then visit us as soon as possible. We will treat walk-in patients with emergencies.                                                  Soreness                               Every person reacts differently during the first week of treatment. You may feel general soreness while you adjust to your new braces. You may take pain relievers without anti-inflamatory activity. A warm wash cloth, heating pad or warm salt water rinses may reduce soreness in your jaws.                                                               Loose wire/wire irritation                                                      If your wires are causing irritation you should try moving the wire away from the irritated area with a cotton swab or an eraser. If the wire does not move then try covering the end of the wire with a small piece of cotton or a small amount of hard or soft wax.
