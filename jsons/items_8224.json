Students are advised by the program's director and associate director, other members of the Program's faculty, and by selected faculty in the Graduate School at large. Advising extends beyond course selection and the master's thesis. An interdisciplinary graduate degree can be shaped to reach many different goals, and it is here that the expertise of the faculty proves especially valuable.

from the civil wars of early Islam. Representing less than one percent of the world\u2019s Muslims, Ibadis remain largely unknown to the broader Muslim community. This lecture discusses the group\u2019s origins, history, and the relationship between its theology and political ideology and those of the two main branches of Islam.
