The BM curriculum and the MM curriculum offer intensive professional training integrally linked to the Music Composition, Music Technology, and Songwriting programs.    We help our students develop the diverse skillsets required for writing music for today&rsquo;s media industry. Our students become adept in virtual, traditional and hybrid orchestration , conforming midi and audio cues, score preparation, music editing, sample library creation and audio production. Recognizing the diversity of scoring methods in today&rsquo;s media industry, our students are given various opportunities to record with different ensembles , from hybrid sessions with virtuosic soloists to scoring for string and symphonic orchestras featuring top NYC musicians. Our students leave with professional and diverse portfolios.    The best testimonial for our program is the success of our students. They continually participate in prestigious and competitive workshops such as the SCL Mentorship Program, Columbia/ASCAP Film Scoring Workshop, and the Sundance Composers Lab. Over the years, our students have scored over a thousand films in collaboration with the film school at Tisch School of the Arts, many of which have premiered at Sundance and Cannes as well as other national and international film festivals.    Our faculty have contributed to well over 250 feature films, including names such as Ira Newborn , Todd Kasow , Paul Chihara , Mark Suozzo , Michael Patterson , Irwin Fisch , and Julia Wolfe . We take full advantage of New York City&rsquo;s dynamic music scene in our FRIDAY@1:00 series, attracting some of the most renowned composers, songwriters, publishers, and industry executives. At these events, students share their work and receive professional critiques.

The BM curriculum and the MM curriculum offer intensive professional training integrally linked to the Music Composition, Music Technology, and Songwriting programs.    We help our students develop the diverse skillsets required for writing music for today&rsquo;s media industry. Our students become adept in virtual, traditional and hybrid orchestration , conforming midi and audio cues, score preparation, music editing, sample library creation and audio production. Recognizing the diversity of scoring methods in today&rsquo;s media industry, our students are given various opportunities to record with different ensembles , from hybrid sessions with virtuosic soloists to scoring for string and symphonic orchestras featuring top NYC musicians. Our students leave with professional and diverse portfolios.    The best testimonial for our program is the success of our students. They continually participate in prestigious and competitive workshops such as the SCL Mentorship Program, Columbia/ASCAP Film Scoring Workshop, and the Sundance Composers Lab. Over the years, our students have scored over a thousand films in collaboration with the film school at Tisch School of the Arts, many of which have premiered at Sundance and Cannes as well as other national and international film festivals.    Our faculty have contributed to well over 250 feature films, including names such as Ira Newborn , Todd Kasow , Paul Chihara , Mark Suozzo , Michael Patterson , Irwin Fisch , and Julia Wolfe . We take full advantage of New York City&rsquo;s dynamic music scene in our FRIDAY@1:00 series, attracting some of the most renowned composers, songwriters, publishers, and industry executives. At these events, students share their work and receive professional critiques.

The BM curriculum and the MM curriculum offer intensive professional training integrally linked to the Music Composition, Music Technology, and Songwriting programs.    We help our students develop the diverse skillsets required for writing music for today&rsquo;s media industry. Our students become adept in virtual, traditional and hybrid orchestration , conforming midi and audio cues, score preparation, music editing, sample library creation and audio production. Recognizing the diversity of scoring methods in today&rsquo;s media industry, our students are given various opportunities to record with different ensembles , from hybrid sessions with virtuosic soloists to scoring for string and symphonic orchestras featuring top NYC musicians. Our students leave with professional and diverse portfolios.    The best testimonial for our program is the success of our students. They continually participate in prestigious and competitive workshops such as the SCL Mentorship Program, Columbia/ASCAP Film Scoring Workshop, and the Sundance Composers Lab. Over the years, our students have scored over a thousand films in collaboration with the film school at Tisch School of the Arts, many of which have premiered at Sundance and Cannes as well as other national and international film festivals.    Our faculty have contributed to well over 250 feature films, including names such as Ira Newborn , Todd Kasow , Paul Chihara , Mark Suozzo , Michael Patterson , Irwin Fisch , and Julia Wolfe . We take full advantage of New York City&rsquo;s dynamic music scene in our FRIDAY@1:00 series, attracting some of the most renowned composers, songwriters, publishers, and industry executives. At these events, students share their work and receive professional critiques.
