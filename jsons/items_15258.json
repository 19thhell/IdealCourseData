Student Services                                    The Copenhagen Business School has a \"Buddy system\" arrangement where each exchange/guest student will be assigned a Danish \"buddy\" to help in getting through the first few weeks in the new surroundings. This means being picked up in the airport, help with registration at the National Registry, advice on shopping, post offices and other practical matters. \"Buddies\" are CBS students who have volunteered to help one or more international students. Throughout the semester various activities are planned for the international students and their buddies.

You should use this page, in additional to CBS\u2019 course listings , to help you prepare a preliminary list and backup list of courses you want to take abroad. Please note: You can take a maximum of two classes per major/concentration during your IBEX semester. Also, Accounting courses cannot be taken abroad for credit toward the Accounting or CPA majors/concentrations.    There is no guarantee that the courses listed here will be offered during the specific semester you study abroad. Once CBS publishes its confirmed courses for the semester you will be attending, you can revise your list as needed based on what is actually being offered. If you see a course on the CBS website that you would like to take, but it is not listed here, you can submit the syllabus to Stern\u2019s International Exchanges &amp; Special Programs team for approval. If the course is approved you will be notified and it will be added to the list of courses below. If a course is already listed here as approved, it does not need to be reviewed or approved again.

Student Services                                    The Copenhagen Business School has a \"Buddy system\" arrangement where each exchange/guest student will be assigned a Danish \"buddy\" to help in getting through the first few weeks in the new surroundings. This means being picked up in the airport, help with registration at the National Registry, advice on shopping, post offices and other practical matters. \"Buddies\" are CBS students who have volunteered to help one or more international students. Throughout the semester various activities are planned for the international students and their buddies.

However you are not limited to taking the courses listed on this page. You should use this page, in additional to CBS\u2019 course listings , to help you prepare a preliminary list and backup list of courses you want to take abroad. Please note: You can take a maximum of two classes per major/concentration during your IBEX semester. Also, Accounting courses cannot be taken abroad for credit toward the Accounting or CPA majors/concentrations.    There is no guarantee that the courses listed here will be offered during the specific semester you study abroad. Once CBS publishes its confirmed courses for the semester you will be attending, you can revise your list as needed based on what is actually being offered. If you see a course on the CBS website that you would like to take, but it is not listed here, you can submit the syllabus to Stern\u2019s International Exchanges &amp; Special Programs team for approval. If the course is approved you will be notified and it will be added to the list of courses below. If a course is already listed here as approved, it does not need to be reviewed or approved again.    Please note: CBS has a separate course list for its International Summer University Program (ISUP).

Student Services                                    The Copenhagen Business School has a \"Buddy system\" arrangement where each exchange/guest student will be assigned a Danish \"buddy\" to help in getting through the first few weeks in the new surroundings. This means being picked up in the airport, help with registration at the National Registry, advice on shopping, post offices and other practical matters. \"Buddies\" are CBS students who have volunteered to help one or more international students. Throughout the semester various activities are planned for the international students and their buddies.

You should use this page, in additional to CBS\u2019 course listings , to help you prepare a preliminary list and backup list of courses you want to take abroad. Please note: You can take a maximum of two classes per major/concentration during your IBEX semester. Also, Accounting courses cannot be taken abroad for credit toward the Accounting or CPA majors/concentrations.    There is no guarantee that the courses listed here will be offered during the specific semester you study abroad. Once CBS publishes its confirmed courses for the semester you will be attending, you can revise your list as needed based on what is actually being offered. If you see a course on the CBS website that you would like to take, but it is not listed here, you can submit the syllabus to Stern\u2019s International Exchanges &amp; Special Programs team for approval. If the course is approved you will be notified and it will be added to the list of courses below. If a course is already listed here as approved, it does not need to be reviewed or approved again.
