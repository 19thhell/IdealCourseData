The course explores New York humor through a variety of venues: stand-up comedy, television, film, literature, advertising, and personal narratives. What do performers such as Letterman and Seinfeld tell us about New York City? We examine how the City influences its performers and their approach to humor, and how New York humor relates to urban and/or ethnic humor in the rest of the country. Readings include New York humorists (James Thurber, Fran Lebowitz, Woody Allen, etc.) as well as some theory of comedy and humor.

While there is a popular perception in the U.S. that public opinion throughout the regions is monolithic and Arab censorship is unassailable, many film and theatre practitioners have presented daring examinations of subjects ranging from religious revivalism, family law, homosexuality, and gender relations, often in the context of broad issues of human rights. This class examines these issues through theatre and film, with special focus on works from Syria, Egypt, and Israel. We will also examine traditional performance forms ranging from the dance and storytelling to marketplace behavior.    Additional class time is necessary for film viewing.
