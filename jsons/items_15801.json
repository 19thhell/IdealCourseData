students to the possibilities and capabilities of interactive tools, whether hardware or software, and to teach them how to understand and create new experiences with those tools.   It is also designed to serve as a crossroads for a variety of disciplines, from engineering and computer science to the social sciences and the arts. This mixing is built into the courses themselves and embodied in the interactive lab, an environment where scientists and artists come together with curious students and faculty to imagine new forms of media and technology.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

What is media&rsquo;s role in creating culture, influencing political events, forming communities, and archiving? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space and how does participatory media change the face of cultural institutions, historical narratives, and mapping? Students are asked to consider the role of media in their own lives and consider where it both fails and succeeds.

This course studies these technologies through the lens of social, political, and ethical values investigating whether and how technical systems promote or impede values to which we are committed. While we explore concepts and literatures, students form collaborative groups, select projects and apply philosophical and social theories of technology to analyze and, possibly, design, prototype, and build systems. The course welcomes students with a variety of backgrounds and skills, though some prior understanding of and experience with digital technology and media, and computing or social, political, and ethical analysis is recommended.

MDMED-AD 116 Mashups - Creating with Web APIs                                             As the World Wide Web continues to grow and pervade our everyday lives, an ever-increasing amount of data and digital services are becoming accessible to us through public web APIs - Application Programming Interfaces. Common to many web sites, including YouTube, Twitter, Google Maps, Wikipedia and more, these web APIs offer a way to programmatically request and re-purpose endless troves of information. How might we use these available resources to create unique, creative, and compelling web experiences of our own? Subscribing to a process-oriented approach, much of class time will be spent reviewing and writing code, primarily Javascript, for client-side (front-end) web development.

students to the possibilities and capabilities of interactive tools, whether hardware or software, and to teach them how to understand and create new experiences with those tools.   It is also designed to serve as a crossroads for a variety of disciplines, from engineering and computer science to the social sciences and the arts. This mixing is built into the courses themselves and embodied in the interactive lab, an environment where scientists and artists come together with curious students and faculty to imagine new forms of media and technology.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

What is media&rsquo;s role in creating culture, influencing political events, forming communities, and archiving? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space and how does participatory media change the face of cultural institutions, historical narratives, and mapping? Students are asked to consider the role of media in their own lives and consider where it both fails and succeeds.

MDMED-AD 114J Values in Information Technology and Digital Media                                             Computing, information technology, and digital media are integrated into all aspects of contemporary life including commerce, finance, education, politics, entertainment, communication, and social life. This course studies these technologies through the lens of social, political, and ethical values investigating whether and how technical systems promote or impede values to which we are committed. While we explore concepts and literatures, students form collaborative groups, select projects and apply philosophical and social theories of technology to analyze and, possibly, design, prototype, and build systems. The course welcomes students with a variety of backgrounds and skills, though some prior understanding of and experience with digital technology and media, and computing or social, political, and ethical analysis is recommended.

MDMED-AD 116 Mashups - Creating with Web APIs                                             As the World Wide Web continues to grow and pervade our everyday lives, an ever-increasing amount of data and digital services are becoming accessible to us through public web APIs - Application Programming Interfaces. Common to many web sites, including YouTube, Twitter, Google Maps, Wikipedia and more, these web APIs offer a way to programmatically request and re-purpose endless troves of information. How might we use these available resources to create unique, creative, and compelling web experiences of our own? Subscribing to a process-oriented approach, much of class time will be spent reviewing and writing code, primarily Javascript, for client-side (front-end) web development.

Students develop artistic collaborative projects involving sound, movement, digital video, lighting, interaction technologies, and telematics, which are presented publicly at the end of the semester. This course requires no skills and is open to anyone willing to establish a collaborative project involving different art forms and other domains.    * Note: The former title of this course was &#39;Collaborating in the Digital Domain&#39;.

conventions, and practices. Students take both practice and studies courses, and finish their degree with a capstone project that reflects the historical and cultural contexts of their interests and studies.   The intermingling of studies and practice and the relatively easy traffic between majors and concentrations at NYUAD enables Film and New Media majors to connect their study to a broad range of other fields and disciplines, such as Interactive Media, Arab Crossroads, Art and Art History, Literature and Creative Writing, Computer Science, Social Research and Public Policy, and Theater.     Abu Dhabi links students to some of the largest and oldest film industries in the world, including India, Egypt, and the vibrant film and new media cultures throughout the Maghreb and the Mashriq, Iran, Turkey, South and East Asia, Africa, and the Gulf, as well as Europe, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Americas. This is a vibrant training ground for makers, curators and students of film and new media.     The program encourages students to explore other areas of arts by requiring them to take one or more classes in another arts programs in order to deepen and broaden their understanding of their fields. Students also benefit from the Global Network University\u2019s unique resources and are encouraged to study at our worldwide sites, such as Accra and London, and NYU\u2019s other portal campuses in New York and Shanghai.     The program prepares students for a lifetime of creative and critical thinking and rigorous analysis of media, as well as a solid foundation for graduate and professional programs in a wide variety of disciplines and fields, as well as careers as filmmakers, scholars, curators, critics, educators, innovators and leaders in film and new media organizations and industries.                                 Major in Film and New Media               The major in Film and New Media emphasizes interdisciplinary and global approaches to film and new media. Students develop critical and interpretive skills for making and understanding documentary, experimental, narrative, and interactive styles of film and new media and learn the methods and theoretical models for analyzing film, new media and their histories.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

Writing assignments include both critical analyses and creative exercises.

FILMM-AD 106 The Human Condition: From Script to Screen                                             Human behavior and our relationships form the basis of most narratives and our insatiable need for story. This course will explore human behavior in the context of evolutionary psychology, and develop that into a working screenplay. Readings and film screenings will focus on observing human behaviors and relationships. You will hopefully leave the class with a well-honed short script, anchored to a frank and honest look at our behaviors and relationships, and perhaps some greater questions and thoughts into the human condition.

Topics include theme, character, research, story, conflict, dialogue, and script editing. The course aims to make a connection between the ancient traditions of the oral storyteller and the professional practice of the contemporary screenwriter when pitching to producers. Screenings and discussions focus on classical and contemporary examples of the short film from a variety of genres, traditions, and cultures. All students complete two short screenplays.

FILMM-AD 116J Single Shot Cinema                                             In this hands-on course, we explore the vocabulary of camera movement and the dramatic impact of the long, single take. Single Shot Cinema is a film method that re-interprets film language based on the technical developments and possibilities of filmmaking in the digital age. What was once only possible with cranes and Steadicams is now accessible to the low-budget filmmaker. Students discover how to block actions and characters in a scene and how to choreograph one single shot, using smooth and flexible camera movements that expresses the drama, emotion, and vision of the director.

Through the universal language of lenses and lighting we learn how these play a central role when working with a set. Students develop the skills to use a motion picture camera in order to tell a good story. The class structure reflects a working film set with emphasis on production. Learning to create a mood advances the ultimate goal of a filmmaker. The heart of visual storytelling is composition: camera placement, camera angles, camera movement, and lens choice. Together with the lighting style a film finds its own unique life. In each class we look at selected scenes from popular films and recreate them. We shoot exercises in the classroom or on location.

First, we trace the origin and variations of New Wave films from European through Latin American to East Asian nations. Then, we expand the scope to transnational crossroads including pan-Chinese, Balkan, South Asian, and African regions. Finally, we explore how contemporary cinema reflects sociopolitical and cultural phenomena in the age of globalization. Major trends and directors are introduced with close analysis of key films.

After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the New Wave in philosophical existentialism (Sartre, de Beauvoir) and the movement&rsquo;s theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma, we examine a chronological series of films by Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rohmer), Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker), and Cin&eacute;ma V&eacute;rit&eacute; (Rouch, Morin). While focusing on the films themselves, we also take a cultural studies approach by seeing the films as part of a broader artistic and mediatic spectrum.

Through the genres of experimental, narrative, and documentary image-making, this course examines the work of women who have pioneered and re-imagined the methods, theories and ideas of the dominant culture. An eclectic and multi-cultural selection of feature length films, shorts, exhibitions, books, and iconic images will be screened and studied. During the semester students will sub-mit written responses and critiques to the work presented. Weekly exercises will help develop the students critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. Students will look to their own cultural milieu to make a final image based project in conjunction with a written essay, and create oral/visual presentations. Field trips outside of class are mandatory.

We will study closely the film style of film directors whose work exemplifies different elements of film style: mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and the long take with static camera (Antonioni, Tsai, Tarr); editing in space, shot/reverse shot cutting, eye-line matches, and point-of-view editing (Hitchcock, Ozu); camera movement (Ophuls, Fellini, Tarkovsky); and sound/image montage (Lang, Bresson, Godard). Based on identical scripts, students (working in groups) will be assigned four practical film-based exercises modeled upon the films of these directors.

Combining close readings of the literary source-texts with close analysis of the films, the course will simultaneously explore the &ldquo;transtextuality&rdquo; theory that treats the complex and mutating relations between any single text and all the other texts, genres, media, and discourses with which it comes into dialogue. Through these contrapuntal analyses, the course will demonstrate the myriad ways that adaptation study can illuminate both media.

It also maps out historically significant films on three broadly thematic stages: mind, society, and culture.

From the Libyan War of 1911-1912 onwards, film has been integral to shaping public consciousness of military events as they unfold and public memory of wars after the guns have fallen silent. The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war&rsquo;s many violences are represented; the filmmakers&rsquo; circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory. Case studies may include the two World Wars, civil wars (Spain, Lebanon), anti-colonial wars, the fall of Communism, the war in Iraq, Vietnam, the Israel-Palestinian conflict; and the Egyptian revolution.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The course explores how documentary and fiction are combined throughout history and in different cultures. We will examine the work of ten filmmakers who have merged both formats creating singular hybrid films. Dramatic reconstructions, manipulated imagery or fictional interstitials are frequently incorporated into documentaries to elevate realism. Conversely, fiction occasionally crosses over into documentary to create a sense of authenticity or truthfulness. Lastly, the division is sometimes completely eradicated making it difficult to distinguish the reality from the imaginary. Over the course of the semester, students will create their own docu-fiction short films. They will bring together fiction and non-fiction story elements reflecting on how each form complements the other.

Beginning with recordings of oral tradition originating in the early empire of Mali to novels addressing the roles of African colonial intermediaries to music protesting apartheid in South Africa, students will engage with a variety of sources of cultural and artistic nature. The course will focus on historical developments such as the Atlantic and internal slave trades, the process of European colonization, religious practice, decolonization, genocide and migration, urbanization, and AIDS. We will also examine various themes, such as local and imposed notions of race and ethnicity, lived experiences of and Africans&rsquo; responses to colonialism on the continent, issues of gender and class, and political resistance. Our broad goal is to investigate to what extent long-term historical dynamics determine the present. Students will not only watch films, listen to music, and read literature, but also read reflections on the methods of using these sources as a way of studying the history of Africa. Course requirements provide students with a language and historical framework for understanding the dynamic history of the continent.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

What is media&rsquo;s role in creating culture, influencing political events, forming communities, and archiving? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space and how does participatory media change the face of cultural institutions, historical narratives, and mapping? Students are asked to consider the role of media in their own lives and consider where it both fails and succeeds.

Students build a directorial vocabulary for translating impulse and imagination into compelling narrative and non-narrative staged moments. Using techniques from Brecht, Brook, Grotowski, and Bogart, students learn to articulate ideas to actors in compelling and inspiring ways. Students explore physical exercises to increase their range as directors; tools with which to fuel actors physically and emotionally; and theories of collaboration and ensemble. The core of the class is the exploration of directing as a physical collaboration with actors within a landscape of thought, emotion, openness, and truth.

students to the possibilities and capabilities of interactive tools, whether hardware or software, and to teach them how to understand and create new experiences with those tools.   It is also designed to serve as a crossroads for a variety of disciplines, from engineering and computer science to the social sciences and the arts. This mixing is built into the courses themselves and embodied in the interactive lab, an environment where scientists and artists come together with curious students and faculty to imagine new forms of media and technology.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

This course studies these technologies through the lens of social, political, and ethical values investigating whether and how technical systems promote or impede values to which we are committed. While we explore concepts and literatures, students form collaborative groups, select projects and apply philosophical and social theories of technology to analyze and, possibly, design, prototype, and build systems. The course welcomes students with a variety of backgrounds and skills, though some prior understanding of and experience with digital technology and media, and computing or social, political, and ethical analysis is recommended.

MDMED-AD 116 Mashups - Creating with Web APIs                                             As the World Wide Web continues to grow and pervade our everyday lives, an ever-increasing amount of data and digital services are becoming accessible to us through public web APIs - Application Programming Interfaces. Common to many web sites, including YouTube, Twitter, Google Maps, Wikipedia and more, these web APIs offer a way to programmatically request and re-purpose endless troves of information. How might we use these available resources to create unique, creative, and compelling web experiences of our own? Subscribing to a process-oriented approach, much of class time will be spent reviewing and writing code, primarily Javascript, for client-side (front-end) web development.

conventions, and practices. Students take both practice and studies courses, and finish their degree with a capstone project that reflects the historical and cultural contexts of their interests and studies.   The intermingling of studies and practice and the relatively easy traffic between majors and concentrations at NYUAD enables Film and New Media majors to connect their study to a broad range of other fields and disciplines, such as Interactive Media, Arab Crossroads, Art and Art History, Literature and Creative Writing, Computer Science, Social Research and Public Policy, and Theater.     Abu Dhabi links students to some of the largest and oldest film industries in the world, including India, Egypt, and the vibrant film and new media cultures throughout the Maghreb and the Mashriq, Iran, Turkey, South and East Asia, Africa, and the Gulf, as well as Europe, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Americas. This is a vibrant training ground for makers, curators and students of film and new media.     The program encourages students to explore other areas of arts by requiring them to take one or more classes in another arts programs in order to deepen and broaden their understanding of their fields. Students also benefit from the Global Network University\u2019s unique resources and are encouraged to study at our worldwide sites, such as Accra and London, and NYU\u2019s other portal campuses in New York and Shanghai.     The program prepares students for a lifetime of creative and critical thinking and rigorous analysis of media, as well as a solid foundation for graduate and professional programs in a wide variety of disciplines and fields, as well as careers as filmmakers, scholars, curators, critics, educators, innovators and leaders in film and new media organizations and industries.                                 Major in Film and New Media               The major in Film and New Media emphasizes interdisciplinary and global approaches to film and new media. Students develop critical and interpretive skills for making and understanding documentary, experimental, narrative, and interactive styles of film and new media and learn the methods and theoretical models for analyzing film, new media and their histories.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence.

This course analyzes and puts into practice principles of different forms of dramatic and dynamic writing: classical, episodic, and parametric in narrative and documentary; rhythmic and contrapuntal in experimental film; episodes and attractions for web platforms; interactive and auto-generative in new media. Writing assignments include both critical analyses and creative exercises.

This course will explore human behavior in the context of evolutionary psychology, and develop that into a working screenplay. Readings and film screenings will focus on observing human behaviors and relationships. You will hopefully leave the class with a well-honed short script, anchored to a frank and honest look at our behaviors and relationships, and perhaps some greater questions and thoughts into the human condition.

FILMM-AD 116J Single Shot Cinema                                             In this hands-on course, we explore the vocabulary of camera movement and the dramatic impact of the long, single take. Single Shot Cinema is a film method that re-interprets film language based on the technical developments and possibilities of filmmaking in the digital age. What was once only possible with cranes and Steadicams is now accessible to the low-budget filmmaker. Students discover how to block actions and characters in a scene and how to choreograph one single shot, using smooth and flexible camera movements that expresses the drama, emotion, and vision of the director.

Through the universal language of lenses and lighting we learn how these play a central role when working with a set. Students develop the skills to use a motion picture camera in order to tell a good story. The class structure reflects a working film set with emphasis on production. Learning to create a mood advances the ultimate goal of a filmmaker. The heart of visual storytelling is composition: camera placement, camera angles, camera movement, and lens choice. Together with the lighting style a film finds its own unique life. In each class we look at selected scenes from popular films and recreate them.

First, we trace the origin and variations of New Wave films from European through Latin American to East Asian nations. Then, we expand the scope to transnational crossroads including pan-Chinese, Balkan, South Asian, and African regions. Finally, we explore how contemporary cinema reflects sociopolitical and cultural phenomena in the age of globalization. Major trends and directors are introduced with close analysis of key films.

After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the New Wave in philosophical existentialism (Sartre, de Beauvoir) and the movement&rsquo;s theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma, we examine a chronological series of films by Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rohmer), Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker), and Cin&eacute;ma V&eacute;rit&eacute; (Rouch, Morin). While focusing on the films themselves, we also take a cultural studies approach by seeing the films as part of a broader artistic and mediatic spectrum.

Through the genres of experimental, narrative, and documentary image-making, this course examines the work of women who have pioneered and re-imagined the methods, theories and ideas of the dominant culture. An eclectic and multi-cultural selection of feature length films, shorts, exhibitions, books, and iconic images will be screened and studied. During the semester students will sub-mit written responses and critiques to the work presented. Weekly exercises will help develop the students critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. Students will look to their own cultural milieu to make a final image based project in conjunction with a written essay, and create oral/visual presentations. Field trips outside of class are mandatory.

We will study closely the film style of film directors whose work exemplifies different elements of film style: mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and the long take with static camera (Antonioni, Tsai, Tarr); editing in space, shot/reverse shot cutting, eye-line matches, and point-of-view editing (Hitchcock, Ozu); camera movement (Ophuls, Fellini, Tarkovsky); and sound/image montage (Lang, Bresson, Godard). Based on identical scripts, students (working in groups) will be assigned four practical film-based exercises modeled upon the films of these directors.

Combining close readings of the literary source-texts with close analysis of the films, the course will simultaneously explore the &ldquo;transtextuality&rdquo; theory that treats the complex and mutating relations between any single text and all the other texts, genres, media, and discourses with which it comes into dialogue. Through these contrapuntal analyses, the course will demonstrate the myriad ways that adaptation study can illuminate both media.

From the Libyan War of 1911-1912 onwards, film has been integral to shaping public consciousness of military events as they unfold and public memory of wars after the guns have fallen silent. The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war&rsquo;s many violences are represented; the filmmakers&rsquo; circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory. Case studies may include the two World Wars, civil wars (Spain, Lebanon), anti-colonial wars, the fall of Communism, the war in Iraq, Vietnam, the Israel-Palestinian conflict; and the Egyptian revolution.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

FILMM-AD 233 Docu-Fiction                                                                   Fact may or may not be stranger than fiction, but invariably both exert strong influences in creating narrative. The course explores how documentary and fiction are combined throughout history and in different cultures. We will examine the work of ten filmmakers who have merged both formats creating singular hybrid films. Dramatic reconstructions, manipulated imagery or fictional interstitials are frequently incorporated into documentaries to elevate realism. Conversely, fiction occasionally crosses over into documentary to create a sense of authenticity or truthfulness. Lastly, the division is sometimes completely eradicated making it difficult to distinguish the reality from the imaginary. Over the course of the semester, students will create their own docu-fiction short films. They will bring together fiction and non-fiction story elements reflecting on how each form complements the other.

Beginning with recordings of oral tradition originating in the early empire of Mali to novels addressing the roles of African colonial intermediaries to music protesting apartheid in South Africa, students will engage with a variety of sources of cultural and artistic nature. The course will focus on historical developments such as the Atlantic and internal slave trades, the process of European colonization, religious practice, decolonization, genocide and migration, urbanization, and AIDS. We will also examine various themes, such as local and imposed notions of race and ethnicity, lived experiences of and Africans&rsquo; responses to colonialism on the continent, issues of gender and class, and political resistance. Our broad goal is to investigate to what extent long-term historical dynamics determine the present. Students will not only watch films, listen to music, and read literature, but also read reflections on the methods of using these sources as a way of studying the history of Africa. Course requirements provide students with a language and historical framework for understanding the dynamic history of the continent.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

What is media&rsquo;s role in creating culture, influencing political events, forming communities, and archiving? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space and how does participatory media change the face of cultural institutions, historical narratives, and mapping? Students are asked to consider the role of media in their own lives and consider where it both fails and succeeds.

In this course students design sound for ongoing theatrical productions, films by NYUAD students, or installation work, and learn how to approach sound design for these diverse media. Topics such as Automatic Dialog Replacement (ADR), Foley, post-synchronized sound and musique concr&egrave;te techniques are covered, and several examples of sound design for film and theatrical performance are analyzed and discussed in class, leading the students to develop their own conceptual approaches to sound design.    * Prerequiste: MUSIC-AD 106 and MUSIC-AD 120 or equivalent.

THEAT-AD 110 Fundamentals of Acting                                                                              Students begin to build a performance vocabulary by using a range of techniques for translating the actor&rsquo;s imagination into stage action. Students are introduced to the internal and external demands of turning psychology into behavior. Students explore acting fundamentals, such as investing yourself in the moment, genuinely listening, personalizing fictional material; and playing objectives are initially explored via games, improvisations, and exercises, followed by partnered scene work, ensemble technique, and solo performance.

THEAT-AD 115 Directing the Actor                                                                                         A course for theater directors, filmmakers, actors, and visual artists. Students build a directorial vocabulary for translating impulse and imagination into compelling narrative and non-narrative staged moments. Using techniques from Brecht, Brook, Grotowski, and Bogart, students learn to articulate ideas to actors in compelling and inspiring ways. Students explore physical exercises to increase their range as directors; tools with which to fuel actors physically and emotionally; and theories of collaboration and ensemble. The core of the class is the exploration of directing as a physical collaboration with actors within a landscape of thought, emotion, openness, and truth.

expression that constitutes an integral part of every civilization. The NYU Abu Dhabi program has two distinguishing features. First, the program takes a global approach to music making and emphasizes both eastern and western approaches to music theory, history, criticism, and practice. The program bridges musical theory, repertoire, and performance styles of Western music (including but not limited to classical, jazz, and popular styles) as well as the influential transnational traditions of North Africa, the Arab Peninsula, the Levant, and the Gulf regions. Abu Dhabi's proximity to major regional musical centers, such as Istanbul, Beirut, and Delhi, and to neighboring Dubai's recording studios and performance venues offers the opportunity to learn first-hand about international popular music.   Second, the music major at NYUAD is dedicated to learning through making music, and through the continual interaction and synthesis of action and reflection. Students are expected to participate in ensembles and can also receive private training on their instruments. Team-taught courses and hybrid courses that draw on music\u2019s relation to dance, theater, visual art, literature, and film, as well as philosophy, religion, cognition, evolution, emergent technologies, and the environment, will be offered regularly. The curriculum provides special opportunities to study and participate in digital music recording and telematic music, and to consider the process of making music from its creation to production and distribution.   The strong programs at NYU New York in ethnomusicology, recording, and digital music are accessible to students in Abu Dhabi through courses taught by affiliated faculty and terms spent in New York and other global sites.   Students pursuing a major or concentration in Music at NYUAD gain proficiency in theory, history, criticism, and interpretation of music traditions throughout the world. At the same time, our students develop skills in analysis, critical thinking, composition, writing, and technology that are valuable across disciplines. As a result, the major and concentration in Music constitute excellent preparation for graduate study in music and related fields in the Arts and Humanities; for careers in the music, media, and culture industries; or for any occupation demanding clear and original thinking, command of the written word, analytical skills, and creativity.                             Requirements   The music major requires a minimum of 12 courses, and has two tracks:     Artistic Practice     Music Studies       The courses offered by the music program are grouped into four disciplinary areas:     Music Practice   Ethnomusicology/Musicology   Music Theory   Music Technology.       Different combinations of courses in the four disciplinary areas define the track for the major.   NOTE: Private Instruction (Music Performance or Composition) and Ensembles are 2-credit courses. All other courses in the Music Program are 4-credit courses.     Common to both tracks     4 Required Courses   Music Technology Fundamentals     Music Theory &amp; Analysis I     Music Histories     Making Music       2 Capstone Seminars     NOTE: Regardless of track, private instruction cannot be taken for more than 8 credits in either instrument or composition and cannot be more than 10 credits in total.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project.

COREA-AD 21 Gesture in Speech, Poetry, Music, and Dance                                                        Gesture lies at the interface of the verbal and the non-verbal in human communication and expression. Through bodily movement, intonation, and stress gesture can transcend the distinctions between normal speech, poetry, song, and dance. Gaining a deeper understanding of the multiple meanings of gesture in a variety of media across different cultures enables the student to approach fundamental means of human expression, and to learn to recognize constants in human communication within the myriad of culturally specific conventions of language, prosody, music, and dance.

Taking advantage of the multicultural nature of NYUAD, we will explore the cultural and universal mechanisms at play when we listen and understand music.

What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present. The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the laments and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict. Drawing on histories and philosophies of war, we will engage with issues related to propaganda, censorship, detention, internment, torture, heroism, sacrifice, bravery, justice, history, memory, and death and with reference to work by Homer, Thuclydides, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Tolstoy, Shostakovitch, Britten, Picasso, Dix, Mishima, Wiesel, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, and John Lennon, among others.

An assumption which this course will make and explore is that all situations in the real world have a musical potential. This potential is defined and realized by discovering, recording and mapping the many ways in which the physical reality of places are dynamic systems of significant acoustic patterns. This seminar will start with an introduction to mobile sound recording that explores sound as it travels through the air in acoustic space using varieties of microphones and space mapping techniques. The course will also explore using acoustic measurement technologies such as accelerometers and hydrophones to investigate how sound exists within structures, the sea and other types of fluids. This course will start out with a large group sound mapping project about Saadiyat Island and expand to other environments in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. In addition to the group project, students will also be required to develop their own unique soundscape works. The course will cover all aspects of environmental field recording, editing and presentation of the final results.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course views musical structures and constructs broadly, referencing phenomena from musics around the world. The bulk of the course is devoted to an exploration of melody, harmony, and counterpoint in the music of diatonic tonality through projects in directed composition and analysis. Repertoire is drawn from both &ldquo;classical&rdquo; (common practice period) music and more recent examples of tonality, including popular music. Regular reading and listening assignments place techniques in historical context and expose students to a wide range of musical examples. Weekly lab sections are devoted to skills in musicianship: listening, sight-singing, dictation, and basic keyboard skills. Students may be required to take MUSIC- AD 100 prior to MUSIC-AD 105 upon taking a placement examination. Please contact Instructor or Music Program Head for details.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region. Focusing on issues of gender, religion and nation, the course pays particular attention to the development of the Maqam system, ritual practices of religious minorities, and the popular musical styles that mobilize social movements.

Depending on the experience and expertise of the instructor, the course might focus on Bach fugues, Mozart opera, Schoenberg&rsquo;s piano music, or the development of electro-acoustic music. While the focus is on issues of how these works create effects, and resultant questions of meaning, we also look at sociological and political issues.    *This course is no longer being offered.

Students of various skill sets gain the necessary footing to develop/envision themselves as music practitioners/makers in a changing global landscape, as we endeavor to focus on cosmopolitan music practices that draw on the uniqueness of the U.A.E. as a global site. Students work in creative music projects involving original writing/composition, recording, and performance. The course additionally has a historical scope in which students consider how these practices have been addressed at different key moments in history and differed according to national and regional contexts.

Beginning with music in the myths and ancient histories of Sumeria, Egypt, and Greece, the seminar concludes with an examination of music and musical production within emerging global and transnational networks of power, where new technologies of mediation are radically re-orchestrating our engagement with sound and the world. Within the broad scope of this overview, we will examine the historical repertoire that has come to be known as &quot;classical music.&quot; The course explores the idea of a permanent canon of musical masterworks, which as a nineteenth-century invention, expanded gradually to include much earlier music as it became increasingly known. The course is not limited to the European musical tradition and canon but also examines non-Western musical traditions in the Middle East, India, and Asia, which grew out of a complex confluence of established practices.

This course surveys a variety of musics, with a particular emphasis on careful listening and aural analysis. Assigned readings help to contextualize and problematize the listening, shedding light on musical preconceptions and biases. Each student chooses from a diverse array of research topics early in the semester, preparing for a substantial presentation during the final weeks of class.

Students develop artistic collaborative projects involving sound, movement, digital video, lighting, interaction technologies, and telematics, which are presented publicly at the end of the semester. This course requires no skills and is open to anyone willing to establish a collaborative project involving different art forms and other domains.    * Note: The former title of this course was &#39;Collaborating in the Digital Domain&#39;.

MUSIC-AD 260 Intro to Maqam &amp; Usul: Modality, Rhythm &amp; Improvisation in the Art Music of the ME                                                                                                    The central tradition of Middle East art music was based in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul, where it achieved its mature form from the early 18th until the beginning of the 20th century, and interacted with the music of major cities such as Aleppo, Baghdad and Cairo, as well as the music of the Byzantine church. This course presents the development of maqam (mode) as both theory and practice, based on classical texts, compositions from the 17th until the 20th centuries, and the music of modern masters, since the advent of sound recording. The principal focus will be on the analysis of 1) modality, intonation and modulation, 2) relations of melody and rhythm (usul) in compositions, 3) non-metrical improvisation (taksim).    *Note: Prerequiste- reading ability of musical notation.    * This course is no longer being offered.
