              Curriculum Vitae                              Areas of Expertise       Role of families in promoting adolescent health, with a special focus on preventing HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, and unintended pregnancies; parent-adolescent communication; intervention research; HIV prevention; and alcohol and drug use                         Biography     Dr. Vincent Guilamo-Ramos is a professor and director of the doctoral program at the Silver School of Social Work. He is licensed as a clinical social worker (LCSW) and registered nurse (RN) in New York State, and board certified in HIV/AIDS Nursing (ACRN). Dr. Guilamo-Ramos has expertise in the role of families in promoting adolescent health, with a special focus on preventing HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, and unintended pregnancies. Additional research interests include parent-adolescent communication, intervention research, HIV prevention, and alcohol and drug use. Dr. Guilamo-Ramos has conducted research primarily in urban, resource-poor settings, including the South Bronx, Harlem, and Lower East Side communities of New York City. In addition, Dr. Guilamo-Ramos has extended his focus to HIV-prevention among vulnerable populations in Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean.   Dr. Guilamo-Ramos has been the principal investigator of numerous federally funded research grants for his work on adolescent risk behavior. Current projects include a five-year, NICHD-funded project aimed at investigating factors associated with the formation of adolescent romantic relationships and subsequent sexual risk behavior in Latino youth; an NIMH/NICHD-funded project aimed at further developing a clinic-based family intervention designed to delay and/or reduce sexual risk taking behavior among Latino and African American early adolescents in outpatient healthcare settings; and a NIAAA-funded project aimed at examining factors associated with adolescent alcohol consumption along U.S.-Mexico border communities in Texas. Dr. Guilamo-Ramos is the Director of the Pilot and Mentoring Core at the Center for Drug Use and HIV Research (CDHUR), a NIDA funded P30 center housed within the NYU School of Nursing. The Pilot and Mentoring Core provides targeted infrastructure to early career investigators interested in developing independent research careers focused on the prevention and treatment of HIV and drug use. Dr. Guilamo-Ramos is also a standing member of the National Institute of Health's Psychosocial Risk and Disease Prevention Study Section (PDRP) and serves as a member of the Board of Directors for the Latino Commission on AIDS.       Dr. Guilamo-Ramos is co-director of the Center for Latino Adolescent and Family Health (CLAFH) at the Silver School. The Center seeks to investigate the role of the Latino family in shaping the development, health and overall well-being of Latino adolescents. Specifically, CLAFH seeks to: 1) foster the development, evaluation, and dissemination of evidence-based family interventions designed to prevent and/or reduce problem behaviors among Latino adolescents; 2) develop, evaluate, and disseminate family interventions for positive youth development approaches to Latino adolescent development and well-being; 3) examine issues of immigration related to the experiences of Latino families; and 4) promote the economic well-being of the Latino community. Strategically based in New York City, CLAFH addresses the needs of New York's diverse Latino communities in both national and global contexts. The Center serves as a link between the scientific community, Latino health and social service providers, and the broader Latino community. Among CLAFH's noteworthy accomplishments is the development and evaluation of &quot;Families Talking Together,&quot; an evidence-based adolescent sexual risk reduction intervention designed to assist parents with talking to teens about the delay of sexual debut and prevention of risky sexual behavior. Dr. Guilamo-Ramos and colleagues have also published Parental Monitoring of Adolescents: Current Perspectives for Researchers and Practitioners , which provides research-informed guidance about how parents can effectively monitor their teen children to prevent and/or reduce adolescent risk behavior. Dr. Guilamo-Ramos is also the chair of the Latino Initiative Advisory Group of The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. As part of his work with the National Campaign, he co-authored a communication guide, &quot;Parent-Adolescent Communication about Sex in Latino Families: A Guide for Practitioners,&quot; which contains specific strategies and recommendations for assisting practitioners in helping Latino parents discuss sex with their adolescent children.   Dr. Guilamo-Ramos received his PhD in social welfare from SUNY Albany, and his MSW from New York University. In addition, Dr. Guilamo-Ramos holds a master's degree in management from the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at NYU and a master's degree in public health from the Global Health Leadership NYU MPH Program.

              Curriculum Vitae                              Areas of Expertise       Role of families in promoting adolescent health, with a special focus on preventing HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, and unintended pregnancies; parent-adolescent communication; intervention research; HIV prevention; and alcohol and drug use                         Biography     Dr. Vincent Guilamo-Ramos is a professor and director of the doctoral program at the Silver School of Social Work. He is licensed as a clinical social worker (LCSW) and registered nurse (RN) in New York State, and board certified in HIV/AIDS Nursing (ACRN). Dr. Guilamo-Ramos has expertise in the role of families in promoting adolescent health, with a special focus on preventing HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, and unintended pregnancies. Additional research interests include parent-adolescent communication, intervention research, HIV prevention, and alcohol and drug use. Dr. Guilamo-Ramos has conducted research primarily in urban, resource-poor settings, including the South Bronx, Harlem, and Lower East Side communities of New York City. In addition, Dr. Guilamo-Ramos has extended his focus to HIV-prevention among vulnerable populations in Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean.   Dr. Guilamo-Ramos has been the principal investigator of numerous federally funded research grants for his work on adolescent risk behavior. Current projects include a five-year, NICHD-funded project aimed at investigating factors associated with the formation of adolescent romantic relationships and subsequent sexual risk behavior in Latino youth; an NIMH/NICHD-funded project aimed at further developing a clinic-based family intervention designed to delay and/or reduce sexual risk taking behavior among Latino and African American early adolescents in outpatient healthcare settings; and a NIAAA-funded project aimed at examining factors associated with adolescent alcohol consumption along U.S.-Mexico border communities in Texas. Dr. Guilamo-Ramos is the Director of the Pilot and Mentoring Core at the Center for Drug Use and HIV Research (CDHUR), a NIDA funded P30 center housed within the NYU School of Nursing. The Pilot and Mentoring Core provides targeted infrastructure to early career investigators interested in developing independent research careers focused on the prevention and treatment of HIV and drug use. Dr. Guilamo-Ramos is also a standing member of the National Institute of Health's Psychosocial Risk and Disease Prevention Study Section (PDRP) and serves as a member of the Board of Directors for the Latino Commission on AIDS.       Dr. Guilamo-Ramos is co-director of the Center for Latino Adolescent and Family Health (CLAFH) at the Silver School. The Center seeks to investigate the role of the Latino family in shaping the development, health and overall well-being of Latino adolescents. Specifically, CLAFH seeks to: 1) foster the development, evaluation, and dissemination of evidence-based family interventions designed to prevent and/or reduce problem behaviors among Latino adolescents; 2) develop, evaluate, and disseminate family interventions for positive youth development approaches to Latino adolescent development and well-being; 3) examine issues of immigration related to the experiences of Latino families; and 4) promote the economic well-being of the Latino community. Strategically based in New York City, CLAFH addresses the needs of New York's diverse Latino communities in both national and global contexts. The Center serves as a link between the scientific community, Latino health and social service providers, and the broader Latino community. Among CLAFH's noteworthy accomplishments is the development and evaluation of &quot;Families Talking Together,&quot; an evidence-based adolescent sexual risk reduction intervention designed to assist parents with talking to teens about the delay of sexual debut and prevention of risky sexual behavior. Dr. Guilamo-Ramos and colleagues have also published Parental Monitoring of Adolescents: Current Perspectives for Researchers and Practitioners , which provides research-informed guidance about how parents can effectively monitor their teen children to prevent and/or reduce adolescent risk behavior. Dr. Guilamo-Ramos is also the chair of the Latino Initiative Advisory Group of The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. As part of his work with the National Campaign, he co-authored a communication guide, &quot;Parent-Adolescent Communication about Sex in Latino Families: A Guide for Practitioners,&quot; which contains specific strategies and recommendations for assisting practitioners in helping Latino parents discuss sex with their adolescent children.   Dr. Guilamo-Ramos received his PhD in social welfare from SUNY Albany, and his MSW from New York University. In addition, Dr. Guilamo-Ramos holds a master's degree in management from the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at NYU and a master's degree in public health from the Global Health Leadership NYU MPH Program.

Research in Accounting, Auditing, and Financial Reporting    The Ross Institute\u2019s mission is to support state-of-the-art research in accounting, auditing, and financial reporting to capital markets, and disseminate such research to the business community: investors, corporate officers, and auditors, as well as the business media. This mission includes conveying to researchers the feedback of practitioners. We are, accordingly, creating an environment for enhancing research and its application.        &#8211; Ross Institute History          In 1971, Vincent C. Ross established and endowed the Ross Institute with the goal of creating an environment where research would flourish and where financial executives, professional accountants, government officials, and academics could work to advance accounting principles and practices.    Over the years The Vincent C. Ross Institute has provided funding for many activities, in a variety of formats, for the exchange of ideas about accounting and related disciplines, including: conducting large-scale research projects on topics of interest to financial and management accountants, and disseminating the results to the business and academic communities, through conferences, journals, the working paper series and over the Internet.                         \u00a0JAAF Conference   The 2011 conference was held on November 4 &amp; 5.
