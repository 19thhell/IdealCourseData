Shifrin had been extensively covering the US-led anti-terror efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This article, on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks which provoked the US military response, was a detailed and dismal account of the mistakes and failures of the US \u201cwar on terror\u201d, observed by Shifrin from several places, including Afghanistan\u2019s second largest city, Kandahar, in the turbulent southern province near the bristling border with Pakistan.       The article\u2019s analysis of a brutal, intransigent conflict \u2013 the massive American anti-insurgency effort unable to exterminate the tenacious, intractable Taliban insurgents, the treachery of US-allied warlords, and the unrelenting suffering of ordinary people caught in the hostilities \u2013 was unfortunately nothing new. Other reporters had painted similar pictures of US military and political might, mobilized to avenge the wound of 9/11, stumbling and faltering through unanticipated consequences of its desire to punish Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Shifrin\u2019s article is striking because it brings Shakespeare into the calamities of Kandahar, as he invokes constant references to the play Titus Andronicus to explain the American mission, its mistakes and murderous outcomes.       Ten years earlier, Shifrin was a Columbia under-graduate and studied Titus Andronicus in his first class after the planes struck the New York towers in 2001. Ten years later, contemplating the ruins of lives, hopes and of American prestige, he recalls the lessons of the play and reflects that \u201cperhaps Shakespeare might have imagined the US would be here.\u201d            Fig. 1- Recent staged scene from Titus Andronicus    Source: Wikicommons       It might seem implausible to envisage the 16th /17the Century English playwright imagining the 21st century predicaments of American power in South Asia. But Shakespeare\u2019s theatrical imagination had a prodigious capacity to transport insights and ideas about politics and human actions, perhaps derived from his English context, into distant places and times, as evidenced by his Roman plays, such as Titus Andronicu s (and Anthony and Cleopatra discussed later in this essay). In Titus Andronicus , that imagination is particularly fertile, even febrile: the leading Roman general Titus is an entirely invented figure, unlike the Julius Caesar and Mark Antony who inhabit other plays with impeccable historical credentials; the events are also invented, occurring in an unspecified period of the Roman empire\u2019s struggle against Barbarian tribes. Most spectacularly, his imagination unleashes an unending series of viciously bloody acts, which make Titus Andronicus Shaskespeare\u2019s most unremittingly violent play.       The violence is a result of cycles of brutal revenge and grotesque atrocities that end in near-total death and devastation. It starts with Titus defeating a tribe of rebellious Goths and killing the captive Goth Queens\u2019s son, which incites a convoluted succession of revenge and counter-revenge, attended by treachery and further reprisals. Titus defines himself in lurid terms: \u201cVengeance is in my heart; death in my hand/ Blood and revenge are hammering in my head,\u201d in the process describing the play\u2019s central compulsions.        Fig.2- Titus Andronicus German staging    Source: Wikicommons       Shifrin relocates this revenge-perpetuating ideology from imperial Rome to US -invaded Afghanistan to argue that Shakespeare had a profound understanding of how the dynamics of reciprocal violence operate in imperial wars; that civilians need to be conciliated, not intimidated, by imperial powers; that exercise of force without wisdom produces pernicious loss for all. Shifrin is so convinced of the trans-global relevance of Titus Andronicus that he asks: \u201cHad the Americans learnt from Shakespeare\u2019s epic of vengeance might Afghanistan and Pakistan be less violent and more welcoming of the US today?\u201d       The question may well be overly simplistic. The particular circumstances of wars \u2013 their causes, adversaries, tactics -- are different, and lessons learnt from one cannot be seamlessly transposed on another. Moreover, revenge and its relentless wars of attrition or its ravaging human toll are a common theme explored and deplored by writers from the time of Homer. Indeed, the ancient Indian story The Mahabharata is also an \u201cepic of vengeance\u201d that offers cautionary lessons.       Nevertheless, Shifrin\u2019s insistence that Shakespeare\u2019s Roman drama makes sense in present day Afghanistan does confirm the view that some Shakespeare plays enact structures of relationships and interactions that have enormous relevance for major international developments of recent centuries. This is part of, though not entirely, the function of Shakespeare\u2019s much celebrated \u201cuniversalism:\u201d that the love he portrays, or the ambitions of his nobles, or the cravenness of courtiers, or his philosophical musings regarding time and mortality seem valid through the ages. It may be interesting to note, that during his time, not much attention was paid to this \u201cuniversal\u201d value of his plays; the 18th Century Samuel Johnson first extolled this as a way of exonerating Shakespeare from the criticism that his plays violated classical principles. Johnson\u2019s defence was that they contained universal truths that transcended his technical transgressions. Later in the 18th and 19th centuries, English and German Romantic poets discovered in Shakespeare philosophical profundities that they cultivated themselves and so revered his \u201cuniversality.\u201d Similarly in the mid-20th Century the Polish political activist and theatre critic Jan Kott claimed Shakespeare\u2019s particular affinity with the political and existential debates of the mid-20th Century in his book called Shakespeare our Contemporary . Jan Kott went so far as to argue that you can\u2019t really understand Hamlet unless you\u2019ve lived under repressive, authoritarian regimes and know what it is to fear a midnight knock on the door!       These are aspects of Shakespeare\u2019s supposed \u201cuniversalism\u201d in specific contexts. I would argue that, for our present times, certain Shakespeare plays extend and modify the notion of \u201cuniversalism\u201d into a penetrating vision of \u201cglobalism,\u201d when he depicts, examines and critiques the attitudes and interactions of people of diverse racial and cultural backgrounds, especially when geographical spaces, power equations and social factors shape those interactions.       England had scarcely begun to appropriate the land and resources of native Americans when Shakespeare composed The Tempest , with its tensions between dominant colonizers and the aggrieved colonized. England was still hovering on the edges of global, commercial activity, when Shakespeare developed in The Merchant of Venice his concerns about the effects of expansive mercantile and financial environments. Deliberate double-meanings in the language of \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cworth\u201d suggest that the market-place turns human beings into commodities. Mercantilism\u2019s multi-cultural mix is also hard to harmonize: the prosperous Venetian merchant Antonio\u2019s ships sail all over an inter-connected world -- Mexico, the Indies, England, Tripoli -- but in Venice there is friction between long-domiciled Jewish and Christian merchants.            Fig. 3- Scene between merchants, The Merchant of Venice    Source: Wikicommons            Fig.4- Shylock and his daughter, The Merchant of Venice    Source: Wikicommons       In another Roman history play, Antony and Cleopatra , Shakespeare presents a different multi-cultural situation, created by empire-building and the desire to rule over a people who are different from the rulers. Such situations became more familiar long after Shakespeare\u2019s times, in the 19th and 20th centuries, as western powers expanded and acquired vast sections of the globe. The play is about the tragic love affair of Antony, the brilliant Roman general and Cleopatra the Queen of an Egypt that successive Roman generals had sought to conquer. The love affair is enacted within the larger imperial ambitions of Rome and particularly of Octavius Caesar, Antony\u2019s one time ally-turned-enemy, who finally defeats the combined forces of Antony and Cleopatra, extends Roman rule over Egypt and effectively inaugurates the Roman empire, and is elevated from Octavius to Augustus Caesar.            Fig.5- Banquet of Cleopatra, 17th century    Source: Wikicommons       Shakespeare\u2019s source for Antony and Cleopatra was Plutarch\u2019s histories, but he deploys the historical material to produce some of the most insightful passages about the operations of imperial powers, especially their self-image and representation of those they wish to rule. Most interestingly, these portrayals closely resemble the imperial and colonial discourses of much later periods.       Edward Said\u2019s landmark 1998 book, Orientalism , argued that as 18th and 19th Century European powers colonized other parts of the world, often oppressing and exploiting their colonial subjects, a discourse emerged to justify and perpetuate colonialism. This discourse called \u201cOrientalism\u201d presented the Europeans as superior and better equipped to rule, and the colonized \u201cother\u201d as inadequate, immature and in need of European guidance. Many of the features that Said identifies as \u201cOrientalist\u201d discourse can be deciphered in Antony and Cleopatra: the plot and characterizations develop and support the colonial ideology which legitimizes colonial rule, as the formidable, disciplined Roman forces of Caesar defeat the unreliable, self-indulgent Egyptians    .    In Antony and Cleopatra \u201call the world\u2019s the stage,\u201d a geographical space conjured by a cascade of place names -- Parthia, Syria, Lydia, Media, Mesopotamia, Armenia \u2013 great kingdoms once, but now available for Roman acquisition. Rome\u2019s imperial greatness resides in these possessions or alliances; their repetitive mention signifies the contours and conventions of empires. It is in the same spirit of global ownership, of amassing vast territories under one rule, that Britain would later declare proudly by the end of the 19th Century that \u201cthe sun never set on the British empire.\u201d       Most significantly, the play shows an apparent difference between the Romans and the Egyptians that seems to facilitate and validate Rome\u2019s power and its conquest of Egypt. The Romans, especially Octavius the conquering General, are presented as superior, efficient, masterful, and ultimately stronger militarily; the Egyptians, especially the passionate, wilful Queen Cleopatra, it is alleged, revel in pleasure and luxury, and are militarily vulnerable. Said had argued in Orientalism that a culture that attempts to dominate another often endows itself with masculine qualities and the culture it seeks to dominate with feminine ones. In the play, the male Roman figures assert themselves as proficient warriors, austere and rational as opposed to the singularly feminized, playful members of Cleopatra\u2019s entourage. Antony is portrayed as a once-exemplary Roman hero who has degenerated by complying with the voluptuous feminized Egyptian ways under the spell of Cleopatra and Egypt\u2019s attractions.       Throughout its early sections, the play describes the charms and dangers of Cleopatra and Egypt, mainly from the perspective of combat-hardened Roman soldiers. \u201cThe beds in the East are soft,\u201d claims a Roman soldier, contrasting the harsh rigor of Roman militarism with the sensual ease and langor supposedly represented by Egypt. The details of the splendours and opulent beauty of the \u201cbarge\u201d that Cleopatra \u201csat upon like a burnished throne\u201d may have come verbatim from Plutarch\u2019s florid descriptions, but in the context of the play the images of oriental sumptuousness are conjured to tempt and also to remind the Romans that these are deviations from Rome\u2019s more austere ethos. And that this feminised sensuality requires and awaits capture and control by Roman power and moral probity.            Fig. 6- Elizabeth Taylor, Cleopatra (film, 1963)    Source: Wikicommons       Cleopatra, who embodies an uncontrolled, intemperate, promiscuous allure is consistently denigrated by the Romans as \u201cgipsy\u201d and \u201cstrumpet\u201d and contrasted with the chaste and modest Roman woman, Octavia. This characterization recurs later in the many \u201cexotic\u201d eastern women \u2013 the seductive queens and courtesans, the treacherous Mata Hari spies, the dancing temptresses -- that fill the fantasy fiction and imaginings of the colonial mind. In \u201c Europe\u2019s Myths of the Orient \u201d Rana Kabbani demonstrates how such images were simultaneously entertaining for the west, occasions for moral superiority and justification of colonial rule which would regulate the alleged moral excesses and cultural decadence.       Antony, the revered military leader, whose Roman values succumb to Egyptian charms, who abandons his Roman responsibilities for \u201cAlexandrian revels\u201d, represents the kind of figure whose fate is most dreaded and despised in colonial accounts \u2013 the once upright European who goes \u201cnative\u201d, who enters and embraces debased eastern spaces and practices and loses his valued European identity. In several stories by Rudyard Kipling, set in 19th Century colonial India, the English protagonists who surrender to Indian pleasures, who go \u201cBeyond the Pale,\u201d are ostracized by their English compatriots and become degraded, diminished shadows of their previous selves. They seem to echo the fear that Mark Antony himself experiences about his transformation: \u201cThese strong Egyptian fetters I must break or lose myself in dotage.\u201d       On the surface Shakespeare seems to create all the colonial constructs that \u201cOrientalists\u201d several centuries later adopt to support and perpetuate the colonial ideology. Yet Shakespeare\u2019s craft is too complex to conform to the simplicities of this ideology. Indeed on occasion he seems to subvert it: his Roman soldiers, who had portrayed the Egyptians as indolent inebriants, themselves surrender to wild drinking when they gather for high-level strategizing and alliance building. They accuse Cleopatra of deviousness, but are themselves masters of calculated, cold-blooded, murderous betrayals. Though the Romans repudiate Antony\u2019s absorption of Egyptian traits, these seem to enhance, not diminish, him as tragic hero. Shakespeare thus enacts imperial discourse to reveal its hollowness; he inscribes the assumptions of Roman superiority and Egyptian inferiority, but discloses that they are unstable constructs, not representations of reality. \u201cThe beds in the east\u201d are only as \u201csoft\u201d as the Romans fantasize and as suits their purpose. And if their purpose is empire and its consolidation, Shakespeare demonstrates that Roman supremacy is achieved at the expense of an impoverished world: the lustrous Cleopatra and the illustrious Antony flame out; Egypt, once fabled, is enfeebled by Roman power. The gains of empire, Shakespeare seems to suggest, are less compelling than the losses they inflict. Maybe that\u2019s why Nick Shifrin was right. Maybe we should \u201cRead Shakespeare in Kandahar.\u201d                                       Rochelle Almeida    rochelle.almeida@nyu.edu                  Jacqueline Bishop    jaj204@nyu.edu                  David Damstra    ddamstra@nyu.edu                  William Klein    bill.klein@nyu.edu                  James McBride    jim.mcbride@nyu.edu                  Joseph Portanova    joseph.portanova@nyu.edu                  Nancy Reale    nancy.reale@nyu.edu                  Robert Squillace    robert.squillace@nyu.edu                  Minu Tharoor    minu.tharoor@nyu.edu                  Timothy Tomlinson    tt7@nyu.edu                  Joan Varnum    jv2089@nyu.edu"}]},

Shakespeare thus enacts imperial discourse to reveal its hollowness; he inscribes the assumptions of Roman superiority and Egyptian inferiority, but discloses that they are unstable constructs, not representations of reality. \u201cThe beds in the east\u201d are only as \u201csoft\u201d as the Romans fantasize and as suits their purpose. And if their purpose is empire and its consolidation, Shakespeare demonstrates that Roman supremacy is achieved at the expense of an impoverished world: the lustrous Cleopatra and the illustrious Antony flame out; Egypt, once fabled, is enfeebled by Roman power. The gains of empire, Shakespeare seems to suggest, are less compelling than the losses they inflict. Maybe that\u2019s why Nick Shifrin was right. Maybe we should \u201cRead Shakespeare in Kandahar.\u201d                                       Rochelle Almeida    rochelle.almeida@nyu.edu                  Jacqueline Bishop    jaj204@nyu.edu                  David Damstra    ddamstra@nyu.edu                  William Klein    bill.klein@nyu.edu                  James McBride    jim.mcbride@nyu.edu                  Joseph Portanova    joseph.portanova@nyu.edu                  Nancy Reale    nancy.reale@nyu.edu                  Robert Squillace    robert.squillace@nyu.edu                  Minu Tharoor    minu.tharoor@nyu.edu                  Timothy Tomlinson    tt7@nyu.edu                  Joan Varnum    jv2089@nyu.edu"}, {"content": "Advanced Honors Seminars: Spring 2015, CAS | NYU                                                  Navigation       College of Arts and Science                 About Arts and Science | Departments and Programs | The Faculty       About the College | Programs | Students | Admissions | Alumni                  Back to Home             Advanced Honors Seminars: Spring 2015   The College is one of the most diverse communities   anywhere\u2013an exciting, sophisticated center in one of the most exciting   and cosmopolitan cities in the world. Our mission is to prepare students   to be thought leaders and successful global citizens. We do this by   creating unique academic opportunities for student and faculty   engagement that emphasize research and scholarly communication. Part of   the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced Honors Seminars place   students in small classes with distinguished faculty to study topics   that have the potential to change how we think and how we work. As such,   they are ideal gateways for the intellectually stimulating discussions   we aim to foster. They challenge students and faculty to engage   intensively within and beyond their fields of study, and they inspire   intellectual responsibility towards the scholarly community and the   wider world. In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science   launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic   principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to upper-level courses   (open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors). Distinguished professors   drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s   professional schools, and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural,   and governmental leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances,   the seminars are cross-listed with departments and students may count   the classes toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes   will count only as electives. Advanced Honors Seminars have three   central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between   exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students intellectually   through honors-level work in critical thinking, writing, and conversing;   and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in and aptitude for conducting   independent research (e.g. a DURF grant or a Senior Honors Thesis). They   are designed to foster scholarly insight and debate and to nurture the   intellectual passions of students and faculty alike. We encourage you to   try one this year! G. Gabrielle Starr Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science Wendy Suzuki Director of College Honors Programs   Course Descriptions  Power, Domination and Resistance AHSEM-UA 166 (class # 23136)  Instructor: Steven Lukes Thursday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This course will introduce students to the complexities of conceptualizing and studying power. How do we determine where it lies? Who has more and who less? How do we study its mechanisms and effects, above all in view of the intuition that it is at its most effective when least observable by both agents and observers? Is power at its most effective when most imperceptible, and, if so, how are we to study it? What are the relations between the concept of \u201cpower\u201d and such related concepts as \u201cauthority,\u201d \u201cinfluence,\u201d \u201cmanipulation,\u201d \u201ccoercion,\u201d \u201cforce,\u201d and \u201cviolence\u201d? What is the relationship between so-called \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d power? We will look at some classical writings (from Thomas Hobbes to Max Weber), at modern writers (such as Hannah Arendt, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel Foucault), and at work by contemporary political scientists and sociologists. Abstract discussion will be leavened throughout by case studies exemplifying the conceptual discussion. Cross-listed with Sociology as SOC-UA 935.001. This course can count towards the major in Sociology as either an advanced seminar or elective. Steven Lukes is Professor of Sociology. He studied philosophy, politics, and economics at Oxford, where he obtained his doctorate, writing a thesis on Durkheim under the supervision of the anthropologist E. E. Evans-Prichard. He has previously held posts in Politics and Sociology at Balliol College, Oxford; in Political and Social Theory at the European University Institute in Florence; in Moral Philosophy at the University of Siena; and in Sociology at the London School of Economics. He is a Fellow of the British Academy and an editor of the European Journal of Sociology. His writing and teaching have ranged over political science, political and moral philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and the philosophy of the social sciences. His published works include Emile Durkheim: His Life and Work; Individualism, Marxism, and Morality ; Liberals and Cannibals: The Implications of Diversity ; The Curious Enlightenment of Professor Caritat: A Comedy of Ideas (a novel soon to be reissued); and Power: A Radical View , which recently appeared in a much-expanded second edition. He is also co-editor of Rationality and Relativism and The Category of the Person: Anthropology, Philosophy, History . His most recent book is Moral Relativism . What is Memory? AHSEM-UA 187 (class # 19746)  Instructor: Suzanne England Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia. Thanks to the written records that serve as our cultural memory, we know that memory has been a topic of inquiry at least since those records began. Today\u2019s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as how is memory embodied? How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self\u2014and with language and story-telling\u2014and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center\u2019s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that serves their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed. Cross-listed with the Silver School of Social Work as UNDSW-US 79.001. Suzanne England is a Professor at the Silver School of Social Work at NYU. She holds degrees from the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Illinois Chicago, and Tulane University. She was Dean of the Silver School at NYU from 2001 to 2009 and Dean at the Tulane Graduate School of Social Work from 1994 to 2001. Professor England\u2019s teaching includes methods of human inquiry, social policy and politics, narrative approaches to policy and advocacy, management and organizational practice, and ethical leadership. Her current research is on narratives\u2014literary, dramatic, autobiographical, and popular culture representations of aging, old age, memory, caregiving and domestic space. This research is at the nexus of moral philosophy and memory studies as she seeks to develop frameworks for examining memory and forgetting in moral performances, and the expressions of meta-narratives and archetypes of aging, old age and age-related dementias in contemporary literature and popular culture. Making History: Culture and Politics in the Caribbean AHSEM-UA 204 (class # 11940)  Instructor: Sibylle Fischer Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m. In this seminar we will study the culture and politics of the Caribbean. The class is organized around key moments of Caribbean history: \u201cDiscovery;\u201d slavery and the struggles against it; colonialism and independence movements; U.S. occupations, dictatorships and revolutionary movements; the massive growth of a Caribbean diaspora; and the transformation of the Caribbean islands into so many tourist destinations. While the Spanish-speaking islands (Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic) are at the center, the French and English-speaking Caribbean (and questions that concern the Caribbean as a region), will be part of the discussion. Readings are drawn from primary sources (slave testimonies, declarations of independence, revolutionary discourses), literary texts, film, and important essays in cultural studies/critical theory, anthropology, and history. The class will be taught in English. Reading of texts in the original language is encouraged. Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 551.002 and with History as HIST-UA 760.001. Sibylle Fischer holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and Spanish from Columbia University. She has held teaching positions at Duke as well as at Princeton and now teaches in the Department of Spanish &amp; Portuguese and the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU, with affiliations with Comparative Literature and Africana Studies. Her research focuses on Caribbean history and culture. Her study of the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) and its impact on Caribbean national cultures, Modernity Disavowed , won book awards from the Modern Language Association, the Latin American Studies Association, The Caribbean Cultural Studies Association, and the Caribbean Philosophical Association. Jewish Women in Modern History AHSEM-UA 219 (class # 23214)  Instructor: Marion Kaplan Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. This course will approach Jewish women\u2019s history from the perspective of social history. After an introduction to the normative role of women in Judaism, the body of the course will focus on Jewish women in Modern Europe and America, analyzing their history in a variety of countries from the American and French Revolutions, through the bourgeois 19th century, World War I, the interwar era, the Nazi era, and postwar Europe and the United States. Students will read secondary sources but we will pay particular attention to memoirs, diaries, and letters. Students will learn about the prescriptive roles of Jewish women in the home, family, religion, and worlds of work and social life. They will focus, however, on the actual activities of Jewish women, what they did, rather than what they were supposed to do. They will investigate the rich variety of responsibilities and tasks that women performed in the (often intersecting) private and public spheres of life, how they both preserved religion in the modern era and also mediated non-Jewish culture for their families. They will further note that women both kept the Jewish family and community together and reached out to non-Jews, joining in secular women\u2019s organizations, local community projects, and the field of social work and teaching. They will discover that women\u2019s roles were often contested and always crucial to the Jewish community. Cross-listed with Hebrew and Judaic Studies as HBRJD-UA 185.001 and with History as HIST-UA 800.001.  Marion Kaplan is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History.

She is co-editor of Gender and Jewish History (2010). Anthropology in the Horror Film AHSEM-UA 220 (class # 23219)  Instructor: Edward Hubbard Thursday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. Anthropologists have appeared as protagonists and key characters in many horror films. Films like The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988), Ganja and Hess (1973), Candyman (1992) and Cannibal Holocaust (1980), have pitted the anthropologist against powerful spirits and demons, accursed artifacts, mutant beasts, malevolent sorcerers and ferocious cannibals. This course is a critical examination of the anthropologist and anthropological research as conventions of the horror film. Through weekly screenings, reading and discussions, we will examine filmic representations of the anthropologist as a liminal figure \u2013 a hapless intermediary between science and superstition, between modernity and arcane tradition \u2013 who grapples methodologically with both rationalist and non-rationalist epistemes. We will also examine cinematic depictions of fieldwork as a terrifying, ill-advised crossing of social, cultural, geographic, and temporal boundaries. These films will be used as a basis to consider the major disciplinary problems, anxieties and even phobias arising out of anthropology\u2019s troubled place in the history of the West. We will look at the often complimentary roles played by anthropological science and the horror genre in constructing, popularizing and sometimes challenging Western notions of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality and citizenship. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 180.003 and with Dramatic Literature as DRLIT-UA 306.001.

His regional focus is the Afro-Atlantic \u2013 specifically Cape Verde, Brazil and the Caribbean \u2013 with interests in pop culture, media, creolization, globalization, gothic and carnivalesque aesthetics, gender and sexuality. His dissertation research, based on three years of multi-sited fieldwork, is entitled Creolization and Contemporary Pop Iconicity in Cape Verde. His forthcoming publications include articles that explore black abjection in creole cultures by way of analysis of multiple forms of ethnographic data, primarily blason populaire; an experimental piece on race and the experience of the uncanny in ethnographic research; and a monograph on the globalization of acoustic batuku music in Cape Verde. Migration, Citizenship, and Belonging AHSEM-UA 221 (class # 23220)  Instructor: Arely Zimmerman Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m. New modalities of economic organization and relationships, innovations in technology and communication, and the sheer rate of growth of Latin American migration to U.S. cities has impacted the modes and practices of identity, community and membership in U.S. Latino communities. This course examines the normative and political dilemmas around issues of citizenship, belonging, and national identity amongst U.S. Latinos- brought about by immigration, transnationalism, neoliberalism, and globalization. These dilemmas revolve around themes national identity and sovereignty, democratic citizenship, and the rights of immigrants. The class will draw from a wide array of readings in political and legal theory, sociology, anthropology, and U.S. Latino studies. By the end of the class, students will be able to articulate and understand political theories of nation-state citizenship, including its historical, sociological, and legal underpinnings. Importantly, students will have a deep understanding of how citizenship is transformed as both a legal status and a set of practices that constitute contemporary political and social membership. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 541.002. Arely Zimmerman holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California (Los Angeles), with specializations in political theory and race and ethnic politics.

She is concurrently working on new research in the areas of youth, second generation Latino/a civic engagement, and new media. Empire and Decolonization AHSEM-UA 222 (class # 23573)  Instructor: Manu Goswami Thursday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. This class examines the global history of empire and decolonization, focusing on the case studies of the Spanish Empire from the nineteenth century and the British Empire in the twentieth century. These two great empires \u2013 the first running from the 15th to the 19th centuries, the second from the 18th to the 20th \u2013 are often contrasted as opposites: where the Spanish Empire is seen as the great bastion of medieval Catholicism, the British Empire is taken as Protestant and liberal. Where the first is thought of as founded through conquest and war, the second is often described as taking place through settlement and commerce. This course will question these oppositions, examining how both colonial projects of rule, and the nationalist movements that emerged against them, helped create the ideas and institutions associated with liberalism and democracy. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 569.001 . Manu Goswami is Associate Professor of History and the author of Producing India: From Colonial Economy to National Space (2004). Her research interests include nationalism and internationalism, political economy and economic thought, social theory and historical methods. Her articles have appeared in Comparative Studies of Society and History, American Historical Review, boundary 2, Journal of Historical Sociology and Political Power and Social Theory , among others. Rival Monarchies: Old Regime Spain and France AHSEM-UA 223 (class # 23574)  Instructor: Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schaub Wednesday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. In the memory of the history of Western Europe, the 16th century was Spanish, the 17th French, and the 18th British. The aim of this seminar is to tell the story of a 200 year duel between two archenemies: France and Spain from the Late Middle Ages to the eve of the Enlightenment. Both powers alternatively dominated during these 200 years. At the end of the period, Spain was still the most powerful European colonial empire and France the most threatening continental power upon the European soil. This is a story of wars, conquest and frontiers. The seminar will provide students with a dynamic overview of the rivalry of the two most powerful European monarchies and empires in the Early Modern Times, before the rising of the British power. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 275.001. Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schaub teaches at the Ecole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales (Paris). He is a researcher at the Mondes Am\u00e9ricains EHESS\u2019 center, as a specialist in the comparative history of the Iberian Empires. He has been visiting professor at Yale, Michigan, Oxford, Tokyo, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. He is currently preparing, with Silvia Sebastiani, a new book on the creation of racial categories in Western societies from the Late Middle Ages to the Enlightenment. He has written books on a large array of topics, such as the Jewish community in the Northern African city of Oran; the union of Spanish and Portuguese crowns in Renaissance Europe; the influence of the Spanish religious and political models on absolutist France; the historical background of Aphra Behn\u2019s novel Orroonoko or The Royal Slave ; and the challenge of writing a global history of Europe. 20th Century Music: Studies in Contemporary Opera AHSEM-UA 224 (class # 23575)  Instructor: Louis Karchin Tuesday and Thursday, 3:30-4:45 p.m. Prerequisite: ability to read music. This course will explore operas of the 20th and 21st centuries, beginning with works emerging from the classical tradition such as Richard Strauss\u2019 comedy Der Rosenkavalier , and continuing with the groundbreaking operas of Berg, Bartok, Britten, Stravinsky and others. The second half of the course will explore such recent innovative works as John Adam\u2019s Nixon in China , Kaija Saariaho\u2019s L\u2019amour de loin , Helmut Lachenmann\u2019s Das M\u00e4dchen mit den Schwefelh\u00f6lzern , and Gyorgy Ligeti\u2019s Le Grande Macabre . The course will focus on the interrelation of music and text, and consider subject matter as it reflects the cultural milieu of the times. Cross-listed with Music as MUSIC-UA 111.001. Louis Karchin , Professor of Music at NYU, is the composer of over 70 works, including two operas. His first opera, Romulus , is available on a Naxos Records release that has garnered acclaim internationally. He has received three awards for his work from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and a Guggenheim Fellowship, among many honors. Mr. Karchin has also been instrumental in new music advocacy, co-founding, mentoring, and often conducting performance ensembles such as the Orchestra of the League of Composers and the Washington Square Ensemble. He has written extensively on contemporary music topics. The Search for Authenticity AHSEM-UA 225 (class # 23681) Instructor: David Samuels Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. How should human beings sound? This is a question that has linked ideas about music to ideas about ethics for 100 years or more. The social and ethical dilemmas of two world wars and the global spread of industrial modernity created a challenge: how can we maintain our true humanity in the face of these traumas and disruptions? In this course we will explore three areas of musical life: folk music revivals, ethnomusicology, and historical performance movements. By attending to links between them, we will attempt to address questions about the role of \u201cauthenticity\u201d in musical and ethical discourse; how concerns about authenticity have colored critical responses to various musical styles and performers; and whether, in the end, authenticity is really what people have been worried about at all. Cross-listed with Music as MUSIC-UA 153.002. David Samuels is Associate Professor of Music at NYU. He is a linguistic anthropologist, folklorist, and ethnomusicologist, and received his Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Texas. His book Putting A Song On Top of It: Music and Identity on the San Carlos Apache Reservation (University of Arizona Press, 2004) was the first book-length monograph exploring popular music\u2019s place in the formation of contemporary Indigenous identities. His current work is focused in two main areas: how missionary encounters refigured Indigenous ideologies of language, culture, and aesthetics; and the ethical ideas suffusing various musical movements in the 20th and 21st centuries. Literature and Machines AHSEM-UA 226 (class # 24031) Instructor: Nicola Cipani Tuesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Machine metaphors play an important role in modern literature, conveying beliefs, anxieties, shifts, and reflections on key topics, including the nature of consciousness and creativity; the dynamics of desire and gratification; gender roles; the organization of society; the meaning of \"nature\"; and the function of technology. This course explores different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal; and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines). Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural contexts, primarily from the late 19th and 20th century (e.g., Belle \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion. Nicola Cipani is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Department of Italian Studies and has been working at NYU for ten years. His interests include reception of antiquity in medieval and early modern culture, Renaissance philosophy, the intersection of verbal/ visual forms (such as the art of memory, emblem books, and representations of dreams), and 20th-century experimental literature. At the Italian Department he has served in the capacity of Director of Language Programs (since 2005), Director of Summer Programs (2011-12), and Director of Undergraduate Studies (2011, 2013). Latin America's 1968 AHSEM-UA 229 (class # 24553)  Instructor: Jill Lane Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. In Latin America, the year 1968 marked a turning point in the social, political, and cultural transformations that had had been unfolding in the wake of the Cuban Revolution of 1959. For Latin America, as for the rest of the world, the sixties were shaped by the geopolitics of the Cold War and of anti-colonial struggles across the globe. Yet they are most remembered by those who lived them as a time when ordinary people felt, like never before and perhaps never after, that they could change the course of history. Millions of youth in student movements, advocates for indigenous rights, workers, campesinos, educators, intellectuals, and artists, along with guerrillas and other armed insurgents, were self-aware actors in world-historical projects of radical social, political, economic, and cultural change. In these years, the personal became political, politics became theatrical, theatre became a weapon, and the lines between self, art, and politics were forever changed. In this course we study the complex relations between revolution, counterculture, and authoritarian rule as they emerged in Latin America\u2019s 1968: the emergence of Brazil\u2019s Cinema Novo, Cuba\u2019s imperfect cinema, and militant documentary across the region; the rise of rock and activist nueva canci\u00f3n; and the apogee of student activism and the counterculture in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. We encounter 1968 through art, music, film, fiction, journalism and news coverage, along with other primary documents from the period. No knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese is needed for this course; students with these languages may read texts in the original. Jill Lane is Director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, and Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at NYU.

Shifrin had been extensively covering the US-led anti-terror efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This article, on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks which provoked the US military response, was a detailed and dismal account of the mistakes and failures of the US \u201cwar on terror\u201d, observed by Shifrin from several places, including Afghanistan\u2019s second largest city, Kandahar, in the turbulent southern province near the bristling border with Pakistan.       The article\u2019s analysis of a brutal, intransigent conflict \u2013 the massive American anti-insurgency effort unable to exterminate the tenacious, intractable Taliban insurgents, the treachery of US-allied warlords, and the unrelenting suffering of ordinary people caught in the hostilities \u2013 was unfortunately nothing new. Other reporters had painted similar pictures of US military and political might, mobilized to avenge the wound of 9/11, stumbling and faltering through unanticipated consequences of its desire to punish Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Shifrin\u2019s article is striking because it brings Shakespeare into the calamities of Kandahar, as he invokes constant references to the play Titus Andronicus to explain the American mission, its mistakes and murderous outcomes.       Ten years earlier, Shifrin was a Columbia under-graduate and studied Titus Andronicus in his first class after the planes struck the New York towers in 2001. Ten years later, contemplating the ruins of lives, hopes and of American prestige, he recalls the lessons of the play and reflects that \u201cperhaps Shakespeare might have imagined the US would be here.\u201d            Fig. 1- Recent staged scene from Titus Andronicus    Source: Wikicommons       It might seem implausible to envisage the 16th /17the Century English playwright imagining the 21st century predicaments of American power in South Asia. But Shakespeare\u2019s theatrical imagination had a prodigious capacity to transport insights and ideas about politics and human actions, perhaps derived from his English context, into distant places and times, as evidenced by his Roman plays, such as Titus Andronicu s (and Anthony and Cleopatra discussed later in this essay). In Titus Andronicus , that imagination is particularly fertile, even febrile: the leading Roman general Titus is an entirely invented figure, unlike the Julius Caesar and Mark Antony who inhabit other plays with impeccable historical credentials; the events are also invented, occurring in an unspecified period of the Roman empire\u2019s struggle against Barbarian tribes. Most spectacularly, his imagination unleashes an unending series of viciously bloody acts, which make Titus Andronicus Shaskespeare\u2019s most unremittingly violent play.       The violence is a result of cycles of brutal revenge and grotesque atrocities that end in near-total death and devastation. It starts with Titus defeating a tribe of rebellious Goths and killing the captive Goth Queens\u2019s son, which incites a convoluted succession of revenge and counter-revenge, attended by treachery and further reprisals. Titus defines himself in lurid terms: \u201cVengeance is in my heart; death in my hand/ Blood and revenge are hammering in my head,\u201d in the process describing the play\u2019s central compulsions.        Fig.2- Titus Andronicus German staging    Source: Wikicommons       Shifrin relocates this revenge-perpetuating ideology from imperial Rome to US -invaded Afghanistan to argue that Shakespeare had a profound understanding of how the dynamics of reciprocal violence operate in imperial wars; that civilians need to be conciliated, not intimidated, by imperial powers; that exercise of force without wisdom produces pernicious loss for all. Shifrin is so convinced of the trans-global relevance of Titus Andronicus that he asks: \u201cHad the Americans learnt from Shakespeare\u2019s epic of vengeance might Afghanistan and Pakistan be less violent and more welcoming of the US today?\u201d       The question may well be overly simplistic. The particular circumstances of wars \u2013 their causes, adversaries, tactics -- are different, and lessons learnt from one cannot be seamlessly transposed on another. Moreover, revenge and its relentless wars of attrition or its ravaging human toll are a common theme explored and deplored by writers from the time of Homer. Indeed, the ancient Indian story The Mahabharata is also an \u201cepic of vengeance\u201d that offers cautionary lessons.       Nevertheless, Shifrin\u2019s insistence that Shakespeare\u2019s Roman drama makes sense in present day Afghanistan does confirm the view that some Shakespeare plays enact structures of relationships and interactions that have enormous relevance for major international developments of recent centuries. This is part of, though not entirely, the function of Shakespeare\u2019s much celebrated \u201cuniversalism:\u201d that the love he portrays, or the ambitions of his nobles, or the cravenness of courtiers, or his philosophical musings regarding time and mortality seem valid through the ages. It may be interesting to note, that during his time, not much attention was paid to this \u201cuniversal\u201d value of his plays; the 18th Century Samuel Johnson first extolled this as a way of exonerating Shakespeare from the criticism that his plays violated classical principles. Johnson\u2019s defence was that they contained universal truths that transcended his technical transgressions. Later in the 18th and 19th centuries, English and German Romantic poets discovered in Shakespeare philosophical profundities that they cultivated themselves and so revered his \u201cuniversality.\u201d Similarly in the mid-20th Century the Polish political activist and theatre critic Jan Kott claimed Shakespeare\u2019s particular affinity with the political and existential debates of the mid-20th Century in his book called Shakespeare our Contemporary . Jan Kott went so far as to argue that you can\u2019t really understand Hamlet unless you\u2019ve lived under repressive, authoritarian regimes and know what it is to fear a midnight knock on the door!       These are aspects of Shakespeare\u2019s supposed \u201cuniversalism\u201d in specific contexts. I would argue that, for our present times, certain Shakespeare plays extend and modify the notion of \u201cuniversalism\u201d into a penetrating vision of \u201cglobalism,\u201d when he depicts, examines and critiques the attitudes and interactions of people of diverse racial and cultural backgrounds, especially when geographical spaces, power equations and social factors shape those interactions.       England had scarcely begun to appropriate the land and resources of native Americans when Shakespeare composed The Tempest , with its tensions between dominant colonizers and the aggrieved colonized. England was still hovering on the edges of global, commercial activity, when Shakespeare developed in The Merchant of Venice his concerns about the effects of expansive mercantile and financial environments. Deliberate double-meanings in the language of \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cworth\u201d suggest that the market-place turns human beings into commodities. Mercantilism\u2019s multi-cultural mix is also hard to harmonize: the prosperous Venetian merchant Antonio\u2019s ships sail all over an inter-connected world -- Mexico, the Indies, England, Tripoli -- but in Venice there is friction between long-domiciled Jewish and Christian merchants.            Fig. 3- Scene between merchants, The Merchant of Venice    Source: Wikicommons            Fig.4- Shylock and his daughter, The Merchant of Venice    Source: Wikicommons       In another Roman history play, Antony and Cleopatra , Shakespeare presents a different multi-cultural situation, created by empire-building and the desire to rule over a people who are different from the rulers. Such situations became more familiar long after Shakespeare\u2019s times, in the 19th and 20th centuries, as western powers expanded and acquired vast sections of the globe. The play is about the tragic love affair of Antony, the brilliant Roman general and Cleopatra the Queen of an Egypt that successive Roman generals had sought to conquer. The love affair is enacted within the larger imperial ambitions of Rome and particularly of Octavius Caesar, Antony\u2019s one time ally-turned-enemy, who finally defeats the combined forces of Antony and Cleopatra, extends Roman rule over Egypt and effectively inaugurates the Roman empire, and is elevated from Octavius to Augustus Caesar.            Fig.5- Banquet of Cleopatra, 17th century    Source: Wikicommons       Shakespeare\u2019s source for Antony and Cleopatra was Plutarch\u2019s histories, but he deploys the historical material to produce some of the most insightful passages about the operations of imperial powers, especially their self-image and representation of those they wish to rule. Most interestingly, these portrayals closely resemble the imperial and colonial discourses of much later periods.       Edward Said\u2019s landmark 1998 book, Orientalism , argued that as 18th and 19th Century European powers colonized other parts of the world, often oppressing and exploiting their colonial subjects, a discourse emerged to justify and perpetuate colonialism. This discourse called \u201cOrientalism\u201d presented the Europeans as superior and better equipped to rule, and the colonized \u201cother\u201d as inadequate, immature and in need of European guidance. Many of the features that Said identifies as \u201cOrientalist\u201d discourse can be deciphered in Antony and Cleopatra: the plot and characterizations develop and support the colonial ideology which legitimizes colonial rule, as the formidable, disciplined Roman forces of Caesar defeat the unreliable, self-indulgent Egyptians    .    In Antony and Cleopatra \u201call the world\u2019s the stage,\u201d a geographical space conjured by a cascade of place names -- Parthia, Syria, Lydia, Media, Mesopotamia, Armenia \u2013 great kingdoms once, but now available for Roman acquisition. Rome\u2019s imperial greatness resides in these possessions or alliances; their repetitive mention signifies the contours and conventions of empires. It is in the same spirit of global ownership, of amassing vast territories under one rule, that Britain would later declare proudly by the end of the 19th Century that \u201cthe sun never set on the British empire.\u201d       Most significantly, the play shows an apparent difference between the Romans and the Egyptians that seems to facilitate and validate Rome\u2019s power and its conquest of Egypt. The Romans, especially Octavius the conquering General, are presented as superior, efficient, masterful, and ultimately stronger militarily; the Egyptians, especially the passionate, wilful Queen Cleopatra, it is alleged, revel in pleasure and luxury, and are militarily vulnerable. Said had argued in Orientalism that a culture that attempts to dominate another often endows itself with masculine qualities and the culture it seeks to dominate with feminine ones. In the play, the male Roman figures assert themselves as proficient warriors, austere and rational as opposed to the singularly feminized, playful members of Cleopatra\u2019s entourage. Antony is portrayed as a once-exemplary Roman hero who has degenerated by complying with the voluptuous feminized Egyptian ways under the spell of Cleopatra and Egypt\u2019s attractions.       Throughout its early sections, the play describes the charms and dangers of Cleopatra and Egypt, mainly from the perspective of combat-hardened Roman soldiers. \u201cThe beds in the East are soft,\u201d claims a Roman soldier, contrasting the harsh rigor of Roman militarism with the sensual ease and langor supposedly represented by Egypt. The details of the splendours and opulent beauty of the \u201cbarge\u201d that Cleopatra \u201csat upon like a burnished throne\u201d may have come verbatim from Plutarch\u2019s florid descriptions, but in the context of the play the images of oriental sumptuousness are conjured to tempt and also to remind the Romans that these are deviations from Rome\u2019s more austere ethos. And that this feminised sensuality requires and awaits capture and control by Roman power and moral probity.            Fig. 6- Elizabeth Taylor, Cleopatra (film, 1963)    Source: Wikicommons       Cleopatra, who embodies an uncontrolled, intemperate, promiscuous allure is consistently denigrated by the Romans as \u201cgipsy\u201d and \u201cstrumpet\u201d and contrasted with the chaste and modest Roman woman, Octavia. This characterization recurs later in the many \u201cexotic\u201d eastern women \u2013 the seductive queens and courtesans, the treacherous Mata Hari spies, the dancing temptresses -- that fill the fantasy fiction and imaginings of the colonial mind. In \u201c Europe\u2019s Myths of the Orient \u201d Rana Kabbani demonstrates how such images were simultaneously entertaining for the west, occasions for moral superiority and justification of colonial rule which would regulate the alleged moral excesses and cultural decadence.       Antony, the revered military leader, whose Roman values succumb to Egyptian charms, who abandons his Roman responsibilities for \u201cAlexandrian revels\u201d, represents the kind of figure whose fate is most dreaded and despised in colonial accounts \u2013 the once upright European who goes \u201cnative\u201d, who enters and embraces debased eastern spaces and practices and loses his valued European identity. In several stories by Rudyard Kipling, set in 19th Century colonial India, the English protagonists who surrender to Indian pleasures, who go \u201cBeyond the Pale,\u201d are ostracized by their English compatriots and become degraded, diminished shadows of their previous selves. They seem to echo the fear that Mark Antony himself experiences about his transformation: \u201cThese strong Egyptian fetters I must break or lose myself in dotage.\u201d       On the surface Shakespeare seems to create all the colonial constructs that \u201cOrientalists\u201d several centuries later adopt to support and perpetuate the colonial ideology. Yet Shakespeare\u2019s craft is too complex to conform to the simplicities of this ideology. Indeed on occasion he seems to subvert it: his Roman soldiers, who had portrayed the Egyptians as indolent inebriants, themselves surrender to wild drinking when they gather for high-level strategizing and alliance building. They accuse Cleopatra of deviousness, but are themselves masters of calculated, cold-blooded, murderous betrayals. Though the Romans repudiate Antony\u2019s absorption of Egyptian traits, these seem to enhance, not diminish, him as tragic hero. Shakespeare thus enacts imperial discourse to reveal its hollowness; he inscribes the assumptions of Roman superiority and Egyptian inferiority, but discloses that they are unstable constructs, not representations of reality. \u201cThe beds in the east\u201d are only as \u201csoft\u201d as the Romans fantasize and as suits their purpose. And if their purpose is empire and its consolidation, Shakespeare demonstrates that Roman supremacy is achieved at the expense of an impoverished world: the lustrous Cleopatra and the illustrious Antony flame out; Egypt, once fabled, is enfeebled by Roman power. The gains of empire, Shakespeare seems to suggest, are less compelling than the losses they inflict. Maybe that\u2019s why Nick Shifrin was right. Maybe we should \u201cRead Shakespeare in Kandahar.\u201d                                       Rochelle Almeida    rochelle.almeida@nyu.edu                  Jacqueline Bishop    jaj204@nyu.edu                  David Damstra    ddamstra@nyu.edu                  William Klein    bill.klein@nyu.edu                  James McBride    jim.mcbride@nyu.edu                  Joseph Portanova    joseph.portanova@nyu.edu                  Nancy Reale    nancy.reale@nyu.edu                  Robert Squillace    robert.squillace@nyu.edu                  Minu Tharoor    minu.tharoor@nyu.edu                  Timothy Tomlinson    tt7@nyu.edu                  Joan Varnum    jv2089@nyu.edu"}, {"content": "Advanced Honors Seminars: Spring 2015, CAS | NYU                                                  Navigation       College of Arts and Science                 About Arts and Science | Departments and Programs | The Faculty       About the College | Programs | Students | Admissions | Alumni                  Back to Home             Advanced Honors Seminars: Spring 2015   The College is one of the most diverse communities   anywhere\u2013an exciting, sophisticated center in one of the most exciting   and cosmopolitan cities in the world. Our mission is to prepare students   to be thought leaders and successful global citizens. We do this by   creating unique academic opportunities for student and faculty   engagement that emphasize research and scholarly communication. Part of   the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced Honors Seminars place   students in small classes with distinguished faculty to study topics   that have the potential to change how we think and how we work. As such,   they are ideal gateways for the intellectually stimulating discussions   we aim to foster. They challenge students and faculty to engage   intensively within and beyond their fields of study, and they inspire   intellectual responsibility towards the scholarly community and the   wider world. In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science   launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic   principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to upper-level courses   (open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors). Distinguished professors   drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s   professional schools, and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural,   and governmental leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances,   the seminars are cross-listed with departments and students may count   the classes toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes   will count only as electives. Advanced Honors Seminars have three   central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between   exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students intellectually   through honors-level work in critical thinking, writing, and conversing;   and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in and aptitude for conducting   independent research (e.g. a DURF grant or a Senior Honors Thesis). They   are designed to foster scholarly insight and debate and to nurture the   intellectual passions of students and faculty alike. We encourage you to   try one this year! G. Gabrielle Starr Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science Wendy Suzuki Director of College Honors Programs   Course Descriptions  Power, Domination and Resistance AHSEM-UA 166 (class # 23136)  Instructor: Steven Lukes Thursday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This course will introduce students to the complexities of conceptualizing and studying power. How do we determine where it lies? Who has more and who less? How do we study its mechanisms and effects, above all in view of the intuition that it is at its most effective when least observable by both agents and observers? Is power at its most effective when most imperceptible, and, if so, how are we to study it? What are the relations between the concept of \u201cpower\u201d and such related concepts as \u201cauthority,\u201d \u201cinfluence,\u201d \u201cmanipulation,\u201d \u201ccoercion,\u201d \u201cforce,\u201d and \u201cviolence\u201d? What is the relationship between so-called \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d power? We will look at some classical writings (from Thomas Hobbes to Max Weber), at modern writers (such as Hannah Arendt, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel Foucault), and at work by contemporary political scientists and sociologists. Abstract discussion will be leavened throughout by case studies exemplifying the conceptual discussion. Cross-listed with Sociology as SOC-UA 935.001. This course can count towards the major in Sociology as either an advanced seminar or elective. Steven Lukes is Professor of Sociology. He studied philosophy, politics, and economics at Oxford, where he obtained his doctorate, writing a thesis on Durkheim under the supervision of the anthropologist E. E. Evans-Prichard. He has previously held posts in Politics and Sociology at Balliol College, Oxford; in Political and Social Theory at the European University Institute in Florence; in Moral Philosophy at the University of Siena; and in Sociology at the London School of Economics. He is a Fellow of the British Academy and an editor of the European Journal of Sociology. His writing and teaching have ranged over political science, political and moral philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and the philosophy of the social sciences. His published works include Emile Durkheim: His Life and Work; Individualism, Marxism, and Morality ; Liberals and Cannibals: The Implications of Diversity ; The Curious Enlightenment of Professor Caritat: A Comedy of Ideas (a novel soon to be reissued); and Power: A Radical View , which recently appeared in a much-expanded second edition. He is also co-editor of Rationality and Relativism and The Category of the Person: Anthropology, Philosophy, History . His most recent book is Moral Relativism . What is Memory? AHSEM-UA 187 (class # 19746)  Instructor: Suzanne England Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia. Thanks to the written records that serve as our cultural memory, we know that memory has been a topic of inquiry at least since those records began. Today\u2019s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as how is memory embodied? How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self\u2014and with language and story-telling\u2014and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center\u2019s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that serves their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed. Cross-listed with the Silver School of Social Work as UNDSW-US 79.001. Suzanne England is a Professor at the Silver School of Social Work at NYU. She holds degrees from the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Illinois Chicago, and Tulane University. She was Dean of the Silver School at NYU from 2001 to 2009 and Dean at the Tulane Graduate School of Social Work from 1994 to 2001. Professor England\u2019s teaching includes methods of human inquiry, social policy and politics, narrative approaches to policy and advocacy, management and organizational practice, and ethical leadership. Her current research is on narratives\u2014literary, dramatic, autobiographical, and popular culture representations of aging, old age, memory, caregiving and domestic space. This research is at the nexus of moral philosophy and memory studies as she seeks to develop frameworks for examining memory and forgetting in moral performances, and the expressions of meta-narratives and archetypes of aging, old age and age-related dementias in contemporary literature and popular culture. Making History: Culture and Politics in the Caribbean AHSEM-UA 204 (class # 11940)  Instructor: Sibylle Fischer Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m. In this seminar we will study the culture and politics of the Caribbean. The class is organized around key moments of Caribbean history: \u201cDiscovery;\u201d slavery and the struggles against it; colonialism and independence movements; U.S. occupations, dictatorships and revolutionary movements; the massive growth of a Caribbean diaspora; and the transformation of the Caribbean islands into so many tourist destinations. While the Spanish-speaking islands (Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic) are at the center, the French and English-speaking Caribbean (and questions that concern the Caribbean as a region), will be part of the discussion. Readings are drawn from primary sources (slave testimonies, declarations of independence, revolutionary discourses), literary texts, film, and important essays in cultural studies/critical theory, anthropology, and history. The class will be taught in English. Reading of texts in the original language is encouraged. Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 551.002 and with History as HIST-UA 760.001.

She has held teaching positions at Duke as well as at Princeton and now teaches in the Department of Spanish &amp; Portuguese and the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU, with affiliations with Comparative Literature and Africana Studies. Her research focuses on Caribbean history and culture. Her study of the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) and its impact on Caribbean national cultures, Modernity Disavowed , won book awards from the Modern Language Association, the Latin American Studies Association, The Caribbean Cultural Studies Association, and the Caribbean Philosophical Association. Jewish Women in Modern History AHSEM-UA 219 (class # 23214)  Instructor: Marion Kaplan Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. This course will approach Jewish women\u2019s history from the perspective of social history. After an introduction to the normative role of women in Judaism, the body of the course will focus on Jewish women in Modern Europe and America, analyzing their history in a variety of countries from the American and French Revolutions, through the bourgeois 19th century, World War I, the interwar era, the Nazi era, and postwar Europe and the United States. Students will read secondary sources but we will pay particular attention to memoirs, diaries, and letters. Students will learn about the prescriptive roles of Jewish women in the home, family, religion, and worlds of work and social life. They will focus, however, on the actual activities of Jewish women, what they did, rather than what they were supposed to do. They will investigate the rich variety of responsibilities and tasks that women performed in the (often intersecting) private and public spheres of life, how they both preserved religion in the modern era and also mediated non-Jewish culture for their families. They will further note that women both kept the Jewish family and community together and reached out to non-Jews, joining in secular women\u2019s organizations, local community projects, and the field of social work and teaching. They will discover that women\u2019s roles were often contested and always crucial to the Jewish community.

She is co-editor of Gender and Jewish History (2010). Anthropology in the Horror Film AHSEM-UA 220 (class # 23219)  Instructor: Edward Hubbard Thursday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. Anthropologists have appeared as protagonists and key characters in many horror films. Films like The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988), Ganja and Hess (1973), Candyman (1992) and Cannibal Holocaust (1980), have pitted the anthropologist against powerful spirits and demons, accursed artifacts, mutant beasts, malevolent sorcerers and ferocious cannibals. This course is a critical examination of the anthropologist and anthropological research as conventions of the horror film. Through weekly screenings, reading and discussions, we will examine filmic representations of the anthropologist as a liminal figure \u2013 a hapless intermediary between science and superstition, between modernity and arcane tradition \u2013 who grapples methodologically with both rationalist and non-rationalist epistemes. We will also examine cinematic depictions of fieldwork as a terrifying, ill-advised crossing of social, cultural, geographic, and temporal boundaries. These films will be used as a basis to consider the major disciplinary problems, anxieties and even phobias arising out of anthropology\u2019s troubled place in the history of the West. We will look at the often complimentary roles played by anthropological science and the horror genre in constructing, popularizing and sometimes challenging Western notions of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality and citizenship.

Migration, Citizenship, and Belonging AHSEM-UA 221 (class # 23220)  Instructor: Arely Zimmerman Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m. New modalities of economic organization and relationships, innovations in technology and communication, and the sheer rate of growth of Latin American migration to U.S. cities has impacted the modes and practices of identity, community and membership in U.S. Latino communities. This course examines the normative and political dilemmas around issues of citizenship, belonging, and national identity amongst U.S. Latinos- brought about by immigration, transnationalism, neoliberalism, and globalization. These dilemmas revolve around themes national identity and sovereignty, democratic citizenship, and the rights of immigrants. The class will draw from a wide array of readings in political and legal theory, sociology, anthropology, and U.S. Latino studies. By the end of the class, students will be able to articulate and understand political theories of nation-state citizenship, including its historical, sociological, and legal underpinnings. Importantly, students will have a deep understanding of how citizenship is transformed as both a legal status and a set of practices that constitute contemporary political and social membership. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 541.002. Arely Zimmerman holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California (Los Angeles), with specializations in political theory and race and ethnic politics.

She is concurrently working on new research in the areas of youth, second generation Latino/a civic engagement, and new media. Empire and Decolonization AHSEM-UA 222 (class # 23573)  Instructor: Manu Goswami Thursday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. This class examines the global history of empire and decolonization, focusing on the case studies of the Spanish Empire from the nineteenth century and the British Empire in the twentieth century. These two great empires \u2013 the first running from the 15th to the 19th centuries, the second from the 18th to the 20th \u2013 are often contrasted as opposites: where the Spanish Empire is seen as the great bastion of medieval Catholicism, the British Empire is taken as Protestant and liberal. Where the first is thought of as founded through conquest and war, the second is often described as taking place through settlement and commerce. This course will question these oppositions, examining how both colonial projects of rule, and the nationalist movements that emerged against them, helped create the ideas and institutions associated with liberalism and democracy.

Rival Monarchies: Old Regime Spain and France AHSEM-UA 223 (class # 23574)  Instructor: Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schaub Wednesday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. In the memory of the history of Western Europe, the 16th century was Spanish, the 17th French, and the 18th British. The aim of this seminar is to tell the story of a 200 year duel between two archenemies: France and Spain from the Late Middle Ages to the eve of the Enlightenment. Both powers alternatively dominated during these 200 years. At the end of the period, Spain was still the most powerful European colonial empire and France the most threatening continental power upon the European soil. This is a story of wars, conquest and frontiers. The seminar will provide students with a dynamic overview of the rivalry of the two most powerful European monarchies and empires in the Early Modern Times, before the rising of the British power.

This course will explore operas of the 20th and 21st centuries, beginning with works emerging from the classical tradition such as Richard Strauss\u2019 comedy Der Rosenkavalier , and continuing with the groundbreaking operas of Berg, Bartok, Britten, Stravinsky and others. The second half of the course will explore such recent innovative works as John Adam\u2019s Nixon in China , Kaija Saariaho\u2019s L\u2019amour de loin , Helmut Lachenmann\u2019s Das M\u00e4dchen mit den Schwefelh\u00f6lzern , and Gyorgy Ligeti\u2019s Le Grande Macabre . The course will focus on the interrelation of music and text, and consider subject matter as it reflects the cultural milieu of the times. Cross-listed with Music as MUSIC-UA 111.001.

He has written extensively on contemporary music topics. The Search for Authenticity AHSEM-UA 225 (class # 23681) Instructor: David Samuels Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. How should human beings sound? This is a question that has linked ideas about music to ideas about ethics for 100 years or more. The social and ethical dilemmas of two world wars and the global spread of industrial modernity created a challenge: how can we maintain our true humanity in the face of these traumas and disruptions? In this course we will explore three areas of musical life: folk music revivals, ethnomusicology, and historical performance movements. By attending to links between them, we will attempt to address questions about the role of \u201cauthenticity\u201d in musical and ethical discourse; how concerns about authenticity have colored critical responses to various musical styles and performers; and whether, in the end, authenticity is really what people have been worried about at all. Cross-listed with Music as MUSIC-UA 153.002. David Samuels is Associate Professor of Music at NYU. He is a linguistic anthropologist, folklorist, and ethnomusicologist, and received his Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Texas. His book Putting A Song On Top of It: Music and Identity on the San Carlos Apache Reservation (University of Arizona Press, 2004) was the first book-length monograph exploring popular music\u2019s place in the formation of contemporary Indigenous identities. His current work is focused in two main areas: how missionary encounters refigured Indigenous ideologies of language, culture, and aesthetics; and the ethical ideas suffusing various musical movements in the 20th and 21st centuries. Literature and Machines AHSEM-UA 226 (class # 24031) Instructor: Nicola Cipani Tuesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Machine metaphors play an important role in modern literature, conveying beliefs, anxieties, shifts, and reflections on key topics, including the nature of consciousness and creativity; the dynamics of desire and gratification; gender roles; the organization of society; the meaning of \"nature\"; and the function of technology. This course explores different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal; and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines). Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural contexts, primarily from the late 19th and 20th century (e.g., Belle \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion. Nicola Cipani is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Department of Italian Studies and has been working at NYU for ten years. His interests include reception of antiquity in medieval and early modern culture, Renaissance philosophy, the intersection of verbal/ visual forms (such as the art of memory, emblem books, and representations of dreams), and 20th-century experimental literature. At the Italian Department he has served in the capacity of Director of Language Programs (since 2005), Director of Summer Programs (2011-12), and Director of Undergraduate Studies (2011, 2013). Latin America's 1968 AHSEM-UA 229 (class # 24553)  Instructor: Jill Lane Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. In Latin America, the year 1968 marked a turning point in the social, political, and cultural transformations that had had been unfolding in the wake of the Cuban Revolution of 1959. For Latin America, as for the rest of the world, the sixties were shaped by the geopolitics of the Cold War and of anti-colonial struggles across the globe. Yet they are most remembered by those who lived them as a time when ordinary people felt, like never before and perhaps never after, that they could change the course of history. Millions of youth in student movements, advocates for indigenous rights, workers, campesinos, educators, intellectuals, and artists, along with guerrillas and other armed insurgents, were self-aware actors in world-historical projects of radical social, political, economic, and cultural change. In these years, the personal became political, politics became theatrical, theatre became a weapon, and the lines between self, art, and politics were forever changed. In this course we study the complex relations between revolution, counterculture, and authoritarian rule as they emerged in Latin America\u2019s 1968: the emergence of Brazil\u2019s Cinema Novo, Cuba\u2019s imperfect cinema, and militant documentary across the region; the rise of rock and activist nueva canci\u00f3n; and the apogee of student activism and the counterculture in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. We encounter 1968 through art, music, film, fiction, journalism and news coverage, along with other primary documents from the period. No knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese is needed for this course; students with these languages may read texts in the original. Jill Lane is Director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, and Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at NYU.

HIST-GA.1209 19th Century France: France and its Empire 1750-1800s    France and Its Empire, 1750-1880s focuses on the revolutionary period of modern France. This was a tumultuous and creative time, a time of revolution and reaction, republics and monarchies, liberalism and centralized power. We will study this period in three principal ways: by learning about the various regimes, politics, ideologies, and social patterns that marked the era; by reading documents written during this time and texts composed by some of its principal figures; and by analyzing selected works of present-day historical scholarship that help us understand modern France.         As we build this understanding, our thinking will be guided by the following questions: Why was it so difficult during the century following the French Revolution for France to develop a stable political regime? Why, in this connection, did France irrupt into revolution in response to the problems it faced? And to what extent did the French Revolution define the nature and meaning of the period that followed it? Finally, what was the role of France\u2019s empire, and how did colonialism square with the effort to build a stable republican regime?        The French Revolution is fundamental not just to French history but to world history. For this reason, we will devote considerable attention to the origins and meaning of this event. We will also consider the subsequent revolutions of the nineteenth century revolutions and examine the extent to which France became a modern society in the second half of the nineteenth century.

HIST-GA.1416 History of Modern Ireland I     Early-modern Irish history is an epic tale of conflict, subjugation, and the struggle for national identity. In the roughly two and a half centuries covered by this course, Ireland was transformed from a mysterious and remote island on the periphery of Europe to a quasi-autonomous state fully caught up in the sweeping economic, political, and social transformations that defined the late eighteenth century. Among the topics covered in History I are the Tudor conquest and colonization; Gaelic pushback; Ireland under the Stuarts; the Williamite War and formation of the Protestant Ascendancy; the emergence of Irish nationalism; Ireland and the Enlightenment; 18th-century political, economic, and societal transformations; and Ireland in the Age of Revolutions. The struggles and frustrations of this period define the agenda for Ireland\u2019s tumultuous passage through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.             HIST-GA.1421 Debates in Modern Irish History     This course seeks to analyze a selection of the intense debates in Ireland itself and abroad, especially in Britain and the USA, that characterize modern Irish history, concentrating on topics that transcend the specific Irish experience to raise issues of wider human import. It is equally a study of events and of their interpretation from various contested perspectives, and thus requires intense engagement with the historiography, and with the study of history as a mode of thought. The topics to be explored include the issues of Conquest, Collaboration, Assimilation and Resistance, viewed through the prism of Ireland and the British Empire, as reflected in a number of major topics, including: The Act of Union; The Great Irish Famine; Irish Diaspora; Issues of Irish Identity (as seen through Irish and British eyes via historical movements and events); the ethno-religious conflict in Northern Ireland since 1968; Ireland and Globalization.              HIST-GA.1441 History and Historiography of Irish America     The Irish are one of the most significant ethnic groups to ever migrate from Europe to the United States. Their impact has been disproportional to their numbers but this only partially explains our contemporary understanding of \u201cIrish America.\u201d This seminar will explore how the history of Irish immigrants and their descendants in the United States has been written over the past century and a half. Students will evaluate books and documentary films that have been influential in constructing the narrative of the Irish in America, in addition to article literature. The goal is to learn how to separate historical content from historiography and to see how both can influence popular perceptions of an ethnic people.              HIST-GA.1521 Medieval Marriage     This course will explore the practical experience of marriage in the Middle Ages. We will be looking at the lay experience of the stages of married life (from courting and wedding to annulment and death) in all its gendered aspects. For each of the thematic sessions we will explore as much as possible the experience across the whole social range from aristocracy to peasants. Although our focus will be on the Christian Middle Ages of western Europe we will devote ample space to comparative aspects in Islamic and Jewish culture especially for the Mediterranean area. Thematic sessions will centre on exogamy (intermarriage) in mixed faith and ethnic circumstances, polygamy and concubinage, remarriage and step family relationships, male power and female obedience and the memorialisation of married life. We will also explore alternative forms of cohabitation in a sexual or celibate manner. Wherever possible special attention will be paid to the material culture of marriage, such as the domestic arrangement in the houses, living and sleeping quarters and moveable possessions.              HIST-GA.1562 Lit of the Field: Africa     This course introduces students to the major themes, scholarly approaches, and sources for African history.              HIST-GA.1600 Literature of the Field: US to 1877     A reading course covering the earlier period of American history that introduces students to the major themes, interpretations, and methods of inquiry. It is intended to provide a broad command of the field.              HIST-GA.1646 Materializing in the Middle Ages     The theme of the seminar, materiality, is concerned with the tangible stuff of medieval lives, with those materials: animal parts, vegetable fibers, metal, stones, clay, wood, that were used and processed into finished objects: comestibles, clothing, homes and monuments, artifacts and ornaments, images and the media of written and visual communication. As they emerged from raw materials, things affected social relations and cultural perception, enabling action and provoking reaction. We will consider, for example, the effects of pageantry, with its elaborate display of culinary, heraldic, and sartorial splendor, in asserting and maintaining chivalric claims to dominance. We will examine recent archeological findings to understand the ways that, through accessories to their dress, peasants resisted and re-fashioned the identities imposed upon them by medieval elites. Objects, thus, shaped history, yet historians tend to write history based upon texts. Avoiding such an exclusive dependency requires methodological reflection. Stimulated by the work of social scientists such as Jane Bennett, Alfred Gell, Tim Ingold, Bruno Latour, and Bjrnar Olsen, lively debates are currently taking place about the theory, goals, and relevance of material culture studies, and we will develop our own perspectives on the issues at stake. Assessing the participation, meaning, and agency of things in pre-modern lives forces to question boundaries and to put them in a newer historical perspective: the relationships between humans and animals (and nature), between humans and technology, body and soul, images and memory, the animate and the inanimate. Our exploration of the connections between human and non-human environments will consider the appropriation of animal skins in the production of writing; the extension of human personhood via the use of animal power, tools, weapons, images, and memory aids; human involvement with a living landscape of holy trees, sacred groves and springs, and powerful stars; attitudes toward idols and automata; the perception of art as vibrant matter. Though modern theory inspires historians and art historians to seek agency in a network of social and material relationships, medieval intellectuals were more cautious in their belief in the power of matter. In fact, for many, the materiality of the human body was suspicious, as was knowledge that depended upon the mediation of the senses. Such \u2018carnal\u2019 knowledge was ascribed to minorities (Jews) and alleged dissenters (magi, witches). Materiality in the Middle Ages was a philosophical topic fraught with ambivalence, imbued with a potential for violence.              HIST-GA.1750 Intro to Public History     Reviews the history of public history, focusing on historians\u2019 relationships, dialogues, and collaborations with public audiences. Considers issues involving memory, identity, heritage, commemoration, historic preservation, history museums, historic sites, oral history, and digital history. Final project involves a collaborative endeavor with a local public history institution.               HIST-GA.1763 Approaches to History of Women and Gender     This course is intended as an introduction to some of the central methodological and interpretive issues involved in the historical study of women and gender. We consider the development of women\u2019s history as a field from the 1960s, the historiographies that have shaped women\u2019s history (and been influenced by it), the introduction of gender as an analytical category, the interpretive models that have structured writing about women and gender in the past, and the particular challenges involved in researching subjects who have often left little trace in the historic record. This is not a nation-based survey of women\u2019s history. Instead, our approach is comparative. We will read works that have had a significant impact on the development of the field, works that model particular methodological or interpretive approaches, and works by faculty at NYU. We will also consider contemporary reflections on the state of the field, both in the US and internationally .               HIST-GA.1773 Society &amp; Culture: 20th Century America     This is a graduate level research seminar on the social and cultural history of the United States in the twentieth-century. The central project of the course will be each student\u2019s development of an extended, article-length essay based on original research. Considerable class time will be dedicated to preliminary discussions of each research problematic and its relevant historiographies. Research takes time, as does writing and re-writing; papers are NOT written in one sitting or in a single draft. Accordingly, students will be required to develop their research in the first weeks, even as readings and discussion proceed and present finished drafts in class that will be revised for final submission.        Although the seminar is not be readings course or colloquium, the first half of the semester will include readings to introduce some theoretical tools and writing strategies. Introductory readings and wider reading around the relevant historiographies that the various students\u2019 research problematic engages, and shared reading of the research essays of others will also expose students to a broad a range of subjects in the literature in social and cultural history. The subject is cast broadly to allow for diverse student research interests, but will be limited to the long 20th century (from ca. 1890 to the present).              HIST-GA.1782 African American History     Broad exposure to African American history. Begins with a historiographical introduction, describing the growth and development of the field, and moves to a major theme and period treatment ranging from ancient Africa to the civil rights movement. Provides an understanding of the field and a foundation for specialized course work and research.              HIST-GA.1981 Migration History and Theory: The Italian Case as Litmus Test     The course begins with the assumption that mobility is the norm in human history and it will focus on the case of Italy \u2013 a geographically well-defined peninsula, which for centuries has been at the crossroad of demographic movements \u2013 as an ideal example of what kind of socio-cultural transformations can be consequence of population mobility in every society and context. The course will draw on the lessons from the various theories of migration to analyze the way in which Italy's human landscape has been affected by migratory flows and the social, cultural, political impacts these in- and out-flows have originated in the course of history. It will first provide an overview of the state of the art in the field of international migration theories, with a view to clarify any conceptual distinctions between the terms migration, immigration, mobility, diasporas, etc. Then, we will explore some key pathways that will form the focus of the transformations: a) the arts \u2013 literary and visual; b) institutions and laws \u2013 juridical concerns in controlling flows and identifying status and memberships; c) familial/societal structures; d) entrepreneurship and economic culture. Finally, the course will discuss to what extent and in what manner population movements have been forging states and societies and, through the Italian case, will reflect upon the role of mobility as a key dynamic in globalization. The course is addressed to those students with basic knowledge of Italian migration history and/or interest in migration studies, who intend to enhance their knowledge both of international migration theory and the history of Italian global migrations. The main aim of the course is to provide the students with effective tools to develop critical thinking on human mobility.              HIST-GA.2022 MA Proseminar     Introduction to the theoretical and methodological components involved in the research process. Considers historiographical issues; develops an understanding of the archival and library environments, focusing on searching strategies and the use of automated techniques; and emphasizes framing research questions. Students complete a research paper with appropriate documentation and bibliography in their area of interest.              HIST-GA.2031 Advanced Archival Description     Provides an understanding of archival descriptive standards and practices. Focuses on the development and use of bibliographic standards to create and exchange data concerning archival records. Particular emphases include the MARC format; the development, implementation, and evaluation of Encoded Archival Description and Encoded Archival Context; content management systems; digital encoding standards; and digital library development.               HIST-GA.2033 Creating Digital History     Historians who work with the public have a particular need to be confidant with digital tools. The course offers students a hands-on primer in the skills archivist and historians need to create, contribute to, and use web-based historical sites. Students will gain experience digitizing historical materials for preservation and access, creating structured metadata and folksonomies to describe historical objects, conducting online historical research and presenting the results of that research online in the form of blog posts and an online digital exhibit. Projects will center around the history of Greenwich Village and be publicly accessible at htttp://aphdigital.org/GVH. Class discussions will focus on current topics in digital humanities and how they impact the making of digital history sites.               HIST-GA.2122 Empire, Nation, Globalization     Empire and globalization lie at the heart of the spatial turn in academic work during the last several decades. This graduate seminar is designed to enrich student research in various disciplines by exploring empire and globalization as features of modern spatial history. We focus on imperial Britain and the United States and on globalization in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and in most detail, on South Asia. Spatial history begins with the premise that various scalar forms of social space and social power relations are meaningfully connected to one another. Localities weave into regions, continents, and global spaces. Expanding spaces of social power affect everyday life in smaller spaces, right down to New York neighborhoods and mountain hamlets in the Global South. The scale and impact of meaningful spatial interaction pose problems for historical study. Empire and nation do not necessarily form dominant spatial frames. Space is not a stage or container, but rather a permanently ongoing construction project, at all scalar levels. Spatial history entails the study of interactive, changing spaces over time, configured by social power of many kinds at many levels of scale. This course is designed to stimulate, support, and inform student research. Before mid-term, we read and discuss assigned texts. Each week, we focus on one theme, which we develop according to student interest. The bibliography at the end of the syllabus is a work-in-progress, providing resources for further work. After mid-term, we focus on student research. Each student should join the class with a research idea to work with all term. This idea can be very vague to begin with; it can derive from other courses or outside projects. Student work for the course includes weekly reading and one-page weekly essays to prepare for class. Students and instructor meet individually at mid-term to develop research ideas and devise readings for the remainder of the term. Ideas for final week readings also appear at the end of the syllabus. Students present their work in class at the end of the term. A research paper is due on the last day of university classes.                 HIST-GA.2150 Fiction, Historiography &amp; the Event     In this seminar we will examine the construction, disappearance, and persistence of \u201ceventfulness\u201din fiction, historiography, and theory. We will consider narrative theory as it pertains to the writing of fictional and historical texts; the historical novel genre; the problem of collective memory; subjectivity and historical agency; historical time and regimes of figurability; the question of \u201cthe recent past.\u201d Case Study: the Paris Commune. Readings to include Lukacs, Ricoeur, Braudel, Bakhtin, Badiou, Ranci\u00e8re, and Trouillot.              HIST-GA.2162 Twentieth Century Cities      Description forthcoming. In the meantime, please contact the professor directly.                  HIST-GA.2163 European Conceptions of the New Man, 1789-1945     This course concerns a fundamental fantasy of modern European thought, art, and culture, the figure of the \u201cNew Man\u201d in the period 1789-1939\u2014a figure that expressed the idea that human society and even human nature could and should be regenerated through political, philosophical, and aesthetic means. The course is intended as an engagement with a series of further questions: problems of modernity, secularism, humanism and time; methodological questions pertinent to intellectual and conceptual history as well as theory, comparative literature, and political theory: it is thus aimed at once at students with historical but also literary and political-science backgrounds. We will read a mixture of primary and secondary sources.              HIST-GA.2168 Methods and Approaches to World History     Description forthcoming. In the meantime, please contact the professor directly.             HIST-GA.2655 Morning in America: Ronald Reagan, the Nuclear Crisis, and the Cold War of the 1980s          This course seeks to place the final decade of the Cold War in historical perspective by focusing on the intertwinement of domestic and foreign policy during the Reagan administration. It explores the emergence of the neoconservative movement, the \u201cReagan revolution,\u201d the effects of \u201cReaganomics\u201d and the military buildup, and the ascent of Evangelical Christianity as a political factor. It also retraces the debates surrounding the role of government, social responsibility, the welfare state and public health care system, shifting value systems, and technological innovation, as well as their representations in society and popular culture. Merging an \u201cestablishment\u201d perspective with an analysis of protest cultures, the course examines Reagan\u2019s foreign policy of \u201cpeace through strength\u201d with regard to the Soviet Union from a global perspective, analyzing the nuclear threat and the renewed arms race, his policies toward Europe and Central America, Iran-Contra, the question of human rights in East-West diplomacy, and the controversy, widespread opposition, and grassroots activism these issues triggered both at home and abroad. Readings include the most recent and influential scholarship on this period as well as a variety of primary sources.             HIST-GA.2707 The Agrarian Question in History     This course will explore the emergence of what was called the \u201cAgrarian Question\u201d in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as that question was related to the emergence of industrialization and the question of value, problems of domestic and global revolution, and the issues of modernization and development in Europe and the non-Western world. We will trace the evolution of the question from its physiocratic core, through its articulation in Smith, Marx, the Soviet Union, Peru, and into the later twentieth century as part of the 'peasant problem.' The last part of the semester will be devoted to studying how this question has re-emerged in today\u2019s China, as a problem of development, where the peasantry persists. The aim of the class is to familiarize students with some of the basic philosophical and historical texts surrounding problems of development and culture, as they pertain to the agrarian question in China and elsewhere and to assist students in analyzing contemporary problems through a longer historical perspective. A lot of reading and a research paper at the end are basic requirements. Students from all geographical specializations welcome; MA students should write for permission to register.              HIST-GA.2901 Captivity, Displacement, and Migration     This course explores questions of voluntary and involuntary movement across the greater Ottoman and Mediterranean worlds. The emphasis is on the early modern period, especially the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, heyday of corsairs, renegades, captives, and converts. (Participants interested in other periods may write final papers accordingly.) The Ottoman empire, with its particular brand of imperial slavery and its forms of economic and household slavery, is a principal, although not exclusive, focus of the course; the \u201cGrand Turk\u201d looms large even when not a direct protagonist of events. The Eurasian and Mediterranean frontiers of the empire and the peoples who crossed them are emphasized. The majority of the readings are recent monographs; we will also read contemporary narratives. Occasional guest speakers will share their expertise in the themes of the course.            HIST-GA.3013 Research in Archives and Public History     This course is an independent study within the Archives and Public History Program.              HIST-GA.3021 Research in History     This course is an independent study.              HIST-GA.3022 Readings in History     This course is an independent study.              HIST-GA.3213 Eastern Europe Workshop     This 2-credit course involves discussion of selected readings concerning Eastern Europe, discussion of graduate student papers and current research concerning Eastern Europe, attendance at guest lectures concerning Eastern Europe, and independent research on Eastern Europe guided by the instructor.            HIST-GA.3330 Guantanamo Public Memory Project at NYU     This class will bring together Museum Studies, Public History and CLACS students into a nationwide collaboration facilitated by the Guantanamo Public Memory Project. The class will seek to trace the complex history of Guantanomo Bay via the project\u2019s collation of oral history, documentary and photographic, and material culture pertaining to the facility. This history will be framed within a broader set of questions about the politics of archives, the ethics of historical narratives, the techniques and technologies that make history present for the public and the constitution of public consciousness via engagement with images, text and testimony. The class will coordinate, create and curate an exhibition that will draw content from 8 similar classes held in graduate programs across the country (the exhibition itself will travel subsequently to each of the venues). The exhibition will be held at NYU in the Kimmel Windows gallery space \u2013 a 24 hour accessible series of vitrines on the intersection of West 3 rd street and LaGuardia Place. NYU students will curate this exhibition, create digital and other content and coordinate a large international symposium to be held at the exhibition\u2019s opening.              HIST-GA.3603 Approaches to Historical Research and Writing     This course is designed to introduce students to some of the basic methodological and interpretive issues involved in historical research. Based around a core set of readings, the course covers important books and articles that explicitly deal with questions of method, as well as examples of certain methodologies or schools of historiography in action. The goal of this course is to help the student produce a research paper that is of potentially publishable quality and to reveal that the student is capable of doing graduate level research and writing.              HIST-GA.3701 Creation of the Constitution     The course begins with readings setting forth the intellectual and experiential background of the framing, including common law and natural rights theory, republicanism, economic &amp; political scientific ideas, and colonial and post-Independence experience. We then study large parts of the debates at the Constitutional Convention, primarily using Madison's Notes. Next come the ratification debates, including readings from antifederalist writers, about half of The Federalist, and overviews of the Virginia and New York ratification conventions. We conclude with the addition of the Bill of Rights. Classes consist of a combination of lecture and extensive participation by students.              HIST-GA.3704 Legal History Colloquium     This course, taught by faculty members of the School of Law, is designed for students planning academic careers, in particular, as legal historians. Students who take the course will be expected to work on a major research paper intended for publication. Specific topics discussed during the semester are determined by the interests of those participating in the colloquium. 2 credits. Consent of instructors is required to register.              HIST-GA.3803 Atlantic History Workshop     This yearlong course overlaps with the Atlantic History Workshop colloquium, which meets regularly in the Department of History throughout the academic year. At the colloquium, participants discuss pre-circulated works-in-progress presented by visiting scholars or members of the colloquium. Students enrolled in this course attend every meeting of the colloquium and undertake additional activities assigned by the instructor during the regular class meetings.            HIST-GA.3901 The Mediterranean in Historical Perspective        Trains students in the history of the Mediterranean and provides them with insights into the theories and interpretations of the Mediterranean. Analyzes the ways in which the Mediterranean has been identified not only as a geographical region, but also as a cultural, political, and social one. Examines the reshaping of cultural, political, and social borders across the Mediterranean.                         Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
