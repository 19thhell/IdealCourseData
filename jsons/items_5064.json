As the only studio training actors, directors, designers, playwrights and creators of devised work in a single setting, Playwrights Horizons offers students an unparalleled opportunity for the cross-fertilization of skills, a commitment to the collaborative nature of theater and a dedication to the principle that each student is a whole artist to be nurtured, challenged and celebrated. Rigorous training with our diverse faculty of professional artists working in traditional, global and avant-garde performance styles, challenges each student to discover and bring forth the artist within. As the student progresses through the program, the balance shifts from projects that support foundational class work, to class work that supports the needs of the artist in the development and production of actual work. Projects offer the opportunity to collaborate with fellow students, recent alumni, faculty professionals and guest mentors creating a network of feedback and support that serves as a bridge to the world beyond studio walls. Our project-driven methodology ensures that students emerge from the program with the physical, emotional and intellectual strength and flexibility their work requires. Our students develop, as well, a deep connection to their own personal vision and appetite for artistic risk that will enable them to define their own unique path as artists, citizens and human beings. The school is part of Playwrights Horizons Theater, one of New York\u2019s most successful off-Broadway nonprofit theaters and producer of such shows as the Tony nominated Grey Gardens, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Sunday in the Park with George, Driving Miss Daisy and I Am My Own Wife, as well as the Obie Award-winning Circle, Mirror, Transformation and Clybourne Park.

Pairing five New Dramatists playwrights with five composers from a   variety of musical and stylistic backgrounds, this nearly   round-the-clock workshop sparks early-stage collaborations. During the   two-week studio, facilitated by Ben Krywosz and music director Roger   Ames, an ensemble of five singer/actors support the participants as they   develop overnight responses to five songwriting assignments. The goal   of the Composer-Librettist Studio is to expose new talent to the   intensely collaborative process of writing music-theatre and to prepare   writers and composers for the joys as well as the inevitable challenges   and disagreements that arise in collaboration.    This year, the New Dramatists playwright participants are Mia Chung, Madeleine George, Barbara Hammond and current Van Lier Fellows Brian Ota\u00f1o and Charise Castro Smith .    They are joined by composers Scotty Arnold (cycle 20), Martin Hennessy, Mike Iveson, David Mallamud (cycle 13) and Peter Stopschinski , in addition to performers David Anderson, April Armstrong, Maria-Christina Oliveras, Adam Overett and Lori Wilner .    There will be a final sing-through of all twenty-five pieces generated over the course of the studio on Monday, February 27. Please call New Dramatists at 212-757-6960 for details, as reservations are required .  Click HERE for the official press release.  The Composer-Librettist Studio is made possible by lead sponsorship from The Jerome Foundation.
