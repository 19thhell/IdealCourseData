JUMP TO: MEDITATION CLASS SCHEDULE | YOGA CLASS SCHEDULE          Meditation   The type of meditation we practice at The Mindfulness Project involves simple \u2014 but not always easy! \u2014 breath and awareness exercises that bring our attention to the present moment. Through these exercises, we relax and rejuvenate our bodies, see the world around us more clearly, and act with more compassion towards ourselves and others.   Our meditation practice is enriched with teachings from a variety of spiritual traditions as well as lessons from our own personal lives. Meditations consist of two periods of 20 minute meditations, with guidance as needed, and a 10-15 minute discussion or exercise.   There is nothing quite like meditating with a community.

However, it is important to note that mats are given out on a first-come, first-served basis.

JUMP TO: MEDITATION CLASS SCHEDULE | YOGA CLASS SCHEDULE          Meditation   The type of meditation we practice at The Mindfulness Project involves simple \u2014 but not always easy! \u2014 breath and awareness exercises that bring our attention to the present moment. Through these exercises, we relax and rejuvenate our bodies, see the world around us more clearly, and act with more compassion towards ourselves and others.   Our meditation practice is enriched with teachings from a variety of spiritual traditions as well as lessons from our own personal lives. Meditations consist of two periods of 20 minute meditations, with guidance as needed, and a 10-15 minute discussion or exercise.   There is nothing quite like meditating with a community.

Yoga for women with physical disabilities is an excellent tool for a strong, relaxed body. Using basic hatha yoga postures, breathing and relaxation techniques, these classes are done in a seated position. The IWD yoga classes allow women of all abilities participate in the class and the poses are adapted to their ability.     Through the practice of yoga, participants may experience:        Clarity      Relaxation      Self-empowerment      Focus      Flexibility and tone      Mindfulness             From the instructor: &quot;One of the participants is severely disabled as a result of multiple sclerosis. She uses a motorized wheelchair and only has movement in one arm. She came to the class and participated fully. She found the eye exercises helpful and benefited from the breathing practice. This participant had difficulty breathing and needed to open up her chest. Since the class was done in a seated position, the instructor showed the participant&#39;s aide how to adapt the fish pose so the participant can do it in bed. The participant reported the following week that she felt wonderful.&quot;                                    Call us for more information: 212-598-6429       NYULMC Home   Contact Us   For Faculty &amp; Staff   Careers   Make a Gift   Site Map"}]},

JUMP TO: MEDITATION CLASS SCHEDULE | YOGA CLASS SCHEDULE          Meditation   The type of meditation we practice at The Mindfulness Project involves simple \u2014 but not always easy! \u2014 breath and awareness exercises that bring our attention to the present moment. Through these exercises, we relax and rejuvenate our bodies, see the world around us more clearly, and act with more compassion towards ourselves and others.   Our meditation practice is enriched with teachings from a variety of spiritual traditions as well as lessons from our own personal lives. Meditations consist of two periods of 20 minute meditations, with guidance as needed, and a 10-15 minute discussion or exercise.   There is nothing quite like meditating with a community.

We will begin with a heat-building warm-up, flow through a varied and comprehensive sequence of standing postures, and end class gently in a few easy, restorative poses. Each week will focus on unpacking and building up the skills needed to accomplish a challenging arm balance and/or inversion. A knowledge of yoga basics is assumed.

Frequently Asked Questions                                                      Should I bring my own mat?                               We provide mats for all yoga practitioners. However, it is important to note that mats are given out on a first-come, first-served basis.

I am not affiliated with the University. Can I still participate?

Yoga for women with physical disabilities is an excellent tool for a strong, relaxed body. Using basic hatha yoga postures, breathing and relaxation techniques, these classes are done in a seated position. The IWD yoga classes allow women of all abilities participate in the class and the poses are adapted to their ability.     Through the practice of yoga, participants may experience:        Clarity      Relaxation      Self-empowerment      Focus      Flexibility and tone      Mindfulness             From the instructor: &quot;One of the participants is severely disabled as a result of multiple sclerosis. She uses a motorized wheelchair and only has movement in one arm. She came to the class and participated fully. She found the eye exercises helpful and benefited from the breathing practice. This participant had difficulty breathing and needed to open up her chest. Since the class was done in a seated position, the instructor showed the participant&#39;s aide how to adapt the fish pose so the participant can do it in bed. The participant reported the following week that she felt wonderful.&quot;                                    Call us for more information: 212-598-6429       NYULMC Home   Contact Us   For Faculty &amp; Staff   Careers   Make a Gift   Site Map"}, {"content": "Programs &amp; Classes | The Initiative for Women With Disabilities                                                                                                                                                           The Initiative for Women With Disabilities                                                                Home   About Us   Medical Services   Wellness Services   Programs & Classes   Contact                 NYULMC Home   Careers   Make a Gift   News        Enter your keywords:                                        Home Programs &amp; Classes         Print   Email   - A + A                                Programs & Classes      Empowerment Program   Social Work   Young Women&#039;s Program   Achilles Group Workout   Arthritis Exercise   Belly Dancing   Fluid Movements   Mat Pilates   Meditation   Self-Defense   Strength &amp; Tone   Tai Chi and Qigong   Yoga                                                                           Programs &amp; Classes                                IWD offers programs, activities, and classes specifically designed for women with physical disabilities.
