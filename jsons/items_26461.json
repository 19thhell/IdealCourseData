Program Director : Sarah Beck Address : Pless Building, Room 775 82 Washington Square East New York, NY 10003 Phone : 212-998-5470    The Interaction of Language and Learning    Language is our most important tool for spoken and written communication, but it is much more than that. Through language, we develop our sense of tradition and our social, ethical and moral concerns. Reading a novel, poem, or play, we experience, understand, and express feelings ranging from joy to sadness, from love to alienation. Language that is sensitively and intelligently shaped can help us to learn who we are and who others are. The teaching of language and literature offers exceptional opportunities and personal rewards. For a more complete statement of English Education at Steinhardt see \" Who We Are in Teacher Education: Our Background, Mission and Vision \".    Our Reputation Continues to Grow    Our Bachelor of Science Program, Teaching English, Grades 7-12 , has long been regarded as among the finest in the country. Students majoring in English education may our distinguished faculty: Sarah Beck, David Kirkland, Joseph McDonald, and Gordon Pradl. Barbiere, the author of numerous books, brings extensive experience with middle school students and a particular focus on the education of girls. Beck specializes in helping high school students develop academic literacy and has worked closely with one of our partnership high schools in the city.    Professor Kirkland, a recognized expert on Hip Hop , focuses on the alterative literacies of inner-city youth and the skills English teachers need to connect to their worlds. Pradl, who specializes in composition, and the teaching of literature, is the author of several articles on narrative language, the coauthor (with John Mayher) of Learning to Write/Learning to Learn , and the author of Literature for Democracy . Our entire faculty holds a deep commitment for the role writing and literature play in bringing out the creative inner voice of student teachers and the students that they, themselves, will be guiding.    Relationships Provide the Key    Many other programs in English education tend to isolate the different aspects of learning and teaching, but in our program they are inseparable. We integrate all aspects of English education-theories of language and literature, literature's content and meaning, and methods for teaching adolescents. You study the relationship among the reader, the literary work, and the writer. You learn how to develop, apply, and evaluate teaching materials and strategies. And you learn how teacher, student, school, and community interact with each other in the educational process. In effect, you build two concentrations in one-deepening your understanding of language, composition, and literature while becoming skilled in reflective teaching.    In Touch with the Latest Ideas    The undergraduate program is enriched by our graduate programs and the ongoing research and curriculum development of the faculty in NYU Steinhardt's Department of Teaching and Learning. As a result, you are in contact with and benefit from the latest thinking and practice in the field of English education. One example is the recent publication of Teaching English Today: Advocating Change in the Secondary Curriculum , which was edited by Professors John Mayher and Pradl, and includes contributions by them and Professor Beck.    Pursuing a Special Interest    We encourage small-group collaboration in learning, and you may negotiate with your professors the kinds of projects and other learning experiences relevant for a particular course. You will have frequent opportunities to develop your creative potential through writing poetry, short stories, and plays within your courses. There are, in addition, numerous campus literary publications that welcome your interest and participation.    Your Teaching Internship    In your junior year, you begin your student teaching experience by observing secondary school teachers and their students in the classroom. During each semester your senior year, under the guidance of your supervising teacher, you assume responsibility for teaching an actual class, one in middle school and one in high school. Teacher education is a collaborative effort, involving you, the experienced cooperating teacher in whose classroom you will be working, and a member of our faculty.    Financial Support for Master's Study    NYU Steinhardt offers generous Scholarships for Advanced Study to graduating seniors in Teaching and Learning who want to continue on for their master's degree in early childhood or childhood education, secondary education, literacy education, special education, or environmental conservation education at NYU Steinhardt.

To support this through practice, course work focuses on transactional processes between speaker and listener, writer and audience, reader/viewer and work, teacher and student, school and community, and theory and practice.    The distinguishing characteristics of this program are the faculty's commitment to a transactional social constructionist view of learning that is embodied in the following principles:       Learning is most significant when one attends to one's own and others' needs, concerns, and enjoyment.    Individuals learn not by memorizing but by constructing their own version of that knowledge in relation to what they already know, believe, and have experienced.    Language learning and use proceed most naturally from whole to part, from known to unknown, and from experience to reflection.    Language learning has no ceiling.    Learning is acquired through using language in its various modes.       The program offers four master's degree programs leading to initial teacher certifcation:       English Education, Grades 7-12, MA    Clinically Based English Education Teacher Residency, Grades 7-12, Advanced Certificate and MA    Educational Theatre, All Grades, and English, Grades 7-12, Dual MA    Teaching English and Teaching Students with Disabilities, Grades 7-12, Dual MA       We offer a master's degree program for teachers who already hold initial teacher certification, which leads to professional teacher certification:       English Education, Grades 7-12, MA, leading to professional certification       Financial Aid Opportunities    Steinhardt offers generous scholarships for full-time study for the English Education MA program and the Dual Teacher Certification program in Theatre and English. The Clinically Based English Education Teacher Residency Program offers full tuition scholarships for the Advanced Certificate and generous partial scholarships for the MA.    Career Opportunities    Many graduates teach English in intermediate and secondary schools and in two- and four-year colleges; others educate teachers and conduct research in schools and universities, teach writing and administer writing programs, and direct curriculum development and educational programs in schools, colleges, and universities. In non-school settings, alumni work as editors and consultants in publishing and education and direct curriculum and training programs in the industry.

Through language, we develop our sense of tradition and our social, ethical and moral concerns. Reading a novel, poem, or play, we experience, understand, and express feelings ranging from joy to sadness, from love to alienation. Language that is sensitively and intelligently shaped can help us to learn who we are and who others are. The teaching of language and literature offers exceptional opportunities and personal rewards. For a more complete statement of English Education at Steinhardt see \" Who We Are in Teacher Education: Our Background, Mission and Vision \".    Our Reputation Continues to Grow    Our Bachelor of Science Program, Teaching English, Grades 7-12 , has long been regarded as among the finest in the country. Students majoring in English education may our distinguished faculty: Sarah Beck, David Kirkland, Joseph McDonald, and Gordon Pradl. Barbiere, the author of numerous books, brings extensive experience with middle school students and a particular focus on the education of girls. Beck specializes in helping high school students develop academic literacy and has worked closely with one of our partnership high schools in the city.    Professor Kirkland, a recognized expert on Hip Hop , focuses on the alterative literacies of inner-city youth and the skills English teachers need to connect to their worlds. Pradl, who specializes in composition, and the teaching of literature, is the author of several articles on narrative language, the coauthor (with John Mayher) of Learning to Write/Learning to Learn , and the author of Literature for Democracy . Our entire faculty holds a deep commitment for the role writing and literature play in bringing out the creative inner voice of student teachers and the students that they, themselves, will be guiding.    Relationships Provide the Key    Many other programs in English education tend to isolate the different aspects of learning and teaching, but in our program they are inseparable. We integrate all aspects of English education-theories of language and literature, literature's content and meaning, and methods for teaching adolescents. You study the relationship among the reader, the literary work, and the writer. You learn how to develop, apply, and evaluate teaching materials and strategies. And you learn how teacher, student, school, and community interact with each other in the educational process. In effect, you build two concentrations in one-deepening your understanding of language, composition, and literature while becoming skilled in reflective teaching.    In Touch with the Latest Ideas    The undergraduate program is enriched by our graduate programs and the ongoing research and curriculum development of the faculty in NYU Steinhardt's Department of Teaching and Learning. As a result, you are in contact with and benefit from the latest thinking and practice in the field of English education. One example is the recent publication of Teaching English Today: Advocating Change in the Secondary Curriculum , which was edited by Professors John Mayher and Pradl, and includes contributions by them and Professor Beck.    Pursuing a Special Interest    We encourage small-group collaboration in learning, and you may negotiate with your professors the kinds of projects and other learning experiences relevant for a particular course. You will have frequent opportunities to develop your creative potential through writing poetry, short stories, and plays within your courses. There are, in addition, numerous campus literary publications that welcome your interest and participation.    Your Teaching Internship    In your junior year, you begin your student teaching experience by observing secondary school teachers and their students in the classroom. During each semester your senior year, under the guidance of your supervising teacher, you assume responsibility for teaching an actual class, one in middle school and one in high school. Teacher education is a collaborative effort, involving you, the experienced cooperating teacher in whose classroom you will be working, and a member of our faculty.    Financial Support for Master's Study    NYU Steinhardt offers generous Scholarships for Advanced Study to graduating seniors in Teaching and Learning who want to continue on for their master's degree in early childhood or childhood education, secondary education, literacy education, special education, or environmental conservation education at NYU Steinhardt.

Beck, Director, Associate Professor of English Education                           Teacher Education AT NYU STEINHARDT         Did you ever read a poem or a story and come to your English class excited to share your response, only to have your teacher shut down discussion in order to make it clear what the \"correct\" interpretation should be?    Similarly, when it came time to write, the teacher-directed routines continued. While you had a number of things you wanted to explore and express, the teacher only droned on, emphasizing proper form and correct grammar, ignoring your concerns and interests. There was always a right answer and most of the time was spent getting ready for some examination. We hope your experience with English has not been exclusively with such teacher-centered instruction.    Making Literacy Flourish in the Classroom    The English Education Program at NYU Steinhardt has always stood for something different. We have been committed to cultivating teachers who want to make literacy flourish in their classrooms &ndash; from I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings to The Crucible , from autobiographical pieces to essays exploring today's commercial pressures on youth. By truly making English a space where readings come alive and students investigate issues of personal and social significance, teachers extend and refine communication skills essential to academic and personal success.    As we see it, an important goal for us as English teachers is to know our students in the context of a rich and complex world of information, both literary and expository. This allows us to plan engaging lessons that include challenging material and purposeful activities. In this way, our students develop both confidence and competence, seeing their own responsibility to participate energetically in our ongoing social democracy.    A Leader Among English Education Programs    Yet beyond preparing teachers who are dedicated to making a difference in the literate lives of their students, NYU Steinhardt's Program in English Education has historically been a leader in helping to theorize and construct dynamic, collaboratively negotiated methods of teaching and learning in literature, writing, and the language arts.    In the 1940s the program was led by Louise M. Rosenblatt, whose Literature as Exploration (1938) provided a groundbreaking perspective on the reading and teaching of literature. Literature study, of course, has always figured centrally in the English classroom, but prior to Rosenblatt's powerful ideas about the transactional process that occurs when one reads a text, English instruction was mostly characterized by a conventional search for \"correct readings\" &ndash; readings that, of course, were established by the teacher or some other \"expert\" critic.    Rosenblatt dramatically shifted our perspective on reading and thus on what English teachers might do. By demonstrating how each reader was responsible for enacting a reading response, she showed that it was the teacher's task to help evoke these personal responses that in turn, through the give and take of discussion, would evolve into more complex interpretations. This process of social reading allowed students to explore the worlds of inner and outer experience in a safe environment, one in which a variety of meanings and their consequences might be shared and questioned. In this way, the English classroom proved to be a continuing experiment, one in which democratic scripts and values were tested, practiced, and strengthened.    Another early educational leader in our program was Lou LaBrant. Her work complemented Rosenblatt's by connecting the process of student understanding and meaning-making with writing instruction. Just as reading demanded that the teacher be open and supportive of student response, so writing required authentic and creative assignments, real audiences, and a process that allowed meaning-making to evolve through social conversation and feedback.    Together, Rosenblatt and LaBrant paved the way for English teachers to take student voices seriously, so that the English curriculum might be a place where literature and other media served as a bridge to pursue students' concerns, even as communicative competence and critical skills are being developed. In a negotiated curriculum and classroom, an English teacher is responsible for much more than just providing students with access to the canon and some privileged view of \"culture.\" The task equally involves validating the various experiences students bring with them to the learning situation, while encouraging a wide range of cultural contacts and transactions from adolescent literature to the latest rap lyrics.    Over the past 30 years, our program has also been shaped by its close association with outstanding scholars in England and Australia, most notably, James Britton, Nancy Martin, Geoffrey Summerfield, and Douglas Barnes in Great Britain and Garth Boomer in Australia. Their research, writing, and teaching contributed to refining our approaches to the English curriculum. In Language and Learning , James Britton provided a seminal theoretical frame for understanding the important role of active language use on the part of all learners, both in terms of narrative imagining and analytical inquiry. Nancy Martin helped us recognize how writing and the composing process was a crucial component of instruction across the curriculum, while Douglas Barnes continued to illustrate the inestimable value of social and critical exploratory talk in learning.    Educators such as these (including Geoffrey Summerfield, Garth Boomer, Gordon Hodgeon, Barbara Davies, John Dixon, and Denys Harding) played significant roles in the direction of our Study Abroad Program, which began in 1975. We were also pleased to welcome a number of them as visiting faculty, who spoke during our Summer Conferences at Washington Square and taught summer courses for us.    Linking the World of the Text to the Student's World    Today's faculty carry on this tradition of English teaching and learning that focuses on linking the world of the text to the world of the student. The teaching and scholarly work of our full-time faculty members has been devoted to the proposition that a professional interest in teaching a subject can only proceed from ongoing reflection into what it means to learn that subject from a student's point of view. These faculty members include:       Sarah W. Beck , who studies teachers' and students' understanding of academic literacies, with a special interest in assessment practices as a context for investigating this understanding;    Myrrh Domingo , (Visiting Assistant Professor of English Education and Literacy Education), who studies language and literacy development in the context of digital technologies and globalization;    Maura Gouck , a veteran NYC high-school teacher with extensive practical experience in public school settings;    Michael J. Kieffer , who studies the language and literacy development of students from linguistically diverse backgrounds, aiming to conduct research that can inform instruction and policy to improve the reading outcomes of students in urban schools;    David Kirkland , whose work on the relationship between literacy and masculinity and digital literacies among urban youth informs our efforts to help teachers recognize and employ the cultural resources that students bring to classroom (on leave 2011-2014);    Joseph McDonald , whose expertise and scholarship in the areas of school reform and teacher professional development help us to situate our progressive philosophies of curriculum and teaching and adolescent literacy development in the context of broader efforts to improve schools;    Ayanna Taylor , (Master Teacher of English Education), who has eighteen years of experience teaching in urban public school districts and charter schools, and has also worked as a teacher trainer and coach and a charter school developer.       In tandem, these faculty work to provide a place where the English classroom can be questioned and re- visioned, where old texts join with new, and language both spoken and written is honored as the most powerful tool for realizing the occasions and opportunities of our private lives and our public democracy.
