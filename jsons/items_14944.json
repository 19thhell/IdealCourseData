It has traditionally offered its students the opportunity to specialize in one of three sub-specializations within Management: Organizational Behavior, Organization Theory, and Strategy. The programs seeks to help its students acquire the necessary background knowledge to become independent researchers and scholars in the field of management. The program encourages students to take an interdisciplinary approach to research if they so desire. Our program offers several advantages over competing schools: World-class Faculty. In a recent survey, Stern's Management Department was ranked fourth world-wide in terms of research productivity. Our faculty publish in and serve on editorial boards of all the leading management journals. Breadth &amp; Diversity. Because of the size of our faculty, we are able to offer a wide array of expertise across the broad research domain of management. With over twenty full-time professors, you are likely to find someone to mentor you no matter what your area of interest. Small Size. The small size of the program relative to the size of the department means that students can get very personalized attention from faculty. The Doctoral Coordinator makes every effort to match students with faculty who can help them develop research skills in their specific area of interest. Living Laboratory. As the center of international commerce, New York City offers amazing opportunities for conversing with managers and studying business organizations. Research opportunities abound right outside our door.

It has traditionally offered its students the opportunity to specialize in one of three sub-specializations within Management: Organizational Behavior, Organization Theory, and Strategy. The programs seeks to help its students acquire the necessary background knowledge to become independent researchers and scholars in the field of management. The program encourages students to take an interdisciplinary approach to research if they so desire. Our program offers several advantages over competing schools: World-class Faculty. In a recent survey, Stern's Management Department was ranked fourth world-wide in terms of research productivity. Our faculty publish in and serve on editorial boards of all the leading management journals. Breadth &amp; Diversity. Because of the size of our faculty, we are able to offer a wide array of expertise across the broad research domain of management. With over twenty full-time professors, you are likely to find someone to mentor you no matter what your area of interest. Small Size. The small size of the program relative to the size of the department means that students can get very personalized attention from faculty. The Doctoral Coordinator makes every effort to match students with faculty who can help them develop research skills in their specific area of interest. Living Laboratory. As the center of international commerce, New York City offers amazing opportunities for conversing with managers and studying business organizations. Research opportunities abound right outside our door.

The management course program helps students develop a repertoire of skills to anticipate, address, and resolve the central challenges of running organizations in the 21st century. You will learn how to identify (and implement) the best strategy for a firm. You will also examine ways in which people work as individuals, as team members, and as organizational members.    You may also consider pursuing the Management Consulting Track (MCT). Stern\u2019s approach is to teach consulting as an effective way of thinking about businesses and solving business problems that is applicable in any job role inside and outside the consulting industry. Consultants identify and adapt \u201cbest practices\u201d to the firms that hire them, working on different projects across different industries with access to the top executives in the firms they consult to. Consultants can be called on for their strategic, operational, industry, and financial expertise. This track is an excellent complement to a concentration in management as well as in other areas (e.g. finance, marketing, accounting).    The courses that contribute to this track have this symbol, MCT, next to the course title.     Career Preparation  All careers involve the management of individuals and groups. The management program is designed to provide students with both practical skills and an understanding of the underlying theory that will make you an effective individual contributor and manager. You will learn to view the business as a whole, to evaluate the overall needs of an organization (for-profit, and not-for-profit and government) and to define supporting objectives. You will develop an outlook that enables you to perceive and anticipate opportunities to innovate and the need for change.    As management always involves people, courses present the most recent theories concerned with human behavior along with current practices that affect and influence behavior in work organizations. The management course program complements the more specialized focus that necessarily characterizes courses in other functional areas. It helps students prepare and succeed in a managerial career that leverages but is not limited to a functional specialization.     Management Concentration Requirements (12 units)  Students who decide to concentrate in management will take four courses (12 units) in advanced management electives after completing the required core course Management and Organizations MGMT-UB 1. Some multidisciplinary (MULT-UB) courses have also been approved to count toward fulfilling management concentration requirements.    Students pursuing a concentration in management and organizations should consult with their adviser in the Stern Office of Academic Advising by the end of sophomore year to ensure that course distribution requirements are being met and to formally declare the management concentration. The Department of Management and Organizations undergraduate faculty adviser is always available to advise you on which management courses best fulfill your objectives.
