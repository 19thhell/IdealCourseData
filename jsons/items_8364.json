Once an FMLN radio announcer, he broke ranks when he became disillusioned with their ideology. Guadalupe lost her parents, husband, and a son in the war. With seven children left to raise on her own, she nonetheless supports the actions of the FMLN, and believes in the cause which took the lives of so many of her loved ones. Angel, formerly an FMLN guerrilla, was a mortal enemy of Nicolas, who was a policeman during the conflict. Now they are both members of the National Civil Police - and friends. Miguel and Vitelio are war orphans, trying to reconstruct a semblance of family life. And Francisco is a happy to lucky bus ticket collector whose primary interests are women and Hollywood. As the film presents the lives of Salvadorans today, it also questions the stability of the calm and asks whether the foundations of the peace accord - controlling delinquency, meting justice, redistributing land, and fighting poverty - will ever be realized. Seven Dreams of Peace is a hopeful and troubling look at the legacy of the war in El Salvador.

PHYSICAL FEATURES: 1 videocassette (53 min.) : sd., b&amp;w ; 1/2 in.  Call Number: VCA 1440  Summary: This &quot;film editorial&quot; reviews U.S. relations with Latin America in general and with Cuba and Venezuela in particular in the early 1960&#39;s. At a meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS) in San Jose, Costa Rica, the U.S. uses its influence to expel Cuba from the meeting and sponsors the Declaration of San Jose, condemning Sino-Soviet intervention in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere and the shipment of Soviet missiles to Cuba. Venezuelan foreign minister Arcaya sides with Cuba at the meeting and is subsequently removed from office by Venezuelan president Betancourt. This action spurs big anti-American protests in Caracas. The film then looks at the general dire poverty that prevails throughout Latin American and suggests that such poverty helps foster anti-American feeling in the region. Finally the film turns to Cuba, where we see people whose lives are being changed by Castro&#39;s regime, and also Castro addressing a protest rally of over one million people. The Declaration of Havana was made at this meeting, denouncing the Declaration of San Jose.

NO DIALOGUE  Call Number: ON ORDER  Summary: With layers of hallunications and no dialogue, Orinoko narrates the Spanish and English explorations of the Orinoko river and the quest for El dorado, the first by Columbus, and subsequently by Alexander Von Humboldt. These explorers encounter and initiate the destruction of the indegenious communities they meet. With magnificant photography and haunting sound track, the film captures the first explorer&#39;s phantasmagoric experience. The film begins before the encounter with the stunning sequence of an Anerindian tribe going about their daily activities. Each shot means meant to distance disorient the viewers, compelling us to decipher each action, much as the conquistadors may have done. When the European characters make their appearance on the Orinoco, they are filmed in an equally opaque manner. No word is spoken; it is a silent adventure, except for the strange and ominous sounds of the jungle. Viewers are not encouraged to identify with these strange , rather bizarre yet solorful individuals. Toward the end of the film, it becomes clear that the entire experience of the Europeans has been filmed from the point of a Yanomami shaman in a drug induced trance.

Mexicans on the other side, however, face endless barriers of barbed wire, attack dogs, and armed border patrols. They wait for nightfall to attempt crossings, to live or simply in search of a day&#39;s work. Alex Webb captures the odd panorama of border - comical peddlers making deals with amused tourists, U.S. servicemen in search of tequila, and Mexicans furtively looking to get stateside. Many are caught, ,but they merely try to cross again when released. The border is a constant flurry of activity which represents different things to different people - depending on which side you are on.

LE CRI DES SANS VISAGE (YA BASTA! THE BATTLE CRY OF THE FACELESS)  AUTHOR: Thierry Zeno  IMPRINT: New York, NY : First Run/Icarus Films, 1997  PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: 1 videocassette (50 min.)  Call Number: VCA 7913  Summary: In Mexico on January 1, 1994, Indians of Mayan origin staged an armed take-over of several Chiapas municipalities. But the Zapatista Army of National Liberation did not wish to seize power; rather it demanded land, work, housing, education, healthcare, food, justice, independence, freedom and democracy. The Indians&#39; spokesman and head of military operations, Sub-commander Marcos, is not an Indian. He has been able to rally public opinion on the Indians&#39; tragic living conditions. Now a war of words has replaced the armed struggle. The Zapatista movement&#39;s cause echoes worldwide but the lives of the Indians today in the mountains and the jungles of Chiapas are no less precarious than before. In this documentary if is the Indian men and women who speak, re-situating their struggle in its human, cultural and historical context.      TITLE: YANKI NO! [videorecording]  AUTHOR: Drew, Robert (Co-produced by Time, Inc. and ABC-TV)  IMPRINT: Los Angeles, Calif. : Direct Cinema LTD., c1960.  PHYSICAL FEATURES: 1 videocassette (53 min.) : sd., b&amp;w ; 1/2 in.  Call Number: VCA 1440  Summary: This &quot;film editorial&quot; reviews U.S. relations with Latin America in general and with Cuba and Venezuela in particular in the early 1960&#39;s. At a meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS) in San Jose, Costa Rica, the U.S. uses its influence to expel Cuba from the meeting and sponsors the Declaration of San Jose, condemning Sino-Soviet intervention in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere and the shipment of Soviet missiles to Cuba. Venezuelan foreign minister Arcaya sides with Cuba at the meeting and is subsequently removed from office by Venezuelan president Betancourt. This action spurs big anti-American protests in Caracas. The film then looks at the general dire poverty that prevails throughout Latin American and suggests that such poverty helps foster anti-American feeling in the region. Finally the film turns to Cuba, where we see people whose lives are being changed by Castro&#39;s regime, and also Castro addressing a protest rally of over one million people. The Declaration of Havana was made at this meeting, denouncing the Declaration of San Jose.

FAQ's for Incoming Students    Who is my academic advisor? Can it be any faculty member?   Your primary academic advisors are the Center\u2019s Director, Clinical Associate Professor Pamela Calla, and the Faculty Fellow Professors Edgardo P\u00e9rez Morales and Katherine Smith. You should meet with your advisor twice persemester, and for registration advisement. You are encouraged to establish contacts with other faculty working in the area of their interests, particularly other CLACS faculty, as these professors could serve both as additional advisors or as readers for your Master\u2019s Project.      How do I find professors who are working in my area of interest?   Your academic advisor should be able to suggest relevant faculty; be sure to ask them during your advisement sessions. You should also consult our affiliated faculty listing, which includes brief biographies of most faculty at NYU working on issues related to Latin America and the Caribbean. Check Albert and relevant department websites for graduate course listings to find faculty teaching in your areas of interest.      I want to take a class in another department. What do I do?   Many graduate seminars require the instructor\u2019s or department\u2019s permission to register, and this is usually noted in Albert on the Department\u2019s graduate course listings. Some seminars are restricted to PhD students or students in that department, and will not be open to you. However, many seminars welcome and are designed for MA students. You may be asked to contact the Professor directly, or contact the Department. If approved, they will give you an access code that will enable you to register.      What if I am not sure whether a class really interests me? Should I register anyway? Because space is often limited in seminars, we recommend that you register for your first choice classes prior to the start of the term. However, it is expected that students will attend the first class and then decide whether they want to stay in the seminar. You may also contact the professors and sit in on the first class without registering for it. The last day to add a class without late fees is the end of the 2nd week of classes. For a full refund schedule for dropping a class, please visit the Bursar\u2019s website.       How can I take classes at Columbia? Can I take whatever I want?
