Students will come to understand how technological innovation, regulatory bodies, advertisers, network heads, creative producers, audiences have interacted with economic, social, & political forces to shape television over time.

From spaces of work to spaces of leisure, screens are sites for collaboration, performance, surveillance, & resistance. This course traces the cultural history of screens from a range of forms - from the panorama to the cinema, from the radar system to the television, & from the terminal to the mobile device - to provide a way of thinking about the development of the screen as simultaneously architectural, material, representational & computational.

Every week, we discuss its current events, will hear from people currently working in the industry, examine case studies, & discuss overall business landscapes. Central to each class is the notion that practical business considerations & the design-driven creative process do not have to be in opposition. True creative independence hinges on the well-informed & critical understanding of the building blocks that make up the economic context in which games industry professionals operate.

Students will think through political & symbolic borders & their material & immaterial formations. Readings which draw on examples from across the world will be included throughout the course. The course will culminate with a trip to Israel/Palestine.

In recent photographic anthologies, historical texts, tourist guidebooks, memoirs, novels, as well as in documentary & fictional films, such visual material prior to the partition of Palestine has played an important role in the battle over representation. In context of partition & displacement, we will argue, dominant & counter media also play in defining national identity & communal belonging.

Emphasis will be given on how space socially organizes human meaning & on the ?inscription? of space. How do people, through, their practices & their being in the world, form relationships with the locales they occupy (both the natural world & the build environment)? How do they attach meanings to spaces to create places? & how do the experiences of inhabiting viewing & hearing those places shape their meanings, communicative practices, cultural performance memories & habits? Course themes include; mapping & the imagination; vision & space, soundscape, architecture & landscape; new media & space/time compression; space & identity; spatial violence; spatialization of memory.

The purpose of this doctoral course, \u201cSpecial Topics in Critical Theory: Marx,\u201d is to read key works by Marx, supplemented by some contemporary texts in western Marxist political theory, with the ultimate goal of understanding the various political & philosophical debates with which these texts engage. The course emphasizes Marxism as as a political theory, but will also address Marxism as a scholarly methodology for critique applicable to disciplines beyond political theory. Some attention is given to the so-called cultural turn in twentieth-century Marxist thought, including Marx's influence on feminism, identity, representation, & visual culture. Themes include: the commodity, alienation & reification, surplus value, ideology, consumerism, subjectivity, postfordism, community, & communism.

More particularly, the course will consider the ways that the modern category \u201cinformation\u201d has emerged in relation to different media & different genres. What are the social, material, institutional, & semantic conditions that have worked to align communication with truth or authenticity? What routes can be discerned between a history of media & a history of objectivity? Significant attention will be paid to the elaboration of key terms & concepts as well as to different disciplinary & interdisciplinary resources that shape such an inquiry.

We begin with an overview of cybernetics, information theory, systems theory, distributed communications networks, & theories of postmodernity. Next, we examine the rise of immaterial labor in the service economies & the extension of codified labor practices into the realm of daily life. The seminar will also consider the ramifications of informatic capture & the formation of coded objects & bodies. Finally, we explore networked struggle &, through it, a political theory of the present moment. The course will favor both close readings of specific technologies as well as social & cultural claims about the information age.

This class offers a counterpoint by examining the legacies of these experiences in visual & cultural studies. It suggests a different history of the present than is usually told, with particular regard to visuality in film, art & performance. Each participant will undertake a research project using materials in the Tamiment Library (& elsewhere if needed) & will present the results in a mini-conference at the end of the semester.

From e-mail to texting, from online gaming to online banking, from You Tube to Hulu, from DoS attacks to Second Life sit-ins, nearly every traditional aspect of our lives has found a new expression in its digital proxy. In order to understand the cultural, social, political & economic consequences of this development, we must look to the origins of today\u2019s cyberculture, in the futuristic visions (both dystonian & utopian) that shaped the development of today\u2019s networked technologies. We will trace the genealogy of these visions, as they developed in tandem with the growing digital communications infrastructure over the past three quarters of a century, & evolved into new forms that even the most forward-thinking of visionaries could not have predicted. Ultimately, one can argue the the Internet has both exceeded & fallen short of the hype that surrounded its birth & development, & by comparing the myth to the reality, we may better understand what aspects of the human condition are likely to persist regardless of technological development.

We will examine a range of forms of mediated production & consumption understood broadly in relation to political, economic, & cultural power, & situate these forms in relation to contemporary theorizing about global cultural convergence, divergence, & hybridity.      Course Page               40    4            MCC-GE 2381            Topics in Globalization: Global Consumer Culture           Consumer culture by its nature is intensely local & inevitably global. Its locality is tied up with the intimacy of food, clothing, & shelter, & the elasticity of the relationship between bodies & things, between needs & desires, yet its meanings & messages are globally circulated & produced. This course explores critical approaches to the globalization of consumer culture by examining how bodies & things shape each other through long histories (colonial, postcolonial, global) of production, distribution, & fashion. Students will study the social world of global consumers as an analytic entry point into the complex networks of cultural practice which mediate the perennial tension between habituation & novelty.

Focuses on case studies of the supranational regional players in some of the most important geo-linguistic world markets, where the tensions between global/transnational media flows & local interests are most evident, engaging with theoretical positions ranging from critiques of the homogenizing effects of globalization to those that affirm the changing power relations of counter-flows based on audience preferences.

It looks in particular at the way media genres travel & how their circulation raises issues about the cultural power of certain media narratives in specific historical, political & social conditions of consumption. We will examine the battle for national, regional, & global media markets as a struggle for the \u2018legitimate\u2019 cultural & political view of the world expressed through information (news), scientific discourse (documentaries), & popular culture (films, tele novels, reality television, music) to understand the complex global flow of television programs & films.
