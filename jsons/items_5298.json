Welcome to NYU's swing society! Come join us for lessons every Wednesday in Kimmel room 606. Beginner's lessons will be held from 6PM to 7PM, and the advanced lesson is from 7PM to 8PM.    We got some real good swing dancers from the society to teach the beginner's lesson, but we got some awesome professional teachers for the awesome advanced class, which is awesome, so you should totally take that too.    Also every Thursday we go to this awesome swing party called Frim Fram Jam, where they sometimes do the Shim Sham. It's at Club 412 (412 Eighth Avenue, 4th Floor) from 9PM to 1AM. We meet at the NYU Starbucks at 8:45 p.m. Bring your metro card and student ID to get in for $5!"}]}]
