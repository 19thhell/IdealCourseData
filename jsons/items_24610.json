The Courant Institute at New York University has a world-leading reputation in applied mathematics and scientific computation and the placement of the Center within the Courant Institute provides a unique platform for interdisciplinary research at the highest level. Of great importance is the fact that faculty in CAOS are active members of the international science community in all of the scientific disciplines intersecting with the mission of the Center.    Approval for the CAOS Ph.D. program was sought in part because it was felt that such a program would aid a crucial need in the AOS research community: the paucity of quality students entering AOS graduate education and research noted recently by Vali et al., 2002. A quote from that report states the issue clearly:    \"Participants in the 1999 UCAR Forum on the future of the atmospheric sciences confirmed that there is a serious problem regarding the quantity and quality of students entering the atmospheric and related sciences (including oceanography, space science, and earth science). In a subsequent UCAR survey on broad topics, conducted during June and July of 2000, we received more comments on the quantity and quality of graduate students than on any other issue. [...] Apparently many university departments around the world are experiencing similar difficulties recruiting highly skilled students in the environmental sciences. [...] Anecdotal evidence suggests that this decline has led to increased competition nationally for good students, a shortfall of graduate students to assist in teaching, and a smaller pool of students to contribute to the university research efforts. If the decrease is truly widespread and persistent, the number of Ph.D. graduates could be insufficient to meet national needs in the near future.[...] The [earth science] community may face a significant shortfall in Ph.D.s by the year 2011.\"    The importance of climate research is universally acknowledged because the success of this research enterprise has potential impact on all life on our planet. Pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the immensely complicated climate processes that occur and interact over vastly different length and time scales is crucial for reducing the uncertainty in much needed climate forecasts. Despite this well recognized and documented need, recruitment of high-caliber graduate students and researchers into this field has been difficult. Basically, students with exceptional mathematical and computational ability are often drawn to other fields before they become aware of the possibilities in atmosphere ocean science.    Our unique PhD program combines rigorous mathematical course work with disciplinary research in atmosphere ocean science. It is an exceptionally popular and highly selective program that can admit only about 10% of applicants. This is a clear indication of the pressing need for interdisciplinary graduate education of this type. By drawing students from new pools of talent, our program seeks to be a significant channel for the recruitment and training of top-class students into the important and highly interdisciplinary fields of atmosphere, ocean, and polar science.    The distinct focus of the program complements local area institutions - Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University - whose members participate in the CAOS colloquium and in collaborative research. These programs are focusing on more applied aspects of AOS modeling, such as data assimilation into global climate models, and have a somewhat different student audience. In addition, program faculty have research connections with such institutions as the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Rockefeller University, the Goddard Space Flight Center, and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research."}]},

The Courant Institute at New York University has a world-leading reputation in applied mathematics and scientific computation and the placement of the Center within the Courant Institute provides a unique platform for interdisciplinary research at the highest level. Of great importance is the fact that faculty in CAOS are active members of the international science community in all of the scientific disciplines intersecting with the mission of the Center.    Approval for the CAOS Ph.D. program was sought in part because it was felt that such a program would aid a crucial need in the AOS research community: the paucity of quality students entering AOS graduate education and research noted recently by Vali et al., 2002. A quote from that report states the issue clearly:    \"Participants in the 1999 UCAR Forum on the future of the atmospheric sciences confirmed that there is a serious problem regarding the quantity and quality of students entering the atmospheric and related sciences (including oceanography, space science, and earth science). In a subsequent UCAR survey on broad topics, conducted during June and July of 2000, we received more comments on the quantity and quality of graduate students than on any other issue. [...] Apparently many university departments around the world are experiencing similar difficulties recruiting highly skilled students in the environmental sciences. [...] Anecdotal evidence suggests that this decline has led to increased competition nationally for good students, a shortfall of graduate students to assist in teaching, and a smaller pool of students to contribute to the university research efforts. If the decrease is truly widespread and persistent, the number of Ph.D. graduates could be insufficient to meet national needs in the near future.[...] The [earth science] community may face a significant shortfall in Ph.D.s by the year 2011.\"    The importance of climate research is universally acknowledged because the success of this research enterprise has potential impact on all life on our planet. Pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the immensely complicated climate processes that occur and interact over vastly different length and time scales is crucial for reducing the uncertainty in much needed climate forecasts. Despite this well recognized and documented need, recruitment of high-caliber graduate students and researchers into this field has been difficult. Basically, students with exceptional mathematical and computational ability are often drawn to other fields before they become aware of the possibilities in atmosphere ocean science.    Our unique PhD program combines rigorous mathematical course work with disciplinary research in atmosphere ocean science. It is an exceptionally popular and highly selective program that can admit only about 10% of applicants. This is a clear indication of the pressing need for interdisciplinary graduate education of this type. By drawing students from new pools of talent, our program seeks to be a significant channel for the recruitment and training of top-class students into the important and highly interdisciplinary fields of atmosphere, ocean, and polar science.    The distinct focus of the program complements local area institutions - Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University - whose members participate in the CAOS colloquium and in collaborative research. These programs are focusing on more applied aspects of AOS modeling, such as data assimilation into global climate models, and have a somewhat different student audience.

The Courant Institute at New York University has a world-leading reputation in applied mathematics and scientific computation and the placement of the Center within the Courant Institute provides a unique platform for interdisciplinary research at the highest level. Of great importance is the fact that faculty in CAOS are active members of the international science community in all of the scientific disciplines intersecting with the mission of the Center.    Approval for the CAOS Ph.D. program was sought in part because it was felt that such a program would aid a crucial need in the AOS research community: the paucity of quality students entering AOS graduate education and research noted recently by Vali et al., 2002. A quote from that report states the issue clearly:    \"Participants in the 1999 UCAR Forum on the future of the atmospheric sciences confirmed that there is a serious problem regarding the quantity and quality of students entering the atmospheric and related sciences (including oceanography, space science, and earth science). In a subsequent UCAR survey on broad topics, conducted during June and July of 2000, we received more comments on the quantity and quality of graduate students than on any other issue. [...] Apparently many university departments around the world are experiencing similar difficulties recruiting highly skilled students in the environmental sciences. [...] Anecdotal evidence suggests that this decline has led to increased competition nationally for good students, a shortfall of graduate students to assist in teaching, and a smaller pool of students to contribute to the university research efforts. If the decrease is truly widespread and persistent, the number of Ph.D. graduates could be insufficient to meet national needs in the near future.[...] The [earth science] community may face a significant shortfall in Ph.D.s by the year 2011.\"    The importance of climate research is universally acknowledged because the success of this research enterprise has potential impact on all life on our planet. Pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the immensely complicated climate processes that occur and interact over vastly different length and time scales is crucial for reducing the uncertainty in much needed climate forecasts. Despite this well recognized and documented need, recruitment of high-caliber graduate students and researchers into this field has been difficult. Basically, students with exceptional mathematical and computational ability are often drawn to other fields before they become aware of the possibilities in atmosphere ocean science.    Our unique PhD program combines rigorous mathematical course work with disciplinary research in atmosphere ocean science. It is an exceptionally popular and highly selective program that can admit only about 10% of applicants. This is a clear indication of the pressing need for interdisciplinary graduate education of this type. By drawing students from new pools of talent, our program seeks to be a significant channel for the recruitment and training of top-class students into the important and highly interdisciplinary fields of atmosphere, ocean, and polar science.    The distinct focus of the program complements local area institutions - Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University - whose members participate in the CAOS colloquium and in collaborative research. These programs are focusing on more applied aspects of AOS modeling, such as data assimilation into global climate models, and have a somewhat different student audience. In addition, program faculty have research connections with such institutions as the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Rockefeller University, the Goddard Space Flight Center, and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research."}, {"content": "Philosophy of Education - Humanities and Social Sciences in the Professions - NYU Steinhardt                                          Skip to content        NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and    Human Development           apply now     request info     contact                                     Department of Humanities and Social Sciences in the Professions              About           Programs         Applied Statistics     Education and Jewish Studies     Education and Social Policy     Education Studies     History of Education     Interdepartmental Research Studies     International Education     Philosophy of Education     Sociology of Education     Minor in Global and Urban Education Studies               People         Faculty     Staff     Students     Alumni               Admissions           Research          Center for the Promotion of Research Involving Innovative Statistical Methodology      Commission on Gender, Race and Social Justice      Institute for Education and Social Policy      Multinational Institute of American Studies      Faculty Research Interests               FAQ           News           Events                   Philosophy of Education               Global Programs                About the Philosophy of Education Program    Study in the Philosophy of Education Program is oriented toward a critical understanding of broad conceptual and normative issues in education and the human service professions. Course offerings apply traditional humanistic modes of inquiry to the professions, focusing on philosophical questions not raised in specialized departments and programs. Graduate students take general courses in philosophy of education as well as topical courses that focus on special issues and literatures.    The Master of Arts program in philosophy of education offers students an overview of philosophical issues as they pertain to education and the other human service fields represented in the School of Education. Course work examines theories of society, morality, and knowledge as they relate to education and allied fields. Classes focus on topics such as the role of values in education; philosophies of science and applied science; feminist philosophies and their relevance to education and the human services; 20th-century philosophic movements; and ideas of nature.    In addition to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in philosophy of education, the program offers a master's degree in environmental conservation education that emphasizes the social, philosophical, and historical background of environmental issues. Interested students should consult the description for that program.    Career Opportunities    The master's degree program in philosophy of education prepares students to teach in humanities and social studies programs in secondary schools and colleges. The Ph.D. degree program in philosophy of education prepares professors and teachers of philosophy of education for college- and university-level positions.    Degree/Course Requirements for Master of Arts    The 36-point program includes the following requirements: Philosophy of Education (18 points); Courses Outside Philosophy of Education (12 points); Tutorial Study for Writing a Final Integrating Paper (6 points)    Degree/Course Requirements for Doctor of Philosophy    The doctoral program in philosophy of education requires students to complete 88 points beyond the bachelor's degree and to have sufficient background to pursue independent study on philosophical problems and an orientation towards philosophic questions raised by the educational and human service professions.    The Ph.D. requirements include the following: Foundations of Education and Core Courses in the Philosophy of Education (15 points); Graduate Work in the Department of Philosophy of the Graduate School of Arts and Science (16 points); Specialty Courses in Philosophy of Education (18 points); History of Education (9 points); Research Dissertation, and Proposal Seminars (18 points); Electives (12 points).    Fulfillment of doctoral requirements may include a successfully completed 36-point master's degree program in philosophy of education.    Special Admission Requirements    *Please note that we are not currently accepting applications for either the M.A. or Ph.D. program in Philosophy of Education.* In addition to the general admission requirements, the M.A. program requires a written sample on a philosophic topic; the Ph.D. program requires a bachelor's degree in philosophy or its equivalent and a written sample on a philosophic topic.
