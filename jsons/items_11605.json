Nowhere is food more politically and culturally charged than in NYC, so the city is also our classroom. We negotiate the porous yet enduring boundaries of race and culture as often as we eat, walk or shop in Little Italy or Little India, Koreatown or Chinatown, Le Petite Senegal or Harlem. None of these places or cuisines is in any way associated with contemporary American food culture, which has historically harkened to preserving what is &quot;authentically&quot; American. These differences can be understood as forms of exclusion as well as cultural preservation\u2014but either way they are lines of demarcation that make legible forms of power.

It also has new Preface and a new Afterword, in which Nestle brings Food Politics up to date.     \u201cWhen Food Politics was first published, a decade ago, I remember thinking that the marriage of those two words-food and politics seemed surprising, even radical. What was political about food? Everything, it turns out. But we didn't really know that then. Now, thanks to this book and all the work it has inspired, the words food and politics have become inseparable.\u201d --Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma , Food Rules , and recently, Cooked .     During the time since Food Politics was first published, the U.S. Hispanic population has grown by over 40 percent, accounting for more than half of the growth in the total population of the U.S., at a rate four times that of the population overall. This changing demographic has also given a rise to a new generation of Latino chefs, who bring the cuisine of their native countries to the forefront of the American palette.     \u201cThe Latino culinary influence is being felt everywhere, and it is new, innovative, and exciting,\u201d said Clark Wolf, founder and President of Clark Wolf Company. \u201cFor the first time, a Latin foods cookbook, Gran Cocina Latina: The Food of Latin America , by Maricel Presilla, has been honored with the prestigious James Beard\u2019s Cookbook of the Year Award for 2012, a fitting tribute to Latino peoples and their cuisine,\u201d he said.     The panelists include:       Corby Kummer, Senior Editor, The Atlantic   Marion Nestle Author and Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition in the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at NYU Steinhardt; Professor of Sociology at NYU; and Visiting Professor of Nutritional Sciences at Cornell   Maricel Presilla Chef, Author of Gran Cocina Latina: The Food of Latin America Named 2012 Cookbook of the Year by the James Beard Foundation   Katy Sparks, Chef and Owner of Katy Sparks Culinary Consulting   Host: Clark Wolf, food and restaurant consultant. Wolf has more than thirty years of experience in the food industry and is founder and President of Clark Wolf Company, a New York-based food and restaurant consulting firm.

About Fales Library and Special Collections:   The Fales Library, comprising nearly 355,000 volumes, and over 10,000 linear feet of archive and manuscript materials, houses the Fales Collection of rare books and manuscripts in English and American literature, the Downtown Collection, the Food and Cookery Collection and the general Special Collections of the NYU Libraries. The Fales Collection was given to NYU in 1957 by DeCoursey Fales in memory of his father, Haliburton Fales. It is especially strong in English literature from the middle of the 18th century to the present, documenting developments in the novel. The Downtown Collection documents the downtown New York art, performance, and literary scenes from 1975 to the present and is extremely rich in archival holdings, including extensive film and video objects. The Food and Cookery Collection is a vast, and rapidly expanding collection of books and manuscripts documenting food and foodways with particular emphasis on New York City. Other strengths of the collection include the Berol Collection of Lewis Carroll Materials, the Robert Frost Library, the Kaplan and Rosenthal Collections of Judaica and Hebraica and the manuscript collections of Elizabeth Robins and Erich Maria Remarque. The Fales Library preserves manuscripts and original editions of books that are rare or important not only because of their texts, but also because of their value as artifacts.

We address these core concerns, in part, by engaging works of literature that examine the relationship between food and the expression of culture, history and trauma. Course texts may include novels like Nervous Conditions, Breath Eyes Memory, Beloved , and Black Boy . Nowhere is food more politically and culturally charged than in NYC, so the city is also our classroom. We negotiate the porous yet enduring boundaries of race and culture as often as we eat, walk or shop in Little Italy or Little India, Koreatown or Chinatown, Le Petite Senegal or Harlem. None of these places or cuisines is in any way associated with contemporary American food culture, which has historically harkened to preserving what is &quot;authentically&quot; American. These differences can be understood as forms of exclusion as well as cultural preservation\u2014but either way they are lines of demarcation that make legible forms of power. We use a variety of texts to investigate dynamics of power represented in and by food. Who is food for? How does the representation of food reify and negotiate the boundaries of race and culture?

[Subways A,C,E, B,D,M to West 4th Street; 6 line to Astor Place; R train to 8th Street.]     Just as relevant today as when it was first published, Nestle\u2019s Food Politics, the Tenth Anniversary Edition , is out with a new Foreword by Michael Pollan. It also has new Preface and a new Afterword, in which Nestle brings Food Politics up to date.     \u201cWhen Food Politics was first published, a decade ago, I remember thinking that the marriage of those two words-food and politics seemed surprising, even radical. What was political about food? Everything, it turns out. But we didn't really know that then. Now, thanks to this book and all the work it has inspired, the words food and politics have become inseparable.\u201d --Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma , Food Rules , and recently, Cooked .     During the time since Food Politics was first published, the U.S. Hispanic population has grown by over 40 percent, accounting for more than half of the growth in the total population of the U.S., at a rate four times that of the population overall. This changing demographic has also given a rise to a new generation of Latino chefs, who bring the cuisine of their native countries to the forefront of the American palette.     \u201cThe Latino culinary influence is being felt everywhere, and it is new, innovative, and exciting,\u201d said Clark Wolf, founder and President of Clark Wolf Company. \u201cFor the first time, a Latin foods cookbook, Gran Cocina Latina: The Food of Latin America , by Maricel Presilla, has been honored with the prestigious James Beard\u2019s Cookbook of the Year Award for 2012, a fitting tribute to Latino peoples and their cuisine,\u201d he said.     The panelists include:       Corby Kummer, Senior Editor, The Atlantic   Marion Nestle Author and Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition in the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at NYU Steinhardt; Professor of Sociology at NYU; and Visiting Professor of Nutritional Sciences at Cornell   Maricel Presilla Chef, Author of Gran Cocina Latina: The Food of Latin America Named 2012 Cookbook of the Year by the James Beard Foundation   Katy Sparks, Chef and Owner of Katy Sparks Culinary Consulting   Host: Clark Wolf, food and restaurant consultant. Wolf has more than thirty years of experience in the food industry and is founder and President of Clark Wolf Company, a New York-based food and restaurant consulting firm.

About Fales Library and Special Collections:   The Fales Library, comprising nearly 355,000 volumes, and over 10,000 linear feet of archive and manuscript materials, houses the Fales Collection of rare books and manuscripts in English and American literature, the Downtown Collection, the Food and Cookery Collection and the general Special Collections of the NYU Libraries. The Fales Collection was given to NYU in 1957 by DeCoursey Fales in memory of his father, Haliburton Fales. It is especially strong in English literature from the middle of the 18th century to the present, documenting developments in the novel. The Downtown Collection documents the downtown New York art, performance, and literary scenes from 1975 to the present and is extremely rich in archival holdings, including extensive film and video objects. The Food and Cookery Collection is a vast, and rapidly expanding collection of books and manuscripts documenting food and foodways with particular emphasis on New York City. Other strengths of the collection include the Berol Collection of Lewis Carroll Materials, the Robert Frost Library, the Kaplan and Rosenthal Collections of Judaica and Hebraica and the manuscript collections of Elizabeth Robins and Erich Maria Remarque. The Fales Library preserves manuscripts and original editions of books that are rare or important not only because of their texts, but also because of their value as artifacts.

She is also Professor of Sociology at NYU and Visiting Professor of Nutritional Sciences at Cornell. She also holds an honorary degree from Transylvania University in Kentucky. She earned a Ph.D. in molecular biology and an M.P.H. in public health nutrition from the University of California, Berkeley. Previous faculty positions were at Brandeis University and the UCSF School of Medicine. From 1986-88, she was senior nutrition policy advisor in the Department of Health and Human Services and editor of The Surgeon General&rsquo;s Report on Nutrition and Health. Her research examines scientific and socioeconomic influences on food choice, obesity, and food safety, emphasizing the role of food marketing.   She is the author of five prize-winning books: Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health; Safe Food: The Politics of Food Safety; What to Eat; Why Calories Count: From Science to Politics (with Dr. Malden Nesheim); and Eat, Drink Vote: An Illustrated Guide to Food Politics. She also has written two books about pet food, Pet Food Politics: The Chihuahua in the Coal Mine and Feed Your Pet Right (also with Dr. Nesheim). Her most recent books were published in 2013: the tenth anniversary edition of Food Politics (with a foreword by Michael Pollan); the paperback edition of Why Calories Count; and Eat, Drink, Vote. Her next book, about food advocacy and the soda industry, will be published by Oxford University Press in September 2015.   From 2008 to 2013, she wrote a monthly Food Matters column for the San Francisco Chronicle food section. She blogs daily (almost) at www.foodpolitics.com , and twitters @marionnestle.   Among her recent honors are the John Dewey Award for Distinguished Public Service from Bard College in 2010. In 2011, the University of California School of Public Health at Berkeley named her as Public Health Hero, Time Magazine included her Twitter among its top 10 in health and science; Michael Pollan ranked her as the #2 most powerful foodie in America (after Michelle Obama), and Mark Bittman ranked her #1 in his list of foodies to be thankful for. She received the James Beard Leadership Award in 2013, and in 2014 the U.S. Healthful Food Council's Innovator of the Year Award and the Public Health Association of New York City's Media Award, among others.
