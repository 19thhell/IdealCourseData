Formal leadership training is introduced in the Lawyering Program during 1L year, and students are encouraged to take an Emotional Intelligence (EQ) Assessment that will help them determine and develop the skills they need to become effective leaders. For 2L and 3L students, we offer a variety of simulation courses, clinics, and seminars that involve collaborative learning and delve deeply into skills-based components. The Law School is also participating in the creation of a new advanced certificate program in leadership for select students in NYU professional schools.   In addition, the AnBryce Scholarship Program , Furman Public Policy Scholarship , Jacobson Leadership Program in Law and Business , and Root-Tilden-Kern Program offer scholarships t o students who demonstrate an aptitude for leadership.                     Leadership Seminars   The Law School offers many seminars that focus on the exercise of leadership, such as the Guarini Leadership in Government Service Seminar and the Law and Business of Corporate Transformation and Leadership course in collaboration with Stern.                   Boosting EQ   Recognizing that the secret ingredient for being an effective leader in business, law, and many other spheres may be emotional intelligence, often known as EQ, NYU Law has rolled out an emotional intelligence training program led by Vice Dean Jeannie Forrest.
