From classical antiquity to the present, education and theatre have shared common goals and uses. The Program in Educational Theatre at New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development consciously brings the two fields together &ndash; in the classroom, workshop, studio, and on the stage. Here, we develop new strategies in teaching and learning through drama. We encourage experimentation by students, faculty, and alumni in the creation and presentation of theatre for audiences of all ages. Staged productions become the laboratory for testing new ideas and methods, while program research disseminates these findings through books, articles, and plays that are published and performed throughout the world.    Programs of study lead to the bachelor of science, master of arts, doctor of philosophy, and doctor of education degrees. These programs provide comprehensive training in all aspects of educational theatre for careers in preschool through college and university teaching as well as for professional theatre for children.

Careers in Educational Theatre    Educational theatre offers exciting and rewarding careers that combine creative achievement with the genuine satisfactions of teaching. Graduates of our program are teachers of drama and theatre at preschools; elementary, junior and senior high schools; and colleges and universities. They hold positions in education departments in museums and art galleries. They are directors of drama and theatre for community centers, camp and recreation programs, and religious organizations. Others are successful performers, directors, playwrights, and producers of theatre for young audiences.    Notable alumni of the program include playwrights and filmmakers (John Patrick Shanley, Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize winner for Doubt and winner of the 1988 Academy Award for his script for the film Moonstruck and author of numerous plays produced off-Broadway), directors (Myrna Casas, director of her own prize-winning company in Puerto Rico), authors (Dr. Nellie McCaslin, prolific author of widely employed texts on drama for children), and numerous theatre professionals.       Admission Requirements    Specific admission requirements are listed in the description of each degree program. See also the general NYU admission section for more information.       Financial Aid Opportunities    The Educational Theatre Program frequently offers a number of teaching fellowships to graduate students qualified to teach courses in stagecraft, acting, or other undergraduate areas. Teaching fellows also supervise productions and prepare teaching guides and educational materials for the program's performances and dramatic activities. See also the general  Financial Aid section for NYU.       Special Opportunities    Each summer, the Program in Educational Theatre offers a  Graduate Study Abroad Program in Great Britain. Students may earn up to 12 graduate credits in a variety of intensive courses and field experiences conducted by leaders in British, Irish, and Scotish educational theatre. In the past they have included such notable authorities as Dorothy Heathcote, Cecily O'Neill, Rosemary Linnell, and Gavin Bolton, as well as representatives from the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre. Open to teachers, university students, recreation leaders, librarians, language and speech arts specialists, theatre directors, and actors, the summer program offers unique opportunities to work with elementary through high school age students in both formal and informal dramatic activities. Coursework spans play production for youth audiences, improvisation, pantomime, street theatre, playground activities, story dramatization, and role-playing.    Students may choose to enroll in Independent Study and Practicum in Educational Theatre in order to undertake internships and fieldwork throughout the city or to work with faculty members on special research or creative projects. With leading collections for research in the performing arts, New York City affords doctoral students excellent sources for projects and dissertation subjects.    We also offer a popular three-summer option with the opportunity to study in New York City, London and Dublin for those who can devote their summers to immersive experiences and intensive study.

Our curriculum is designed for the serious young musician who is seeking a program that fully integrates the study of voice with the study of acting. We are committed to the traditions of classically-based vocal training while at the same time allowing students to explore the demanding repertoire that is expected of professional singers in today's ever-expanding world of music theatre performance.    In addition to voice, acting and dance, as well as courses in music theatre repertoire and history, the core of our program's music theatre specialization training takes place through an intensive series of music theatre workshops. These workshops explore such critical areas as movement, speech, diction, song study, scene study, audition skills, and business skills - the essential \"tools of the trade\" that a young artist needs in order to pursue a professional career.    In addition to the work in classrooms and studios, the program offers performance opportunities in fully-staged productions under the guidance of professional directors, choreographers, conductors, musical directors, and designers. Our guest artists and faculty are drawn from New York's vibrant community of professional artists who count Broadway, off-Broadway, regional theatre and national tours among their credits.    Students specializing in Music Theatre make their New York \"debut\" in their final semester as they are presented to New York's agents, casting directors, directors, and producers in their graduation showcase - a revue designed to feature the work of each student and help them make their first professional contacts in the industry.    The Department's acclaimed programs of study in Music Business (B.M., M.A.), Music Technology (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Jazz (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Music Composition (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), and Music Education (B.M., M.A., Ph.D.) provide a rich and valuable array of elective courses for music performance majors that prepare them for an ever-changing music industry and musical climate. Undergraduate and graduate students also benefit from the extraordinary opportunities available through the diverse offerings of a major university in the cultural capital of the world, New York City.

Open to teachers, university students, recreation leaders, librarians, language and speech arts specialists, theatre directors, and actors, the summer program offers unique opportunities to work with elementary through high school age students in both formal and informal dramatic activities. Coursework spans play production for youth audiences, improvisation, pantomime, street theatre, playground activities, story dramatization, and role-playing.    Students may choose to enroll in Independent Study and Practicum in Educational Theatre in order to undertake internships and fieldwork throughout the city or to work with faculty members on special research or creative projects. With leading collections for research in the performing arts, New York City affords doctoral students excellent sources for projects and dissertation subjects.    We also offer a popular three-summer option with the opportunity to study in New York City, London and Dublin for those who can devote their summers to immersive experiences and intensive study.

Our curriculum is designed for the serious young musician who is seeking a program that fully integrates the study of voice with the study of acting. We are committed to the traditions of classically-based vocal training while at the same time allowing students to explore the demanding repertoire that is expected of professional singers in today's ever-expanding world of music theatre performance.    In addition to voice, acting and dance, as well as courses in music theatre repertoire and history, the core of our program's music theatre specialization training takes place through an intensive series of music theatre workshops. These workshops explore such critical areas as movement, speech, diction, song study, scene study, audition skills, and business skills - the essential \"tools of the trade\" that a young artist needs in order to pursue a professional career.    In addition to the work in classrooms and studios, the program offers performance opportunities in fully-staged productions under the guidance of professional directors, choreographers, conductors, musical directors, and designers. Our guest artists and faculty are drawn from New York's vibrant community of professional artists who count Broadway, off-Broadway, regional theatre and national tours among their credits.    Students specializing in Music Theatre make their New York \"debut\" in their final semester as they are presented to New York's agents, casting directors, directors, and producers in their graduation showcase - a revue designed to feature the work of each student and help them make their first professional contacts in the industry.    The Department's acclaimed programs of study in Music Business (B.M., M.A.), Music Technology (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Jazz (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Music Composition (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), and Music Education (B.M., M.A., Ph.D.) provide a rich and valuable array of elective courses for music performance majors that prepare them for an ever-changing music industry and musical climate. Undergraduate and graduate students also benefit from the extraordinary opportunities available through the diverse offerings of a major university in the cultural capital of the world, New York City.
