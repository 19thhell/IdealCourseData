Students majoring in music acquire skills in composition, technology, and performance, and they develop ways to consider music from a theoretical and historical perspective. The program offers students the opportunity to learn firsthand about a diverse range of traditional and popular musics spanning various cultures and styles. This is accomplished by drawing on the uniqueness of Abu Dhabi as a cosmopolitan city and an international hub, and by taking special advantage of its location next door to the thriving media scene of Dubai, as well as its close proximity to major regional music centers, including Istanbul, Beirut, Cairo, Delhi and Accra.     The goal is to help students of all skill levels develop their technical competencies and successfully engage with a broad range of musical ideas and creative expressions. Consistent with the NYUAD ethos a forward-thinking, decentered approach to music education, where all musical traditions are treated with equal value and significance is the hallmark of the program. Music students must go beyond simple, surface tolerance and appreciation for music cultures and instead recognize, promote, help create and sustain both local and global music as profound intercultural communication, and as a powerful tool for cultural fusion, hybridity and social aggregation.     In an interconnected and ever-changing society, music makers must develop the ability to articulate musical discourse and scholarship with practitioners of other disciplines. Resonating with the decentered approach to music apprenticeship, NYUAD Music majors are encouraged to make music in interdisciplinary contexts, cross-pollinating music with other art forms and fields of study, such as film, theater, new media, science and engineering, and exploring new areas of inquiry.     The strong programs at NYU in New York in music technology, music production, composition, performance, ethnomusicology, musicology, music business, music journalism and theory, are all accessible to students in Abu Dhabi through courses taught by affiliated faculty. Many of these subjects can also be explored at study abroad semesters spent in New York or other global sites. As a result, the major and concentration in Music may be excellent gateways for a wide variety of studies: those hoping to ultimately pursue graduate study in music and related fields in the Arts and Humanities; those hoping to pursue careers in the music, media, and culture industries; or for those pursuing any occupation that demands clear and original thinking, command of the written word, analytical skills, and creativity.                                                               Major in Music               The music major requires a minimum of 12 courses, and has two tracks:Artistic Practice and Music Studies. The courses offered by the music program are grouped into four disciplinary areas: Music Practice, Ethnomusicology/Musicology, Music Theory, and Music Technology. Different combinations of courses in the four disciplinary areas define the track for the major.                                                         Concentration               The concentration in Music is designed for students who want to explore music in combination with other fields taught at NYUAD, or who wish to sustain their involvement with music based on their music practice before coming to NYUAD.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project. Students may also elect to participate in a capstone project with other students majoring in the arts. Collaborating students work with a faculty member to define the overall goals of the group Capstone Project, as well as the goals of each participant.

Through bodily movement, intonation, and stress gesture can transcend the distinctions between normal speech, poetry, song, and dance. Gaining a deeper understanding of the multiple meanings of gesture in a variety of media across different cultures enables the student to approach fundamental means of human expression, and to learn to recognize constants in human communication within the myriad of culturally specific conventions of language, prosody, music, and dance.

This course analyzes what we understand as &ldquo;music.&rdquo; Drawing on music of different styles from all over the world, we will explore what constitutes musical meaning, how it is produced, and how music expresses feelings. Taking advantage of the multicultural nature of NYUAD, we will explore the cultural and universal mechanisms at play when we listen and understand music. A lab portion of the class guides students through basic musical elements such as notation systems, scales, and simple compositional techniques.

What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present. The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the laments and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict. Drawing on histories and philosophies of war, we will engage with issues related to propaganda, censorship, detention, internment, torture, heroism, sacrifice, bravery, justice, history, memory, and death and with reference to work by Homer, Thuclydides, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Tolstoy, Shostakovitch, Britten, Picasso, Dix, Mishima, Wiesel, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, and John Lennon, among others.

An assumption which this course will make and explore is that all situations in the real world have a musical potential. This potential is defined and realized by discovering, recording and mapping the many ways in which the physical reality of places are dynamic systems of significant acoustic patterns. This seminar will start with an introduction to mobile sound recording that explores sound as it travels through the air in acoustic space using varieties of microphones and space mapping techniques. The course will also explore using acoustic measurement technologies such as accelerometers and hydrophones to investigate how sound exists within structures, the sea and other types of fluids. This course will start out with a large group sound mapping project about Saadiyat Island and expand to other environments in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. In addition to the group project, students will also be required to develop their own unique soundscape works. The course will cover all aspects of environmental field recording, editing and presentation of the final results.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course views musical structures and constructs broadly, referencing phenomena from musics around the world. The bulk of the course is devoted to an exploration of melody, harmony, and counterpoint in the music of diatonic tonality through projects in directed composition and analysis. Repertoire is drawn from both &ldquo;classical&rdquo; (common practice period) music and more recent examples of tonality, including popular music. Regular reading and listening assignments place techniques in historical context and expose students to a wide range of musical examples. Weekly lab sections are devoted to skills in musicianship: listening, sight-singing, dictation, and basic keyboard skills. Students may be required to take MUSIC- AD 100 prior to MUSIC-AD 105 upon taking a placement examination. Please contact Instructor or Music Program Head for details.    Students in the NYUNY Music Dept: This course is equivalent to MUSIC-UA 20 Elements of Music; Students wishing to substitute MUSIC-AD 105 for MUSIC-UA 201 Harmony and Counterpoint 1 must sit a diagnostic exam in New York.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region. Focusing on issues of gender, religion and nation, the course pays particular attention to the development of the Maqam system, ritual practices of religious minorities, and the popular musical styles that mobilize social movements.

Depending on the experience and expertise of the instructor, the course might focus on Bach fugues, Mozart opera, Schoenberg&rsquo;s piano music, or the development of electro-acoustic music. While the focus is on issues of how these works create effects, and resultant questions of meaning, we also look at sociological and political issues.    *This course is no longer being offered.

Students of various skill sets gain the necessary footing to develop/envision themselves as music practitioners/makers in a changing global landscape, as we endeavor to focus on cosmopolitan music practices that draw on the uniqueness of the U.A.E. as a global site. Students work in creative music projects involving original writing/composition, recording, and performance. The course additionally has a historical scope in which students consider how these practices have been addressed at different key moments in history and differed according to national and regional contexts.

Beginning with music in the myths and ancient histories of Sumeria, Egypt, and Greece, the seminar concludes with an examination of music and musical production within emerging global and transnational networks of power, where new technologies of mediation are radically re-orchestrating our engagement with sound and the world. Within the broad scope of this overview, we will examine the historical repertoire that has come to be known as &quot;classical music.&quot; The course explores the idea of a permanent canon of musical masterworks, which as a nineteenth-century invention, expanded gradually to include much earlier music as it became increasingly known. The course is not limited to the European musical tradition and canon but also examines non-Western musical traditions in the Middle East, India, and Asia, which grew out of a complex confluence of established practices.

This course surveys a variety of musics, with a particular emphasis on careful listening and aural analysis. Assigned readings help to contextualize and problematize the listening, shedding light on musical preconceptions and biases. Each student chooses from a diverse array of research topics early in the semester, preparing for a substantial presentation during the final weeks of class.

Students develop artistic collaborative projects involving sound, movement, digital video, lighting, interaction technologies, and telematics, which are presented publicly at the end of the semester. This course requires no skills and is open to anyone willing to establish a collaborative project involving different art forms and other domains.    * Note: The former title of this course was &#39;Collaborating in the Digital Domain&#39;.

MUSIC-AD 260 Intro to Maqam &amp; Usul: Modality, Rhythm &amp; Improvisation in the Art Music of the ME                                                                                                    The central tradition of Middle East art music was based in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul, where it achieved its mature form from the early 18th until the beginning of the 20th century, and interacted with the music of major cities such as Aleppo, Baghdad and Cairo, as well as the music of the Byzantine church. This course presents the development of maqam (mode) as both theory and practice, based on classical texts, compositions from the 17th until the 20th centuries, and the music of modern masters, since the advent of sound recording. The principal focus will be on the analysis of 1) modality, intonation and modulation, 2) relations of melody and rhythm (usul) in compositions, 3) non-metrical improvisation (taksim).    *Note: Prerequiste- reading ability of musical notation.    * This course is no longer being offered.

Students majoring in music acquire skills in composition, technology, and performance, and they develop ways to consider music from a theoretical and historical perspective. The program offers students the opportunity to learn firsthand about a diverse range of traditional and popular musics spanning various cultures and styles. This is accomplished by drawing on the uniqueness of Abu Dhabi as a cosmopolitan city and an international hub, and by taking special advantage of its location next door to the thriving media scene of Dubai, as well as its close proximity to major regional music centers, including Istanbul, Beirut, Cairo, Delhi and Accra.     The goal is to help students of all skill levels develop their technical competencies and successfully engage with a broad range of musical ideas and creative expressions. Consistent with the NYUAD ethos a forward-thinking, decentered approach to music education, where all musical traditions are treated with equal value and significance is the hallmark of the program. Music students must go beyond simple, surface tolerance and appreciation for music cultures and instead recognize, promote, help create and sustain both local and global music as profound intercultural communication, and as a powerful tool for cultural fusion, hybridity and social aggregation.     In an interconnected and ever-changing society, music makers must develop the ability to articulate musical discourse and scholarship with practitioners of other disciplines. Resonating with the decentered approach to music apprenticeship, NYUAD Music majors are encouraged to make music in interdisciplinary contexts, cross-pollinating music with other art forms and fields of study, such as film, theater, new media, science and engineering, and exploring new areas of inquiry.     The strong programs at NYU in New York in music technology, music production, composition, performance, ethnomusicology, musicology, music business, music journalism and theory, are all accessible to students in Abu Dhabi through courses taught by affiliated faculty. Many of these subjects can also be explored at study abroad semesters spent in New York or other global sites. As a result, the major and concentration in Music may be excellent gateways for a wide variety of studies: those hoping to ultimately pursue graduate study in music and related fields in the Arts and Humanities; those hoping to pursue careers in the music, media, and culture industries; or for those pursuing any occupation that demands clear and original thinking, command of the written word, analytical skills, and creativity.                                                               Major in Music               The music major requires a minimum of 12 courses, and has two tracks:Artistic Practice and Music Studies. The courses offered by the music program are grouped into four disciplinary areas: Music Practice, Ethnomusicology/Musicology, Music Theory, and Music Technology. Different combinations of courses in the four disciplinary areas define the track for the major.                                                         Concentration               The concentration in Music is designed for students who want to explore music in combination with other fields taught at NYUAD, or who wish to sustain their involvement with music based on their music practice before coming to NYUAD.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project. Students may also elect to participate in a capstone project with other students majoring in the arts. Collaborating students work with a faculty member to define the overall goals of the group Capstone Project, as well as the goals of each participant.

Through bodily movement, intonation, and stress gesture can transcend the distinctions between normal speech, poetry, song, and dance. Gaining a deeper understanding of the multiple meanings of gesture in a variety of media across different cultures enables the student to approach fundamental means of human expression, and to learn to recognize constants in human communication within the myriad of culturally specific conventions of language, prosody, music, and dance.

This course analyzes what we understand as &ldquo;music.&rdquo; Drawing on music of different styles from all over the world, we will explore what constitutes musical meaning, how it is produced, and how music expresses feelings. Taking advantage of the multicultural nature of NYUAD, we will explore the cultural and universal mechanisms at play when we listen and understand music. A lab portion of the class guides students through basic musical elements such as notation systems, scales, and simple compositional techniques.

What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present. The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the laments and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict. Drawing on histories and philosophies of war, we will engage with issues related to propaganda, censorship, detention, internment, torture, heroism, sacrifice, bravery, justice, history, memory, and death and with reference to work by Homer, Thuclydides, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Tolstoy, Shostakovitch, Britten, Picasso, Dix, Mishima, Wiesel, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, and John Lennon, among others.

An assumption which this course will make and explore is that all situations in the real world have a musical potential. This potential is defined and realized by discovering, recording and mapping the many ways in which the physical reality of places are dynamic systems of significant acoustic patterns. This seminar will start with an introduction to mobile sound recording that explores sound as it travels through the air in acoustic space using varieties of microphones and space mapping techniques. The course will also explore using acoustic measurement technologies such as accelerometers and hydrophones to investigate how sound exists within structures, the sea and other types of fluids. This course will start out with a large group sound mapping project about Saadiyat Island and expand to other environments in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. In addition to the group project, students will also be required to develop their own unique soundscape works. The course will cover all aspects of environmental field recording, editing and presentation of the final results.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course views musical structures and constructs broadly, referencing phenomena from musics around the world. The bulk of the course is devoted to an exploration of melody, harmony, and counterpoint in the music of diatonic tonality through projects in directed composition and analysis. Repertoire is drawn from both &ldquo;classical&rdquo; (common practice period) music and more recent examples of tonality, including popular music. Regular reading and listening assignments place techniques in historical context and expose students to a wide range of musical examples. Weekly lab sections are devoted to skills in musicianship: listening, sight-singing, dictation, and basic keyboard skills. Students may be required to take MUSIC- AD 100 prior to MUSIC-AD 105 upon taking a placement examination. Please contact Instructor or Music Program Head for details.    Students in the NYUNY Music Dept: This course is equivalent to MUSIC-UA 20 Elements of Music; Students wishing to substitute MUSIC-AD 105 for MUSIC-UA 201 Harmony and Counterpoint 1 must sit a diagnostic exam in New York.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region. Focusing on issues of gender, religion and nation, the course pays particular attention to the development of the Maqam system, ritual practices of religious minorities, and the popular musical styles that mobilize social movements.

Depending on the experience and expertise of the instructor, the course might focus on Bach fugues, Mozart opera, Schoenberg&rsquo;s piano music, or the development of electro-acoustic music. While the focus is on issues of how these works create effects, and resultant questions of meaning, we also look at sociological and political issues.    *This course is no longer being offered.

Students of various skill sets gain the necessary footing to develop/envision themselves as music practitioners/makers in a changing global landscape, as we endeavor to focus on cosmopolitan music practices that draw on the uniqueness of the U.A.E. as a global site. Students work in creative music projects involving original writing/composition, recording, and performance. The course additionally has a historical scope in which students consider how these practices have been addressed at different key moments in history and differed according to national and regional contexts.

Beginning with music in the myths and ancient histories of Sumeria, Egypt, and Greece, the seminar concludes with an examination of music and musical production within emerging global and transnational networks of power, where new technologies of mediation are radically re-orchestrating our engagement with sound and the world. Within the broad scope of this overview, we will examine the historical repertoire that has come to be known as &quot;classical music.&quot; The course explores the idea of a permanent canon of musical masterworks, which as a nineteenth-century invention, expanded gradually to include much earlier music as it became increasingly known. The course is not limited to the European musical tradition and canon but also examines non-Western musical traditions in the Middle East, India, and Asia, which grew out of a complex confluence of established practices.

This course surveys a variety of musics, with a particular emphasis on careful listening and aural analysis. Assigned readings help to contextualize and problematize the listening, shedding light on musical preconceptions and biases. Each student chooses from a diverse array of research topics early in the semester, preparing for a substantial presentation during the final weeks of class.

Students develop artistic collaborative projects involving sound, movement, digital video, lighting, interaction technologies, and telematics, which are presented publicly at the end of the semester. This course requires no skills and is open to anyone willing to establish a collaborative project involving different art forms and other domains.    * Note: The former title of this course was &#39;Collaborating in the Digital Domain&#39;.

MUSIC-AD 260 Intro to Maqam &amp; Usul: Modality, Rhythm &amp; Improvisation in the Art Music of the ME                                                                                                    The central tradition of Middle East art music was based in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul, where it achieved its mature form from the early 18th until the beginning of the 20th century, and interacted with the music of major cities such as Aleppo, Baghdad and Cairo, as well as the music of the Byzantine church. This course presents the development of maqam (mode) as both theory and practice, based on classical texts, compositions from the 17th until the 20th centuries, and the music of modern masters, since the advent of sound recording. The principal focus will be on the analysis of 1) modality, intonation and modulation, 2) relations of melody and rhythm (usul) in compositions, 3) non-metrical improvisation (taksim).    *Note: Prerequiste- reading ability of musical notation.    * This course is no longer being offered.

expression that constitutes an integral part of every civilization. The NYU Abu Dhabi program has two distinguishing features. First, the program takes a global approach to music making and emphasizes both eastern and western approaches to music theory, history, criticism, and practice. The program bridges musical theory, repertoire, and performance styles of Western music (including but not limited to classical, jazz, and popular styles) as well as the influential transnational traditions of North Africa, the Arab Peninsula, the Levant, and the Gulf regions. Abu Dhabi's proximity to major regional musical centers, such as Istanbul, Beirut, and Delhi, and to neighboring Dubai's recording studios and performance venues offers the opportunity to learn first-hand about international popular music.   Second, the music major at NYUAD is dedicated to learning through making music, and through the continual interaction and synthesis of action and reflection. Students are expected to participate in ensembles and can also receive private training on their instruments. Team-taught courses and hybrid courses that draw on music\u2019s relation to dance, theater, visual art, literature, and film, as well as philosophy, religion, cognition, evolution, emergent technologies, and the environment, will be offered regularly. The curriculum provides special opportunities to study and participate in digital music recording and telematic music, and to consider the process of making music from its creation to production and distribution.   The strong programs at NYU New York in ethnomusicology, recording, and digital music are accessible to students in Abu Dhabi through courses taught by affiliated faculty and terms spent in New York and other global sites.   Students pursuing a major or concentration in Music at NYUAD gain proficiency in theory, history, criticism, and interpretation of music traditions throughout the world. At the same time, our students develop skills in analysis, critical thinking, composition, writing, and technology that are valuable across disciplines. As a result, the major and concentration in Music constitute excellent preparation for graduate study in music and related fields in the Arts and Humanities; for careers in the music, media, and culture industries; or for any occupation demanding clear and original thinking, command of the written word, analytical skills, and creativity.                             Requirements   The music major requires a minimum of 12 courses, and has two tracks:     Artistic Practice     Music Studies       The courses offered by the music program are grouped into four disciplinary areas:     Music Practice   Ethnomusicology/Musicology   Music Theory   Music Technology.       Different combinations of courses in the four disciplinary areas define the track for the major.   NOTE: Private Instruction (Music Performance or Composition) and Ensembles are 2-credit courses. All other courses in the Music Program are 4-credit courses.     Common to both tracks     4 Required Courses   Music Technology Fundamentals     Music Theory &amp; Analysis I     Music Histories     Making Music       2 Capstone Seminars     NOTE: Regardless of track, private instruction cannot be taken for more than 8 credits in either instrument or composition and cannot be more than 10 credits in total.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project. Students may also elect to participate in a capstone project with other students majoring in the arts.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project. Students may also elect to participate in a capstone project with other students majoring in the arts.

COREA-AD 21 Gesture in Speech, Poetry, Music, and Dance                                                        Gesture lies at the interface of the verbal and the non-verbal in human communication and expression. Through bodily movement, intonation, and stress gesture can transcend the distinctions between normal speech, poetry, song, and dance. Gaining a deeper understanding of the multiple meanings of gesture in a variety of media across different cultures enables the student to approach fundamental means of human expression, and to learn to recognize constants in human communication within the myriad of culturally specific conventions of language, prosody, music, and dance.

This course analyzes what we understand as &ldquo;music.&rdquo; Drawing on music of different styles from all over the world, we will explore what constitutes musical meaning, how it is produced, and how music expresses feelings. Taking advantage of the multicultural nature of NYUAD, we will explore the cultural and universal mechanisms at play when we listen and understand music.

What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present. The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the laments and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict. Drawing on histories and philosophies of war, we will engage with issues related to propaganda, censorship, detention, internment, torture, heroism, sacrifice, bravery, justice, history, memory, and death and with reference to work by Homer, Thuclydides, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Tolstoy, Shostakovitch, Britten, Picasso, Dix, Mishima, Wiesel, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, and John Lennon, among others.

An assumption which this course will make and explore is that all situations in the real world have a musical potential. This potential is defined and realized by discovering, recording and mapping the many ways in which the physical reality of places are dynamic systems of significant acoustic patterns. This seminar will start with an introduction to mobile sound recording that explores sound as it travels through the air in acoustic space using varieties of microphones and space mapping techniques. The course will also explore using acoustic measurement technologies such as accelerometers and hydrophones to investigate how sound exists within structures, the sea and other types of fluids. This course will start out with a large group sound mapping project about Saadiyat Island and expand to other environments in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. In addition to the group project, students will also be required to develop their own unique soundscape works. The course will cover all aspects of environmental field recording, editing and presentation of the final results.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course views musical structures and constructs broadly, referencing phenomena from musics around the world. The bulk of the course is devoted to an exploration of melody, harmony, and counterpoint in the music of diatonic tonality through projects in directed composition and analysis. Repertoire is drawn from both &ldquo;classical&rdquo; (common practice period) music and more recent examples of tonality, including popular music. Regular reading and listening assignments place techniques in historical context and expose students to a wide range of musical examples. Weekly lab sections are devoted to skills in musicianship: listening, sight-singing, dictation, and basic keyboard skills. Students may be required to take MUSIC- AD 100 prior to MUSIC-AD 105 upon taking a placement examination. Please contact Instructor or Music Program Head for details.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region. Focusing on issues of gender, religion and nation, the course pays particular attention to the development of the Maqam system, ritual practices of religious minorities, and the popular musical styles that mobilize social movements.

Depending on the experience and expertise of the instructor, the course might focus on Bach fugues, Mozart opera, Schoenberg&rsquo;s piano music, or the development of electro-acoustic music. While the focus is on issues of how these works create effects, and resultant questions of meaning, we also look at sociological and political issues.    *This course is no longer being offered.

Students of various skill sets gain the necessary footing to develop/envision themselves as music practitioners/makers in a changing global landscape, as we endeavor to focus on cosmopolitan music practices that draw on the uniqueness of the U.A.E. as a global site. Students work in creative music projects involving original writing/composition, recording, and performance. The course additionally has a historical scope in which students consider how these practices have been addressed at different key moments in history and differed according to national and regional contexts.

Beginning with music in the myths and ancient histories of Sumeria, Egypt, and Greece, the seminar concludes with an examination of music and musical production within emerging global and transnational networks of power, where new technologies of mediation are radically re-orchestrating our engagement with sound and the world. Within the broad scope of this overview, we will examine the historical repertoire that has come to be known as &quot;classical music.&quot; The course explores the idea of a permanent canon of musical masterworks, which as a nineteenth-century invention, expanded gradually to include much earlier music as it became increasingly known. The course is not limited to the European musical tradition and canon but also examines non-Western musical traditions in the Middle East, India, and Asia, which grew out of a complex confluence of established practices.

This course surveys a variety of musics, with a particular emphasis on careful listening and aural analysis. Assigned readings help to contextualize and problematize the listening, shedding light on musical preconceptions and biases. Each student chooses from a diverse array of research topics early in the semester, preparing for a substantial presentation during the final weeks of class.

Students develop artistic collaborative projects involving sound, movement, digital video, lighting, interaction technologies, and telematics, which are presented publicly at the end of the semester. This course requires no skills and is open to anyone willing to establish a collaborative project involving different art forms and other domains.    * Note: The former title of this course was &#39;Collaborating in the Digital Domain&#39;.

MUSIC-AD 260 Intro to Maqam &amp; Usul: Modality, Rhythm &amp; Improvisation in the Art Music of the ME                                                                                                    The central tradition of Middle East art music was based in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul, where it achieved its mature form from the early 18th until the beginning of the 20th century, and interacted with the music of major cities such as Aleppo, Baghdad and Cairo, as well as the music of the Byzantine church. This course presents the development of maqam (mode) as both theory and practice, based on classical texts, compositions from the 17th until the 20th centuries, and the music of modern masters, since the advent of sound recording. The principal focus will be on the analysis of 1) modality, intonation and modulation, 2) relations of melody and rhythm (usul) in compositions, 3) non-metrical improvisation (taksim).    *Note: Prerequiste- reading ability of musical notation.    * This course is no longer being offered.
