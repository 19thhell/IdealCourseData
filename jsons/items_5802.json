Fuchsberg Clinical Law Center has long been renowned for the quality of its faculty, the variety of its offerings, and the innovative structure of its curriculum. With 15 full-time clinical faculty and 39 clinics , NYU School of Law provides students with unparalleled experiences in working with clients and communities to address urgent problems, influence public policy, and improve the quality of legal problem-solving.   For twenty years, NYU Law has coordinated its much heralded first-year Lawyering Program , upper-level simulation courses, and fieldwork clinics in a carefully structured pedagogical construct of sequenced, dynamic learning, developed by Professor Anthony G. Amsterdam , one of the most respected public interest lawyers and law professors in the country. The Lawyering Program introduces students to a sophisticated theory of legal problem-solving that Professor Amsterdam, Professor Peggy Davis and other members of the NYU School of Law faculty have been the leaders in creating. Grounded in this model, students in the Law School's upper-level clinics work with clients and communities on intensely demanding cases, projects, and deals.   Each upper-level clinic builds on first-year instruction in its own special way. In order to serve clients and communities as effective practitioners, each clinic requires students to master particular bodies of law (for example, family, civil rights, or death penalty law), to learn specific skills suited to different practice arenas (for example, litigation, policy analysis, and/or outreach skills), and to learn to work under close supervision of faculty (for example, preparing for trials and hearings, writing appellate and post-conviction briefs, and/or planning community education workshops).   NYU School of Law faculty design each and every upper-level clinic with a common aspiration. Clinics advance the instruction to which students already have been exposed, diversify the skill sets available for effective legal problem solving, and deepen an increasingly coherent sense of how lawyers might best do their work. At the same time, clinics exhort students to appreciate just how much they must grow over the course of their careers. Problems evolve, and so must problem solvers if they are to become and remain expert in the practice of law.   A distinctive feature of NYU School of Law's clinics is that the faculty who teach them are tenured or tenure track professors whose sole professional interest is the research and teaching they do at the Law School. The faculty-student ratio in clinical courses is extremely low (typically, a clinical faculty member teaches 8 to 10 students), in order to ensure students the intensive experience that the best of clinics should deliver.

In fact, these valuable experiences often lead directly to full-time employment  upon graduation; many of our recent graduates now work at the facilities where they once attended clinic. Affiliations are full-time and  last 6, 8 and 16 weeks (the latter divided into two 8-week sessions) each respective summer immediately following spring semester. Currently, we affiliate with over 350 healthcare facilities across the nation as close as our very own NYU Medical Center  and as far away as Juneau Physical Therapy in Alaska. Students play an active role in selecting their sites from places including teaching  hospitals, rehabilitation centers, schools, private practices, and skilled nursing facilities thereby assuring a well-rounded clinical experience.  If a student wishes to attend a site with which we are not presently affiliated, we will make all attempts to effectuate a relationship  with that site. Recent affiliations have taken place in such prominent facilities as the Cardiac Rehabilitation Unit of Columbia Presbyterian  Hospital, the Burn Center of Cornell Medical Center, the NYU Medical Center&rsquo;s Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, Stanford Hospital,  California Pacific Medical Center, the VA Medical Center of Palo Alto, New England Hospital, Kessler Institute For Rehabilitation, and United  Cerebral Palsy of New York City.    Clinical Observation       I - Fall semester, 2nd year (musculoskeletal area)   II - Spring semester, 2nd year (cardiopulmonary area)   III - Fall semester, 3rd year (neuromuscular area)   IV - Spring semester, 3rd year (integumentary and woman&#39;s health areas)    This clinical education component of the Doctor of Physical Therapy program allows students to observe and be mentored by  expert clinicians working in their respective specialized clinical settings. Students observe in small groups and see firsthand what it  takes to become a highly skilled, well rounded professional practitioner in conjunction with the specific system currently being studied  in class (cardiovascular/pulmonary; musculoskeletal; neuromuscular; and genito-urinary, integumentary, endocrine, immune, and gastrointestinal),  thus establishing a unique link between the didactic and clinical aspects of the program. Observations are part-time (one day per week) and occur in stress-free, nurturing environments allowing students to truly  appreciate collaborative, problem-based learning in all aspects of the profession including examination, intervention, business, management,  and professional behavior. To ensure that our clinical observation program remains at the forefront of physical therapy education and establishes  the best learning and working environment possible, our faculty carefully selects each participating clinician based on years of experience  within their respective areas of specialization, and advocates an open dialogue between student, master clinician, and faculty.
