Her most recent reporting project was a story about ten and eleven year old boys tried on conspiracy to murder charges in rural Washington state, for Buzzfeed Longform. David Grann described the article as \"Deeply reported, disturbing, important,\" and it was chosen as one of The New Yorker's Weekend Reads. Since graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in English Lit she has written for the New Republic on phone hacking and the London riots, for the Economist on Rebecca West and Greek cinema, as well as for the Guardian on Newcastle, bad literary marriages, and watching the same film every day for a year. She\u2019s also reviewed books for the Financial Times, Independent, and New York Times. For the last year she has been a research assistant to Patrick Radden Keefe, working on background for his articles about mining corruption in Guinea, marijuana legalisation in Washington and Colorado, and more recently pieces on insider trading in New York hedge funds as well as Swiss banks and offshore accounts.   Alex Brokaw received his B.A. in English and Creative Writing from Emory University in 2011. Following school he helped run a literary journal before taking work as a copywriter. Then, after someone asked him if he wouldn\u2019t mind writing a few articles, he began as a financial reporter. The work was enjoyable, and he continued as a reporter on and off for the next two years, covering areas such as agribusiness, global trade, and emerging economies. Somewhere along the line he ran across digital currencies, didn\u2019t pay too much attention, and then, months later came back around. He\u2019s been building his coverage of the emerging space ever since. He\u2019s particularly interested in the impact of the technology behind digital currencies to things that do and don\u2019t have to do with money.   Jaspal Chana is a recent graduate of the University of Durham with a degree in Theology &amp; Religion. During this time he has spent a year living in Sweden, interned at an English language newspaper in Dubai, written a number of commentary pieces for the university newspaper and featured as a fortnightly columnist on a student website writing about the artistic value of various aspects of popular culture. Through his studies he has become particularly interested in the role of religion in the American political system as well as the relationship between personal identity, nation and culture, which he hopes to explore through the religion/journalism program at NYU.   Michelle Kim is a native of South Korea and has worked at the Seoul bureau of Thomson Reuters for the past year. She wrote a number of features on North Korea, especially on the regime\u2019s human rights abuse and the reunion of war-torn families. While interviewing North Korean defectors, she found the lighter conversations they shared just as intriguing as their harrowing accounts of midnight escapes and prison camp atrocities. Their hopes for marriage and family, what school life was like in a democratic society and the new dreams they cultivated\u2014these topics were not shocking news items, but added personality to each of their tales. So during her time at NYU, she hopes to bond with North Korean defectors who may be living in the New York area and write longer, detailed narratives of each individual\u2019s experience. Michelle earned a B.A. in International Studies from Ewha Womans University in 2013, with concentrations in Diplomacy and Asian Studies. She loves the smell of old library books and reading her favorite novels over and over again.   With roots in Washington, D.C. and Stuttgart, Germany, Natalie Lampert has traveled and written her way through thirty countries. Despite this, she still struggles using chopsticks. Natalie received her B.A. in English and International Relations from Elon University in 2011. She has worked in a variety of writing environments, including as a reporter for an Austrian newspaper, as managing editor of her college\u2019s literary journal, and as an intern at a publishing house in Sri Lanka. As a 2012-2013 Fulbright scholar in Sri Lanka, Natalie taught contemporary literature at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. She works during summer months for National Geographic, leading student expeditions focused on creative writing and photography. At NYU, she plans to write about meditation and its practitioners, exploring the juxtaposition of insight meditation\u2019s increasing popularity in urban epicenters such as New York City and the rise of Buddhist extremism in South Asia.   Hannah McCarthy is a graduate of Bennington College, where she earned her B.A. in Philosophy and Theatre. After completing her thesis work on Brecht and the power of the theatrical event, she became interested in community ritual and the theatrics of religious worship. Writing for the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Gazette, Hannah explored the peculiar rites of the insular year-round community of artists, business owners and fisherman. She spent the following year travelling the U.S. in a beat-up white 2001 Odyssey (named Hal), researching religion and the desire for community across generations and geographies. In the late nights and wee morning hours between farming, fundraising for a couple of non-profits and working as a film producer, Hannah has written about these various microcosms. She intends to continue this work while at NYU, concentrating the shifting liturgical landscape of a spiritually displaced younger generation.   Michela Pfeifer is Austrian but - after studying in France and the UK and working as a \u201cspin doctor\u201d in the European Parliament in Brussels for several years\u2013 she would more appropriately define herself as a \u201cEuropean above all\u201d. After ghost-writing speeches and articles for politicians, mainly in the field of human rights and the Middle East, she turned to journalism after reporting on her recent trip to South America in Revolve, a Brussels-based environmentalist magazine. She has notably written on renewable energy, environment and sustainability, democracy and fundamental rights. In \u201canother\u201d life, she spent six months learning yoga in India, worked in banking in the Principality of Liechtenstein and was a member of the Austrian national gymnastics team. Michela speaks German, English, French and Spanish and holds a degree in Foreign Languages with Business, a postgraduate in Translating for Cinema and a MA in International Politics from the University of Paris-South.   Raella Rayside spent her entire life building her dance career. She loved the idea of evoking emotion with nothing but her body, and tirelessly studied technique and body conditioning to become an expert at it. She started at NYU as a dance major, but under her parent\u2019s insistence and her conscience\u2019s pleas for something more stable she wandered into an introductory journalism class. It wasn\u2019t until her second year that she discovered the art of literary journalism. She was enthralled by the ideas of long-form narrative and the personal essay, and quickly realized that she had a gift for storytelling on paper as well. Raella graduated in 2013 from NYU with a BFA in dance and a BA in journalism. She is excited to continue honing her craft as a writer and a narrator and can\u2019t wait to put pen to paper again.   Renee Saleh studied modern literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz, a concentration that encouraged her study of the literature produced by socially and economically depoliticized ethnic groups. She became increasingly interested in the manifestation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict here in the United States, and particularly in the microcosm of New York City. She maintains an open-minded curiosity about the essence of identity and stubbornness inherent to a conflict such as this one, and hopes to eventually write long-form pieces regarding her own identity and relationship to the conflict. Post 9/11 Islamophobia is another interest of hers, as she plans to use that concept as one of many lenses under which she will parse the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Since graduation, she has had experience working with a couple different non profits, both of which were socio-political by nature and have solidified her desire to combine her love of the written word with greater social issues that have heavily impacted her own world view.   Lindsey Smith struggles to flip pancakes, fried eggs, and other flat things in pans. She can't dance to save her life, and should stay away from singing in public, for everyone's sake. Despite these deficits, she graduated from Stanford University in 2011 with a BA in Italian and English: Creative Writing. In 2008-2009, she went to Lecce, Italy as a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar, where she studied sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology, and (bewilderingly) Spanish at the Universit\u00e0 del Salento. There, \"in the heel of the boot,\" Lindsey was first exposed to the complicated interplay between organized crime and social norms, a relationship that has fascinated her since and will anchor her research at NYU. After graduating, she worked in venture philanthropy in the Bay Area, vetting, selecting, and coaching a portfolio of start-up nonprofits. During that time, she also wrote on topics from family, to football, to books, for literary and philanthropic publications including, most recently, Narrative Magazine. As always, she is eager to learn and do so much more.   In 1986 Giulia Alexandra Smythies was conceived in a small flat in the center of London. For six months prior to her conception, her starving parents had subsisted on nothing but small packets of jaffa cakes. Their baby was born fat and curly-headed, with an unquenchable thirst for chocolate. They named her Giulia, after an Alpine mountain range in Italy, the country of their birth. Without realising it, Giulia grew up confused about her identity. Not only did she speak three languages, have two passports, and live in Alabama, Italy, Seattle, and Germany, but nobody could actually pronounce her name. In 2012 her search for meaning led her to Aboriginal Australia where she connected with Mundanara Bayles and her elders, Lilla Watson and Mary Graham. In a speech given at the 1985 United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Nairobi, Lilla Watson is famous for saying, \"If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound with mine, then let us walk together.\" Giulia believes that a society is only as healthy as its sickest member and that as long as there is injustice for some, there will be suffering by all. She is at NYU to learn the art of creating change.   Cleuci de Oliveira hails from Brasilia, Brazil.

Although she left the Canadian North for Toronto before she was a year old, she still contends that the snow, the cold, and the hockey games played on the frozen lake behind her house (watched from her crib, of course), left a permanent imprint on her life. She\u2019s not yet sure whether it was the early thrust out of, and into, two very different landscapes, or the more likely culprit of being raised with the neuroticism inherent in any Jewish upbringing, that forged her fascination with the forces that shape us and the means by which we come to terms with the decisions we make. Either way, it was that very fascination that led her to NYU, where she intends to write about the lengths and risks we all seem willing to take when finding (or creating) meaning in our lives is involved.

She entered the New York City Teaching Fellows in 2005 and subsequently earned her MS in Teaching from Pace University. Jessica loves her students and the art of education; but, in the process of helping her students craft their writing, she realized she was sacrificing her own. Ergo, the full-time pursuit of journalism. Jessica graduated cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania with a dual BA degree in Creative Writing and Classical Studies. During her years as an undergraduate, she wrote for The Daily Pennsylvanian, 34th Street Magazine, Merrick Life, and interned at Harper's Bazaar.

No one ever fully understood what he did for a living, despite his best efforts to explain it to them. Their attention would wander as soon as he mentioned the word \"data.\" While he is proud of the skills he has developed in Excel over the past four years, he looks forward to closing the spreadsheets this summer and enrolling in the literary reportage program at NYU. When Dan isn't crunching numbers, he enjoys walking through Manhattan, thirty blocks at a time, and searching for restaurants that can satisfy his cravings for certain kinds of junk food.   Allyson Polsky McCabe comes to Literary Reportage from a Lectureship in the English Department at Yale University. Allyson's background is in cultural theory and rhetoric and she has published broadly in scholarly venues.

She earned a degree in studio art and went on to day jobs in construction and with homeless youth. Teaching herself how to use a video camera she made a short documentary on garbage in 2002. Much to her surprise the project expanded into a book, Gone Tomorrow: The Hidden Life of Garbage (The New Press 2005). Her second book, Green Gone Wrong (Scribner 2010), takes on the myth that we can buy our way out of environmental crisis. Her byline has appeared in The New York Times Magazine, Mother Jones, the American Prospect, and The Nation. Her reporting has taken her everywhere from organic farms and eco-villages to dusty rural India and the rainforest on Borneo. On days off she can be found wandering through museums, watching films, and cooking with friends.

She has a weakness for makeshift shelters, hand-crafted signs, and odd renovation projects.   Katherine Don holds a B.A. in biological anthropology from Northwestern University. After graduation she meandered about in indecision, initiated short-lived careers in publishing, nonprofit management, and social work, and freelance wrote for books published by such houses as Publications International and St. Martin's Press.

She is easily and overly amused by phenomena such as the triple consecutive appearance of \"in,\" sentence two above.   Clara Kim graduated from Columbia College, with B.A. in English literature and a visual art minor. After college, she went back to Korea, the country she grew up in, and spent the past two years traveling around the coastal villages, teaching English at a North Korean refugee school, and working as a freelance translator. Curious about the way people dress and write, she is also loves drawing out the natural storyteller in others.   Andrew Marantz tried a bit of everything at Brown. His interest in philosophy led him to India, where he learned Vedic epistemology and how to eat with his hands. His interest in cognitive science led him to Nepal, where he worked on a hypoxia study at Everest Base Camp. His interest in the politics of mass incarceration led him to an upstate New York prison town, which then became the subject of his undergraduate thesis. After college, he followed the herd to Brooklyn, where he worked as a freelance journalist, researcher, and conversation starter, writing for such places as Slate, Heeb, and Time Out New York. Andrew thinks the four most overrated things in life are bars, World War II movies, Sonic Youth, and home fries.   Marta Mart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez studied Journalism at Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona because she wanted to write. Thanks to New Journalism she discovered that literary techniques were a great tool to explain our complex world. Unfortunately, Spain offers few opportunities for in-depth reporting, not even in important media such as El Pa\u00eds, where she interned. Not wishing to stay in the same place for a long time, she went to live in Berlin and travelled constantly because of her work at a tourism magazine. New York is her new boot camp, where she will look for stories about immigration and generational conflicts, especially between women.   Robert Moor completed his B.A. in Literary Arts at Brown University. Though his studies mostly consisted of writing strange, genre-bending fiction (with literary revolutionaries like Robert Coover and Thalia Field) and fiery, student-activist journalism (contributing to and editing the College Hill Independent, the weekly Brown/RISD student newspaper), his best work strives to combine the experimental spirit of postmodern literature with the factual constraints of journalism. He is currently thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail.   Lisa Peterson-de la Cueva betrayed her Midwestern roots by moving to New York to attend Barnard College. She has a master's degree in teaching, which she used while teaching social studies to junior high students in New York City and English to adult immigrants in the Twin Cities.

She has published work in various Minnesota publications including the Twin Cities Daily Planet, the MN Women's Press, the Rake, and KFAI radio.   Carrie Rothburd earned a B.A. in fine arts/photography in her native NY before moving to Wisconsin, where she completed an M.A. in educational policy studies, interned at The Progressive Magazine (where she also worked as art assistant), and worked with community-based nonprofits.

Alex Brokaw received his B.A. in English and Creative Writing from Emory University in 2011. Following school he helped run a literary journal before taking work as a copywriter. Then, after someone asked him if he wouldn\u2019t mind writing a few articles, he began as a financial reporter. The work was enjoyable, and he continued as a reporter on and off for the next two years, covering areas such as agribusiness, global trade, and emerging economies. Somewhere along the line he ran across digital currencies, didn\u2019t pay too much attention, and then, months later came back around. He\u2019s been building his coverage of the emerging space ever since. He\u2019s particularly interested in the impact of the technology behind digital currencies to things that do and don\u2019t have to do with money. Jaspal Chana is a recent graduate of the University of Durham with a degree in Theology &amp; Religion. During this time he has spent a year living in Sweden, interned at an English language newspaper in Dubai, written a number of commentary pieces for the university newspaper and featured as a fortnightly columnist on a student website writing about the artistic value of various aspects of popular culture. Through his studies he has become particularly interested in the role of religion in the American political system as well as the relationship between personal identity, nation and culture, which he hopes to explore through the religion/journalism program at NYU. Michelle Kim is a native of South Korea and has worked at the Seoul bureau of Thomson Reuters for the past year. She wrote a number of features on North Korea, especially on the regime\u2019s human rights abuse and the reunion of war-torn families. While interviewing North Korean defectors, she found the lighter conversations they shared just as intriguing as their harrowing accounts of midnight escapes and prison camp atrocities. Their hopes for marriage and family, what school life was like in a democratic society and the new dreams they cultivated\u2014these topics were not shocking news items, but added personality to each of their tales. So during her time at NYU, she hopes to bond with North Korean defectors who may be living in the New York area and write longer, detailed narratives of each individual\u2019s experience. Michelle earned a B.A. in International Studies from Ewha Womans University in 2013, with concentrations in Diplomacy and Asian Studies. She loves the smell of old library books and reading her favorite novels over and over again. With roots in Washington, D.C. and Stuttgart, Germany, Natalie Lampert has traveled and written her way through thirty countries. Despite this, she still struggles using chopsticks. Natalie received her B.A. in English and International Relations from Elon University in 2011. She has worked in a variety of writing environments, including as a reporter for an Austrian newspaper, as managing editor of her college\u2019s literary journal, and as an intern at a publishing house in Sri Lanka. As a 2012-2013 Fulbright scholar in Sri Lanka, Natalie taught contemporary literature at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. She works during summer months for National Geographic, leading student expeditions focused on creative writing and photography. At NYU, she plans to write about meditation and its practitioners, exploring the juxtaposition of insight meditation\u2019s increasing popularity in urban epicenters such as New York City and the rise of Buddhist extremism in South Asia. Hannah McCarthy is a graduate of Bennington College, where she earned her B.A. in Philosophy and Theatre. After completing her thesis work on Brecht and the power of the theatrical event, she became interested in community ritual and the theatrics of religious worship. Writing for the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Gazette, Hannah explored the peculiar rites of the insular year-round community of artists, business owners and fisherman. She spent the following year travelling the U.S. in a beat-up white 2001 Odyssey (named Hal), researching religion and the desire for community across generations and geographies. In the late nights and wee morning hours between farming, fundraising for a couple of non-profits and working as a film producer, Hannah has written about these various microcosms. She intends to continue this work while at NYU, concentrating the shifting liturgical landscape of a spiritually displaced younger generation. Michela Pfeifer is Austrian but - after studying in France and the UK and working as a \u201cspin doctor\u201d in the European Parliament in Brussels for several years\u2013 she would more appropriately define herself as a \u201cEuropean above all\u201d. After ghost-writing speeches and articles for politicians, mainly in the field of human rights and the Middle East, she turned to journalism after reporting on her recent trip to South America in Revolve, a Brussels-based environmentalist magazine. She has notably written on renewable energy, environment and sustainability, democracy and fundamental rights. In \u201canother\u201d life, she spent six months learning yoga in India, worked in banking in the Principality of Liechtenstein and was a member of the Austrian national gymnastics team. Michela speaks German, English, French and Spanish and holds a degree in Foreign Languages with Business, a postgraduate in Translating for Cinema and a MA in International Politics from the University of Paris-South. Raella Rayside spent her entire life building her dance career. She loved the idea of evoking emotion with nothing but her body, and tirelessly studied technique and body conditioning to become an expert at it. She started at NYU as a dance major, but under her parent\u2019s insistence and her conscience\u2019s pleas for something more stable she wandered into an introductory journalism class. It wasn\u2019t until her second year that she discovered the art of literary journalism. She was enthralled by the ideas of long-form narrative and the personal essay, and quickly realized that she had a gift for storytelling on paper as well. Raella graduated in 2013 from NYU with a BFA in dance and a BA in journalism. She is excited to continue honing her craft as a writer and a narrator and can\u2019t wait to put pen to paper again. Renee Saleh studied modern literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz, a concentration that encouraged her study of the literature produced by socially and economically depoliticized ethnic groups. She became increasingly interested in the manifestation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict here in the United States, and particularly in the microcosm of New York City. She maintains an open-minded curiosity about the essence of identity and stubbornness inherent to a conflict such as this one, and hopes to eventually write long-form pieces regarding her own identity and relationship to the conflict. Post 9/11 Islamophobia is another interest of hers, as she plans to use that concept as one of many lenses under which she will parse the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Since graduation, she has had experience working with a couple different non profits, both of which were socio-political by nature and have solidified her desire to combine her love of the written word with greater social issues that have heavily impacted her own world view. Lindsey Smith struggles to flip pancakes, fried eggs, and other flat things in pans. She can't dance to save her life, and should stay away from singing in public, for everyone's sake. Despite these deficits, she graduated from Stanford University in 2011 with a BA in Italian and English: Creative Writing. In 2008-2009, she went to Lecce, Italy as a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar, where she studied sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology, and (bewilderingly) Spanish at the Universit\u00e0 del Salento. There, \"in the heel of the boot,\" Lindsey was first exposed to the complicated interplay between organized crime and social norms, a relationship that has fascinated her since and will anchor her research at NYU. After graduating, she worked in venture philanthropy in the Bay Area, vetting, selecting, and coaching a portfolio of start-up nonprofits. During that time, she also wrote on topics from family, to football, to books, for literary and philanthropic publications including, most recently, Narrative Magazine. As always, she is eager to learn and do so much more. In 1986 Giulia Alexandra Smythies was conceived in a small flat in the center of London. For six months prior to her conception, her starving parents had subsisted on nothing but small packets of jaffa cakes. Their baby was born fat and curly-headed, with an unquenchable thirst for chocolate. They named her Giulia, after an Alpine mountain range in Italy, the country of their birth. Without realising it, Giulia grew up confused about her identity. Not only did she speak three languages, have two passports, and live in Alabama, Italy, Seattle, and Germany, but nobody could actually pronounce her name. In 2012 her search for meaning led her to Aboriginal Australia where she connected with Mundanara Bayles and her elders, Lilla Watson and Mary Graham. In a speech given at the 1985 United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Nairobi, Lilla Watson is famous for saying, \"If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound with mine, then let us walk together.\" Giulia believes that a society is only as healthy as its sickest member and that as long as there is injustice for some, there will be suffering by all. She is at NYU to learn the art of creating change. Cleuci de Oliveira hails from Brasilia, Brazil. She earned a B.S. in Studio Art at NYU and followed it up with an M.A. in History of Art at University College London. After working in the UK arts sector for several years, Cleuci made a career change into journalism. She has written for print and online publications in her native Brazil. Currently, she works for Cracked.com, both as a moderator for its Writers\u2019 Workshop and as a reporter for the more recent Personal Experience features. In the process, she has interviewed, among others, a Russian mail-order bride, the survivor of an end-times Christian cult and a woman with a neurological condition that prevents her from recognizing faces. Maggie Whitehead spent the past four years in Baltimore, Maryland working for the International Rescue Committee as a caseworker for newly arrived refugees. While serving a wide refugee client base, she worked closely with trauma victims and wrote individual histories to secure disability status for refugees with psychosomatic conditions. Prior to refugee resettlement, she lived in Tamil Nadu with a dozen mischievous teenage boys, who taught her bad Indian manners and the convoluted nature of English phonetics. Despite years of communicating mainly with limited English speakers, Maggie hopes to regain her vocabulary and put it to use. She is eager to unite her passions for writing and advocacy at NYU, and plans to focus her work around the successes and trials of human migration.

Her most recent reporting project was a story about ten and eleven year old boys tried on conspiracy to murder charges in rural Washington state, for Buzzfeed Longform. David Grann described the article as \"Deeply reported, disturbing, important,\" and it was chosen as one of The New Yorker's Weekend Reads. Since graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in English Lit she has written for the New Republic on phone hacking and the London riots, for the Economist on Rebecca West and Greek cinema, as well as for the Guardian on Newcastle, bad literary marriages, and watching the same film every day for a year. She\u2019s also reviewed books for the Financial Times, Independent, and New York Times. For the last year she has been a research assistant to Patrick Radden Keefe, working on background for his articles about mining corruption in Guinea, marijuana legalisation in Washington and Colorado, and more recently pieces on insider trading in New York hedge funds as well as Swiss banks and offshore accounts.   Alex Brokaw received his B.A. in English and Creative Writing from Emory University in 2011. Following school he helped run a literary journal before taking work as a copywriter. Then, after someone asked him if he wouldn\u2019t mind writing a few articles, he began as a financial reporter. The work was enjoyable, and he continued as a reporter on and off for the next two years, covering areas such as agribusiness, global trade, and emerging economies. Somewhere along the line he ran across digital currencies, didn\u2019t pay too much attention, and then, months later came back around. He\u2019s been building his coverage of the emerging space ever since. He\u2019s particularly interested in the impact of the technology behind digital currencies to things that do and don\u2019t have to do with money.   Jaspal Chana is a recent graduate of the University of Durham with a degree in Theology &amp; Religion. During this time he has spent a year living in Sweden, interned at an English language newspaper in Dubai, written a number of commentary pieces for the university newspaper and featured as a fortnightly columnist on a student website writing about the artistic value of various aspects of popular culture. Through his studies he has become particularly interested in the role of religion in the American political system as well as the relationship between personal identity, nation and culture, which he hopes to explore through the religion/journalism program at NYU.   Michelle Kim is a native of South Korea and has worked at the Seoul bureau of Thomson Reuters for the past year. She wrote a number of features on North Korea, especially on the regime\u2019s human rights abuse and the reunion of war-torn families. While interviewing North Korean defectors, she found the lighter conversations they shared just as intriguing as their harrowing accounts of midnight escapes and prison camp atrocities. Their hopes for marriage and family, what school life was like in a democratic society and the new dreams they cultivated\u2014these topics were not shocking news items, but added personality to each of their tales. So during her time at NYU, she hopes to bond with North Korean defectors who may be living in the New York area and write longer, detailed narratives of each individual\u2019s experience. Michelle earned a B.A. in International Studies from Ewha Womans University in 2013, with concentrations in Diplomacy and Asian Studies. She loves the smell of old library books and reading her favorite novels over and over again.

She works during summer months for National Geographic, leading student expeditions focused on creative writing and photography. At NYU, she plans to write about meditation and its practitioners, exploring the juxtaposition of insight meditation\u2019s increasing popularity in urban epicenters such as New York City and the rise of Buddhist extremism in South Asia.   Hannah McCarthy is a graduate of Bennington College, where she earned her B.A. in Philosophy and Theatre. After completing her thesis work on Brecht and the power of the theatrical event, she became interested in community ritual and the theatrics of religious worship. Writing for the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Gazette, Hannah explored the peculiar rites of the insular year-round community of artists, business owners and fisherman. She spent the following year travelling the U.S. in a beat-up white 2001 Odyssey (named Hal), researching religion and the desire for community across generations and geographies. In the late nights and wee morning hours between farming, fundraising for a couple of non-profits and working as a film producer, Hannah has written about these various microcosms. She intends to continue this work while at NYU, concentrating the shifting liturgical landscape of a spiritually displaced younger generation.   Michela Pfeifer is Austrian but - after studying in France and the UK and working as a \u201cspin doctor\u201d in the European Parliament in Brussels for several years\u2013 she would more appropriately define herself as a \u201cEuropean above all\u201d. After ghost-writing speeches and articles for politicians, mainly in the field of human rights and the Middle East, she turned to journalism after reporting on her recent trip to South America in Revolve, a Brussels-based environmentalist magazine. She has notably written on renewable energy, environment and sustainability, democracy and fundamental rights. In \u201canother\u201d life, she spent six months learning yoga in India, worked in banking in the Principality of Liechtenstein and was a member of the Austrian national gymnastics team. Michela speaks German, English, French and Spanish and holds a degree in Foreign Languages with Business, a postgraduate in Translating for Cinema and a MA in International Politics from the University of Paris-South.   Raella Rayside spent her entire life building her dance career. She loved the idea of evoking emotion with nothing but her body, and tirelessly studied technique and body conditioning to become an expert at it. She started at NYU as a dance major, but under her parent\u2019s insistence and her conscience\u2019s pleas for something more stable she wandered into an introductory journalism class. It wasn\u2019t until her second year that she discovered the art of literary journalism. She was enthralled by the ideas of long-form narrative and the personal essay, and quickly realized that she had a gift for storytelling on paper as well. Raella graduated in 2013 from NYU with a BFA in dance and a BA in journalism. She is excited to continue honing her craft as a writer and a narrator and can\u2019t wait to put pen to paper again.   Renee Saleh studied modern literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz, a concentration that encouraged her study of the literature produced by socially and economically depoliticized ethnic groups. She became increasingly interested in the manifestation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict here in the United States, and particularly in the microcosm of New York City. She maintains an open-minded curiosity about the essence of identity and stubbornness inherent to a conflict such as this one, and hopes to eventually write long-form pieces regarding her own identity and relationship to the conflict. Post 9/11 Islamophobia is another interest of hers, as she plans to use that concept as one of many lenses under which she will parse the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Since graduation, she has had experience working with a couple different non profits, both of which were socio-political by nature and have solidified her desire to combine her love of the written word with greater social issues that have heavily impacted her own world view.   Lindsey Smith struggles to flip pancakes, fried eggs, and other flat things in pans. She can't dance to save her life, and should stay away from singing in public, for everyone's sake. Despite these deficits, she graduated from Stanford University in 2011 with a BA in Italian and English: Creative Writing. In 2008-2009, she went to Lecce, Italy as a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar, where she studied sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology, and (bewilderingly) Spanish at the Universit\u00e0 del Salento. There, \"in the heel of the boot,\" Lindsey was first exposed to the complicated interplay between organized crime and social norms, a relationship that has fascinated her since and will anchor her research at NYU. After graduating, she worked in venture philanthropy in the Bay Area, vetting, selecting, and coaching a portfolio of start-up nonprofits. During that time, she also wrote on topics from family, to football, to books, for literary and philanthropic publications including, most recently, Narrative Magazine. As always, she is eager to learn and do so much more.   In 1986 Giulia Alexandra Smythies was conceived in a small flat in the center of London. For six months prior to her conception, her starving parents had subsisted on nothing but small packets of jaffa cakes. Their baby was born fat and curly-headed, with an unquenchable thirst for chocolate. They named her Giulia, after an Alpine mountain range in Italy, the country of their birth. Without realising it, Giulia grew up confused about her identity. Not only did she speak three languages, have two passports, and live in Alabama, Italy, Seattle, and Germany, but nobody could actually pronounce her name. In 2012 her search for meaning led her to Aboriginal Australia where she connected with Mundanara Bayles and her elders, Lilla Watson and Mary Graham. In a speech given at the 1985 United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Nairobi, Lilla Watson is famous for saying, \"If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound with mine, then let us walk together.\" Giulia believes that a society is only as healthy as its sickest member and that as long as there is injustice for some, there will be suffering by all. She is at NYU to learn the art of creating change.   Cleuci de Oliveira hails from Brasilia, Brazil.

Maggie Whitehead spent the past four years in Baltimore, Maryland working for the International Rescue Committee as a caseworker for newly arrived refugees. While serving a wide refugee client base, she worked closely with trauma victims and wrote individual histories to secure disability status for refugees with psychosomatic conditions. Prior to refugee resettlement, she lived in Tamil Nadu with a dozen mischievous teenage boys, who taught her bad Indian manners and the convoluted nature of English phonetics. Despite years of communicating mainly with limited English speakers, Maggie hopes to regain her vocabulary and put it to use. She is eager to unite her passions for writing and advocacy at NYU, and plans to focus her work around the successes and trials of human migration.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Literary Reportage 2013   Elizabeth Flock &lt; elizabethflock@gmail.com &gt; is a journalist with a deep interest in social issues and foreign news reporting.

Although she left the Canadian North for Toronto before she was a year old, she still contends that the snow, the cold, and the hockey games played on the frozen lake behind her house (watched from her crib, of course), left a permanent imprint on her life. She\u2019s not yet sure whether it was the early thrust out of, and into, two very different landscapes, or the more likely culprit of being raised with the neuroticism inherent in any Jewish upbringing, that forged her fascination with the forces that shape us and the means by which we come to terms with the decisions we make. Either way, it was that very fascination that led her to NYU, where she intends to write about the lengths and risks we all seem willing to take when finding (or creating) meaning in our lives is involved.

She earned a degree in studio art and went on to day jobs in construction and with homeless youth. Teaching herself how to use a video camera she made a short documentary on garbage in 2002. Much to her surprise the project expanded into a book, Gone Tomorrow: The Hidden Life of Garbage (The New Press 2005). Her second book, Green Gone Wrong (Scribner 2010), takes on the myth that we can buy our way out of environmental crisis. Her byline has appeared in The New York Times Magazine, Mother Jones, the American Prospect, and The Nation. Her reporting has taken her everywhere from organic farms and eco-villages to dusty rural India and the rainforest on Borneo. On days off she can be found wandering through museums, watching films, and cooking with friends.   Elaine Stuart was most recently the senior associate features/travel editor at Modern Bride, enjoying far-flung assignments in Tahiti and Turkey until Cond\u00e9 Nast closed the magazine last fall. Before that she worked at Child and interned at New York. As a freelancer, she has contributed to a number of national, regional and digital publications. She holds a B.A. in English and Psychology from Georgetown University, where she was a member and co-director of the student dance company and wrote her honors thesis on contemporary dance criticism. Prior to college, she attended high school for ballet at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts and danced with the Charleston Ballet Theatre and Richmond Ballet.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Literary Reportage Bios - 2009   Patrick Arden just left a job as a senior reporter at Metro New York. For nearly a decade, he was the managing editor of the Chicago Reader, a pioneer of the alternative-newsweekly movement. He's also been the editor-in-chief of Illinois Times, a winner of a general excellence award from the Illinois Press Association. He has published stories at Salon.com, the Chicago Sun-Times, the New York Post, and other places.   Mark Byrne graduated from Columbia College in Chicago, where he was an editor of the college newspaper. While in school, he contributed to a number of local magazines, including Chicago Magazine, where he also interned. He was the associate editor at Featherproof Books, a small literary press, and an intern at New York Magazine, in which he still enjoys an occasional byline. Most recently, he worked as a freelance editor at Popular Science. Mark grew up primarily in Wisconsin, where he successfully avoided picking up an accent.   Alexandra Cardia graduated from Oberlin College with a B.A. in Art History and English. She did her Honors work on Spanish regionalist architecture, specifically on public spaces that are both geographically rooted and globally relevant. For the past year she has worked as an editorial assistant at Cabinet, a Brooklyn-based quarterly magazine of art and culture.   Marianne Do was born in Melbourne, Australia, and raised in Saudi Arabia until she moved to Houston, Texas at the age of eleven. She graduated from the University of Houston with a degree in Architecture, and dedicated a couple of summers to teach high school students how to design buildings (not that she really had the credentials to do so). She has a weakness for makeshift shelters, hand-crafted signs, and odd renovation projects.   Katherine Don holds a B.A. in biological anthropology from Northwestern University. After graduation she meandered about in indecision, initiated short-lived careers in publishing, nonprofit management, and social work, and freelance wrote for books published by such houses as Publications International and St. Martin's Press. She believes that effective journalism must always couple with compelling narrative, and looks forward to the opportunity to prove this premise through her own writing. She is easily and overly amused by phenomena such as the triple consecutive appearance of \"in,\" sentence two above.   Clara Kim graduated from Columbia College, with B.A. in English literature and a visual art minor. After college, she went back to Korea, the country she grew up in, and spent the past two years traveling around the coastal villages, teaching English at a North Korean refugee school, and working as a freelance translator. Curious about the way people dress and write, she is also loves drawing out the natural storyteller in others.   Andrew Marantz tried a bit of everything at Brown. His interest in philosophy led him to India, where he learned Vedic epistemology and how to eat with his hands. His interest in cognitive science led him to Nepal, where he worked on a hypoxia study at Everest Base Camp. His interest in the politics of mass incarceration led him to an upstate New York prison town, which then became the subject of his undergraduate thesis. After college, he followed the herd to Brooklyn, where he worked as a freelance journalist, researcher, and conversation starter, writing for such places as Slate, Heeb, and Time Out New York. Andrew thinks the four most overrated things in life are bars, World War II movies, Sonic Youth, and home fries.   Marta Mart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez studied Journalism at Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona because she wanted to write. Thanks to New Journalism she discovered that literary techniques were a great tool to explain our complex world. Unfortunately, Spain offers few opportunities for in-depth reporting, not even in important media such as El Pa\u00eds, where she interned. Not wishing to stay in the same place for a long time, she went to live in Berlin and travelled constantly because of her work at a tourism magazine. New York is her new boot camp, where she will look for stories about immigration and generational conflicts, especially between women.   Robert Moor completed his B.A. in Literary Arts at Brown University. Though his studies mostly consisted of writing strange, genre-bending fiction (with literary revolutionaries like Robert Coover and Thalia Field) and fiery, student-activist journalism (contributing to and editing the College Hill Independent, the weekly Brown/RISD student newspaper), his best work strives to combine the experimental spirit of postmodern literature with the factual constraints of journalism. He is currently thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail.   Lisa Peterson-de la Cueva betrayed her Midwestern roots by moving to New York to attend Barnard College. She has a master's degree in teaching, which she used while teaching social studies to junior high students in New York City and English to adult immigrants in the Twin Cities. Her transition from teaching to writing landed her in the field of citizen journalism, where she developed a passion for subduing rancor about its validity. She has published work in various Minnesota publications including the Twin Cities Daily Planet, the MN Women's Press, the Rake, and KFAI radio.   Carrie Rothburd earned a B.A. in fine arts/photography in her native NY before moving to Wisconsin, where she completed an M.A. in educational policy studies, interned at The Progressive Magazine (where she also worked as art assistant), and worked with community-based nonprofits. During subsequent stops in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, she finished an M.A. in fiction, began to ride dressage, and adopted two dogs, three cats, and a horse. Carrie earns her living as a freelance grant-writing consultant and writes company histories for a business encyclopedia.   Jenell Schwab holds a B.S. in anthropology from the University of California at Riverside. A natural wanderer, she adopted the high Sierra Nevada as a home where she wrote furiously for a ski town press. Life was copasetic until she happened upon a rabbit hole that led her to trade the \"landlubbing\" lifestyle for a whirlwind tour of the domestic, offshore oil industry. She has been occupied recently by road trips, sailing in Puget Sound and dodging cacti in the Sonoran Desert.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Victoria Beale is a journalist who has worked in the UK, Canada and the US. Her most recent reporting project was a story about ten and eleven year old boys tried on conspiracy to murder charges in rural Washington state, for Buzzfeed Longform. David Grann described the article as \"Deeply reported, disturbing, important,\" and it was chosen as one of The New Yorker's Weekend Reads. Since graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in English Lit she has written for the New Republic on phone hacking and the London riots, for the Economist on Rebecca West and Greek cinema, as well as for the Guardian on Newcastle, bad literary marriages, and watching the same film every day for a year. She\u2019s also reviewed books for the Financial Times, Independent, and New York Times. For the last year she has been a research assistant to Patrick Radden Keefe, working on background for his articles about mining corruption in Guinea, marijuana legalisation in Washington and Colorado, and more recently pieces on insider trading in New York hedge funds as well as Swiss banks and offshore accounts. Alex Brokaw received his B.A. in English and Creative Writing from Emory University in 2011. Following school he helped run a literary journal before taking work as a copywriter. Then, after someone asked him if he wouldn\u2019t mind writing a few articles, he began as a financial reporter. The work was enjoyable, and he continued as a reporter on and off for the next two years, covering areas such as agribusiness, global trade, and emerging economies. Somewhere along the line he ran across digital currencies, didn\u2019t pay too much attention, and then, months later came back around. He\u2019s been building his coverage of the emerging space ever since. He\u2019s particularly interested in the impact of the technology behind digital currencies to things that do and don\u2019t have to do with money. Jaspal Chana is a recent graduate of the University of Durham with a degree in Theology &amp; Religion. During this time he has spent a year living in Sweden, interned at an English language newspaper in Dubai, written a number of commentary pieces for the university newspaper and featured as a fortnightly columnist on a student website writing about the artistic value of various aspects of popular culture. Through his studies he has become particularly interested in the role of religion in the American political system as well as the relationship between personal identity, nation and culture, which he hopes to explore through the religion/journalism program at NYU. Michelle Kim is a native of South Korea and has worked at the Seoul bureau of Thomson Reuters for the past year. She wrote a number of features on North Korea, especially on the regime\u2019s human rights abuse and the reunion of war-torn families. While interviewing North Korean defectors, she found the lighter conversations they shared just as intriguing as their harrowing accounts of midnight escapes and prison camp atrocities. Their hopes for marriage and family, what school life was like in a democratic society and the new dreams they cultivated\u2014these topics were not shocking news items, but added personality to each of their tales. So during her time at NYU, she hopes to bond with North Korean defectors who may be living in the New York area and write longer, detailed narratives of each individual\u2019s experience. Michelle earned a B.A. in International Studies from Ewha Womans University in 2013, with concentrations in Diplomacy and Asian Studies. She loves the smell of old library books and reading her favorite novels over and over again. With roots in Washington, D.C. and Stuttgart, Germany, Natalie Lampert has traveled and written her way through thirty countries. Despite this, she still struggles using chopsticks. Natalie received her B.A. in English and International Relations from Elon University in 2011. She has worked in a variety of writing environments, including as a reporter for an Austrian newspaper, as managing editor of her college\u2019s literary journal, and as an intern at a publishing house in Sri Lanka. As a 2012-2013 Fulbright scholar in Sri Lanka, Natalie taught contemporary literature at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. She works during summer months for National Geographic, leading student expeditions focused on creative writing and photography. At NYU, she plans to write about meditation and its practitioners, exploring the juxtaposition of insight meditation\u2019s increasing popularity in urban epicenters such as New York City and the rise of Buddhist extremism in South Asia. Hannah McCarthy is a graduate of Bennington College, where she earned her B.A. in Philosophy and Theatre. After completing her thesis work on Brecht and the power of the theatrical event, she became interested in community ritual and the theatrics of religious worship. Writing for the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Gazette, Hannah explored the peculiar rites of the insular year-round community of artists, business owners and fisherman. She spent the following year travelling the U.S. in a beat-up white 2001 Odyssey (named Hal), researching religion and the desire for community across generations and geographies. In the late nights and wee morning hours between farming, fundraising for a couple of non-profits and working as a film producer, Hannah has written about these various microcosms. She intends to continue this work while at NYU, concentrating the shifting liturgical landscape of a spiritually displaced younger generation. Michela Pfeifer is Austrian but - after studying in France and the UK and working as a \u201cspin doctor\u201d in the European Parliament in Brussels for several years\u2013 she would more appropriately define herself as a \u201cEuropean above all\u201d. After ghost-writing speeches and articles for politicians, mainly in the field of human rights and the Middle East, she turned to journalism after reporting on her recent trip to South America in Revolve, a Brussels-based environmentalist magazine. She has notably written on renewable energy, environment and sustainability, democracy and fundamental rights. In \u201canother\u201d life, she spent six months learning yoga in India, worked in banking in the Principality of Liechtenstein and was a member of the Austrian national gymnastics team. Michela speaks German, English, French and Spanish and holds a degree in Foreign Languages with Business, a postgraduate in Translating for Cinema and a MA in International Politics from the University of Paris-South. Raella Rayside spent her entire life building her dance career. She loved the idea of evoking emotion with nothing but her body, and tirelessly studied technique and body conditioning to become an expert at it. She started at NYU as a dance major, but under her parent\u2019s insistence and her conscience\u2019s pleas for something more stable she wandered into an introductory journalism class. It wasn\u2019t until her second year that she discovered the art of literary journalism. She was enthralled by the ideas of long-form narrative and the personal essay, and quickly realized that she had a gift for storytelling on paper as well. Raella graduated in 2013 from NYU with a BFA in dance and a BA in journalism. She is excited to continue honing her craft as a writer and a narrator and can\u2019t wait to put pen to paper again. Renee Saleh studied modern literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz, a concentration that encouraged her study of the literature produced by socially and economically depoliticized ethnic groups. She became increasingly interested in the manifestation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict here in the United States, and particularly in the microcosm of New York City. She maintains an open-minded curiosity about the essence of identity and stubbornness inherent to a conflict such as this one, and hopes to eventually write long-form pieces regarding her own identity and relationship to the conflict. Post 9/11 Islamophobia is another interest of hers, as she plans to use that concept as one of many lenses under which she will parse the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Since graduation, she has had experience working with a couple different non profits, both of which were socio-political by nature and have solidified her desire to combine her love of the written word with greater social issues that have heavily impacted her own world view. Lindsey Smith struggles to flip pancakes, fried eggs, and other flat things in pans. She can't dance to save her life, and should stay away from singing in public, for everyone's sake. Despite these deficits, she graduated from Stanford University in 2011 with a BA in Italian and English: Creative Writing. In 2008-2009, she went to Lecce, Italy as a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar, where she studied sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology, and (bewilderingly) Spanish at the Universit\u00e0 del Salento. There, \"in the heel of the boot,\" Lindsey was first exposed to the complicated interplay between organized crime and social norms, a relationship that has fascinated her since and will anchor her research at NYU. After graduating, she worked in venture philanthropy in the Bay Area, vetting, selecting, and coaching a portfolio of start-up nonprofits. During that time, she also wrote on topics from family, to football, to books, for literary and philanthropic publications including, most recently, Narrative Magazine. As always, she is eager to learn and do so much more. In 1986 Giulia Alexandra Smythies was conceived in a small flat in the center of London. For six months prior to her conception, her starving parents had subsisted on nothing but small packets of jaffa cakes. Their baby was born fat and curly-headed, with an unquenchable thirst for chocolate. They named her Giulia, after an Alpine mountain range in Italy, the country of their birth. Without realising it, Giulia grew up confused about her identity. Not only did she speak three languages, have two passports, and live in Alabama, Italy, Seattle, and Germany, but nobody could actually pronounce her name. In 2012 her search for meaning led her to Aboriginal Australia where she connected with Mundanara Bayles and her elders, Lilla Watson and Mary Graham. In a speech given at the 1985 United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Nairobi, Lilla Watson is famous for saying, \"If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound with mine, then let us walk together.\" Giulia believes that a society is only as healthy as its sickest member and that as long as there is injustice for some, there will be suffering by all. She is at NYU to learn the art of creating change. Cleuci de Oliveira hails from Brasilia, Brazil. She earned a B.S. in Studio Art at NYU and followed it up with an M.A. in History of Art at University College London. After working in the UK arts sector for several years, Cleuci made a career change into journalism. She has written for print and online publications in her native Brazil. Currently, she works for Cracked.com, both as a moderator for its Writers\u2019 Workshop and as a reporter for the more recent Personal Experience features. In the process, she has interviewed, among others, a Russian mail-order bride, the survivor of an end-times Christian cult and a woman with a neurological condition that prevents her from recognizing faces. Maggie Whitehead spent the past four years in Baltimore, Maryland working for the International Rescue Committee as a caseworker for newly arrived refugees. While serving a wide refugee client base, she worked closely with trauma victims and wrote individual histories to secure disability status for refugees with psychosomatic conditions. Prior to refugee resettlement, she lived in Tamil Nadu with a dozen mischievous teenage boys, who taught her bad Indian manners and the convoluted nature of English phonetics. Despite years of communicating mainly with limited English speakers, Maggie hopes to regain her vocabulary and put it to use. She is eager to unite her passions for writing and advocacy at NYU, and plans to focus her work around the successes and trials of human migration.
