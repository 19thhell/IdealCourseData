And a way of categorizing music for the sake of bringing it to market. Yet, there was a time that \u201csoul\u201d referred to a very specific kind of music in a very specific time and place. This course will trace the exciting history of soul music and the enduring culture that sprang from it, beginning with the rise of rhythm and blues in the \u201850s, through the turbulent \u201860s, to its crowning moment in 1967 with the arrival of its best-known avatar, the Queen of Soul -- Aretha Franklin. Through reading, discussion, listening sessions, guest speakers and video presentations, we will consider: the various definitions of \u201csoul\u201d, the roots of soul music and the stars of the style. How the music reflected the social and political spirit of the \u201860s, and predicted the triumphant future of black music in America. How the consideration of soul music necessarily raises issues of racial identity, conflict, and dialogue. How the continuing dialogue between white and black America takes place in a musical arena that we still label \u201csoul\u201d. We will also trace the gospel birth, \u201cpop\u201d musical development, and explosive arrival of Aretha Franklin \u2013 the \u201cNatural Woman\u201d whose voice delivered Soul into mainstream popularity and brought African American authenticity into the popular realm. We will look at the many ways that soul music morphed after the \u201860s,giving rise to black musical styles like funk, disco, and hip hop, and focus on the evolving relationship of soul music and American race relations as well. This path of inquiry will offer a means to understanding the continuing impact of the music and culture of the soul era, as well as Ms. Franklin\u2019s continuing reign.

Sarah Dash is a founding member of the  groundbreaking R&amp;B harmony group Labelle \u2013 famed for their 1974 hit  \u201cLady Marmalade\u201d and fusing rock and psychedelic esthetics with  girl-group sound. She is also one of those great vocal talents whose  career \u2013 with Labelle and on her own -- reflects almost every twist and  turn in American popular music from the \u201850s to the present. In  her native Trenton, New Jersey in 1961, Ms. Dash\u2013 along with Patti  Labelle, Nona Hendryx and Cindy Birdsong \u2013 founded Patti Labelle and  the Bluebelles, the precursor to Labelle. Their sound expanded from the  girl-group sound popular in the early \u201860s, to embrace jazz standards  (much like early Aretha Franklin), gospel-flavored songs and soul  ballads. After hiring London TV producer Vicki Wickham to manage them  in 1970,Labelle infused their sound with rock and funk rhythms, and  updated their show to reflect the costumed extremes of rock psychedelia  (think David Bowie and Elton John) and the political messages of the  day (think James Brown and Yoko Ono.) Outrageous and  outspoken, Labelle concerts during the 1970s were NOT to be missed (and  their recent reunion tour is on the same level!) During this time they  opened for big acts like the Who and expanded their outreach to a  larger, rock-directed audiences. Ms. Dash went solo after  Labelle split in 1976, finding success with disco hits (\u201cSinner Man\u201d)  and R&amp;B ballads (like \"I Can't Believe Someone Like You Could  Really Love Me,\" with a full gospel choir backing!) Through the \u201880s  and \u201890s, Ms. Dash continued to place her voice in different contexts:  dance \"Lucky Tonight\" (featuring background vocals by Sylvester),  session work (with the O\u2019Jays, Chic and the Rolling Stones!) and even  rap \u2013 1985\u2019s Satisfaction, with the High Fidelity Three \u2013 one of the  first instances of an original R&amp;B vocal being a primary element of  a rap performance. Besides the current Labelle reunion, Ms. Dash  continues to be busy singing in the studio, in her church, and is  working on what will be her first gospel album.
