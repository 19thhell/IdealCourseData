Research shows that children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) don't show these same preferences for voices and faces. We are examining how differences in these early-appearing biases might help identify infants at risk for developing ASD. Using the findings of this study, we hope to be able to identify ASD in the first year of life to allow for early intervention and treatment.    We are currently seeking children 6 months old and younger who have an older sibling with or without Autism Spectrum Disorder. Participation involves 6 visits to NYU at Washington Square Park, once at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. Each visit consists of questionnaires and interactive tasks. An evaluation is provided at the 24 and 36 month visits. Compensation and small gifts are provided for time and travel.    Please follow the links on the left to learn more about each visit.
