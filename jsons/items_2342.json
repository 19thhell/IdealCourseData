A minimum of four courses must be taken within the Draper Program; the remaining courses may be taken in other departments and programs in the Graduate School. Extensive faculty advising follows students' course selection, monitors academic progress, and assists in the development of long-term goals. Exploration and innovative interdisciplinary work is promoted through the Draper Program's faculty, courses, and the unique relationship it enjoys with other departments and programs in the Graduate School. The Draper Program offers a combination of flexibility and rigorous academic training. Part of the Program's success results from personal, individual faculty advisement. Students are advised by the program's director and associate director, other members of the Program's faculty, and by selected faculty in the Graduate School at large. Advising extends beyond course selection and the master's thesis. An interdisciplinary graduate degree can be shaped to reach many different goals, and it is here that the expertise of the faculty proves especially valuable. Draper graduates move into doctoral programs, professional schools, and many kinds of productive careers, ranging from teaching at the secondary level to mass media production to Wall Street.

Although proponents would argue that these new methods are increasingly powerful, their use raises complicated questions about how decisions can and should be made, in realms from drafting a baseball player to measuring the effectiveness of a federal program. This course examines the history of quantification from the Renaissance to the present, with special attention to the ways new technologies and methodologies intersect with changing notions of rationality and causality. Topics include medicine, population statistics, legal contracts, philosophy, professional sports and gambling. Readings may include Bernoulli, Quetelet, Durkheim, Hacking, Porter.
