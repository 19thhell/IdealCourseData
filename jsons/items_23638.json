She received her PhD in Social Welfare from the School of Social Policy &amp; Practice at the University of Pennsylvania. She earned an AM (MSW equivalent) from the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago.   As a mental health services researcher, Dr. Barrenger\u2019s work examines the intersection between the mental health system and other systems of care: criminal justice, homelessness, substance use, and poverty. Her current research examines the production of risk for recidivism among men with mental illnesses leaving prison. She is also interested in implementation research that considers the community or structural factors that can impact the effectiveness of empirically supported treatments in high-risk environments. She received an individual NRSA pre-doctoral training grant from the National Institute of Mental Health in support of this research.   Previously, Dr. Barrenger worked in a community mental health center in Chicago where she supervised two Assertive Community Treatment Teams, developed a program to transition individuals from the state psychiatric hospital to the community, and worked on initiatives to increase communication between Cook County Jail and local mental health providers. These experiences in public mental health inform her current research agenda.   Dr. Barrenger\u2019s teaching areas include social determinants of health, human behavior in the social environment, qualitative research methods, and policy. She is committed to integrating criminal justice content into social work curriculum as increasingly social workers come into contact with individuals who have been impacted by mass incarceration.

She received her PhD in Social Welfare from the School of Social Policy &amp; Practice at the University of Pennsylvania. She earned an AM (MSW equivalent) from the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago.   As a mental health services researcher, Dr. Barrenger\u2019s work examines the intersection between the mental health system and other systems of care: criminal justice, homelessness, substance use, and poverty. Her current research examines the production of risk for recidivism among men with mental illnesses leaving prison. She is also interested in implementation research that considers the community or structural factors that can impact the effectiveness of empirically supported treatments in high-risk environments. She received an individual NRSA pre-doctoral training grant from the National Institute of Mental Health in support of this research.   Previously, Dr. Barrenger worked in a community mental health center in Chicago where she supervised two Assertive Community Treatment Teams, developed a program to transition individuals from the state psychiatric hospital to the community, and worked on initiatives to increase communication between Cook County Jail and local mental health providers. These experiences in public mental health inform her current research agenda.   Dr. Barrenger\u2019s teaching areas include social determinants of health, human behavior in the social environment, qualitative research methods, and policy. She is committed to integrating criminal justice content into social work curriculum as increasingly social workers come into contact with individuals who have been impacted by mass incarceration.

She received her PhD in Social Welfare from the School of Social Policy &amp; Practice at the University of Pennsylvania. She earned an AM (MSW equivalent) from the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago.   As a mental health services researcher, Dr. Barrenger\u2019s work examines the intersection between the mental health system and other systems of care: criminal justice, homelessness, substance use, and poverty. Her current research examines the production of risk for recidivism among men with mental illnesses leaving prison. She is also interested in implementation research that considers the community or structural factors that can impact the effectiveness of empirically supported treatments in high-risk environments. She received an individual NRSA pre-doctoral training grant from the National Institute of Mental Health in support of this research.   Previously, Dr. Barrenger worked in a community mental health center in Chicago where she supervised two Assertive Community Treatment Teams, developed a program to transition individuals from the state psychiatric hospital to the community, and worked on initiatives to increase communication between Cook County Jail and local mental health providers. These experiences in public mental health inform her current research agenda.   Dr. Barrenger\u2019s teaching areas include social determinants of health, human behavior in the social environment, qualitative research methods, and policy. She is committed to integrating criminal justice content into social work curriculum as increasingly social workers come into contact with individuals who have been impacted by mass incarceration.

She received her PhD in Social Welfare from the School of Social Policy &amp; Practice at the University of Pennsylvania. She earned an AM (MSW equivalent) from the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago.   As a mental health services researcher, Dr. Barrenger\u2019s work examines the intersection between the mental health system and other systems of care: criminal justice, homelessness, substance use, and poverty. Her current research examines the production of risk for recidivism among men with mental illnesses leaving prison. She is also interested in implementation research that considers the community or structural factors that can impact the effectiveness of empirically supported treatments in high-risk environments. She received an individual NRSA pre-doctoral training grant from the National Institute of Mental Health in support of this research.   Previously, Dr. Barrenger worked in a community mental health center in Chicago where she supervised two Assertive Community Treatment Teams, developed a program to transition individuals from the state psychiatric hospital to the community, and worked on initiatives to increase communication between Cook County Jail and local mental health providers. These experiences in public mental health inform her current research agenda.   Dr. Barrenger\u2019s teaching areas include social determinants of health, human behavior in the social environment, qualitative research methods, and policy. She is committed to integrating criminal justice content into social work curriculum as increasingly social workers come into contact with individuals who have been impacted by mass incarceration.
