The Clinic provides legal services to non-profit organizations, as well as to small businesses, entrepreneurs and social enterprises that may not have access to the traditional legal market and that operate in areas of concern to the public.   Course Description   In the Clinic, first offered in the Spring 2010 semester, students have worked on:     planning transactions and drafting contracts, memoranda of understanding, leases, promissory notes, employment agreements and other operating agreements;   reviewing contracts and other documents and advising senior executives and boards about governance and disclosure practices; and   preparing bylaws, conflict-of-interest, investment, social media and other board policies, employee manuals, committee charters, and similar documents.     We expect students in the Clinic will develop analytical, planning, editorial and counseling skills in the context of client projects and reality-grounded class work. Students will learn to understand legal documents as business communications and to communicate complex legal concepts, factual matters and tactical choices in simple, concise, organized and understandable ways.   The Clinic\u2019s clients include both non-profit organizations and certain for-profit businesses. We focus on providing practical and thoughtful support to senior leaders of these institutions. We expect that Clinic students will do great work for our clients. Finally, we want our students to see how business lawyers can serve the community by advising social enterprises and engaging in pro bono work, board service and volunteer activities.   The Clinic includes a weekly two-hour seminar, which focuses on the business lawyer\u2019s multiple roles in assessing, planning and managing corporate transactions. Most seminars will feature guest speakers, typically practicing lawyers who advise business executives on strategic decisions, or executives who work with business lawyers on transactions. Student exercises in the seminars will include negotiations, analysis of hypothetical transactions, and presentations of student work. In addition, the seminar will involve some substantive law sessions, including discussions of relevant ethical and not-for-profit law provisions and other areas that may be required for effective representation.   The following are some examples of the Clinic\u2019s work:     For a for\u2010profit company developing an app to fight hunger and eliminate wasted food, advised regarding compliance with the New York charitable solicitation laws, drafted collaboration agreements with restaurants and charities and revised website terms of use;   For a for-profit company producing animations to spread health awareness to at-risk communities, drafted financing documents for seed-round investments from friends and family.   For a for-profit software analytics firm utilizing big data to route enterprises more efficiently and analyze traffic data to promote public safety, drafted term sheets for potential partnerships with logistics companies.   For a nonprofit advisory firm that collaborates with government, funders and social services providers on social impact bonds, advised on structuring a proposed transaction.
