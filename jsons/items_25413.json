CREATE is engaged in research on the cognitive science-based design and evaluation of emerging, advanced technologies for learning, in particular multimedia, hypermedia, online learning, video, and mixed symbolic systems. CREATE works to develop approaches to the design of technology-based educational materials based on principles derived from theoretical foundations, implement models and examples of educational applications based on these methods and principles, and develop and apply methods and criteria for the evaluation of such educational environments. Faculty, doctoral, and funded research projects are on-going in CREATE, and all ECT students have opportunities to participate.       Visit the CREATE Website       dolcelab: Lab for the Design Of Learning, Collaboration, &amp; Experience    ECT is the home of dolcelab, the Lab for Design Of Learning, Collaboration, &amp; Experience . dolcelab is engaged in design-based research of learning and collaboration environments to support human flourishing in diverse areas such as information futures, knowledge-building, environmental education, innovation and engineering, and international development. Learning and collaboration are studied in socio-technical systems to support goals such as human dignity, empowerment, identity development, equity, and sustainability.

The Institute works to provide fundamental scientific evidence of \"what works\" in games for learning - what makes certain games compelling and playable, and what design elements make games educationally effective. The results provide critically important information to researchers, game developers, and educators, and point the way to a new era of using games for educational purposes.    The general research strategy of the G4LI has three prongs: understanding the design principles that make effective educational games; innovative research methods to study the impact of digital media on learning; and integration of these materials into both classrooms and informal learning settings. The initial focus is on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education at the critical learning point of the middle school years (grades 6-8).

CREATE is engaged in research on the cognitive science-based design and evaluation of emerging, advanced technologies for learning, in particular multimedia, hypermedia, online learning, video, and mixed symbolic systems. CREATE works to develop approaches to the design of technology-based educational materials based on principles derived from theoretical foundations, implement models and examples of educational applications based on these methods and principles, and develop and apply methods and criteria for the evaluation of such educational environments. Faculty, doctoral, and funded research projects are on-going in CREATE, and all ECT students have opportunities to participate.

Learning and collaboration are studied in socio-technical systems to support goals such as human dignity, empowerment, identity development, equity, and sustainability.

The Institute works to provide fundamental scientific evidence of \"what works\" in games for learning - what makes certain games compelling and playable, and what design elements make games educationally effective. The results provide critically important information to researchers, game developers, and educators, and point the way to a new era of using games for educational purposes.    The general research strategy of the G4LI has three prongs: understanding the design principles that make effective educational games; innovative research methods to study the impact of digital media on learning; and integration of these materials into both classrooms and informal learning settings. The initial focus is on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education at the critical learning point of the middle school years (grades 6-8).

Our programs are unique in their focus across broad learning contexts and in the linkage between design and research (including our studio-based learning approach).    Our master's in Digital Media Design for Learning and Advanced Certificate in Digital Media Design for Learning (formerly Educational Communication and Technology) prepare students to create, use, and evaluate media and technology for learning, from software and websites, to games, video and mobile phone applications. The master's in Games for Learning prepares students to create, use and evaluate serious games for learning and social change. The PhD in Educational Communication and Technology prepares world-class scholars to theorize and study the relationship between design, media, technology, and learning in a variety of paradigms: from social science, to design, to humanistic and cultural studies.
