All Journalism majors must also complete a second major within CAS, as outlined in the General Requirements for the major.   Note: Students wishing to also enroll in NYU\u2019s Study Abroad program must begin the Media Criticism concentration no later than their sophomore year in order to complete the program.   Typical full-time course of study   Fall Semester I   Investigating Journalism (JOUR-UA 501)   Spring Semester I   History  of the Media (JOUR-UA  610)   Journalistic Inquiry (JOUR-UA 101)   Fall Semester II   The Beat: Media Criticism (JOUR-UA  201)   One  or two Electives   Spring Semester II   Advanced Reporting: Media Criticism (JOUR-UA 301)   One or two Electives   One required lecture   Investigating Journalism JOUR-UA 501 No prerequisites. For the Journalism major and the prospective Journalism major.\u00a0 This is Journalism\u2019s gateway course, a lecture centered on articles and primary historical documents that have had profound impact on the course of American Journalism as practiced today. In addition, recitation sections will meet once a week for further discussion of the readings and the writing of a series of essays designed to assess students\u2019 understanding of important journalistic concepts and practices, as well as their potential as writers and reporters preparing for leadership in the field.   One required Media Criticism seminar   History of the Media JOUR-UA 610 Prerequisite: Investigating Journalism. Offered only in the Spring term. A historical survey of the media from language and the earliest uses of images to the Web. The emphasis, in an attempt to gain perspective on our own communications revolution, is on the reception, uses, and political, social, and philosophical consequences of different forms of communication.   Three required skills courses   Journalistic Inquiry JOUR-UA 101 Prerequisite: Investigating Journalism First-level reporting. Emphasis in this course throughout the term is on sophisticated reporting and research technique as students concurrently survey the various forms of journalistic writing, from the essay, to the hard-news pyramid, to feature writing to broadcast style. The Beat: Media Criticism JOUR-UA 201 Prerequisites: Journalistic Inquiry and History of the Media. Offered only in the Fall term. If the press monitors the powers that be, who keeps a vigilant eye on the fourth estate, a power unto itself? The \u201cbeat,\u201d in this case, is the newsmedia themselves. In this course, we delve deep into the issues and ideas that have engaged critics of the newsmedia throughout the modern era, from I.F. Stone to Ben Bagdikian, Noam Chomsky to Anne Coulter. More profoundly, we deconstruct their analytical methods and lay bare their agendas, critiquing the critics. This course involves a significant writing load, most of which will incorporate both academic argument and journalistic reportage. Advanced Reporting: Media Criticism JOUR-UA 301 Prerequisite: \u00a0The Beat: Media Criticism. Offered only in the Spring term. Advanced Reporting: Media Criticism is the concentration\u2019s capstone course, focusing on new media and the new conceptual paradigms implicit in them. Drawing on the body of theoretical and historical knowledge students have accumulated in the concentration, New Forms will ask students not only to analyze new forms of media, but to conduct their own experiments, exploring the expressive possibilities of various media. In the end, students will be expected to produce a long-form critique, heavily reported and rigorously argued, of a media-related issue. The project can be produced in print; online/interactive media; or other, experimental forms. As with all work in the concentration, the capstone project should engage the public mind, rather than an academic audience.   One required journalism seminar elective   Students must choose one journalism seminar course from the following list of theory/issues/history or media criticism offerings:   Topics in Media  Criticism (JOUR-UA 622)   Journalism  Ethics and First Amendment Law (JOUR-UA 502)   Any Journalism and Society course(JOUR-UA  503), such as Women and the  Media, Minorities in the Media, \u00a0and Covering the Earth.   Any Issues and Ideas course (JOUR-UA 505),  such as Reporting in the Line of Fire   Journalism as Literature (JOUR-UA 504)   Any Seminar course (JOUR-UA 401), such  as Entrepreneurial Journalism and The Journalism of Empathy   In addition to the six required courses listed above, Media Criticism students must choose two or three additional courses from the entire list of Institute electives to complete the 32 to 36 credits needed for the major.

Note: Students wishing to also enroll in NYU\u2019s Study Abroad program must begin the Media Criticism concentration no later than their sophomore year in order to complete the program.   Typical full-time course of study   Fall Semester I   Investigating Journalism (JOUR-UA 501)   Spring Semester I   History  of the Media (JOUR-UA  610)   Journalistic Inquiry (JOUR-UA 101)   Fall Semester II   The Beat: Media Criticism (JOUR-UA  201)   One  or two Electives   Spring Semester II   Advanced Reporting: Media Criticism (JOUR-UA 301)   One or two Electives   One required lecture   Investigating Journalism JOUR-UA 501 No prerequisites. For the Journalism major and the prospective Journalism major.\u00a0 This is Journalism\u2019s gateway course, a lecture centered on articles and primary historical documents that have had profound impact on the course of American Journalism as practiced today. In addition, recitation sections will meet once a week for further discussion of the readings and the writing of a series of essays designed to assess students\u2019 understanding of important journalistic concepts and practices, as well as their potential as writers and reporters preparing for leadership in the field.   One required Media Criticism seminar   History of the Media JOUR-UA 610 Prerequisite: Investigating Journalism. Offered only in the Spring term. A historical survey of the media from language and the earliest uses of images to the Web. The emphasis, in an attempt to gain perspective on our own communications revolution, is on the reception, uses, and political, social, and philosophical consequences of different forms of communication.   Three required skills courses   Journalistic Inquiry JOUR-UA 101 Prerequisite: Investigating Journalism First-level reporting. Emphasis in this course throughout the term is on sophisticated reporting and research technique as students concurrently survey the various forms of journalistic writing, from the essay, to the hard-news pyramid, to feature writing to broadcast style. The Beat: Media Criticism JOUR-UA 201 Prerequisites: Journalistic Inquiry and History of the Media. Offered only in the Fall term. If the press monitors the powers that be, who keeps a vigilant eye on the fourth estate, a power unto itself? The \u201cbeat,\u201d in this case, is the newsmedia themselves. In this course, we delve deep into the issues and ideas that have engaged critics of the newsmedia throughout the modern era, from I.F. Stone to Ben Bagdikian, Noam Chomsky to Anne Coulter. More profoundly, we deconstruct their analytical methods and lay bare their agendas, critiquing the critics. This course involves a significant writing load, most of which will incorporate both academic argument and journalistic reportage. Advanced Reporting: Media Criticism JOUR-UA 301 Prerequisite: \u00a0The Beat: Media Criticism. Offered only in the Spring term. Advanced Reporting: Media Criticism is the concentration\u2019s capstone course, focusing on new media and the new conceptual paradigms implicit in them. Drawing on the body of theoretical and historical knowledge students have accumulated in the concentration, New Forms will ask students not only to analyze new forms of media, but to conduct their own experiments, exploring the expressive possibilities of various media. In the end, students will be expected to produce a long-form critique, heavily reported and rigorously argued, of a media-related issue. The project can be produced in print; online/interactive media; or other, experimental forms. As with all work in the concentration, the capstone project should engage the public mind, rather than an academic audience.   One required journalism seminar elective   Students must choose one journalism seminar course from the following list of theory/issues/history or media criticism offerings:   Topics in Media  Criticism (JOUR-UA 622)   Journalism  Ethics and First Amendment Law (JOUR-UA 502)   Any Journalism and Society course(JOUR-UA  503), such as Women and the  Media, Minorities in the Media, \u00a0and Covering the Earth.   Any Issues and Ideas course (JOUR-UA 505),  such as Reporting in the Line of Fire   Journalism as Literature (JOUR-UA 504)   Any Seminar course (JOUR-UA 401), such  as Entrepreneurial Journalism and The Journalism of Empathy   In addition to the six required courses listed above, Media Criticism students must choose two or three additional courses from the entire list of Institute electives to complete the 32 to 36 credits needed for the major.

Drawing on disparate schools of thought, from Plato to postmodernism, Bagdikian to Baudrillard, the Media Criticism concentration examines the social roles, cultural effects, philosophical implications, corporate influences, and ideological agendas of the media.   This concentration brings a new approach to the study of the mass media, combining analytical strategies associated with press criticism, media theory, and cultural studies with a focus on new media and the radical ways in which they are transforming our social worlds, economic landscape, and cultural environment.   The Media Criticism concentration insists on deep historical knowledge and a fluency in the major theoretical approaches to media analysis. At the same time, it is founded on the cornerstone journalistic values of factuality, balance, and clarity. Students learn to communicate their critical insights not in academic papers but in exhaustively reported, clearly written articles, essays, and works in broadcast or online media that are both about the media and examples of mass media.   Media Criticism graduates will be well prepared for lives as critically engaged citizens of a mass-media society; as public intellectuals, speaking about the media to the wider world beyond the academy; or as scholars teaching and writing about the media in an academic context.

One required Media Criticism seminar   History of the Media JOUR-UA 610 Prerequisite: Investigating Journalism. Offered only in the Spring term. A historical survey of the media from language and the earliest uses of images to the Web. The emphasis, in an attempt to gain perspective on our own communications revolution, is on the reception, uses, and political, social, and philosophical consequences of different forms of communication.   Three required skills courses   Journalistic Inquiry JOUR-UA 101 Prerequisite: Investigating Journalism First-level reporting. Emphasis in this course throughout the term is on sophisticated reporting and research technique as students concurrently survey the various forms of journalistic writing, from the essay, to the hard-news pyramid, to feature writing to broadcast style. The Beat: Media Criticism JOUR-UA 201 Prerequisites: Journalistic Inquiry and History of the Media. Offered only in the Fall term. If the press monitors the powers that be, who keeps a vigilant eye on the fourth estate, a power unto itself? The \u201cbeat,\u201d in this case, is the newsmedia themselves. In this course, we delve deep into the issues and ideas that have engaged critics of the newsmedia throughout the modern era, from I.F. Stone to Ben Bagdikian, Noam Chomsky to Anne Coulter. More profoundly, we deconstruct their analytical methods and lay bare their agendas, critiquing the critics. This course involves a significant writing load, most of which will incorporate both academic argument and journalistic reportage. Advanced Reporting: Media Criticism JOUR-UA 301 Prerequisite: \u00a0The Beat: Media Criticism. Offered only in the Spring term. Advanced Reporting: Media Criticism is the concentration\u2019s capstone course, focusing on new media and the new conceptual paradigms implicit in them. Drawing on the body of theoretical and historical knowledge students have accumulated in the concentration, New Forms will ask students not only to analyze new forms of media, but to conduct their own experiments, exploring the expressive possibilities of various media. In the end, students will be expected to produce a long-form critique, heavily reported and rigorously argued, of a media-related issue. The project can be produced in print; online/interactive media; or other, experimental forms. As with all work in the concentration, the capstone project should engage the public mind, rather than an academic audience.   One required journalism seminar elective   Students must choose one journalism seminar course from the following list of theory/issues/history or media criticism offerings:   Topics in Media  Criticism (JOUR-UA 622)   Journalism  Ethics and First Amendment Law (JOUR-UA 502)   Any Journalism and Society course(JOUR-UA  503), such as Women and the  Media, Minorities in the Media, \u00a0and Covering the Earth.

Drawing on disparate schools of thought, from Plato to postmodernism, Bagdikian to Baudrillard, the Media Criticism concentration examines the social roles, cultural effects, philosophical implications, corporate influences, and ideological agendas of the media.   This concentration brings a new approach to the study of the mass media, combining analytical strategies associated with press criticism, media theory, and cultural studies with a focus on new media and the radical ways in which they are transforming our social worlds, economic landscape, and cultural environment.   The Media Criticism concentration insists on deep historical knowledge and a fluency in the major theoretical approaches to media analysis. At the same time, it is founded on the cornerstone journalistic values of factuality, balance, and clarity. Students learn to communicate their critical insights not in academic papers but in exhaustively reported, clearly written articles, essays, and works in broadcast or online media that are both about the media and examples of mass media.   Media Criticism graduates will be well prepared for lives as critically engaged citizens of a mass-media society; as public intellectuals, speaking about the media to the wider world beyond the academy; or as scholars teaching and writing about the media in an academic context.

This is the Capstone course. Subject matter varies from section to section, but the basic skeleton of the course is the same across sections: the emphasis is on development of the ability to produce writing and reporting within a sophisticated longform story structure. The course involves query writing, topic research and reading, interviewing, and repeated drafts and rewrites, leading to a full-length piece of writing aimed at a publishable level and the ability of the student to present the reporting orally.   ---   \u00a0   You\u2019ve probably heard a variation of this before: We\u2019re no more aware of the media we swim in than a fish is of the water it lives in. In this class, we\u2019re going to question everything about our media (including that truism).   The goal: to achieve a heightened awareness of the media surrounding us and to channel that awareness into insightful, engaging, and well-reported criticism.   You\u2019ll hone your skills of observation and inquiry to analyze the social, psychological, and political effects of media in their various forms, from advertising and design to language, cable news, satire, and the omnipresent screen itself.   What stereotypes, clich\u00e9s, fictions, flatteries, double standards, and false equivalencies do various media propagate, wittingly or otherwise? What roles do fact and fantasy play in our media, including in our own writing? How do different news outlets treat--and spin--the same story, and how does that shape public opinion and eventually history?                                               Arthur L.
