Nationwide, there are approximately 1200 colleges and universities participating in the America Reads Challenge.   Building on the success of the America Reads Challenge, America Counts was initiated in July 1999 as an effort to improve student achievement in mathematic and assist students in mastering challenging mathematics, including the foundations of algebra and geometry, by the end of the 9th grade. Nationwide, there are approximately 300 colleges and universities participating in America Counts.     NYU's America Reads program began in 1997 with the placement of approximately 700 tutors in 43 schools in New York City School Districts 1 and 2. Today, as schools prepare students for careers of the 21st century, NYU America Reads has grown to include mathematics tutoring, expanding the program to NYU America Reads &amp; America Counts.     Currently, approximately 800 tutors are placed in 80 schools in New York City School Districts 1, 2, 4, and 13.
