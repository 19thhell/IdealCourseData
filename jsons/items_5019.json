Due to Italy\u2019s strong historical legacy, modern Italian artists and architects have gone through an intense struggle to break from academic models. Initially the new movements, such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau, arrived from outside sources, yet beginning with I Macchiaoli, followed by the Futurists, Neo\u2013 Rationalists, Arte Povera, and Transavanguardia, Italians were frequently originators of the discourses of new artistic movements. The tide of trends periodically seceded from traditions and then returned to them in critical ways, seen in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico or the wistful pavilions of Aldo Rossi. During the past decade Italy has produced several new institutions for contemporary art and architecture, including MART in Rovereto, the Museo del \u2018900 (Museum of the 20th century) in Milan, and MAXXI (Museum of the Arts of the 21st century), devoted specifically to both art and architecture, broadening the historical and critical perspective and providing a stimulus for the art of the future. The course includes two site visits in Florence, one day-trip to the Venice Biennale, one day-trip to Rome.

Cultures and Contexts: Italy - CORE-UA 9554 - 4 points                               In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

They struggle to direct public debate towards clearer visions of the day\u2019s challenges and to  keep our minds open to wider possibilities and different explanations. They excel at pointing out  the common fallacies of our age. Most often dissenters, in the minority in their own countries,  public intellectuals are deeply committed to independent thinking at (often) considerable  personal sacrifice. Simultaneously observers and participants, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d,  consensus builders and social critics, thinkers and occasionally active politicians, these public  figures are central to modern democratic dialogue. Not surprisingly, considerable controversy  accompanies the appearance of (many) university-trained professionals in the public sphere, and  the discussions they initiate have been characterized quite often by bitter and personal attacks.   This course examines the work and contributions of several prominent intellectuals in crucial  periods of contemporary European history over the 20th and 21st centuries, and considers  their important roles in public debate, policy-making and the political process. Their writings  focus on the important issues of their time \u2013 war and peace, economic instability, dictatorship,  European integration, organized crime, the collapse of European communism and post-industrial  capitalism \u2013 concerns that are still very much of relevance and debate today. Finally, the course  also considers the \u201ctheory\u201d of public intellectuals by looking at the writings on their own place  in society and on the models of participation that others, like them, have offered in the past.   The class has a seminar format with discussion of the principal works of a number of public  intellectuals and their biographies framing the weekly sessions. We will also explore the  historical context of these works and consider, with the advantage of hindsight, the relative  accuracy of the positions assumed in the past \u2013 did they really come close to \u201ctelling the  truth\u201d as we understand it today? The reactions of the public, of political leaders, and of other  prominent individuals are also examined to better consider the impact of these intellectuals\u2019  contributions and to appreciate the measure of their commitment to freedom and open  discussion.

Italy is well-known for being a family centered society.  What are the causes and consequences of this phenomenon? Since the 1960s, the family has  undergone a series of changes, due to the women\u2019s movement, decrease of marriages, fall of  birthrate, etc. Is the family loosing its centrality in Italy? According to some scholars, the family  is still one of the few shared values in Italy. The course will investigate the social function of the  family in Italy, from the political unification of the country to the present. We will also analyze  ideas of femininity and masculinity conveyed by the media and their connections to the idea  of Italianness. The imagined Italian community was constructed on the site of the female body  which was meant to epitomize a series of values such as fertility, health, prosperity, purity,  tradition, etc. The course will also map the condition of women and LGBT people in Italy today.

This course examines Florentine art and culture from approximately 1400 to 1600 in an attempt to offer a fresh assessment of the contribution made by the city to world culture.    The course is divided into three modules: the Early Renaissance Republic; Laurentian Florence and the Medici in Exile; and the Princely State. For each of these sections, selected artworks and literary texts provide primary sources for analysis and class discussion. Works by artists such as Brunelleschi, Masaccio, Fra Angelico, Filippo Lippi, Donatello, Leonardo, MIchelangelo, Vasari, Bronzino and Cellini, will be examined together with poems, letters, biographies and autobiographies written by Lucrezia Tornabuoni, Lorenzo the Magnificent, Machiavelli, MIchelangelo, Vasari and Cellini.   Lectures on Florentine history and art will complement class discussions of artworks and texts. Site visits will provide an opportunity for direction examination of key works of architecture, painting or sculpture and serve as stimulus for dialogue about these.

Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. This course will focus on Italian cities, including Florence. Conducted in English.

In the course, students will be introduced to the transformations introduced in current political regimes (both democratic and authoritarian) by media activism, and they will develop a closer understanding and a critical view of the Italian and international media-politics-civil society conundrums.     Sample Syllabus                                                                        The Renaissance of Two Cities: Politics, Literature and Theater in Florence and Ferrara - ITAL-UA 9173 - 4 points                               Due to the political fragmentation of Italy at the time, the Renaissance assumed many flavors and  different declinations in various parts of the country. The course focuses on two characteristic examples  of this diverse Italian Renaissance: Florence and Ferrara, from the end of the 15th to the beginning of the 16th century. The course thus aims to introduce students to the concept of a decentered Renaissance.   Florence was a republic, marked by prominent political discourse (Machiavelli, Guicciardini) as part of its  Renaissance. Even the powerful private patrons of the arts (the Medici family, essentially) were obliged  to compete with a vast, vivacious array of cultural agencies. As a result, even Medici patronage  encompassed both the popular taste for \u2018street poetry\u2019 (Pulci\u2019s Morgante ) and the \u2018sacra  rappresentazione\u2019 but also the more erudite refinement of neoplatonism (Ficino, Poliziano, Botticelli\u2019s  Venus and Springtime).   Ferrara revolved around the court of the Este, which was the sole cultural agency of the city. The  autocratic court generated scarce political discourse in Ferrara; rather, it sponsored a culture of lavish  and \u2013 at least apparently \u2013 hedonistic escapism. The icons of this culture are its theatrical achievements  (Ferrara resurrected the classical form of comedy), and its excellence in the production of chivalric  literature (Boiardo\u2019s Orlando Innamorato , Ariosto\u2019s Orlando Furioso ), which aimed to transform the  Renaissance city of the Este lords in a new, dreamy Camelot.

The course aims to develop the students' interest in, and knowledge of, international human rights; to explore human rights theory and practice; to introduce various human rights conventions and mechanisms, particularly the United Nations system; and to provide advanced instruction in several key aspects of international human rights, including the effects of globalisation on human rights, the question of the universality / cultural-specificity of human rights, and the so-called 'interdependence' of various human rights.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world.

The approach is multidisciplinary and aims at a comprehensive survey of the music theatre in the context of the Italian cultural heritage. Literary sources, musico-dramatic features, vocal styles are studied in connection with major works that best represent trends and genres in the Italian operatic tradition. Students are expected to master the distinctive characteristics of such genres as favola in musica, intermezzo, opera seria, opera buffa, grand opera, dramma lirico, and the basic elements of Italian versification. Students listen to and watch recorded operas and attend performances in Florence or other Italian cities.

Many photographers who have been utilizing digital cameras are turning (and returning) to traditional, silver-based film and papers. This intensive course is designed to introduce and explore the practical and creative applications of analog photography. Students will learn camera operation, composition principles, and metering techniques. Supported by a comprehensive lab facility, students will learn film processing and archival projection print enlarging methods as well as the basics of print finishing and presentation. Classes will incorporate critiques of student work, slide lectures of important historical and contemporary imagery, hands-on studio and laboratory demonstrations, and field trips. Students will be assigned reading for class discussion and relevant photography exhibits to view.   Students are required to complete a minimum of 4 hours of lab work per week (hours arranged by the student) in addition to regular class attendance. This course is designed to engage the student in a photographic dialogue within a productive semester. A lab fee is charged for this course.                                                                      Photography of Architecture, City and Territory - IPHTI-UT 1210 - 4 points                               City, territory and architecture have been, from the beginning of photography, privileged objects for its practice. Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.   Sample Syllabus                                Politics                                                  Comparative Politics- POL-UA 9500- 4 points                               This course will introduce students to the study of comparative politics, which is defined as the study of domestic politics anywhere in the world. As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.

It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

The topics covered in the first part will include the US vision of the new international order, the end of the old European balance of power, the Cold War and the division of Europe, the building of the Western alliance, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. The second part of the course will concentrate on contemporary issues ranging from the evolution of NATO to trade relations and the role of the dollar and the euro in the international monetary system. Particular attention will also be given to the challenges posed by the \u2018war on terror\u2019, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Conducted in English.

Presents a study of post-World War II Italian politics and society in comparative and historical perspective. Seeks explanations of Italian political development in specific historical factors such as the 19th century patterns of state formation and the experience of fascism. Comparative analysis seeks to show how the social structure, political culture, and party systems have shaped Italy's distinct development. Current and recurrent political issues include the problem of integrating the south into the national economy and state response to social movements, particularly terrorism. Conducted in English.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

It will offer a grasp of the history and changing geography of terrorism campaigns, their rationale and their resources. The latter objective will take into account the gender perspective and examine women\u2019s involvement in terrorist activities. We will approach this topic by analyzing terrorism as a strategy of political violence adopted in unconventional asymmetrical conflict. Here the violent action is communicative and instrumental to promote a cause that by choice or contingencies cannot be pursued exclusively through peaceful means nor fought as conventional war. The course will be structured as a series of interactive seminars in which we will address questions at the level of the individuals and at the level of groups: why do some groups use terrorism as one of several strategies, while others specialize in it? How do terrorist groups emerge? Under which circumstances do groups decline? Who joins a terrorist group? Under which conditions do women become active participants in terrorist campaigns? Why do only some groups use suicide attacks? To what extent do ideologies define terrorism campaigns?

Sample Syllabus                                                                      Modern Movements in Italian Art, 1860-2012 - ARTH-UA 9850 - 4 points                               This course investigates the scope of Italian artistic ingenuity during the past century and a half and puts it in reference to contemporary art movements. Due to Italy\u2019s strong historical legacy, modern Italian artists and architects have gone through an intense struggle to break from academic models. Initially the new movements, such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau, arrived from outside sources, yet beginning with I Macchiaoli, followed by the Futurists, Neo\u2013 Rationalists, Arte Povera, and Transavanguardia, Italians were frequently originators of the discourses of new artistic movements. The tide of trends periodically seceded from traditions and then returned to them in critical ways, seen in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico or the wistful pavilions of Aldo Rossi. During the past decade Italy has produced several new institutions for contemporary art and architecture, including MART in Rovereto, the Museo del \u2018900 (Museum of the 20th century) in Milan, and MAXXI (Museum of the Arts of the 21st century), devoted specifically to both art and architecture, broadening the historical and critical perspective and providing a stimulus for the art of the future. The course includes two site visits in Florence, one day-trip to the Venice Biennale, one day-trip to Rome.

Cultures and Contexts: Italy - CORE-UA 9554 - 4 points                               In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

They struggle to direct public debate towards clearer visions of the day\u2019s challenges and to  keep our minds open to wider possibilities and different explanations. They excel at pointing out  the common fallacies of our age. Most often dissenters, in the minority in their own countries,  public intellectuals are deeply committed to independent thinking at (often) considerable  personal sacrifice. Simultaneously observers and participants, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d,  consensus builders and social critics, thinkers and occasionally active politicians, these public  figures are central to modern democratic dialogue. Not surprisingly, considerable controversy  accompanies the appearance of (many) university-trained professionals in the public sphere, and  the discussions they initiate have been characterized quite often by bitter and personal attacks.   This course examines the work and contributions of several prominent intellectuals in crucial  periods of contemporary European history over the 20th and 21st centuries, and considers  their important roles in public debate, policy-making and the political process. Their writings  focus on the important issues of their time \u2013 war and peace, economic instability, dictatorship,  European integration, organized crime, the collapse of European communism and post-industrial  capitalism \u2013 concerns that are still very much of relevance and debate today. Finally, the course  also considers the \u201ctheory\u201d of public intellectuals by looking at the writings on their own place  in society and on the models of participation that others, like them, have offered in the past.   The class has a seminar format with discussion of the principal works of a number of public  intellectuals and their biographies framing the weekly sessions. We will also explore the  historical context of these works and consider, with the advantage of hindsight, the relative  accuracy of the positions assumed in the past \u2013 did they really come close to \u201ctelling the  truth\u201d as we understand it today? The reactions of the public, of political leaders, and of other  prominent individuals are also examined to better consider the impact of these intellectuals\u2019  contributions and to appreciate the measure of their commitment to freedom and open  discussion.

Italy is well-known for being a family centered society.  What are the causes and consequences of this phenomenon? Since the 1960s, the family has  undergone a series of changes, due to the women\u2019s movement, decrease of marriages, fall of  birthrate, etc. Is the family loosing its centrality in Italy? According to some scholars, the family  is still one of the few shared values in Italy. The course will investigate the social function of the  family in Italy, from the political unification of the country to the present. We will also analyze  ideas of femininity and masculinity conveyed by the media and their connections to the idea  of Italianness. The imagined Italian community was constructed on the site of the female body  which was meant to epitomize a series of values such as fertility, health, prosperity, purity,  tradition, etc. The course will also map the condition of women and LGBT people in Italy today.

This course examines Florentine art and culture from approximately 1400 to 1600 in an attempt to offer a fresh assessment of the contribution made by the city to world culture.    The course is divided into three modules: the Early Renaissance Republic; Laurentian Florence and the Medici in Exile; and the Princely State. For each of these sections, selected artworks and literary texts provide primary sources for analysis and class discussion. Works by artists such as Brunelleschi, Masaccio, Fra Angelico, Filippo Lippi, Donatello, Leonardo, MIchelangelo, Vasari, Bronzino and Cellini, will be examined together with poems, letters, biographies and autobiographies written by Lucrezia Tornabuoni, Lorenzo the Magnificent, Machiavelli, MIchelangelo, Vasari and Cellini.   Lectures on Florentine history and art will complement class discussions of artworks and texts. Site visits will provide an opportunity for direction examination of key works of architecture, painting or sculpture and serve as stimulus for dialogue about these.

Sample Syllabus                                                                        The Renaissance of Two Cities: Politics, Literature and Theater in Florence and Ferrara - ITAL-UA 9173 - 4 points                               Due to the political fragmentation of Italy at the time, the Renaissance assumed many flavors and  different declinations in various parts of the country. The course focuses on two characteristic examples  of this diverse Italian Renaissance: Florence and Ferrara, from the end of the 15th to the beginning of the 16th century. The course thus aims to introduce students to the concept of a decentered Renaissance.   Florence was a republic, marked by prominent political discourse (Machiavelli, Guicciardini) as part of its  Renaissance. Even the powerful private patrons of the arts (the Medici family, essentially) were obliged  to compete with a vast, vivacious array of cultural agencies. As a result, even Medici patronage  encompassed both the popular taste for \u2018street poetry\u2019 (Pulci\u2019s Morgante ) and the \u2018sacra  rappresentazione\u2019 but also the more erudite refinement of neoplatonism (Ficino, Poliziano, Botticelli\u2019s  Venus and Springtime).   Ferrara revolved around the court of the Este, which was the sole cultural agency of the city. The  autocratic court generated scarce political discourse in Ferrara; rather, it sponsored a culture of lavish  and \u2013 at least apparently \u2013 hedonistic escapism. The icons of this culture are its theatrical achievements  (Ferrara resurrected the classical form of comedy), and its excellence in the production of chivalric  literature (Boiardo\u2019s Orlando Innamorato , Ariosto\u2019s Orlando Furioso ), which aimed to transform the  Renaissance city of the Este lords in a new, dreamy Camelot.

The course aims to develop the students' interest in, and knowledge of, international human rights; to explore human rights theory and practice; to introduce various human rights conventions and mechanisms, particularly the United Nations system; and to provide advanced instruction in several key aspects of international human rights, including the effects of globalisation on human rights, the question of the universality / cultural-specificity of human rights, and the so-called 'interdependence' of various human rights.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world. Conducted in English.

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. This course will focus on Italian cities, including Florence. Conducted in English.   Sample Syllabus                              Music                                                  Italian Opera - MUSIC-UA -9121 or ITAL-UA 9170 - 4 points                               The course covers the evolution of Italian opera from its beginnings in Florence to the early 20th century with special emphasis on Monteverdi, Rossini, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini. The approach is multidisciplinary and aims at a comprehensive survey of the music theatre in the context of the Italian cultural heritage. Literary sources, musico-dramatic features, vocal styles are studied in connection with major works that best represent trends and genres in the Italian operatic tradition. Students are expected to master the distinctive characteristics of such genres as favola in musica, intermezzo, opera seria, opera buffa, grand opera, dramma lirico, and the basic elements of Italian versification. Students listen to and watch recorded operas and attend performances in Florence or other Italian cities.

Many photographers who have been utilizing digital cameras are turning (and returning) to traditional, silver-based film and papers. This intensive course is designed to introduce and explore the practical and creative applications of analog photography. Students will learn camera operation, composition principles, and metering techniques. Supported by a comprehensive lab facility, students will learn film processing and archival projection print enlarging methods as well as the basics of print finishing and presentation. Classes will incorporate critiques of student work, slide lectures of important historical and contemporary imagery, hands-on studio and laboratory demonstrations, and field trips. Students will be assigned reading for class discussion and relevant photography exhibits to view.   Students are required to complete a minimum of 4 hours of lab work per week (hours arranged by the student) in addition to regular class attendance. This course is designed to engage the student in a photographic dialogue within a productive semester. A lab fee is charged for this course.                                                                      Photography of Architecture, City and Territory - IPHTI-UT 1210 - 4 points                               City, territory and architecture have been, from the beginning of photography, privileged objects for its practice. Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.   Sample Syllabus                                Politics                                                  Comparative Politics- POL-UA 9500- 4 points                               This course will introduce students to the study of comparative politics, which is defined as the study of domestic politics anywhere in the world. As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.

It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

The topics covered in the first part will include the US vision of the new international order, the end of the old European balance of power, the Cold War and the division of Europe, the building of the Western alliance, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. The second part of the course will concentrate on contemporary issues ranging from the evolution of NATO to trade relations and the role of the dollar and the euro in the international monetary system. Particular attention will also be given to the challenges posed by the \u2018war on terror\u2019, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Conducted in English.

Presents a study of post-World War II Italian politics and society in comparative and historical perspective. Seeks explanations of Italian political development in specific historical factors such as the 19th century patterns of state formation and the experience of fascism. Comparative analysis seeks to show how the social structure, political culture, and party systems have shaped Italy's distinct development. Current and recurrent political issues include the problem of integrating the south into the national economy and state response to social movements, particularly terrorism. Conducted in English.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

It will offer a grasp of the history and changing geography of terrorism campaigns, their rationale and their resources. The latter objective will take into account the gender perspective and examine women\u2019s involvement in terrorist activities. We will approach this topic by analyzing terrorism as a strategy of political violence adopted in unconventional asymmetrical conflict. Here the violent action is communicative and instrumental to promote a cause that by choice or contingencies cannot be pursued exclusively through peaceful means nor fought as conventional war. The course will be structured as a series of interactive seminars in which we will address questions at the level of the individuals and at the level of groups: why do some groups use terrorism as one of several strategies, while others specialize in it? How do terrorist groups emerge? Under which circumstances do groups decline? Who joins a terrorist group? Under which conditions do women become active participants in terrorist campaigns? Why do only some groups use suicide attacks? To what extent do ideologies define terrorism campaigns?

Due to Italy\u2019s strong historical legacy, modern Italian artists and architects have gone through an intense struggle to break from academic models. Initially the new movements, such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau, arrived from outside sources, yet beginning with I Macchiaoli, followed by the Futurists, Neo\u2013 Rationalists, Arte Povera, and Transavanguardia, Italians were frequently originators of the discourses of new artistic movements. The tide of trends periodically seceded from traditions and then returned to them in critical ways, seen in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico or the wistful pavilions of Aldo Rossi. During the past decade Italy has produced several new institutions for contemporary art and architecture, including MART in Rovereto, the Museo del \u2018900 (Museum of the 20th century) in Milan, and MAXXI (Museum of the Arts of the 21st century), devoted specifically to both art and architecture, broadening the historical and critical perspective and providing a stimulus for the art of the future.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

They struggle to direct public debate towards clearer visions of the day\u2019s challenges and to  keep our minds open to wider possibilities and different explanations. They excel at pointing out  the common fallacies of our age. Most often dissenters, in the minority in their own countries,  public intellectuals are deeply committed to independent thinking at (often) considerable  personal sacrifice. Simultaneously observers and participants, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d,  consensus builders and social critics, thinkers and occasionally active politicians, these public  figures are central to modern democratic dialogue. Not surprisingly, considerable controversy  accompanies the appearance of (many) university-trained professionals in the public sphere, and  the discussions they initiate have been characterized quite often by bitter and personal attacks.   This course examines the work and contributions of several prominent intellectuals in crucial  periods of contemporary European history over the 20th and 21st centuries, and considers  their important roles in public debate, policy-making and the political process. Their writings  focus on the important issues of their time \u2013 war and peace, economic instability, dictatorship,  European integration, organized crime, the collapse of European communism and post-industrial  capitalism \u2013 concerns that are still very much of relevance and debate today. Finally, the course  also considers the \u201ctheory\u201d of public intellectuals by looking at the writings on their own place  in society and on the models of participation that others, like them, have offered in the past.   The class has a seminar format with discussion of the principal works of a number of public  intellectuals and their biographies framing the weekly sessions. We will also explore the  historical context of these works and consider, with the advantage of hindsight, the relative  accuracy of the positions assumed in the past \u2013 did they really come close to \u201ctelling the  truth\u201d as we understand it today? The reactions of the public, of political leaders, and of other  prominent individuals are also examined to better consider the impact of these intellectuals\u2019  contributions and to appreciate the measure of their commitment to freedom and open  discussion.

Italy is well-known for being a family centered society.  What are the causes and consequences of this phenomenon? Since the 1960s, the family has  undergone a series of changes, due to the women\u2019s movement, decrease of marriages, fall of  birthrate, etc. Is the family loosing its centrality in Italy? According to some scholars, the family  is still one of the few shared values in Italy. The course will investigate the social function of the  family in Italy, from the political unification of the country to the present. We will also analyze  ideas of femininity and masculinity conveyed by the media and their connections to the idea  of Italianness. The imagined Italian community was constructed on the site of the female body  which was meant to epitomize a series of values such as fertility, health, prosperity, purity,  tradition, etc. The course will also map the condition of women and LGBT people in Italy today.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world.

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. This course will focus on Italian cities, including Florence. Conducted in English.

The approach is multidisciplinary and aims at a comprehensive survey of the music theatre in the context of the Italian cultural heritage. Literary sources, musico-dramatic features, vocal styles are studied in connection with major works that best represent trends and genres in the Italian operatic tradition. Students are expected to master the distinctive characteristics of such genres as favola in musica, intermezzo, opera seria, opera buffa, grand opera, dramma lirico, and the basic elements of Italian versification. Students listen to and watch recorded operas and attend performances in Florence or other Italian cities.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      Photography of Architecture, City and Territory - IPHTI-UT 1210 - 4 points                               City, territory and architecture have been, from the beginning of photography, privileged objects for its practice. Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.     Sample Syllabus                                Politics                                                  Comparative Politics- POL-UA 9500- 4 points                               This course will introduce students to the study of comparative politics, which is defined as the study of domestic politics anywhere in the world. As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.     Sample Syllabus                                                                         Acton Seminar: Policies and Politics of the European Union - POL-UA 9595 - 4 points                               The European Union is a unique and strange entity. It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

Moreover, analyzing the Decameron of Boccaccio, we will consider the role of merchants and travelers in some of his novelle. We will highlight metaphors of traveling in the tradition of amor cortese (courtly love), stressing some images in the poems of the Sicilian and Tuscan School and in the Stil Novo, reading as well from Dante's Rime and Petrarch's Canzoniere, and not forgetting the Women Poets, such as Gaspara Stampa. Finally, we will discuss fantastic journeying to the Moon and spatial movements in the chivalric epic of the Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto.

Sample Syllabus                                                                      Modern Movements in Italian Art, 1860-2012 - ARTH-UA 9850 - 4 points                               This course investigates the scope of Italian artistic ingenuity during the past century and a half and puts it in reference to contemporary art movements. Due to Italy\u2019s strong historical legacy, modern Italian artists and architects have gone through an intense struggle to break from academic models. Initially the new movements, such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau, arrived from outside sources, yet beginning with I Macchiaoli, followed by the Futurists, Neo\u2013 Rationalists, Arte Povera, and Transavanguardia, Italians were frequently originators of the discourses of new artistic movements. The tide of trends periodically seceded from traditions and then returned to them in critical ways, seen in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico or the wistful pavilions of Aldo Rossi. During the past decade Italy has produced several new institutions for contemporary art and architecture, including MART in Rovereto, the Museo del \u2018900 (Museum of the 20th century) in Milan, and MAXXI (Museum of the Arts of the 21st century), devoted specifically to both art and architecture, broadening the historical and critical perspective and providing a stimulus for the art of the future. The course includes two site visits in Florence, one day-trip to the Venice Biennale, one day-trip to Rome.

Cultures and Contexts: Italy - CORE-UA 9554 - 4 points                               In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

They struggle to direct public debate towards clearer visions of the day\u2019s challenges and to  keep our minds open to wider possibilities and different explanations. They excel at pointing out  the common fallacies of our age. Most often dissenters, in the minority in their own countries,  public intellectuals are deeply committed to independent thinking at (often) considerable  personal sacrifice. Simultaneously observers and participants, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d,  consensus builders and social critics, thinkers and occasionally active politicians, these public  figures are central to modern democratic dialogue. Not surprisingly, considerable controversy  accompanies the appearance of (many) university-trained professionals in the public sphere, and  the discussions they initiate have been characterized quite often by bitter and personal attacks.   This course examines the work and contributions of several prominent intellectuals in crucial  periods of contemporary European history over the 20th and 21st centuries, and considers  their important roles in public debate, policy-making and the political process. Their writings  focus on the important issues of their time \u2013 war and peace, economic instability, dictatorship,  European integration, organized crime, the collapse of European communism and post-industrial  capitalism \u2013 concerns that are still very much of relevance and debate today. Finally, the course  also considers the \u201ctheory\u201d of public intellectuals by looking at the writings on their own place  in society and on the models of participation that others, like them, have offered in the past.   The class has a seminar format with discussion of the principal works of a number of public  intellectuals and their biographies framing the weekly sessions. We will also explore the  historical context of these works and consider, with the advantage of hindsight, the relative  accuracy of the positions assumed in the past \u2013 did they really come close to \u201ctelling the  truth\u201d as we understand it today? The reactions of the public, of political leaders, and of other  prominent individuals are also examined to better consider the impact of these intellectuals\u2019  contributions and to appreciate the measure of their commitment to freedom and open  discussion.

Italy is well-known for being a family centered society.  What are the causes and consequences of this phenomenon? Since the 1960s, the family has  undergone a series of changes, due to the women\u2019s movement, decrease of marriages, fall of  birthrate, etc. Is the family loosing its centrality in Italy? According to some scholars, the family  is still one of the few shared values in Italy. The course will investigate the social function of the  family in Italy, from the political unification of the country to the present. We will also analyze  ideas of femininity and masculinity conveyed by the media and their connections to the idea  of Italianness. The imagined Italian community was constructed on the site of the female body  which was meant to epitomize a series of values such as fertility, health, prosperity, purity,  tradition, etc. The course will also map the condition of women and LGBT people in Italy today.

This course examines Florentine art and culture from approximately 1400 to 1600 in an attempt to offer a fresh assessment of the contribution made by the city to world culture.    The course is divided into three modules: the Early Renaissance Republic; Laurentian Florence and the Medici in Exile; and the Princely State. For each of these sections, selected artworks and literary texts provide primary sources for analysis and class discussion. Works by artists such as Brunelleschi, Masaccio, Fra Angelico, Filippo Lippi, Donatello, Leonardo, MIchelangelo, Vasari, Bronzino and Cellini, will be examined together with poems, letters, biographies and autobiographies written by Lucrezia Tornabuoni, Lorenzo the Magnificent, Machiavelli, MIchelangelo, Vasari and Cellini.   Lectures on Florentine history and art will complement class discussions of artworks and texts. Site visits will provide an opportunity for direction examination of key works of architecture, painting or sculpture and serve as stimulus for dialogue about these.

Sample Syllabus                                                                        The Renaissance of Two Cities: Politics, Literature and Theater in Florence and Ferrara - ITAL-UA 9173 - 4 points                               Due to the political fragmentation of Italy at the time, the Renaissance assumed many flavors and  different declinations in various parts of the country. The course focuses on two characteristic examples  of this diverse Italian Renaissance: Florence and Ferrara, from the end of the 15th to the beginning of the 16th century. The course thus aims to introduce students to the concept of a decentered Renaissance.   Florence was a republic, marked by prominent political discourse (Machiavelli, Guicciardini) as part of its  Renaissance. Even the powerful private patrons of the arts (the Medici family, essentially) were obliged  to compete with a vast, vivacious array of cultural agencies. As a result, even Medici patronage  encompassed both the popular taste for \u2018street poetry\u2019 (Pulci\u2019s Morgante ) and the \u2018sacra  rappresentazione\u2019 but also the more erudite refinement of neoplatonism (Ficino, Poliziano, Botticelli\u2019s  Venus and Springtime).   Ferrara revolved around the court of the Este, which was the sole cultural agency of the city. The  autocratic court generated scarce political discourse in Ferrara; rather, it sponsored a culture of lavish  and \u2013 at least apparently \u2013 hedonistic escapism. The icons of this culture are its theatrical achievements  (Ferrara resurrected the classical form of comedy), and its excellence in the production of chivalric  literature (Boiardo\u2019s Orlando Innamorato , Ariosto\u2019s Orlando Furioso ), which aimed to transform the  Renaissance city of the Este lords in a new, dreamy Camelot.

The course aims to develop the students' interest in, and knowledge of, international human rights; to explore human rights theory and practice; to introduce various human rights conventions and mechanisms, particularly the United Nations system; and to provide advanced instruction in several key aspects of international human rights, including the effects of globalisation on human rights, the question of the universality / cultural-specificity of human rights, and the so-called 'interdependence' of various human rights.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world. Conducted in English.

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. This course will focus on Italian cities, including Florence. Conducted in English.   Sample Syllabus                              Music                                                  Italian Opera - MUSIC-UA -9121 or ITAL-UA 9170 - 4 points                               The course covers the evolution of Italian opera from its beginnings in Florence to the early 20th century with special emphasis on Monteverdi, Rossini, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini. The approach is multidisciplinary and aims at a comprehensive survey of the music theatre in the context of the Italian cultural heritage. Literary sources, musico-dramatic features, vocal styles are studied in connection with major works that best represent trends and genres in the Italian operatic tradition. Students are expected to master the distinctive characteristics of such genres as favola in musica, intermezzo, opera seria, opera buffa, grand opera, dramma lirico, and the basic elements of Italian versification. Students listen to and watch recorded operas and attend performances in Florence or other Italian cities.

Many photographers who have been utilizing digital cameras are turning (and returning) to traditional, silver-based film and papers. This intensive course is designed to introduce and explore the practical and creative applications of analog photography. Students will learn camera operation, composition principles, and metering techniques. Supported by a comprehensive lab facility, students will learn film processing and archival projection print enlarging methods as well as the basics of print finishing and presentation. Classes will incorporate critiques of student work, slide lectures of important historical and contemporary imagery, hands-on studio and laboratory demonstrations, and field trips. Students will be assigned reading for class discussion and relevant photography exhibits to view.   Students are required to complete a minimum of 4 hours of lab work per week (hours arranged by the student) in addition to regular class attendance. This course is designed to engage the student in a photographic dialogue within a productive semester. A lab fee is charged for this course.                                                                      Photography of Architecture, City and Territory - IPHTI-UT 1210 - 4 points                               City, territory and architecture have been, from the beginning of photography, privileged objects for its practice. Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.   Sample Syllabus                                Politics                                                  Comparative Politics- POL-UA 9500- 4 points                               This course will introduce students to the study of comparative politics, which is defined as the study of domestic politics anywhere in the world. As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.

It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

The topics covered in the first part will include the US vision of the new international order, the end of the old European balance of power, the Cold War and the division of Europe, the building of the Western alliance, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. The second part of the course will concentrate on contemporary issues ranging from the evolution of NATO to trade relations and the role of the dollar and the euro in the international monetary system. Particular attention will also be given to the challenges posed by the \u2018war on terror\u2019, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Conducted in English.

Presents a study of post-World War II Italian politics and society in comparative and historical perspective. Seeks explanations of Italian political development in specific historical factors such as the 19th century patterns of state formation and the experience of fascism. Comparative analysis seeks to show how the social structure, political culture, and party systems have shaped Italy's distinct development. Current and recurrent political issues include the problem of integrating the south into the national economy and state response to social movements, particularly terrorism. Conducted in English.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

It will offer a grasp of the history and changing geography of terrorism campaigns, their rationale and their resources. The latter objective will take into account the gender perspective and examine women\u2019s involvement in terrorist activities. We will approach this topic by analyzing terrorism as a strategy of political violence adopted in unconventional asymmetrical conflict. Here the violent action is communicative and instrumental to promote a cause that by choice or contingencies cannot be pursued exclusively through peaceful means nor fought as conventional war. The course will be structured as a series of interactive seminars in which we will address questions at the level of the individuals and at the level of groups: why do some groups use terrorism as one of several strategies, while others specialize in it? How do terrorist groups emerge? Under which circumstances do groups decline? Who joins a terrorist group? Under which conditions do women become active participants in terrorist campaigns? Why do only some groups use suicide attacks? To what extent do ideologies define terrorism campaigns?

Due to Italy\u2019s strong historical legacy, modern Italian artists and architects have gone through an intense struggle to break from academic models. Initially the new movements, such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau, arrived from outside sources, yet beginning with I Macchiaoli, followed by the Futurists, Neo\u2013 Rationalists, Arte Povera, and Transavanguardia, Italians were frequently originators of the discourses of new artistic movements. The tide of trends periodically seceded from traditions and then returned to them in critical ways, seen in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico or the wistful pavilions of Aldo Rossi. During the past decade Italy has produced several new institutions for contemporary art and architecture, including MART in Rovereto, the Museo del \u2018900 (Museum of the 20th century) in Milan, and MAXXI (Museum of the Arts of the 21st century), devoted specifically to both art and architecture, broadening the historical and critical perspective and providing a stimulus for the art of the future.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

They struggle to direct public debate towards clearer visions of the day\u2019s challenges and to  keep our minds open to wider possibilities and different explanations. They excel at pointing out  the common fallacies of our age. Most often dissenters, in the minority in their own countries,  public intellectuals are deeply committed to independent thinking at (often) considerable  personal sacrifice. Simultaneously observers and participants, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d,  consensus builders and social critics, thinkers and occasionally active politicians, these public  figures are central to modern democratic dialogue. Not surprisingly, considerable controversy  accompanies the appearance of (many) university-trained professionals in the public sphere, and  the discussions they initiate have been characterized quite often by bitter and personal attacks.   This course examines the work and contributions of several prominent intellectuals in crucial  periods of contemporary European history over the 20th and 21st centuries, and considers  their important roles in public debate, policy-making and the political process. Their writings  focus on the important issues of their time \u2013 war and peace, economic instability, dictatorship,  European integration, organized crime, the collapse of European communism and post-industrial  capitalism \u2013 concerns that are still very much of relevance and debate today. Finally, the course  also considers the \u201ctheory\u201d of public intellectuals by looking at the writings on their own place  in society and on the models of participation that others, like them, have offered in the past.   The class has a seminar format with discussion of the principal works of a number of public  intellectuals and their biographies framing the weekly sessions. We will also explore the  historical context of these works and consider, with the advantage of hindsight, the relative  accuracy of the positions assumed in the past \u2013 did they really come close to \u201ctelling the  truth\u201d as we understand it today? The reactions of the public, of political leaders, and of other  prominent individuals are also examined to better consider the impact of these intellectuals\u2019  contributions and to appreciate the measure of their commitment to freedom and open  discussion.

Italy is well-known for being a family centered society.  What are the causes and consequences of this phenomenon? Since the 1960s, the family has  undergone a series of changes, due to the women\u2019s movement, decrease of marriages, fall of  birthrate, etc. Is the family loosing its centrality in Italy? According to some scholars, the family  is still one of the few shared values in Italy. The course will investigate the social function of the  family in Italy, from the political unification of the country to the present. We will also analyze  ideas of femininity and masculinity conveyed by the media and their connections to the idea  of Italianness. The imagined Italian community was constructed on the site of the female body  which was meant to epitomize a series of values such as fertility, health, prosperity, purity,  tradition, etc. The course will also map the condition of women and LGBT people in Italy today.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world.

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. This course will focus on Italian cities, including Florence. Conducted in English.

The approach is multidisciplinary and aims at a comprehensive survey of the music theatre in the context of the Italian cultural heritage. Literary sources, musico-dramatic features, vocal styles are studied in connection with major works that best represent trends and genres in the Italian operatic tradition. Students are expected to master the distinctive characteristics of such genres as favola in musica, intermezzo, opera seria, opera buffa, grand opera, dramma lirico, and the basic elements of Italian versification. Students listen to and watch recorded operas and attend performances in Florence or other Italian cities.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      Photography of Architecture, City and Territory - IPHTI-UT 1210 - 4 points                               City, territory and architecture have been, from the beginning of photography, privileged objects for its practice. Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.

As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.

It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

This course, conducted in Italian, will present the Classics of the Italian Literature in prose and poetry from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, through a specific topic: the journey, understood either as a spiritual/existential journey and as a \u2018love\u2019 journey, but also as the real journey of exploration and contact or the imaginary journey. We will relate the topic's historical and social contexts and identities, and comment on the spiritual peregrination of Dante's Commedia and on the epistle of Petrarch's Ascent of Mount Ventoux. We will introduce the travelogue Il Milione (The Travels of Marco Polo), discussing the figure of the famous merchant and traveler Polo. Moreover, analyzing the Decameron of Boccaccio, we will consider the role of merchants and travelers in some of his novelle. We will highlight metaphors of traveling in the tradition of amor cortese (courtly love), stressing some images in the poems of the Sicilian and Tuscan School and in the Stil Novo, reading as well from Dante's Rime and Petrarch's Canzoniere, and not forgetting the Women Poets, such as Gaspara Stampa. Finally, we will discuss fantastic journeying to the Moon and spatial movements in the chivalric epic of the Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto. Through these texts, and constant cross references to the contemporary Italian classics (Calvino and Eco among others), we will study the origins of Italian Literature.

Weiler , who is director of the JeanMonnet Center, Professor Gr\u00e1inne de B\u00farca , and Ren\u00e9e Haferkamp , a senior visiting scholar at Harvard University.   The conversation touched on a wide range of topics, starting with the structure of the European Union (EU) leadership, which features two presidents \u2013 one, the president of the European Commission; the other, in this case Rompuy, the head of the European Council. \u201cDoes this institutional solution serve Europe well?\u201d de B\u00farca asked. \u201cIs the double-headed presidency working?\u201d Weiler asked a similar question about the recently created post of European foreign minister. Van Rompuy said his office is able to provide \u201ccoherence and continuity\u201d on matters involving EU-wide governance, and can work to build consensus among all 27 EU members, which, he noted, is particularly important in times of crisis. And the EU foreign minister, he said, is in a \u201csteering position\u201d for the EU as a whole in matters of diplomacy. He pointed to efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as an area in which EU members have been able to act in concert. Eventually Weiler turned the discussion to what he called \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d: the euro crisis. Is there a sufficient sense of solidarity in Europe, Weiler asked, to move the EU further in the direction of a fiscal union? \u201cHow much further will politicians be able to go against public opinion?\u201d Van Rompuy acknowledged that there are hurdles to overcoming the current crisis, but counseled patience. The EU, he said, has been built gradually. \u201cAt each stage there are difficulties, but never a step backwards.\u201d Each step is \u201cin the right direction.\u201d Is default by Greece a possible option? Haferkamp asked. \u201cNot at all,\u201d Van Rompuy said. \u201cBecause there is no alternative.
