Our close connection to the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and its physicians in clinical practice and clinical research at NYU Langone Medical Center encourages a truly translational approach, allowing for our research findings to be applied to the development of new patient care strategies to improve preventive cardiology treatments and outcomes.   \u00a0   History &amp; Leadership   The Vascular Biology and Disease Program was established by a generous gift from Marc and Ruti Bell in 2003. \u00a0Edward A. Fisher, MD, PhD, came to NYU at this time with a mandate to establish a preventive cardiology center and foster research, clinical, and educational advances in this area. \u00a0With an extensive research background in lipid/lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis, he was appointed both Director of the Vascular Biology and Disease Program as well as the Director of The Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease. \u00a0As the Leon H. Charney Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine, Dr. Fisher continues to lead these programs today. \u00a0In 2010 he recruited Kathryn Moore, PhD, from Harvard to join NYU and the Bell Program, where she is now Professor of Medicine and Cell Biology. \u00a0For over a decade Dr. Moore has worked to shed light on the pathways of chronic inflammation and dysregulation in cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and Alzheimer\u2019s. \u00a0Around this time the Bell Program welcomed the addition of Jeffrey Berger, MD, Assistant Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Surgery, an accomplished preventive cardiologist whose work in platelets and their roles in heart attacks further expands the research spectrum. His work on platelet activity in high-risk patients and the response of platelets to antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapeutics has contributed significant information on the role these clotting factors.\u00a0   \u00a0   Our Work   Working within a state-of-the-art facility in the Smilow Research Center, our group of distinguished researchers conducts basic science investigations into the factors important in the pathogenesis CVD and associated conditions. A highlight of our work includes the following achievements and projects:   (1) The cell biology of hepatic lipid and lipoprotein metabolism : Dr. Fisher\u2019s lab was the first to demonstrate the degradation of apoprotein B (apoB) as regulated by dietary fatty acids, a process that may also be regulated by insulin. Importantly, this non-proteasomal pathway may be dysregulated in insulin-resistance associated with type II diabetes or obesity, and thereby contribute to the over-production of atherogenic lipoproteins that increase the risk of coronary artery disease in these metabolic states. To further pursue the proteasomal and non-proteasomal regulation of apoB degradation, Bell Program researchers are using cell and molecular biological approaches on experimental models as diverse as cell-free systems and tissue-specific knockout mice.   (2) Investigation of the molecular biology of vascular diseases and non-invasive imaging techniques : The Fisher Lab investigates the molecular factors that regulate the progression and regression of atherosclerotic plaques. Our research relies on mouse models of atherosclerosis and current projects focus on the regression of plaques after the normalization of hyperlipidemia, and the effects of HDL on plaque progression and regression.\u00a0 To get at the molecular levels that regulate changes induced by the various experimental conditions in specific arterial wall cell types, our group has pioneered the use of laser capture microdissection to isolate plaque macrophages in order to study gene expression. Recently, by using novel mouse models and these powerful techniques, we have observed and reported that foam cells can leave plaques during regression and they require dendritic cell properties for this emigration. With collaborators at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine we have recently shown that HDL particles can be converted to nanoplatforms to deliver MRI enhancing agents to plaques to better visualize them. Our goal is to adapt these particles for molecular imaging purposes.   (3) miR33 Regulation of Cholesterol Efflux and HDL Formation: Dr. Moore and colleagues have revealed the role of microRNA 33 (miR33) as a regulator of cholesterol efflux from cells and the formation of HDL, and in a follow up project, Dr. Moore\u2019s lab demonstrated that these findings have highligan antagamir of miR33 can regress atherosclerotic lesions, and that miR33 antagamirs raises HDL levels and lowered VLDL levels in animal models. These findings reveal the important role that miRNAs play in lipoprotein metabolism and open new avenues for the treatment of dyslipidemias.   (4) Platelet and Hypercoagulable Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Disease : Within the Bell Program laboratory Dr. Berger\u2019s team studies platelet activity using various techniques, including whole blood and platelet rich plasma aggregometry, flow cytometry, hematology analysis, and molecular biology using the platelet transcriptome. The goal of the group is to use the platelet phenotype in understanding who is at risk for developing cardiovascular disease and to determine whether modification of the platelet phenotype can ultimately lower the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.   (5) Immune Reaction and Inflammation\u2019s Impact on Vascular Pathology : Dr. Moore and Dr. Fisher have been pursuing how specific molecules are drivers of the chronic immune reaction in cardiovascular disease. They have been able to show that a protein called netrin-1 can promote inflammation and atherosclerosis. Through new projects, Bell Program researchers are seeking to understand attributes of adipose tissue that may contribute to localized and systemic inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity by exploring the role of netrin-1 further.   With each step forward the Bell Program expands its integrative approach to collaborate with researchers conducting related work.\u00a0 We have recently begun working closely with researchers in the Division of Endocrinology at NYULMC including Ann Marie Schmidt, MD, Professor of Medicine, Pharmacology and Pathology and Ira Goldberg, MD, Clarissa and Edgar Bronfman, Jr. Professor of Endocrinology. With these distinguished colleagues we further investigate how macrophages impact diabetic-induced inflammation in atherosclerosis and obesity. We will also be working together on pre-clinical investigations of therapies to improve cardio-metabolic complications of obesity in the coming years.   \u00a0   Recent Bell Program Awards &amp; Honors   Dr. Kathryn Moore has been selected as Chair of the ATVB Leadership Committee of the American Heart Association for 2014-2016   Dr. Jeffrey Berger is granted The Leon H.

It kills more men and women in all ethnic groups in the United States than any other disease each year.   At NYU School of Medicine and the NYU Langone Medical Center, we are taking a multi-disciplinary approach to achieve our goal of diminishing the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. Scientists and physicians at NYU work together quite closely - investigators in The Marc and Ruti Bell Vascular Biology and Disease Program focus on exploring the biology of diseases of the vasculature, while physicians in the NYU Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease work to lower the chance of heart attacks by focusing on the treatment of the most established risk factors recognized today, which are disorders of the blood levels of the fats (lipids) carried by lipoprotein particles, such as VLDL, LDL, and HDL.   We are staffed by an expert faculty group who have extensive experience in both treatment and research aspects of lipid disorders and who are recognized thought leaders in the continuing effort to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors. Backed by a state of the art patient assessment facility and convenient consultative services at the NYU Langone Medical Center, we offer comprehensive risk assessment of cardiovascular disease and the formulation and implementation of a treatment plan directed towards the attainment of a \"heart healthy\" lipid profile. Once instituted, this treatment plan can often be conveniently maintained by your usual physician.

Our close connection to the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and its physicians in clinical practice and clinical research at NYU Langone Medical Center encourages a truly translational approach, allowing for our research findings to be applied to the development of new patient care strategies to improve preventive cardiology treatments and outcomes.   \u00a0   History &amp; Leadership   The Vascular Biology and Disease Program was established by a generous gift from Marc and Ruti Bell in 2003. \u00a0Edward A. Fisher, MD, PhD, came to NYU at this time with a mandate to establish a preventive cardiology center and foster research, clinical, and educational advances in this area. \u00a0With an extensive research background in lipid/lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis, he was appointed both Director of the Vascular Biology and Disease Program as well as the Director of The Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease. \u00a0As the Leon H. Charney Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine, Dr. Fisher continues to lead these programs today. \u00a0In 2010 he recruited Kathryn Moore, PhD, from Harvard to join NYU and the Bell Program, where she is now Professor of Medicine and Cell Biology. \u00a0For over a decade Dr. Moore has worked to shed light on the pathways of chronic inflammation and dysregulation in cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and Alzheimer\u2019s. \u00a0Around this time the Bell Program welcomed the addition of Jeffrey Berger, MD, Assistant Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Surgery, an accomplished preventive cardiologist whose work in platelets and their roles in heart attacks further expands the research spectrum. His work on platelet activity in high-risk patients and the response of platelets to antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapeutics has contributed significant information on the role these clotting factors.\u00a0   \u00a0   Our Work   Working within a state-of-the-art facility in the Smilow Research Center, our group of distinguished researchers conducts basic science investigations into the factors important in the pathogenesis CVD and associated conditions. A highlight of our work includes the following achievements and projects:   (1) The cell biology of hepatic lipid and lipoprotein metabolism : Dr. Fisher\u2019s lab was the first to demonstrate the degradation of apoprotein B (apoB) as regulated by dietary fatty acids, a process that may also be regulated by insulin. Importantly, this non-proteasomal pathway may be dysregulated in insulin-resistance associated with type II diabetes or obesity, and thereby contribute to the over-production of atherogenic lipoproteins that increase the risk of coronary artery disease in these metabolic states. To further pursue the proteasomal and non-proteasomal regulation of apoB degradation, Bell Program researchers are using cell and molecular biological approaches on experimental models as diverse as cell-free systems and tissue-specific knockout mice.   (2) Investigation of the molecular biology of vascular diseases and non-invasive imaging techniques : The Fisher Lab investigates the molecular factors that regulate the progression and regression of atherosclerotic plaques. Our research relies on mouse models of atherosclerosis and current projects focus on the regression of plaques after the normalization of hyperlipidemia, and the effects of HDL on plaque progression and regression.\u00a0 To get at the molecular levels that regulate changes induced by the various experimental conditions in specific arterial wall cell types, our group has pioneered the use of laser capture microdissection to isolate plaque macrophages in order to study gene expression. Recently, by using novel mouse models and these powerful techniques, we have observed and reported that foam cells can leave plaques during regression and they require dendritic cell properties for this emigration. With collaborators at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine we have recently shown that HDL particles can be converted to nanoplatforms to deliver MRI enhancing agents to plaques to better visualize them. Our goal is to adapt these particles for molecular imaging purposes.   (3) miR33 Regulation of Cholesterol Efflux and HDL Formation: Dr. Moore and colleagues have revealed the role of microRNA 33 (miR33) as a regulator of cholesterol efflux from cells and the formation of HDL, and in a follow up project, Dr. Moore\u2019s lab demonstrated that these findings have highligan antagamir of miR33 can regress atherosclerotic lesions, and that miR33 antagamirs raises HDL levels and lowered VLDL levels in animal models. These findings reveal the important role that miRNAs play in lipoprotein metabolism and open new avenues for the treatment of dyslipidemias.   (4) Platelet and Hypercoagulable Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Disease : Within the Bell Program laboratory Dr. Berger\u2019s team studies platelet activity using various techniques, including whole blood and platelet rich plasma aggregometry, flow cytometry, hematology analysis, and molecular biology using the platelet transcriptome. The goal of the group is to use the platelet phenotype in understanding who is at risk for developing cardiovascular disease and to determine whether modification of the platelet phenotype can ultimately lower the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.   (5) Immune Reaction and Inflammation\u2019s Impact on Vascular Pathology : Dr. Moore and Dr. Fisher have been pursuing how specific molecules are drivers of the chronic immune reaction in cardiovascular disease. They have been able to show that a protein called netrin-1 can promote inflammation and atherosclerosis. Through new projects, Bell Program researchers are seeking to understand attributes of adipose tissue that may contribute to localized and systemic inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity by exploring the role of netrin-1 further.   With each step forward the Bell Program expands its integrative approach to collaborate with researchers conducting related work.\u00a0 We have recently begun working closely with researchers in the Division of Endocrinology at NYULMC including Ann Marie Schmidt, MD, Professor of Medicine, Pharmacology and Pathology and Ira Goldberg, MD, Clarissa and Edgar Bronfman, Jr. Professor of Endocrinology. With these distinguished colleagues we further investigate how macrophages impact diabetic-induced inflammation in atherosclerosis and obesity. We will also be working together on pre-clinical investigations of therapies to improve cardio-metabolic complications of obesity in the coming years.   \u00a0   Recent Bell Program Awards &amp; Honors   Dr. Kathryn Moore has been selected as Chair of the ATVB Leadership Committee of the American Heart Association for 2014-2016   Dr. Jeffrey Berger is granted The Leon H.
