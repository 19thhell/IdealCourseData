The fellowship will focus on the different components of effective dental teaching and leadership: didactic teaching in small and large group settings, simulation teaching, and one-to-one clinical teaching. Other topics to facilitate professional growth include curriculum development, evidence-based dentistry, research and writing skills, and teaching with technology and project management.   New York University College of Dentistry is the largest dental school in the United States with the most diverse students and faculty. With many internationally-recognized clinicians, researchers, and educators on staff, T.I.D.E participants can be mentored in virtually any dental discipline. Participants will be expected to create a teaching portfolio, a capstone project for eventual presentation and publication, and other educational resources.

Also I learned how to design and develop curriculum and in using different educational technologies. A major part of the program was intensive training on improving presentation skills and acquiring leadership qualities of the educator.   Prof. Maureen has inspired all of us to be effective teachers. Her passion for teaching and deep knowledge makes our program highly informative and enjoyable. The faculty and administrative staff were all supportive and helpful. They were attentive and responsive whenever needed. We were treated professionally and with respect at all times.
