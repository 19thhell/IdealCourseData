the practice, history, and theoretical reflection of cultural heritage formation and preservation, especially in the area of material culture. Museums and organizations and institutions of cultural policy management make up the two fields of professional activity that are central to the program. Accordingly, the program follows two tracks: one focuses on museums as laboratories of cultural heritage production, the other on strategies of, and issues in, cultural policy management.   The notion of an internationally and cross-culturally &quot;shared heritage&quot; of material culture is the central theme of the entire program. The types of objects, and (museum) collections of objects to which this notion relates, derive from, and belong to, all realms and ages of human productivity. The academic disciplines studying these objects and collections, such as anthropology, archaeology, history, art history, history of science, and modern media studies, inform the wide palette of heuristic perspectives from which students investigate processes and traditions of cultural heritage formation and preservation. They do so through readings, classroom discussions, short research papers, and visits to professional institutions.   The museums that are currently being built in close vicinity to NYU Abu Dhabi's permanent campus on Saadiyat Island \u2014 the Sheikh Zayed National Museum , the Louvre Abu Dhabi , and the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi \u2014 are important objects of study, discussion, and visits in their own right, as are regional organizations of cultural policy and heritage management, such as the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage (ADACH) and the Tourism Development &amp; Investment Company (TDIC). Institutions such as these also offer opportunities for internships and Capstone projects . Courses and internships are available at NYU New York and at NYU's global sites.

How is &ldquo;the past&rdquo; recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage.

ANTH-AD 102J Anthropology of Indigenous Australia: Art, Politics and Cultural Futures                                                                   This course offers an introduction to some of the current issues in the anthropology of Indigenous Australia, considering a range of Aboriginal forms of social being, ranging historically and geographically and giving significant focus to the changing relationships between Indigenous people and the settler nation of Australia. We will explore a range of sites of representation and imagination &ndash; in the expressions of visual art, film, and the performativity of political activism &ndash; in studying how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms. While those in the dominant society thought at first that Aboriginal people and their culture would &ldquo;die out&rdquo; and later that they would or could be simply &ldquo;assimilated,&rdquo; we will trace a history of Indigenous people from urban and remote communities intervening on what W.E.H. Stanner called &ldquo;the great Australian silence&rdquo; and asserting their right to a cultural future. This will include assessing the contentious history of debates over the very rights of representation of Aboriginal culture and realities. This course will make use of several museums in Sydney, and a few prominent Indigenous scholars and artists will present their work relevant to the theme.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course focuses on the formation of the modern museum. Museums of art, natural history, science, technology, and anthropology are examined from a variety of disciplinary approaches that explore the institution and its practices with respect to governance, colonialism, nationalism, class, gender, ethnicity, and community. Visits to the museums and cultural institutions in the region are an important part of this course.

MUSST-AD 112J Multiple Lives of the Work of Art                                                                   This course focuses on defining the main functions of museums and examining how they relate in practice to their stated mission. The purposes, processes, and ethics of such fundamental tasks as acquisitions, conservation, installations, exhibitions, and interpretation are examined in detail with particular attention to how the work of art is perceived in its many different guises and contexts. The role of museums in our age of globalization are also be discussed. Some classes may be taught on site and individual museum visits by students may be required.

MUSST-AD 113J Shared Cultural Heritage: Policies and Perspectives                                                                   An intensive trade and shipping network connected many countries around the Indian Ocean with the Far East and Europe. Famous is the Silk Road, but over the centuries many other regions were also connected through trade. These activities left behind various cultural traces&mdash;in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, and archives. These cultural footprints are now considered \"shared cultural heritage.\" Important junctions in the network are often also recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites for their universal and global value. In this course students study the basic theory of cultural heritage and explore the various perspectives on heritage. Terminology like shared, mutual, global, and contested heritage are discussed. The acquired knowledge and insights will be applied in a research assignment at a World Heritage Site, Galle in Sri Lanka.

MUSST-AD 114J Museums, Communities, and Public Art                                                                   While New York City is known for its world class museums and endless array of commercial galleries, the mainstream art world in Manhattan is only half the story. This course considers a range of art practices and their relation to the communities in which they are produced. The professor brings the class to the Queens Museum (which he directs) to look at how an art institution can be engaged in the social issues of a community, and leads site visits to other city institutions both international and local in their focus. We also visit urban spaces transformed by art from Battery Park City to the subway lines adorned by the city&rsquo;s Arts for Transit Program. Fundamental questions addressed in the course include: How should a museum serve its audience? Should we use the same criteria to assess the success of an artwork in a gallery and on a subway platform? Which parts of New York&rsquo;s art world are transferrable to other international cities, and which are not?

MUSST-AD 115 Global Heritage Sites &amp; Universal Collections, Principles, Perspectives and Practices of Sharing Cultural Heritage                                                                   The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the theory and current academic debates on the subject of &lsquo;sharing&rsquo; cultural heritage from both a global and a local perspective. The course is centred around themes and case studies concerning the theoretical concepts of heritage as tangible sites, moveable collections and intangible practices. The course provides basic knowledge of the issues related to heritage management.

MUSST-AD 214JX Sharing Heritage of the Arabian Trade Routes                                                                              In the 17th century the Ya&rsquo;rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian trade network that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe. Long-distance trade left behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. These cultural footprints are now often considered \"shared cultural heritage\". Notably Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled, were named as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their universal and outstanding value. But what do these values mean and for whom? What makes historical remains heritage? What happens if \"universal values\" are not shared but contested? These fundamental questions steer us to understand the principles of heritage production and management. The Arabian trading routes provide an excellent context to explore the multi-layered and multi-vocal aspects of heritage. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.

MUSST-AD 215J Museums in Global Context                                             This course surveys the history and representational role of museums, from its origins in cabinets of curiosity formed during the age of exploration to the global proliferation of museums today. Our goal is to provide a critical framework to understand how and why museums have evolved and function in a globalized world. We will consider how Enlightment collecting practices led to the development of the &ldquo;universal museum&rdquo; in an era of colonial expansion and examine how this dominant model has expanded &ndash; and been challenged &ndash; over the past century. Among the issues to be discussed are: the organization and display of collections, the language and symbolism of museum architecture, the relationship of museums to their public(s), heritage and repatriation, cultural diversity and the politics of representation, and globalized collecting and exhibiting today. Classroom lectures will be supplemented by field trips drawing on the rich diversity of museums in the New York area.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course explores the consequences for art and scholarship of the recent museum boom and asks what might it take to produce a change of direction.

the practice, history, and theoretical reflection of cultural heritage formation and preservation, especially in the area of material culture. Museums and organizations and institutions of cultural policy management make up the two fields of professional activity that are central to the program. Accordingly, the program follows two tracks: one focuses on museums as laboratories of cultural heritage production, the other on strategies of, and issues in, cultural policy management.   The notion of an internationally and cross-culturally &quot;shared heritage&quot; of material culture is the central theme of the entire program. The types of objects, and (museum) collections of objects to which this notion relates, derive from, and belong to, all realms and ages of human productivity. The academic disciplines studying these objects and collections, such as anthropology, archaeology, history, art history, history of science, and modern media studies, inform the wide palette of heuristic perspectives from which students investigate processes and traditions of cultural heritage formation and preservation. They do so through readings, classroom discussions, short research papers, and visits to professional institutions.   The museums that are currently being built in close vicinity to NYU Abu Dhabi's permanent campus on Saadiyat Island \u2014 the Sheikh Zayed National Museum , the Louvre Abu Dhabi , and the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi \u2014 are important objects of study, discussion, and visits in their own right, as are regional organizations of cultural policy and heritage management, such as the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage (ADACH) and the Tourism Development &amp; Investment Company (TDIC). Institutions such as these also offer opportunities for internships and Capstone projects . Courses and internships are available at NYU New York and at NYU's global sites.

How is &ldquo;the past&rdquo; recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage.

ANTH-AD 102J Anthropology of Indigenous Australia: Art, Politics and Cultural Futures                                                                   This course offers an introduction to some of the current issues in the anthropology of Indigenous Australia, considering a range of Aboriginal forms of social being, ranging historically and geographically and giving significant focus to the changing relationships between Indigenous people and the settler nation of Australia. We will explore a range of sites of representation and imagination &ndash; in the expressions of visual art, film, and the performativity of political activism &ndash; in studying how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms. While those in the dominant society thought at first that Aboriginal people and their culture would &ldquo;die out&rdquo; and later that they would or could be simply &ldquo;assimilated,&rdquo; we will trace a history of Indigenous people from urban and remote communities intervening on what W.E.H. Stanner called &ldquo;the great Australian silence&rdquo; and asserting their right to a cultural future. This will include assessing the contentious history of debates over the very rights of representation of Aboriginal culture and realities. This course will make use of several museums in Sydney, and a few prominent Indigenous scholars and artists will present their work relevant to the theme.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course focuses on the formation of the modern museum. Museums of art, natural history, science, technology, and anthropology are examined from a variety of disciplinary approaches that explore the institution and its practices with respect to governance, colonialism, nationalism, class, gender, ethnicity, and community. Visits to the museums and cultural institutions in the region are an important part of this course.

MUSST-AD 112J Multiple Lives of the Work of Art                                                                   This course focuses on defining the main functions of museums and examining how they relate in practice to their stated mission. The purposes, processes, and ethics of such fundamental tasks as acquisitions, conservation, installations, exhibitions, and interpretation are examined in detail with particular attention to how the work of art is perceived in its many different guises and contexts. The role of museums in our age of globalization are also be discussed. Some classes may be taught on site and individual museum visits by students may be required.

MUSST-AD 113J Shared Cultural Heritage: Policies and Perspectives                                                                   An intensive trade and shipping network connected many countries around the Indian Ocean with the Far East and Europe. Famous is the Silk Road, but over the centuries many other regions were also connected through trade. These activities left behind various cultural traces&mdash;in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, and archives. These cultural footprints are now considered \"shared cultural heritage.\" Important junctions in the network are often also recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites for their universal and global value. In this course students study the basic theory of cultural heritage and explore the various perspectives on heritage. Terminology like shared, mutual, global, and contested heritage are discussed. The acquired knowledge and insights will be applied in a research assignment at a World Heritage Site, Galle in Sri Lanka.

MUSST-AD 114J Museums, Communities, and Public Art                                                                   While New York City is known for its world class museums and endless array of commercial galleries, the mainstream art world in Manhattan is only half the story. This course considers a range of art practices and their relation to the communities in which they are produced. The professor brings the class to the Queens Museum (which he directs) to look at how an art institution can be engaged in the social issues of a community, and leads site visits to other city institutions both international and local in their focus. We also visit urban spaces transformed by art from Battery Park City to the subway lines adorned by the city&rsquo;s Arts for Transit Program. Fundamental questions addressed in the course include: How should a museum serve its audience? Should we use the same criteria to assess the success of an artwork in a gallery and on a subway platform? Which parts of New York&rsquo;s art world are transferrable to other international cities, and which are not?

MUSST-AD 115 Global Heritage Sites &amp; Universal Collections, Principles, Perspectives and Practices of Sharing Cultural Heritage                                                                   The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the theory and current academic debates on the subject of &lsquo;sharing&rsquo; cultural heritage from both a global and a local perspective. The course is centred around themes and case studies concerning the theoretical concepts of heritage as tangible sites, moveable collections and intangible practices. The course provides basic knowledge of the issues related to heritage management.

MUSST-AD 214JX Sharing Heritage of the Arabian Trade Routes                                                                              In the 17th century the Ya&rsquo;rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian trade network that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe. Long-distance trade left behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. These cultural footprints are now often considered \"shared cultural heritage\". Notably Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled, were named as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their universal and outstanding value. But what do these values mean and for whom? What makes historical remains heritage? What happens if \"universal values\" are not shared but contested? These fundamental questions steer us to understand the principles of heritage production and management. The Arabian trading routes provide an excellent context to explore the multi-layered and multi-vocal aspects of heritage. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.

MUSST-AD 215J Museums in Global Context                                             This course surveys the history and representational role of museums, from its origins in cabinets of curiosity formed during the age of exploration to the global proliferation of museums today. Our goal is to provide a critical framework to understand how and why museums have evolved and function in a globalized world. We will consider how Enlightment collecting practices led to the development of the &ldquo;universal museum&rdquo; in an era of colonial expansion and examine how this dominant model has expanded &ndash; and been challenged &ndash; over the past century. Among the issues to be discussed are: the organization and display of collections, the language and symbolism of museum architecture, the relationship of museums to their public(s), heritage and repatriation, cultural diversity and the politics of representation, and globalized collecting and exhibiting today. Classroom lectures will be supplemented by field trips drawing on the rich diversity of museums in the New York area.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

VISAR-AD 155 Exhibition Industry                                                                   The success of Frank Gehry&rsquo;s Bilbao Guggenheim may be seen as the culmination of a paradigm shift away from the old idea of the museum as an art vault to a new conception of the museum as a programming center, a venue for high-profile temporary exhibitions, and a tourist attraction. This course explores the consequences for art and scholarship of the recent museum boom and asks what might it take to produce a change of direction.

the globe, in the past and present, have created images and other forms of visual communication and artistic expression that influence the way we experience the world around us. Their work often allows us to perceive nature, culture, and society with new eyes, revealing and mobilizing the deliberate and unconscious effects of images on the human mind, unraveling prejudices, building critical consciousness, and facilitating aesthetic pleasure and intellectual satisfaction.   The major in Visual Arts integrates studio art, art history, and critical theory. The studio art courses allow students to explore a range of different media and techniques including drawing and painting, sculpture, photography, video, and digital media.   Equally significant are the courses that deal with art history, visual studies, and art criticism. These courses guide students to think critically about the past and present of the visual experience; understand the genesis and development of visual arts in a wide variety of societies; and critically evaluate the visual arts in writing about them. Students are encouraged to take a variety of courses in order to comprehend the reactions to observed reality, the built environment, and the creative urge in a large sphere of societies. We aim to take advantage not only of the panorama of history but to tap into the rich visual cultures of the region in which the students are studying by linking them with practicing artists, art historians, art critics, architects, urban planners, and others who shape our collective visual literacy.   The NYUAD Visual Arts program is closely related to, and cross\u00ad-lists courses from, the pre-professional track in Museum and Cultural Heritage Studies, which takes advantage of the presence in the region of museums such as the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, and the future museums on Abu Dhabi's Saadiyat Island.

Gulf countries have witnessed an unprecedented construction boom since the beginning of oil exploitation. New cities have been built and old cities have been renewed, often with the help of such world-class architects as Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, and Constantinos Doxiadis. In Abu Dhabi, infrastructures, public buildings, and residential projects have been designed by Roger Taillibert, Benjamin Thompson, Norman Foster, and Zaha Hadid, to name but a few. Students contribute to writing the story of modern architecture in the city. They visit and document remarkable buildings, explore local archives, and reconstitute the trajectories of architectural forms and patterns. The final project is an architectural guide designed for students, faculty, and the Abu Dhabi community.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project. Students may also elect to participate in a capstone project with other students majoring in the arts.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project. Students may also elect to participate in a capstone project with other students majoring in the arts.

Taught by a collaborative artist, the course looks at collaboration as it has emerged from the recent history of art, literature, and science to become an essential method of contemporary social experience. Course projects and materials are based around the use of the iPad. Working with the device on creative, co-authored projects, students gain first-hand experience in considering how collaboration is structured and managed in the production of creative works and how a consideration of collaborative and interactive methods changes the way we think about the nature of the finished creative project.

Famous is the Silk Road, but over the centuries many other regions were also connected through trade. These activities left behind various cultural traces&mdash;in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, and archives. These cultural footprints are now considered \"shared cultural heritage.\" Important junctions in the network are often also recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites for their universal and global value. In this course students study the basic theory of cultural heritage and explore the various perspectives on heritage. Terminology like shared, mutual, global, and contested heritage are discussed. The acquired knowledge and insights will be applied in a research assignment at a World Heritage Site, Galle in Sri Lanka.

MUSST-AD 114J Museums, Communities, and Public Art                                                                                         While New York City is known for its world class museums and endless array of commercial galleries, the mainstream art world in Manhattan is only half the story. This course considers a range of art practices and their relation to the communities in which they are produced. The professor brings the class to the Queens Museum (which he directs) to look at how an art institution can be engaged in the social issues of a community, and leads site visits to other city institutions both international and local in their focus. We also visit urban spaces transformed by art from Battery Park City to the subway lines adorned by the city&rsquo;s Arts for Transit Program. Fundamental questions addressed in the course include: How should a museum serve its audience? Should we use the same criteria to assess the success of an artwork in a gallery and on a subway platform? Which parts of New York&rsquo;s art world are transferrable to other international cities, and which are not?

The course is centred around themes and case studies concerning the theoretical concepts of heritage as tangible sites, moveable collections and intangible practices. The course provides basic knowledge of the issues related to heritage management.

MUSST-AD 214JX Sharing Heritage of the Arabian Trade Routes                                                                                         In the 17th century the Ya&rsquo;rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian trade network that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe. Long-distance trade left behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. These cultural footprints are now often considered \"shared cultural heritage\". Notably Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled, were named as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their universal and outstanding value. But what do these values mean and for whom? What makes historical remains heritage? What happens if \"universal values\" are not shared but contested? These fundamental questions steer us to understand the principles of heritage production and management. The Arabian trading routes provide an excellent context to explore the multi-layered and multi-vocal aspects of heritage. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.

VISAR-AD 103X Introduction to Visual Culture                                                                                         Visual Culture Studies branches away from the traditional preoccupations of Art History towards new subjects and methodologies. It takes as its primary area of interest not works of art but other forms of visuality, such as advertising, fashion, comics and graphic novels, television, the internet, graffiti and tattooing, as well as the visual formulations of cultural, racial, and gender difference. Today, the study of visual culture is the focus of a vast body of scholarly investigation and continues to raise new questions in the wake of technological advances and a demand for visual satisfaction. This class offers an introduction to visual analysis in a world increasingly dominated by the graphic transmission of information, knowledge, and aesthetic experience.    Effective from Fall 2013, this course will satisfy the NYUAD Islamic requirement.

VISAR-AD 110 Drawing By Seeing                                                                              This workshop class is open to all levels of artistic experience. The premise is that customary perception (drawing what you &ldquo;know&rdquo;) is in conflict with aesthetic perception (drawing what you actually &ldquo;see&rdquo;). Each exercise reinforces an essential principle such as: &ldquo;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&rdquo; and &ldquo;dynamic perception results in an integrated, dynamic drawing.&rdquo; Students learn how to maintain a unified drawing while at the same time articulate detail. Later sessions address how to apply this experience to individual artistic goals. There are PowerPoint discussions of relevant examples of drawing from the history of drawing.

The course begins with the origins of the medium in France, England, and the U.S. in the 1830s, and proceeds to a broader look at photography throughout the world. Photography is considered as art, medium of communication, formulator of political and propaganda concepts, advertising tool, and aspect of popular culture, and students produce a portfolio of their photographs.

Our goal is to help students develop the skills of painting and experience it as an art form rich in possibilities for the direct expression of feelings, perceptions and ideas.

VISAR-AD 118 Types of Art: From Calligraphy and Stone Carving to Digital Type                                                                              Type Design is the art and craft of designing typefaces. From calligraphy and stone carving to digital type, the history of type recounts the discoveries and technological progress made through human inventions. While some typefaces are insignificant and forgotten, others will survive mankind, such as Futura engraved on the Apollo 11 plaque, left on the Moon. Some of typefaces were revolutionary, others reactionary. But behind each of them there was an inventor. Students will follow the &#39;traces&#39; and the stories of the type masters who shaped our visual typographical landscapes. Western and Arabic versions of typefaces will be examined and students will learn to identify and combine fonts on real visual design layouts. We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry. Typography and type design in the digital age will be investigated via practical exercises and printing workshops. The course will include calligraphy classes with the U.A.E. State calligrapher Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi.    Monday March 3 to Monday April 14 (6 classes during term time) will consist of a Calligraphy Course with Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi from 5-8pm.

This course explores the consequences for art and scholarship of the recent museum boom and asks what might it take to produce a change of direction.

Students explore multiple aspects of visual design from aesthetics to user interfaces and usability, with special consideration of signage in Abu Dhabi. They also develop graphic designs that respond to the Abu Dhabi environment. Practical exercises that emphasize visual communication skills are central to the class. Students become familiar with the design procedures at the core of successful visual identity systems, thus developing their skills in research methodologies, data gathering, analysis, decision making, brainstorming and creative solutions, team work and monitoring.

Any theme/subject and photographic style may be chosen as long as some access to that subject can be gained. Students explore how to approach their subject, develop a theme, and how to choose images that reflect their experiences. They keep a journal, and a final presentation will include a group of photographs and a short personal essay.

VISAR-AD 165J Gardens of Eden in the History of Art                                                                              The garden is one of the oldest modes of human intervention in the environment. This course explores the garden as a major art form by focusing on pictorial and spatial representations of the Garden of Eden. The Edenic Paradise of Genesis and the Qu&rsquo;ran where Adam and Eve transgressed against God gives access to thought about gardens in the ancient Middle East. As a foundational figure in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic theology, the Garden of Eden spawned a history of interpretation that helped differentiate these religions. The history of Eden in the art of the peoples of the book is closely entwined with that of garden design, and the seminar examines both. We will study gardens in ancient Mesopotamia, early Christian monasteries, Syrian and Andalusian courtyards, Renaissance altarpieces, Enlightenment cities, Persian court miniatures, Mughal tomb complexes, and early American towns. To analyze these works, the course introduces fundamental methods of art history as an academic discipline. The seminar includes field trips to gardens and collections in the UAE and India, and concludes with a collaborative garden design project in Abu Dhabi.

They introduce the methods and fundamental concepts of art history by taking one work of art and constructing around it a web of diverse objects and practices that allow us to grapple with the meanings of art and its histories within global and trans-historical perspectives. Among the questions we ask throughout the course are: What is art? What is art history? What are the institutions that shape the practice and dissemination of art? How is art affected by histories of cultural exchange? What is the nature of tradition? Visits to local museums. Lecture/discussion.

The course examines the systems that have prompted this change and the theoretical framework that currently situates Arab art within the global discourse on visual art. Focusing on selected artists, the course explores the impact of political, social and market forces on the region&rsquo;s art and the recent discourse on Islamic art and its links to modern and contemporary art of the region.

They introduce the methods and fundamental concepts of art history by taking one work of art and constructing around it a web of diverse objects and practices that allow us to grapple with the meanings of art and its histories within global and trans-historical perspectives. Among the questions we ask throughout the course are: What is art? What is art history? What are the institutions that shape the practice and dissemination of art? How is art affected by histories of cultural exchange? What is the nature of tradition? Visits to local museums. Lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be through written assignments, powerpoint presentations, and active class participation. No previous knowledge of art history required.

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social, and cultural. Students are given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for artworks to &ldquo;read&rdquo; and how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure allows students to explore ideas of limits and how the limit or horizon of what is possible can be elaborated and expanded on in art. Students engage in group and one-on-one discussions of projects made in response to readings and assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration and consistency in a creative practice.    *Prerequistes: VISAR-AD 112, or, VISAR-AD 122, or, VISAR-AD 123, or VISAR-AD 124.
