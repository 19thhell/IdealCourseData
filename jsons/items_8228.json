It also endeavors to explain the     functions and origins of those institutions by using the tools of economic analysis. Its     mission for students is to help remedy the clear deficiency of much graduate education in     economics today that allows technique to crowd out the bigger picture of market     institutions.          Located in one of the nations premier economics departments, the Program    continues the work of several generations of NYU economists to develop a     comprehensive understanding of markets. (The Program traces its intellectual origins to    the seminar of Ludwig von Mises in the Graduate School of Business beginning in the    late 1940s and through the decades of the Austrian Economics Program, founded by    Israel Kirzner in 1975). It pursues an interdisciplinary approach to understanding     markets. Students in the Program are trained not only in the most advanced current     economic techniques, as part of the standard NYU economics curriculum, but also to     appreciate the broader legal, ethical and cultural framework without which market     processes would be ineffective in producing a prosperous society.     . In this spirit he Program sponsors a book series, Foundations of the Market Economy, published by     Routledge, in which more than twenty books have been produced dealing with such     issues as:            The  knowledge content of prices    \"Free\"  or competitive banking    Transitional political economy    Time, uncertainty and business cycles    Constitutional political economy    Entrepreneurship and economic development       The approach followed in the series and by the members of the Program eschews the     conception of the economy as a system continually in a state of economic balance. We     see economic activities as a process of discovery and innovation. Our perspective pays     critical attention to the creative and entrepreneurial sources of technological progress in     economic growth and development. It also stresses the importance of property rights     and freedom of contract in providing a framework for the mobilization of these creative     forces.           The Program sponsors both shorter and longer-term visits by professors and     advanced doctoral students from other universities working in areas of mutual interest.    There is also a fellowship program for graduate students seeking to obtain their degrees    from NYU who have a demonstrated interest in a broad understanding of the market     economy.     The Program also sponsors the weekly Colloquium on Market Institutions and    Economic Processes in which guests from all over the world present their research to    a highly professional group of NYU faculty, students and faculty-fellows from other    universities throughout the greater New York area. Recent speakers have included Robert     Jervis (Politics, Columbia), Douglas Walton (Philosophy, Winnipeg), Niall Ferguson     (History, Stern-NYU), Kevin McCabe (Economics, George Mason), Arthur Reber     (Psychology, CUNY) ,Gerd Gigerenzer (Max Planck Institute, Berlin), and Ejan     Mackaay (Faculty of Law, University of Montreal).                    The research activities of the Program currently focus upon:           The phenomenon of slippery slopes in law and in public policy and their unintended consequences for legal rules;        Rational choice aspects of ethical decisionmaking and the knowledge requirements of different moral systems;       The processes of competition and entrepreneurship in economic development, and particularly the impact of extra-market institutions in the supply and allocation of entrepreneurial talent;       The role of the human language faculty in economic decisionmaking and the economic aspects of linguistic consciousness in supporting contract formation and trade.
