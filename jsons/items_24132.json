India: Part-Time Student Nick Heller (M.A. '14)             As a part time student in the HESA program I knew I wanted to study abroad from the first time it was mentioned by my adviser and was specifically interested in India because of its rich and diverse culture, and heritage.  During the two weeks in India, our class visited a variety of public and private institutions. I grew tremendously through interacting with students and experiencing their hospitality and passion for learning. Some of the cultural highlights included exploring Mumbai and Kerala in rickshaws, and spending an evening watching a kite festival from a beach side rooftop. This has truly been a perspective changing learning experience.                South Africa: Full-Time Student Amber Lodman (M.A. '14)             The South Africa study abroad program was distinct because of the hearty contextual experience it provides. Yes, South Africa is a beautiful country and its story frames a powerful narrative. You will visit schools, meet people, become acquainted with a culture and gain knowledge of a young democracy. Consider what you will bring there and what you may carry back. l met people and captured moments that influenced who I want to be to the world. That was compelling. Do consider cost, but greatly consider investing in an experience, one which I am carrying throughout life.                Turkey: Full-Time Student Jennifer Low (M.A. '14)                Visiting Turkey was my first time traveling abroad and I am glad I was able to share this experience with members of the Steinhardt community. The visits to different universities were an amazing opportunity to speak with Turkish students, administrators, and faculty about their personal experiences in higher education. In addition to these visits, we also explored Turkey by visiting mosques, trying Turkish cuisine, and touring the Hagia Sophia. The experience allowed me to develop an understanding of the Turkish culture and higher education system, which has enhanced my multicultural knowledge and overall ability to support students in my career.                      Other Global Programs    Some of our students also participate in study abroad programs available through other NYU programs and departments.    Argentina [Education &amp; Advocacy]: Full-Time Student Lauren Jordan (M.A. '14)                There are many electives outside of our program that directly relate to Higher Education that also broaden the scope of our concentration. Education and Advocacy with Gary Anderson is one such course. I was privileged with the opportunity to study in Buenos Aires for 2 weeks in August of 2013. Education and Advocacy in Buenos Aires is taught through the lens of The Dirty War with a focus on the impact of civil society on educational reform. The program gave me a new perspective and enriched my knowledge of education. I learned more about the role of government and the private sector in education and was able to discuss my ideas with a diverse group of students from across NYU. The program reminded me of the importance of activism within the educational system and my own life. This experience was one of the best decisions I have made during my time at NYU.                   London [HIV Prevention &amp; Counseling]: Part-Time Student Ryan Loiter (M.A. '14)                The opportunity to take a class outside of the HESA program was a bit refreshing as a second year student. The opportunity to study in London, another major cosmopolitan city, was exciting and the HIV Prevention and Counseling course was truly eye-opening. In all my years in education I have never felt such emotion to a topic as I did in this class. The opportunity to visit clinics, both here and abroad, and be educated in a subject matter that carries so much stigma and misunderstanding, left me feeling that I had responsibility to educate my peers and the students I work with.

Part-Time Student Perspective: Nick Heller (M.A. '14)             As a part time student in the HESA program I knew I wanted to study abroad from the first time it was mentioned by my adviser and was specifically interested in India because of its rich and diverse culture, and heritage.  During the two weeks in India, our class visited a variety of public and private institutions. I grew tremendously through interacting with students and experiencing their hospitality and passion for learning. Some of the cultural highlights included exploring Mumbai and Kerala in rickshaws, and spending an evening watching a kite festival from a beach side rooftop. This has truly been a perspective changing learning experience.                Full-Time Student Perspective: Colvin Georges (M.A. '15)             The study abroad in India has been one of my most rewarding experiences while being a graduate student at NYU! There were many presentations, conversations, and site visits that strengthened my understanding about the culture and customs of this country as it pertained to education, marriage, religion, language, food, family, social inequalities, and financial stability. Another rewarding part of my study abroad experience was when I toured one of the greatest slums in Dharavi, Mumbai. I witnessed a system of resiliency.

South Africa: Full-Time Student Amber Lodman (M.A. '14)             The South Africa study abroad program was distinct because of the hearty contextual experience it provides. Yes, South Africa is a beautiful country and its story frames a powerful narrative. You will visit schools, meet people, become acquainted with a culture and gain knowledge of a young democracy. Consider what you will bring there and what you may carry back. l met people and captured moments that influenced who I want to be to the world. That was compelling. Do consider cost, but greatly consider investing in an experience, one which I am carrying throughout life.                Turkey: Full-Time Student Jennifer Low (M.A. '14)                Visiting Turkey was my first time traveling abroad and I am glad I was able to share this experience with members of the Steinhardt community. The visits to different universities were an amazing opportunity to speak with Turkish students, administrators, and faculty about their personal experiences in higher education. In addition to these visits, we also explored Turkey by visiting mosques, trying Turkish cuisine, and touring the Hagia Sophia. The experience allowed me to develop an understanding of the Turkish culture and higher education system, which has enhanced my multicultural knowledge and overall ability to support students in my career.                      Other Global Programs    Some of our students also participate in study abroad programs available through other NYU programs and departments.    Argentina [Education &amp; Advocacy]: Full-Time Student Lauren Jordan (M.A. '14)                There are many electives outside of our program that directly relate to Higher Education that also broaden the scope of our concentration. Education and Advocacy with Gary Anderson is one such course. I was privileged with the opportunity to study in Buenos Aires for 2 weeks in August of 2013. Education and Advocacy in Buenos Aires is taught through the lens of The Dirty War with a focus on the impact of civil society on educational reform. The program gave me a new perspective and enriched my knowledge of education. I learned more about the role of government and the private sector in education and was able to discuss my ideas with a diverse group of students from across NYU. The program reminded me of the importance of activism within the educational system and my own life. This experience was one of the best decisions I have made during my time at NYU.                   London [HIV Prevention &amp; Counseling]: Part-Time Student Ryan Loiter (M.A. '14)                The opportunity to take a class outside of the HESA program was a bit refreshing as a second year student. The opportunity to study in London, another major cosmopolitan city, was exciting and the HIV Prevention and Counseling course was truly eye-opening. In all my years in education I have never felt such emotion to a topic as I did in this class. The opportunity to visit clinics, both here and abroad, and be educated in a subject matter that carries so much stigma and misunderstanding, left me feeling that I had responsibility to educate my peers and the students I work with. I was made better because of this course.                             This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University. All rights reserved.

Students are accompanied by program faculty for short-term, in-depth learning experiences during Winter Intersession, Spring Break, and Summer Term, during which time they engage in study and exploration of a country&rsquo;s higher education system in the context of local economic, political, and social realities. Students may earn between 3-6 credits for these courses. Additional information about cost, availability, and application can be found on the Steinhardt Global Programs site .    International Opportunities    Our program offers enriching global opportunities to our students.    India: Part-Time Student Nick Heller (M.A. '14)             As a part time student in the HESA program I knew I wanted to study abroad from the first time it was mentioned by my adviser and was specifically interested in India because of its rich and diverse culture, and heritage.  During the two weeks in India, our class visited a variety of public and private institutions. I grew tremendously through interacting with students and experiencing their hospitality and passion for learning. Some of the cultural highlights included exploring Mumbai and Kerala in rickshaws, and spending an evening watching a kite festival from a beach side rooftop. This has truly been a perspective changing learning experience.                South Africa: Full-Time Student Amber Lodman (M.A. '14)             The South Africa study abroad program was distinct because of the hearty contextual experience it provides. Yes, South Africa is a beautiful country and its story frames a powerful narrative. You will visit schools, meet people, become acquainted with a culture and gain knowledge of a young democracy. Consider what you will bring there and what you may carry back. l met people and captured moments that influenced who I want to be to the world. That was compelling. Do consider cost, but greatly consider investing in an experience, one which I am carrying throughout life.                Turkey: Full-Time Student Jennifer Low (M.A. '14)                Visiting Turkey was my first time traveling abroad and I am glad I was able to share this experience with members of the Steinhardt community. The visits to different universities were an amazing opportunity to speak with Turkish students, administrators, and faculty about their personal experiences in higher education. In addition to these visits, we also explored Turkey by visiting mosques, trying Turkish cuisine, and touring the Hagia Sophia. The experience allowed me to develop an understanding of the Turkish culture and higher education system, which has enhanced my multicultural knowledge and overall ability to support students in my career.                      Other Global Programs    Some of our students also participate in study abroad programs available through other NYU programs and departments.    Argentina [Education &amp; Advocacy]: Full-Time Student Lauren Jordan (M.A. '14)                There are many electives outside of our program that directly relate to Higher Education that also broaden the scope of our concentration. Education and Advocacy with Gary Anderson is one such course. I was privileged with the opportunity to study in Buenos Aires for 2 weeks in August of 2013. Education and Advocacy in Buenos Aires is taught through the lens of The Dirty War with a focus on the impact of civil society on educational reform. The program gave me a new perspective and enriched my knowledge of education. I learned more about the role of government and the private sector in education and was able to discuss my ideas with a diverse group of students from across NYU. The program reminded me of the importance of activism within the educational system and my own life. This experience was one of the best decisions I have made during my time at NYU.                   London [HIV Prevention &amp; Counseling]: Part-Time Student Ryan Loiter (M.A. '14)                The opportunity to take a class outside of the HESA program was a bit refreshing as a second year student. The opportunity to study in London, another major cosmopolitan city, was exciting and the HIV Prevention and Counseling course was truly eye-opening. In all my years in education I have never felt such emotion to a topic as I did in this class. The opportunity to visit clinics, both here and abroad, and be educated in a subject matter that carries so much stigma and misunderstanding, left me feeling that I had responsibility to educate my peers and the students I work with. I was made better because of this course.                             This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University. All rights reserved.
