In this program, participants are offered something beyond the traditional classroom experience by getting the chance to work alongside faculty mentors on cutting-edge research projects. Read More    Prof. Jiang named an IFAC fellow Prof. Jiang has been named a fellow of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) in recognition of his fundamental contributions to nonlinear control theory and design and applications to underactuated mechanical, communications and biological systems. Read More   The mission of the systems and control group is to model and design intelligent and autonomous systems. Initially developed in the context of electric circuits, recent applications have focused on complex, dynamic and networked systems, such as unmanned vehicles and power system networks. The field of system and control provides essential enabling and supporting technologies for different applications in electrical engineering ranging from defense and manufacturing to telecommunications and bioengineering. NYU School of Engineering has a long history of research in the area. Members of the group seek control tools and solutions for increasingly complex systems such as cyber-physical systems, neural systems, swarms of robots, or economic markets.                                                                &copy; NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering."}]}]
