Our mission is to develop graduates capable of contributing to and advancing the practice of civil engineering and construction management and their sub-disciplines.   Our faculty actively participates in scholarly research activities, allowing us to be up-to-date in our areas of expertise and to incorporate research into our teaching. Through research, we contribute to finding better ways of developing and managing our vital civil infrastructure systems, including transportation, water supply/distribution, and waste disposal.   Students also join in research teams, which give them invaluable, hands-on experience that will prepare them for professional or research careers.   Faculty members teach undergraduate as well as graduate students. Thus, students are exposed to instructors who are in the forefront of their fields and who are frequently working on projects and topics of current interest, often within the region. Full-time faculty members are augmented by an excellent group of adjunct faculty who teach specialty courses in areas of their expertise, bringing a strong practical applications element to the classroom.
