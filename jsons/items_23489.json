Mali Bowers and Natalie Nazarian - Empty Healing                               Empty Healing, Mali Bowers   Concentration: Balance: Non-action in Action    Mali Bowers is from Los Angeles and London. Her concentration focuses on tangible applications of the Buddhist concept of sunyata, or emptiness. Ranging from art-making to the human form, the physical and philosophical resonance of &quot;emptiness&quot; inspires her to explore a wide array of disciplines. Her pursuits include sculpture, green design, philosophy, architecture, yoga as architecture of the body, music composition and printmaking, as ways to investigate the fundamentally compassionate principle of sunyata. Her current primary practice is printmaking, as an exploration of emptiness in the creative process. - Mali\u2019s Adviser is Jeanette Tran, Ph.D.   Empty Healing, Natalie Nazarian   Concentration: Compassionate Art, Compassionate Science: An Alternative Approach for the Pre-Medical Student     A native of Minneapolis, Minnesota, Natalie Nazarian is studying art and science, specifically the implications that intersections between these disciplines might have for the future of medicine. Focusing on modes of practice in the simultaneous studies of studio art, and the physical and natural sciences has allowed her to find both conceptual and practical connections. In this vein, she believes that methods of contemporary visual art practice and criticism can be of valuable use in instigating tangible changes to the current culture of the doctor-patient relationship.   Natalie and Mali began collaborating out of the realization that their concentrations were not only complimentary, but inherently connected. They discovered the opportunity for creative collaboration, and how changing the way we see can ultimately change the way we approach healing. Their individual art practices have led them to the conviction that compassionate art can lead to creative responses in healthcare, rather than pre-packaged cures. - Natalie\u2019s Adviser is Leslie Satin, Ph.D.                                                                                                                                                                Rachel Brazie - Towards a Haunted Community                               Towards a Haunted Community, Rachel Brazie   Concentration: (De)Constructing Community: Identity Narrative, Grief, and Politics     Rachel Brazie\u2019s academic and personal interests center around community. To this end, she participated in NYU's Residential College for her first three years before moving to Brooklyn to live in a co-operative. In Gallatin, she is a member of Americas Scholars. She co-founded a Critical Theory Collective to extend intellectual community beyond the walls of the classroom.    Her Senior Project explores three of Toni Morrison's novels - interrogating the ways in which Morrison negotiates America's racial wounds through the personal traumas of her characters. Rachel argues that Morrison's use of haunting offers a necessary interval between mourning and melancholia, a mode of grieving that acknowledges loss without fully letting the go of the ghost.   Outside of school, Rachel has traveled extensively working on rural and urban organic farms, including a summer stint studying indigenous agricultural practices in Peru. Most recently, she apprenticed at the Brooklyn Grange rooftop farm. - Rachel\u2019s Adviser is George Shulman, Ph.D.                                                                                                                                                               Anthony Giambra - We Have the Remote, But Are We Changing the Channel                               We Have the Remote, But Are We Changing the Channel, Anthony Giambra  Concentration: Visual Media Imperialism     Anthony Giambra studies a combination of film, sociology, and media studies at NYU. During his senior year, he has worked as Assistant Media Producer to Mario Batali, Production Intern for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and currently interns as a Development Intern at MTV News &amp; Docs. For his entire junior year, he studied abroad, first in Prague, then in Buenos Aires. In both cities, he delved further into the golden ages of each nation's cinemas. Noticing a difference in national representation and understanding before and after times of political oppression, he grew interested in the influence of media flows throughout the globe, which helped to add a narrowing lens to his academic focus and to create the platform for his TEDx talk. At the moment, he would love to work in late night television after graduation. - Anthony\u2019s Adviser is Rahul Hamid, M.A                                                                                                                                                           Nicole Johnson - The (Re)birth of the Double Consciousness                               The (Re)birth of the Double Consciousness, Nicole Johnson   Concentration: Ethics Management &amp; Production in the Arts     Nicole Johnson studies Ethics, Management &amp; Production in the Arts.

Emergence is the phenomenon by which simple systems governed by simple rules give rise to complex phenomena on a larger scale. Simple systems are able to self-organize into large-scale collective behavior.   In her senior project, What Pattern Recognition Systems Teach Us About Patterns, Adams built a Deep Belief Network (DBN), which is an artificial neural network used in machine learning that mimics the parallel processing of the brain, in order to better understand what is being recognized in pattern recognition.   In preparation for PhD studies in Complexity Theory, Adams will independently commence study of the similarities between efficient designs in natural and artificial systems namely the similarities between leaf vein patterns and housing patterns.   While at NYU, Jane was on the editorial board of the Gallatin Research Journal, and studied Culture, Development, and Globalization in India. Jane earned the Dean\u2019s Award for Graduating Seniors. Adams\u2019 adviser is Jose Perillan, PhD.

By seeking to comprehend the social, political, and economic infrastructures at work specifically in cities (particularly in the megacities of the global south), Bernstein hopes to to acquire an insight into how such systems might be adapted to achieve both local and global sustainability with respect to the environment and the economy. Jennie pays particular attention to a classical capitalist conception, where growth in the Gross Domestic Product acts as the principal metric for measuring economic growth/development.   While at NYU Jennie went abroad to Fortaleza, Brazil, to study Social Justice and Sustainable Development. She hopes to work as an environmental educator in Aspen, Colorado for a year prior to persuing in a Masters program in Urban Ecology. She earned the Dean\u2019s Award for Graduating Seniors.

Mali Bowers and Natalie Nazarian - Empty Healing                               Empty Healing, Mali Bowers   Concentration: Balance: Non-action in Action    Mali Bowers is from Los Angeles and London. Her concentration focuses on tangible applications of the Buddhist concept of sunyata, or emptiness. Ranging from art-making to the human form, the physical and philosophical resonance of &quot;emptiness&quot; inspires her to explore a wide array of disciplines. Her pursuits include sculpture, green design, philosophy, architecture, yoga as architecture of the body, music composition and printmaking, as ways to investigate the fundamentally compassionate principle of sunyata. Her current primary practice is printmaking, as an exploration of emptiness in the creative process. - Mali\u2019s Adviser is Jeanette Tran, Ph.D.   Empty Healing, Natalie Nazarian   Concentration: Compassionate Art, Compassionate Science: An Alternative Approach for the Pre-Medical Student     A native of Minneapolis, Minnesota, Natalie Nazarian is studying art and science, specifically the implications that intersections between these disciplines might have for the future of medicine. Focusing on modes of practice in the simultaneous studies of studio art, and the physical and natural sciences has allowed her to find both conceptual and practical connections. In this vein, she believes that methods of contemporary visual art practice and criticism can be of valuable use in instigating tangible changes to the current culture of the doctor-patient relationship.   Natalie and Mali began collaborating out of the realization that their concentrations were not only complimentary, but inherently connected. They discovered the opportunity for creative collaboration, and how changing the way we see can ultimately change the way we approach healing. Their individual art practices have led them to the conviction that compassionate art can lead to creative responses in healthcare, rather than pre-packaged cures. - Natalie\u2019s Adviser is Leslie Satin, Ph.D.                                                                                                                                                                Rachel Brazie - Towards a Haunted Community                               Towards a Haunted Community, Rachel Brazie   Concentration: (De)Constructing Community: Identity Narrative, Grief, and Politics     Rachel Brazie\u2019s academic and personal interests center around community. To this end, she participated in NYU's Residential College for her first three years before moving to Brooklyn to live in a co-operative. In Gallatin, she is a member of Americas Scholars. She co-founded a Critical Theory Collective to extend intellectual community beyond the walls of the classroom.    Her Senior Project explores three of Toni Morrison's novels - interrogating the ways in which Morrison negotiates America's racial wounds through the personal traumas of her characters. Rachel argues that Morrison's use of haunting offers a necessary interval between mourning and melancholia, a mode of grieving that acknowledges loss without fully letting the go of the ghost.   Outside of school, Rachel has traveled extensively working on rural and urban organic farms, including a summer stint studying indigenous agricultural practices in Peru. Most recently, she apprenticed at the Brooklyn Grange rooftop farm. - Rachel\u2019s Adviser is George Shulman, Ph.D.                                                                                                                                                               Anthony Giambra - We Have the Remote, But Are We Changing the Channel                               We Have the Remote, But Are We Changing the Channel, Anthony Giambra  Concentration: Visual Media Imperialism     Anthony Giambra studies a combination of film, sociology, and media studies at NYU. During his senior year, he has worked as Assistant Media Producer to Mario Batali, Production Intern for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and currently interns as a Development Intern at MTV News &amp; Docs. For his entire junior year, he studied abroad, first in Prague, then in Buenos Aires. In both cities, he delved further into the golden ages of each nation's cinemas. Noticing a difference in national representation and understanding before and after times of political oppression, he grew interested in the influence of media flows throughout the globe, which helped to add a narrowing lens to his academic focus and to create the platform for his TEDx talk. At the moment, he would love to work in late night television after graduation. - Anthony\u2019s Adviser is Rahul Hamid, M.A                                                                                                                                                           Nicole Johnson - The (Re)birth of the Double Consciousness                               The (Re)birth of the Double Consciousness, Nicole Johnson   Concentration: Ethics Management &amp; Production in the Arts     Nicole Johnson studies Ethics, Management &amp; Production in the Arts.

Its methods come with a guarantee of making progress towards accruing more accurate information about our world. Daniel Seara is working towards understanding the roles that humans have in performing the incontrovertibly human activity we call \u201cscience\u201d. Specifically, Daniel studies physics, philosophy and their histories in an attempt to understand the fluid progression that physics has undergone since the 17th century.   Daniel is currently researching liquid crystal colloidal dispersions, studying the colloids\u2019 interactions and self-assembly via optical microscopy at the NYU Center for Soft Matter Research under David J. Pine, PhD. He participated in the NSF funded summer program RiSE at Rutgers University, studying graphene growth on various substrates via pulsed laser deposition as a function of time.

Emergence is the phenomenon by which simple systems governed by simple rules give rise to complex phenomena on a larger scale. Simple systems are able to self-organize into large-scale collective behavior.   In her senior project, What Pattern Recognition Systems Teach Us About Patterns, Adams built a Deep Belief Network (DBN), which is an artificial neural network used in machine learning that mimics the parallel processing of the brain, in order to better understand what is being recognized in pattern recognition.   In preparation for PhD studies in Complexity Theory, Adams will independently commence study of the similarities between efficient designs in natural and artificial systems namely the similarities between leaf vein patterns and housing patterns.   While at NYU, Jane was on the editorial board of the Gallatin Research Journal, and studied Culture, Development, and Globalization in India. Jane earned the Dean\u2019s Award for Graduating Seniors. Adams\u2019 adviser is Jose Perillan, PhD.                                                                  Jennie Bernstein - Brazil, Coastal Erosion, Sustainable Development                               Jennie Bernstein - Brazil, Coastal Erosion, Sustainable Development (Video)   Brazil, Coastal Erosion, Sustainable Development, Jennie Bernstein   Concentration: Sustainable Urban Development   Jennie Bernstein\u2019s concentration combines an understanding of economic development with an appreciation for the social and environmental systems at work on our planet.   By seeking to comprehend the social, political, and economic infrastructures at work specifically in cities (particularly in the megacities of the global south), Bernstein hopes to to acquire an insight into how such systems might be adapted to achieve both local and global sustainability with respect to the environment and the economy. Jennie pays particular attention to a classical capitalist conception, where growth in the Gross Domestic Product acts as the principal metric for measuring economic growth/development.   While at NYU Jennie went abroad to Fortaleza, Brazil, to study Social Justice and Sustainable Development. She hopes to work as an environmental educator in Aspen, Colorado for a year prior to persuing in a Masters program in Urban Ecology. She earned the Dean\u2019s Award for Graduating Seniors.

Specifically, Notini looks at the interaction between language and society in post-colonial environments.   His senior project, Language Commoditization in Rural Minority Speech Communities analyzes insider-outsider dynamics in tourist destinations through linguistic performance and language ideologies. To illustrate the relationship his paper uses two case studies: the Pennsylvania Dutch speaking populations of Lancaster County, PA and Irish speaking communities in the west of Ireland.

Mali Bowers and Natalie Nazarian - Empty Healing                               Empty Healing, Mali Bowers   Concentration: Balance: Non-action in Action    Mali Bowers is from Los Angeles and London. Her concentration focuses on tangible applications of the Buddhist concept of sunyata, or emptiness. Ranging from art-making to the human form, the physical and philosophical resonance of &quot;emptiness&quot; inspires her to explore a wide array of disciplines. Her pursuits include sculpture, green design, philosophy, architecture, yoga as architecture of the body, music composition and printmaking, as ways to investigate the fundamentally compassionate principle of sunyata. Her current primary practice is printmaking, as an exploration of emptiness in the creative process. - Mali\u2019s Adviser is Jeanette Tran, Ph.D.   Empty Healing, Natalie Nazarian   Concentration: Compassionate Art, Compassionate Science: An Alternative Approach for the Pre-Medical Student     A native of Minneapolis, Minnesota, Natalie Nazarian is studying art and science, specifically the implications that intersections between these disciplines might have for the future of medicine. Focusing on modes of practice in the simultaneous studies of studio art, and the physical and natural sciences has allowed her to find both conceptual and practical connections. In this vein, she believes that methods of contemporary visual art practice and criticism can be of valuable use in instigating tangible changes to the current culture of the doctor-patient relationship.   Natalie and Mali began collaborating out of the realization that their concentrations were not only complimentary, but inherently connected. They discovered the opportunity for creative collaboration, and how changing the way we see can ultimately change the way we approach healing. Their individual art practices have led them to the conviction that compassionate art can lead to creative responses in healthcare, rather than pre-packaged cures. - Natalie\u2019s Adviser is Leslie Satin, Ph.D.                                                                                                                                                                Rachel Brazie - Towards a Haunted Community                               Towards a Haunted Community, Rachel Brazie   Concentration: (De)Constructing Community: Identity Narrative, Grief, and Politics     Rachel Brazie\u2019s academic and personal interests center around community. To this end, she participated in NYU's Residential College for her first three years before moving to Brooklyn to live in a co-operative. In Gallatin, she is a member of Americas Scholars. She co-founded a Critical Theory Collective to extend intellectual community beyond the walls of the classroom.    Her Senior Project explores three of Toni Morrison's novels - interrogating the ways in which Morrison negotiates America's racial wounds through the personal traumas of her characters. Rachel argues that Morrison's use of haunting offers a necessary interval between mourning and melancholia, a mode of grieving that acknowledges loss without fully letting the go of the ghost.   Outside of school, Rachel has traveled extensively working on rural and urban organic farms, including a summer stint studying indigenous agricultural practices in Peru. Most recently, she apprenticed at the Brooklyn Grange rooftop farm. - Rachel\u2019s Adviser is George Shulman, Ph.D.                                                                                                                                                               Anthony Giambra - We Have the Remote, But Are We Changing the Channel                               We Have the Remote, But Are We Changing the Channel, Anthony Giambra  Concentration: Visual Media Imperialism     Anthony Giambra studies a combination of film, sociology, and media studies at NYU.

For his entire junior year, he studied abroad, first in Prague, then in Buenos Aires. In both cities, he delved further into the golden ages of each nation's cinemas. Noticing a difference in national representation and understanding before and after times of political oppression, he grew interested in the influence of media flows throughout the globe, which helped to add a narrowing lens to his academic focus and to create the platform for his TEDx talk. At the moment, he would love to work in late night television after graduation. - Anthony\u2019s Adviser is Rahul Hamid, M.A                                                                                                                                                           Nicole Johnson - The (Re)birth of the Double Consciousness                               The (Re)birth of the Double Consciousness, Nicole Johnson   Concentration: Ethics Management &amp; Production in the Arts     Nicole Johnson studies Ethics, Management &amp; Production in the Arts.

Emergence is the phenomenon by which simple systems governed by simple rules give rise to complex phenomena on a larger scale. Simple systems are able to self-organize into large-scale collective behavior.   In her senior project, What Pattern Recognition Systems Teach Us About Patterns, Adams built a Deep Belief Network (DBN), which is an artificial neural network used in machine learning that mimics the parallel processing of the brain, in order to better understand what is being recognized in pattern recognition.   In preparation for PhD studies in Complexity Theory, Adams will independently commence study of the similarities between efficient designs in natural and artificial systems namely the similarities between leaf vein patterns and housing patterns.   While at NYU, Jane was on the editorial board of the Gallatin Research Journal, and studied Culture, Development, and Globalization in India. Jane earned the Dean\u2019s Award for Graduating Seniors.
