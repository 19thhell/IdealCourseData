But perhaps more notably      the island is known for its reggae music, which has made Jamaican      culture an internationally recognized and marketable product. However,      despite its mainstream viability and entertainment value, reggae      music originated as a deeply political form of protest and contestation      against the colonial and imperialist forces operative in the social      context of Jamaican life. Musical ambassadors like The Mighty Diamonds,      the Abyssinians, Judy Mowatt, Burning Spear, Jimmy Cliff, Bob Marley,      Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer, Rita Marley, and Marcia Griffiths, along      with many others, can be credited with bringing reggae music to      the world stage and giving it international recognition. Yet, despite      its worldwide popularity, few (outside of its practitioners and      followers) truly understand the cultural and political climate in      which the music developed. As both a fan of the music and culture,      and as a child of Jamaican parentage, I have always been intrigued      by the social, political, and cultural context from which the music      emerged. My annual visits to the island of Jamaica further informed      my interpretation of the history of reggae music and the impact      of Rastafari culture on the music as well.      Since the beginning of its rise to international popularity in the      1960's and 1970's, there has been a close association between reggae      artists and Rastafari culture, a culture founded on resistance.      The Rastafari in Jamaica have inhabited a marginalized place in      society. Scorned by society for their beliefs and appearance, they      have been, and continue to be, disenfranchised from the means of      production and wealth in Jamaica. Perhaps because of this disenfranchisement,      Rastafari brethren and sistren have always been at the forefront      in contesting the institutionalized racism and classism inherited      from the colonial system. The Rastafari in Jamaica were among the      first on the island to look to Africa as the source of their ancestry      and identity, and were also among the first to use reggae music      as a form of protest against the oppressive social conditions on      the island. Following in the revolutionary spirit of the Maroons      (communities of runaway slaves who fought against British slavers      in Jamaica in the early 18th century), the Rastafari sought to distance      themselves from the colonial culture of the island both in appearance      and in beliefs.      The brutality targeted against the Rastafari in Jamaica was manifest      in the police practice of cutting off a Rastafarian's locks, an      actual and symbolic act meant to strip the Rastafari of their faith      and power. It is little wonder that reggae music, a socially acceptable      and viable product, became a means of political resistance through      performance. Reggae music's lyrics, imbued with biblical imagery      and symbolism, constitute a performative act. In the process of      performing the music, reggae artists were actually protesting against      the oppressive forces of the Babylon system. For the Rastafari,      the Babylon system represents all of the exploitative and oppressive      practices in Jamaica (in particular) and Western society (in general).      This oppressive system began to come under increasing scrutiny in      reggae music. Reggae lyrics, like the above, are indicative of the      reggae protest songs popular during the 1960's and 1970's. Marley's      lyrics, similar to the lyrics of his contemporaries, illustrate      the reggae artists' negative view of the Babylon system, manifest      in the oppressive political policy of the Jamaican government at      the time. During the early rise of the reggae protest songs the      Jamaican government banned many reggae recordings critical of governmental      practices, or these reggae protest songs received very little airplay.      This practice of banning or underplaying the reggae protest songs      reveals the social force and power of this form of protest, which      the Jamaican government sought to control.      Despite (or perhaps because of) the Jamaican government's recognition      of the revolutionary power of reggae protest music, by the mid to      late 1970's, Rastafari symbolism and reggae music began to be increasingly      appropriated by the political parties in Jamaica. This was most      notably manifest during the fierce and violent political campaigns      of the late 1970's between Michael Manley and opposition leader      Edward Seaga, in which Rastafari religious symbolism and reggae      music became an integral part of the political landscape. Rastafari      symbolism and reggae music became a symbolic representation of both      political parties' attempts to show their sympathy with the plight      of the disenfranchised and underrepresented populations in Jamaica.      This attempt by both parties to show a connection to reggae music      and Rastafari culture was evidenced at Bob Marley's 1978 &quot;One      Love Peace Concert&quot; in Kingston, Jamaica, at which Manley and      Seaga both appeared on stage. Marley, flanked by the two politicians,      clasped both of their hands together with his and raised them over      his head in a symbolic call for unity and an end to politically      inspired violence in Jamaica. Yet, despite this symbolic allegiance,      the actual manifestation of political policy to improve the conditions      of the majority of the impoverished Jamaican citizens and policies      to stop the violence associated with politics in Jamaica were never      realized. Although this appropriation of reggae protest music did      not result in any structural changes in governmental practices or      political policy, it did bring reggae protest music into the national      consciousness as a powerful political protest tool. In many ways,      the appropriation of reggae protest music by the Jamaican political      parties legitimized this performative practice as a viable form      of political protest and as a type of nonviolent resistance.      Reggae music and Rastafari culture continue to be revolutionary      and accessible forms of performative art/speech. A new generation      of reggae artists emerging in the 1990's was able to combine conscious      lyrics with hardcore dancehall and hip-hop rhythms, again popularizing      this form of musical protest and introducing the music to a new      generation of listeners. Current reggae artists like Buju Banton,      Anthony B, Sizzla, Capleton, and the Marley Brothers, along with      many others, continue to usher reggae music and Rastafari culture      into the mainstream consciousness of Western society. Reggae music      has contributed to a worldwide youth culture in which the music      is used as a commentary and criticism of social and political policies      considered unjust by the artists. Reggae musicians continue to use      their music as a forum for political protest and as a means for      raising consciousness amongst urban youth populations. The rise      in popularity of Rastafari symbolism in the late twentieth century      into the twenty-first century is evidenced by the ever broadening      social acceptance (in the West) of the dreadlocks hairstyle and      reggae music. Further, the inclusion of reggae music as a category      in the Grammy awards in 1985 was an acknowledgement of the mainstream      acceptance of both the music and the culture from which it originated.      Although reggae music and Rastafari culture continue to work as      viable and accessible forms of protest, the recent trend in reggae      and dancehall music towards more 'rudeboy', materialistic lyrics      undermines the historical and social context out of which earlier      reggae protest music originated. Despite the far-reaching possibilities      for the continued use of reggae music as a platform for political      and social commentary, its inclusion into mainstream popular culture      must necessarily shape the form and content of the music and the      culture. Rastafari symbolism, likewise, has continued to lose its      meaning and significance in the face of its own rise in popularity.      Reggae music and Rastafari culture, which historically constituted      a performative act of protest and contestation, both in the performance      of the music and in the physical embodiment of a Rastafari appearance,      have come to be identified in popular culture as simply a genre      of music or a style of dress and hairstyle. The diminishment of      reggae music and Rastafari culture as forms of protest is evidenced      in the fact that as the music and culture become increasingly more      popular and mainstream, the revolutionary history of this particular      performative practice is slowly being lost. The loss of the historical      context out of which the music originated, coupled with the economic      incentives to mass produce the music and culture, have moved this      performative practice farther away from the realm of revolutionary      practice and closer to the realm of performance as product and commodity.      However, as long as there is a single reggae artist who continues      to honor the struggle and revolutionary spirit out of which this      music originated, it will continue to serve as an effective example      of performance-as-protest for future generations.

But perhaps more notably      the island is known for its reggae music, which has made Jamaican      culture an internationally recognized and marketable product. However,      despite its mainstream viability and entertainment value, reggae      music originated as a deeply political form of protest and contestation      against the colonial and imperialist forces operative in the social      context of Jamaican life. Musical ambassadors like The Mighty Diamonds,      the Abyssinians, Judy Mowatt, Burning Spear, Jimmy Cliff, Bob Marley,      Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer, Rita Marley, and Marcia Griffiths, along      with many others, can be credited with bringing reggae music to      the world stage and giving it international recognition. Yet, despite      its worldwide popularity, few (outside of its practitioners and      followers) truly understand the cultural and political climate in      which the music developed. As both a fan of the music and culture,      and as a child of Jamaican parentage, I have always been intrigued      by the social, political, and cultural context from which the music      emerged. My annual visits to the island of Jamaica further informed      my interpretation of the history of reggae music and the impact      of Rastafari culture on the music as well.      Since the beginning of its rise to international popularity in the      1960's and 1970's, there has been a close association between reggae      artists and Rastafari culture, a culture founded on resistance.      The Rastafari in Jamaica have inhabited a marginalized place in      society. Scorned by society for their beliefs and appearance, they      have been, and continue to be, disenfranchised from the means of      production and wealth in Jamaica. Perhaps because of this disenfranchisement,      Rastafari brethren and sistren have always been at the forefront      in contesting the institutionalized racism and classism inherited      from the colonial system. The Rastafari in Jamaica were among the      first on the island to look to Africa as the source of their ancestry      and identity, and were also among the first to use reggae music      as a form of protest against the oppressive social conditions on      the island. Following in the revolutionary spirit of the Maroons      (communities of runaway slaves who fought against British slavers      in Jamaica in the early 18th century), the Rastafari sought to distance      themselves from the colonial culture of the island both in appearance      and in beliefs.      The brutality targeted against the Rastafari in Jamaica was manifest      in the police practice of cutting off a Rastafarian's locks, an      actual and symbolic act meant to strip the Rastafari of their faith      and power. It is little wonder that reggae music, a socially acceptable      and viable product, became a means of political resistance through      performance. Reggae music's lyrics, imbued with biblical imagery      and symbolism, constitute a performative act. In the process of      performing the music, reggae artists were actually protesting against      the oppressive forces of the Babylon system. For the Rastafari,      the Babylon system represents all of the exploitative and oppressive      practices in Jamaica (in particular) and Western society (in general).      This oppressive system began to come under increasing scrutiny in      reggae music. Reggae lyrics, like the above, are indicative of the      reggae protest songs popular during the 1960's and 1970's. Marley's      lyrics, similar to the lyrics of his contemporaries, illustrate      the reggae artists' negative view of the Babylon system, manifest      in the oppressive political policy of the Jamaican government at      the time. During the early rise of the reggae protest songs the      Jamaican government banned many reggae recordings critical of governmental      practices, or these reggae protest songs received very little airplay.      This practice of banning or underplaying the reggae protest songs      reveals the social force and power of this form of protest, which      the Jamaican government sought to control.      Despite (or perhaps because of) the Jamaican government's recognition      of the revolutionary power of reggae protest music, by the mid to      late 1970's, Rastafari symbolism and reggae music began to be increasingly      appropriated by the political parties in Jamaica. This was most      notably manifest during the fierce and violent political campaigns      of the late 1970's between Michael Manley and opposition leader      Edward Seaga, in which Rastafari religious symbolism and reggae      music became an integral part of the political landscape. Rastafari      symbolism and reggae music became a symbolic representation of both      political parties' attempts to show their sympathy with the plight      of the disenfranchised and underrepresented populations in Jamaica.      This attempt by both parties to show a connection to reggae music      and Rastafari culture was evidenced at Bob Marley's 1978 &quot;One      Love Peace Concert&quot; in Kingston, Jamaica, at which Manley and      Seaga both appeared on stage. Marley, flanked by the two politicians,      clasped both of their hands together with his and raised them over      his head in a symbolic call for unity and an end to politically      inspired violence in Jamaica. Yet, despite this symbolic allegiance,      the actual manifestation of political policy to improve the conditions      of the majority of the impoverished Jamaican citizens and policies      to stop the violence associated with politics in Jamaica were never      realized. Although this appropriation of reggae protest music did      not result in any structural changes in governmental practices or      political policy, it did bring reggae protest music into the national      consciousness as a powerful political protest tool. In many ways,      the appropriation of reggae protest music by the Jamaican political      parties legitimized this performative practice as a viable form      of political protest and as a type of nonviolent resistance.      Reggae music and Rastafari culture continue to be revolutionary      and accessible forms of performative art/speech. A new generation      of reggae artists emerging in the 1990's was able to combine conscious      lyrics with hardcore dancehall and hip-hop rhythms, again popularizing      this form of musical protest and introducing the music to a new      generation of listeners. Current reggae artists like Buju Banton,      Anthony B, Sizzla, Capleton, and the Marley Brothers, along with      many others, continue to usher reggae music and Rastafari culture      into the mainstream consciousness of Western society. Reggae music      has contributed to a worldwide youth culture in which the music      is used as a commentary and criticism of social and political policies      considered unjust by the artists. Reggae musicians continue to use      their music as a forum for political protest and as a means for      raising consciousness amongst urban youth populations. The rise      in popularity of Rastafari symbolism in the late twentieth century      into the twenty-first century is evidenced by the ever broadening      social acceptance (in the West) of the dreadlocks hairstyle and      reggae music. Further, the inclusion of reggae music as a category      in the Grammy awards in 1985 was an acknowledgement of the mainstream      acceptance of both the music and the culture from which it originated.      Although reggae music and Rastafari culture continue to work as      viable and accessible forms of protest, the recent trend in reggae      and dancehall music towards more 'rudeboy', materialistic lyrics      undermines the historical and social context out of which earlier      reggae protest music originated. Despite the far-reaching possibilities      for the continued use of reggae music as a platform for political      and social commentary, its inclusion into mainstream popular culture      must necessarily shape the form and content of the music and the      culture. Rastafari symbolism, likewise, has continued to lose its      meaning and significance in the face of its own rise in popularity.      Reggae music and Rastafari culture, which historically constituted      a performative act of protest and contestation, both in the performance      of the music and in the physical embodiment of a Rastafari appearance,      have come to be identified in popular culture as simply a genre      of music or a style of dress and hairstyle. The diminishment of      reggae music and Rastafari culture as forms of protest is evidenced      in the fact that as the music and culture become increasingly more      popular and mainstream, the revolutionary history of this particular      performative practice is slowly being lost. The loss of the historical      context out of which the music originated, coupled with the economic      incentives to mass produce the music and culture, have moved this      performative practice farther away from the realm of revolutionary      practice and closer to the realm of performance as product and commodity.      However, as long as there is a single reggae artist who continues      to honor the struggle and revolutionary spirit out of which this      music originated, it will continue to serve as an effective example      of performance-as-protest for future generations.

Through readings in literature, history, and cultural studies - in addition to analysis of recordings and films - we study the ways African communities use music to represent their beliefs and practices and to respond to the institutions dominating their societies. Through reading and listening, we raise questions about the historical itineraries linking distant musical communities across North, South, East, and West Africa; about the dynamic relationship between religion, culture, and politics as expressed in musical performance; about the categories of traditional, popular, and sacred musics - and the spaces of creativity and community in between these categories; about musical memory of the pre-colonial past, colonialism, and African independence; and finally, about musical imaginations of African unity and African futures. The music we listen to ranges from oral praise poetry, to indigenous initiation songs, to Africa Islamic poetry and choral hymns, to a variety of popular genres such as Algerian ra \u00ef , Senegalese mbalax , South African jazz, and Ethiopian rap. Our readings will include both academic literature and musical writings by African authors such as Francis Bebey, J.H.
