After a short presentation of Swahili\u2019s history, codification, and relation to other languages, students are drilled in phonetics and grammar. They are also introduced to some poems, songs, and oral narratives. Swahili I \u2013 Intermediate -SCA-UA 123 Prerequisites: Elementary Swahili I and Elementary Swahili II. This course builds upon the basic knowledge of the pronunciation, vocabulary, useful expressions and fundamental grammatical features already attained at introductory level to strengthen reading, writing, and conversation skills accessing a wide range of grammatical and literary knowledge of the language, its cultural context, and literary genre. The students are required to familiarize themselves with a novel and a play written in Kiswahili.  Swahili II \u2013 Intro -SCA-UA 122.001  Prerequisites: Intro   to Swahili   I                             HAKUNA MATATA. Building upon the basic concepts of communicative   Swahili, this course moves one level higher. It reiterates and   reinforces the basic concepts and adds more building blocks to introduce   compound and complex structures. The skills hitherto attained are   concretely expressed in short descriptive essays written in Swahili.    Swahili II \u2013 Intermediate -SCA-UA 124.001  Prerequisites: Intro to Swahili I and II, Intermediate Swahili I. The   focus of this course is to enable students to communicate fluently in   Kiswahili by applying the knowledge acquired in the beginner\u2019s levels   and intermediate I level. Students are expected to carry out   bidirectional conversations and negotiate technical language. Although   at this level students have mastered some intricacies of Kiswahili   grammar and a wide range of vocabulary from various topics, more   vocabulary and grammatical will skills will be applied. Therefore,   students will be enriched with idiomatic expressions, colloquial   expressions and vocabulary, proverbs and Kiswahili sayings used in   everyday speech so as to equip them to face the real challenge of the   language. Additionally, students will be involved in reading literary   and non literary works and analyzing them at their level as well as   engage in simple creative and technical writing, and translations. The   cultural aspect of language will be integrated and emphasized in most   topics.  Topics in Pan-Africanism: Yoruba I - SCA-UA 181.001 The main objective of this course is to develop elementary knowledge of the African language Yoruba, appropriate for the introductory level. By the end of the course, the student should be able to: (1) to read, write and understand simple concepts in Yoruba, minimally understand and be understood in Yoruba, and have fundamental knowledge of the Yoruba culture. Topics in Pan-Africansim: Yoruba II - SCA-UA 181-002  This is a continuation of Yoruba 1, therefore a minimum of one Semester hours or its equivalent experience in Yoruba language is required. The main objective is to further sharpen the Yoruba linguistic acuity that the student acquired at the introductory level. By the end of the course, the student should be able to: (1) to read, write and understand simple to moderately complex concepts in Yoruba; (2)minimally understand and be understood in Yoruba; (3) and advance in knowledge of the Yoruba culture.
