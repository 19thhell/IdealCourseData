It provides a space for students to share, discuss and review research into the field of human rights. Speaking about human rights almost inevitably involves encountering questions of education: cultural change and stability, authority and persuasion, norm diffusion and globalization, history and remembering, nationalism and democracy. We bring these two fields together in order to create a unique and interdisciplinary dialogue. &lsquo;Human rights and education&rsquo; is an expansive and sweeping concept, and topics covered in colloquia are correspondingly broad.    Dates and Location, Spring 2015    The Human Rights and Education Colloquium, in collaboration with students at Teachers College, will meet four times this spring. The meetings will be the first Wednesday of each month, as follows:       February 4th, 2015, 5:30-7:00PM , Teachers College, Columbia University    Russell 302, 3rd Floor of the Library       March 4th, 2015, 5:30-7:00PM , NYU Kimball Hall, 3rd Floor Conference Room       April 1st, 2015, 5:30-7:00PM , Teachers College, Columbia University    Russell 302, 3rd Floor of the Library       May 6th, 2015, 5:30-7:00PM , NYU Kimball Hall, 3rd Floor Conference Room       The sessions start with two 15-minute presentations followed by questions and a discussion. The presentation topics are interdisciplinary and cover a variety of topics. Our past presenters explored the teaching and remembering in post-Pinochet Chile, human rights in Islam, palliative care in West Africa, multiculturalism and human rights in Canada, peacemaking process in Colombia, education in refugee camps and many more. There are many ways to approach human rights and education: We welcome you to share thoughts and creativity with HREC!

It provides a space for students to share, discuss and review research into the field of human rights. Speaking about human rights almost inevitably involves encountering questions of education: cultural change and stability, authority and persuasion, norm diffusion and globalization, history and remembering, nationalism and democracy. We bring these two fields together in order to create a unique and interdisciplinary dialogue. &lsquo;Human rights and education&rsquo; is an expansive and sweeping concept, and topics covered in colloquia are correspondingly broad.    Dates and Location, Spring 2015    The Human Rights and Education Colloquium, in collaboration with students at Teachers College, will meet four times this spring. The meetings will be the first Wednesday of each month, as follows:       February 4th, 2015, 5:30-7:00PM , Teachers College, Columbia University    Russell 302, 3rd Floor of the Library       March 4th, 2015, 5:30-7:00PM , NYU Kimball Hall, 3rd Floor Conference Room       April 1st, 2015, 5:30-7:00PM , Teachers College, Columbia University    Russell 302, 3rd Floor of the Library       May 6th, 2015, 5:30-7:00PM , NYU Kimball Hall, 3rd Floor Conference Room       The sessions start with two 15-minute presentations followed by questions and a discussion. The presentation topics are interdisciplinary and cover a variety of topics. Our past presenters explored the teaching and remembering in post-Pinochet Chile, human rights in Islam, palliative care in West Africa, multiculturalism and human rights in Canada, peacemaking process in Colombia, education in refugee camps and many more. There are many ways to approach human rights and education: We welcome you to share thoughts and creativity with HREC!       For more information, or to submit a presentation proposal, contact Alexandra Cobus at ac5058@nyu.edu .       How do I present?    How do I present?    If you already know what you would like to present, please, send a short 100-150 words abstract to the co-chairs (Alexandra Cobus, at ac5058@nyu.edu or Shannon Lee, at shl2143@tc.columbia.edu ). If you are wondering whether your research relates to HREC, please contact us and we will be happy to discuss it!       We currently accept the applications for all the four Fall sessions on a rolling basis. We recommend submitting them sooner than later so we can plan the session and pair you up with another presentation to stimulate the best discussion.

It provides a space for students to share, discuss and review research into the field of human rights. Speaking about human rights almost inevitably involves encountering questions of education: cultural change and stability, authority and persuasion, norm diffusion and globalization, history and remembering, nationalism and democracy. We bring these two fields together in order to create a unique and interdisciplinary dialogue. &lsquo;Human rights and education&rsquo; is an expansive and sweeping concept, and topics covered in colloquia are correspondingly broad.    Dates and Location, Spring 2015    The Human Rights and Education Colloquium, in collaboration with students at Teachers College, will meet four times this spring. The meetings will be the first Wednesday of each month, as follows:       February 4th, 2015, 5:30-7:00PM , Teachers College, Columbia University    Russell 302, 3rd Floor of the Library       March 4th, 2015, 5:30-7:00PM , NYU Kimball Hall, 3rd Floor Conference Room       April 1st, 2015, 5:30-7:00PM , Teachers College, Columbia University    Russell 302, 3rd Floor of the Library       May 6th, 2015, 5:30-7:00PM , NYU Kimball Hall, 3rd Floor Conference Room       The sessions start with two 15-minute presentations followed by questions and a discussion. The presentation topics are interdisciplinary and cover a variety of topics. Our past presenters explored the teaching and remembering in post-Pinochet Chile, human rights in Islam, palliative care in West Africa, multiculturalism and human rights in Canada, peacemaking process in Colombia, education in refugee camps and many more. There are many ways to approach human rights and education: We welcome you to share thoughts and creativity with HREC!

Students will explore the human rights law, the activists, organizations, policy makers and media influencers in various national and global contexts who are involved in human rights movements, and their efforts to secure social justice across the globe. Focusing on education as a &ldquo;multiplier&rdquo; of other human rights &ndash; the course will introduce students to international treaties, mandates and laws that support the right to education, as well as, grassroots and civil society advocacy strategies to promote education rights.    Through course readings, lectures, guest speakers and site visits in New York and Buenos Aries, students will gain scholarly insight into how human rights, and particularly education rights movements in the US and Latin America work, and have the opportunity to engage with social justice activists to understand how universal laws and principles are understood and enacted in national and local contexts, how human rights advocates draw attention to their struggles, and the challenges they face in their work to secure justice and opportunity for people across the globe.
