We will read literary works by Disraeli, Stendhal, Trollope, Zola, Mallarm\u00e9 and Proust that explore the microphenomenology of political life; the diffusion and dilution of \"the Political\" in the social; the elusiveness and formlessness of the political event; the role of contingency in A central question will be: How is politics as a scene of maneuvers and application of cunning (is Machiavellianism) mapped on (or not) to formal, abstract models of political aesthetics (capitalist epic, democracy in language, the \"revolutionary\" dimension of avant-gardism, comic forms of class struggle, tragic forms of communitas)? The final section of the course will examine politics as a popular, contemporary genre, especially in film and epic television serials. Examples studied will be Roberto Saviano's hit TV series Come Away With Me (read with Paolo Flores d'Arcais,'s \"Anatomy of Berlusconismo), Armando Iannucci's film In the Loop, and the recent TV series House of Cards.  Revisiting the Western Classics: Ancient Materialisms: Matter &amp; Gender in Classical Antiquity  Bianchi This is the first part of a two-course sequence on the history of materialisms in Western philosophy and literature. The second will be taught by Jacques Lezra in Spring 2014. Each class may be taken independently. In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d it is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific historical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the Latin \u2018materia\u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally, wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient texts, including prephilosophical cosmogonies, Presocratic philosophies of nature, Greek atomism, Plato\u2019s Timaeus, Aristotle\u2019s Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals, and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on contemporary readings including those of Kristeva, Irigaray, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19th century conception of Mutterrecht. Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation.  Topics in Black Literature: Fanon &amp; Glissant as Post Negritude Thinkers  Diawara The idea is to take the 1956 Congress of Black Writers and Artists, organized by Presence Africaine in Paris (at the Sorbonne), as a seminal moment, not only for the theories of decolonization, but also for ways of imagining Black and African modernities beyond Negritude. For the first time at this, writers, writers were proposing alternative ideas--Metissage, creolization and national culture--instead of the all encompassing theory of Negritude and its variances of Africanism. The course will first focus on the significance of this Congress to what we call Black Cultural Studies, today, and then attempt to situate and read the texts of Fanon and Glissant in relation to Senghor and Cesaire.  Special Topics in Theory: Edward Said, Comparative Genealogies, and Intellectual Practice Dopico Ten years after his death, we reflect on the intellectual and political legacies, the critical genealogies, and the web of affiliations and interlocutors that Edward Said inscribed for comparative literature. We consider his works from Beginnings on and engage alongside his texts those of his chief influences and interlocutors, including Vico, Gramsci, Arendt, Auerbach, de Man, Derrida, Foucault, Williams and Hall. We will think about his work, his negotiations with various genealogies and intellectual formations, and his role in redefining disciplinary boundaries, historical disciplines like comparatism and emergent fields like postcolonial studies. We will think about his practices as an academic and public intellectual, consider how Said reflected on genre, medium, vocation, and worldliness, and how the essay served as the paradigmatic heuristic practice for his critical engagements.  Culture and Critique: Transnational America   Garcia This seminar examines the transnational turn in U.S. literary studies and the resulting reconfiguration of the relationship between American Studies and Comparative Literature. We explore aesthetic accounts of \u201cAmerica\u201d during different historical junctures and devote special attention to re-conceptualizations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that create new objects of analysis, both smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. We examine longstanding varieties of comparative cultural studies, including theories of the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of the planetary. Among our recurrent themes will be the anti-colonial imagination nurtured by transnational intellectual cultures. Alongside works by such writers as Henry James, Claude McKay, Sherwood Anderson, Nella Larsen, and Jean Toomer, we consider the implications of recent social theory (Spivak, Laclau, Zizek, among others) for twenty-first century comparative American studies.  Discourse and Society: Third Worldism: Bandung, Afro-Asianness, Non-Alignment, &amp; the Middle East  Halim This course addresses a series of overlapping Third-Worldist internationalist movements starting from Bandung (1955) with a focus on the Middle East. Through theoretical texts, journals of the period, and conference statements, accompanied by some literary texts, we will interrogate the prehistory of postcolonial theory, which is generally dated to the publication in 1978 of Edward W. Said\u2019s Orientalism and ask what political purchase may still attach to the term \u201cThird World,\u201d for example in the Arab Spring. Readings by, among others, Anouar Abdel Malek; Aijaz Ahmad; Samir Amin; Mohamed El-Bisatie; Rachid al-Daif; Arif Dirlik; Frantz Fanon; Amitav Ghosh; Alex LaGuma; Roel Meijer; Kwame Nkrumah; Edward Said; Helmy Sharawy; Richard Wright; and Robert Young.  Literature, History, and Politics: Comparative Internationalisms  Ross Internationalism is a central political and cultural force of the modern era. Yet unlike the vast literature on empire and nationalism, the study of radical internationalism has been comparatively meager. This seminar will study the cultural politics of late 19th century Europe in the wake of the Paris Commune of 1871, paying particular attention to the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud, Kropotkin\u2019s political theory, the multifarious writing and activities of William Morris, as well as other figures including Elisee Reclus and Paul Lafargue. Topics to include internationalism, anti-productivism, anarchism.   Contemporary Critical Theories: Freud\u2019s Case Histories  Sanders Psychoanalysis has played a crucial part in the evolution of the critical theories that inform our practice in literary studies. From the efforts of the Frankfurt School to come to terms with the terrifying conjuncture represented by the rise of Fascism in Europe, to the emergence of postcolonial critique in Frantz Fanon and others, to deconstruction, and feminist and queer theory, psychoanalysis has been widely appropriated\u2014often critically, but almost always productively. In this seminar, we shall immerse ourselves in what are the key classical demonstrations of the setting to work of psychoanalysis\u2014namely, Freud\u2019s major case histories: from the Studies on Hysteria, to the cases of Dora, Little Hans, the Rat Man, Senatspr\u00e4sident Schreber, and the Wolf Man. Attention will also be devoted to Freud\u2019s papers on technique. In order to link Freud\u2019s texts to more recent developments in theory and cultural studies, we shall be considering them through the lens of the commentaries devoted to them by Jacques Lacan, as well as important subsequent interventions by Jacqueline Rose, Juliet Mitchell, Nicolas Abraham &amp; Maria Torok, Jacques Derrida, Friedrich Kittler, Avital Ronell, and Eric Santner.

Particular emphasis will be  placed on the modern lyric from formalist, historicist,  rhetorical/deconstructive, hermeneutic, cultural-sociological  (materialist), literary historical, philosophical perspectives. We will  examine how lyric poetry teaches us about these approaches and the  relationship between them, and to what extent poems contains their own  ars poetica (\u201cthe art of poetry\u201d)\u2013 or how reading poetry can teach us  how to read in general.We will focus on a selection of poems by the  following authors: Sappho, Pindar, Du Fu, Li Po; William Wordsworth,  Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Robert Browning; Emily Dickinson,  Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop, Anne Carson; Friedrich  H\u00f6lderlin, Rainer Maria Rilke; Charles Baudelaire, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9,  Paul Celan; Yehuda Amichai, Octavio Paz.    The seminar will instruct students in basic and advanced skills of  interpreting lyric poetry, and in recognizing the differences between  periods, forms, and poets. It is also intended as a reflection on the  field of comparative literature by reading comparatively a range of  poets from distinct backgrounds and traditions.

G29.2610, G91.2610, G65.2614         Sight enables representation ,  which is when the subject is opposed to the relatively stable object or image. Seeing  is directly linked with naming and the recognition of \u201cessences\u201d in things.  Doing is a pure activity that avoids any semantic or  essentialist crystallization of meaning. Doing is traditionally repressed by  Seeing, Making-- by the final product of labor. This repression of activity by  the product reflects an overall domination of commodities and forms. The course  will focus on the activity of Doing from the points of view of Plato and  Aristotle to modern thinkers. We will discuss different ways that form unfolds  without reaching a point of finality (weaving, ornament, music etc.). We will  analyze films and different kinds of performances that oppose the notion of  form. We will study productivist    art of the 1920s. Special attention  will be paid to the problem of expressivity   ( Meyerhold , Eisenstein) and pathos in Warburg\u2019s theorization. We will also discuss relations  between expressivity and the inform ( Bataille ), the idea of disequilibrium as the origin of  meaning. The discussion of Doing allows us to question temporality in different  media and to overcome the established model of art criticism based on the  notion of representation.        Directed Research I          Ross        G29.3998       This is an independent research course in which students, working  closely with a professor within Comparative Literature, will begin the  necessary research to frame their dissertation topic and prepare an  initial bibliography.

Yet unlike the vast literature on empire and nationalism,  the study of radical internationalism has been comparatively meager.  Organized as a joint History and Comparative Literature seminar, this  course seeks to introduce students to the broad contours of a central  political and cultural phenomenon that acquired global appeal in  different historical moments. We will focus in particular on the  intellectual and cultural foundations of internationalisms, its  animating political horizon, and its relationship to its main political  competitors mainly imperialism, nationalism, and fascism. Leading off  with theoretical approaches to internationalism, the readings examine  three main conjunctures: the late 19th century, the interwar decades,  and the decolonization era. The course concludes with a discussion of  contemporary models of \u2018World Literature\u201d and \u201cWorld History\u2019 and of  the challenges posed by studying a movement that was at once  historically intermittent and trans-regional in scope.

G29.2600; G41.3920         (PhD students only; permission of instructor required for MA students)        In this new interdisciplinary course, we will explore intersections of  word, image, and sound in the work of internationally celebrated South  African artist William Kentridge. Timed to coincide with his direction  of Shostakovich\u2019s opera, The Nose , at the Metropolitan Opera  House in March 2010, our seminar will concentrate on Kentridge\u2019s  collaborative theatre projects, and his films, drawings, and etchings,  with a specific emphasis on his adaptations of literary works by Alfred  Jarry, Georg B\u00fcchner, Italo Svevo, and Nikolai Gogol, which we will  study in depth. As a complement to Kentridge\u2019s filmic imagining of  Johannesburg in Mine and other animations, we will read texts  by South African author Ivan Vladislavic and other key writers of the  city such as Georg Simmel and Walter Benjamin. The larger goal of the  course is, by meeting the challenge posed by Kentridge\u2019s oeuvre, to  formulate theoretical protocols for the study of composite art forms.

G29.1951    The intersections of literature, film, and  policing have fundamentally shaped the emergence, development, use, and abuse  of key concepts such as identity, identification, subject, writing, evidence,  authorship, and authority. While writers, filmmakers and police agents have  their own ways of doing things with words and images, this course wagers that  an interdisciplinary exploration can throw light on obscure corners as well as  cornerstones of literary and film studies, as well as on the potential and  limits of the disciplines and of interdisciplinary work. In the course of this  exploration, we will ask questions such as: How do the police translate a life  into a text\u2014the police file? What do the techniques used in this translation, such  as identifying, describing, characterizing, have to do with literary history? What  were film cameras doing in the Gulag and in the Nazi camps? And how was the  moving image affected by its excursion through these camps?           Organized thematically in units such as \u201c Criminal Subjects: Identity,  Identification, Individuation,\u201d \u201cFemale Criminals,\u201d \u201cClues, Signs and  Symptoms,\u201d \u201cThe Novel and the Police,\u201d \u201cRevising the Crime: Cinematic  Reenactments,\u201d and \u201cAesthetics and Policing,\u201d the      readings and screenings range from criminology manuals and  treatises to secret police files and films, and on to more common fare of  literary and film studies, as described below.          Primary texts (the readings and films  are listed in the probable order they will appear on the syllabus)      Michel Foucault,   Discipline and Punish      Edgar Allan Poe, The Complete Stories, selections       Arthur Conan Doyle, The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, selections      Jorge Lois Borges, Labyrinths , selections      Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Crime  and Punishment       Sinan Antoon ,   I'Jaam : an Iraqi Rhapsody      Herta Muller, The   Appointment      Plato, The Apology      Maxim Gorky, ed., The Belomor Canal, selections          Films      Fritz Lang, M, 1931      Jean-Luc Godard, Vivre   sa vie, 1962      Errol Morris, The Thin  Blue Line, 1988      Abbas Kiarostami ,   Close-up , 1990      Mohsen Makhmalbaf ,   A Moment of Innocence, 1996      Corneliu Porumboiu ,   Police, Adjective, 2009          Additional articles   by Tom Gunning, Mikhail Bakhtin , D.A.

We will read literary works by Disraeli, Stendhal, Trollope, Zola, Mallarm\u00e9 and Proust that explore the microphenomenology of political life; the diffusion and dilution of \"the Political\" in the social; the elusiveness and formlessness of the political event; the role of contingency in A central question will be: How is politics as a scene of maneuvers and application of cunning (is Machiavellianism) mapped on (or not) to formal, abstract models of political aesthetics (capitalist epic, democracy in language, the \"revolutionary\" dimension of avant-gardism, comic forms of class struggle, tragic forms of communitas)? The final section of the course will examine politics as a popular, contemporary genre, especially in film and epic television serials. Examples studied will be Roberto Saviano's hit TV series Come Away With Me (read with Paolo Flores d'Arcais,'s \"Anatomy of Berlusconismo), Armando Iannucci's film In the Loop, and the recent TV series House of Cards.  Revisiting the Western Classics: Ancient Materialisms: Matter &amp; Gender in Classical Antiquity  Bianchi This is the first part of a two-course sequence on the history of materialisms in Western philosophy and literature. The second will be taught by Jacques Lezra in Spring 2014. Each class may be taken independently. In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d it is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific historical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the Latin \u2018materia\u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally, wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient texts, including prephilosophical cosmogonies, Presocratic philosophies of nature, Greek atomism, Plato\u2019s Timaeus, Aristotle\u2019s Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals, and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on contemporary readings including those of Kristeva, Irigaray, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19th century conception of Mutterrecht. Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation.  Topics in Black Literature: Fanon &amp; Glissant as Post Negritude Thinkers  Diawara The idea is to take the 1956 Congress of Black Writers and Artists, organized by Presence Africaine in Paris (at the Sorbonne), as a seminal moment, not only for the theories of decolonization, but also for ways of imagining Black and African modernities beyond Negritude. For the first time at this, writers, writers were proposing alternative ideas--Metissage, creolization and national culture--instead of the all encompassing theory of Negritude and its variances of Africanism. The course will first focus on the significance of this Congress to what we call Black Cultural Studies, today, and then attempt to situate and read the texts of Fanon and Glissant in relation to Senghor and Cesaire.  Special Topics in Theory: Edward Said, Comparative Genealogies, and Intellectual Practice Dopico Ten years after his death, we reflect on the intellectual and political legacies, the critical genealogies, and the web of affiliations and interlocutors that Edward Said inscribed for comparative literature. We consider his works from Beginnings on and engage alongside his texts those of his chief influences and interlocutors, including Vico, Gramsci, Arendt, Auerbach, de Man, Derrida, Foucault, Williams and Hall. We will think about his work, his negotiations with various genealogies and intellectual formations, and his role in redefining disciplinary boundaries, historical disciplines like comparatism and emergent fields like postcolonial studies. We will think about his practices as an academic and public intellectual, consider how Said reflected on genre, medium, vocation, and worldliness, and how the essay served as the paradigmatic heuristic practice for his critical engagements.  Culture and Critique: Transnational America   Garcia This seminar examines the transnational turn in U.S. literary studies and the resulting reconfiguration of the relationship between American Studies and Comparative Literature. We explore aesthetic accounts of \u201cAmerica\u201d during different historical junctures and devote special attention to re-conceptualizations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that create new objects of analysis, both smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. We examine longstanding varieties of comparative cultural studies, including theories of the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of the planetary. Among our recurrent themes will be the anti-colonial imagination nurtured by transnational intellectual cultures. Alongside works by such writers as Henry James, Claude McKay, Sherwood Anderson, Nella Larsen, and Jean Toomer, we consider the implications of recent social theory (Spivak, Laclau, Zizek, among others) for twenty-first century comparative American studies.  Discourse and Society: Third Worldism: Bandung, Afro-Asianness, Non-Alignment, &amp; the Middle East  Halim This course addresses a series of overlapping Third-Worldist internationalist movements starting from Bandung (1955) with a focus on the Middle East. Through theoretical texts, journals of the period, and conference statements, accompanied by some literary texts, we will interrogate the prehistory of postcolonial theory, which is generally dated to the publication in 1978 of Edward W. Said\u2019s Orientalism and ask what political purchase may still attach to the term \u201cThird World,\u201d for example in the Arab Spring. Readings by, among others, Anouar Abdel Malek; Aijaz Ahmad; Samir Amin; Mohamed El-Bisatie; Rachid al-Daif; Arif Dirlik; Frantz Fanon; Amitav Ghosh; Alex LaGuma; Roel Meijer; Kwame Nkrumah; Edward Said; Helmy Sharawy; Richard Wright; and Robert Young.  Literature, History, and Politics: Comparative Internationalisms  Ross Internationalism is a central political and cultural force of the modern era. Yet unlike the vast literature on empire and nationalism, the study of radical internationalism has been comparatively meager. This seminar will study the cultural politics of late 19th century Europe in the wake of the Paris Commune of 1871, paying particular attention to the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud, Kropotkin\u2019s political theory, the multifarious writing and activities of William Morris, as well as other figures including Elisee Reclus and Paul Lafargue. Topics to include internationalism, anti-productivism, anarchism.   Contemporary Critical Theories: Freud\u2019s Case Histories  Sanders Psychoanalysis has played a crucial part in the evolution of the critical theories that inform our practice in literary studies. From the efforts of the Frankfurt School to come to terms with the terrifying conjuncture represented by the rise of Fascism in Europe, to the emergence of postcolonial critique in Frantz Fanon and others, to deconstruction, and feminist and queer theory, psychoanalysis has been widely appropriated\u2014often critically, but almost always productively. In this seminar, we shall immerse ourselves in what are the key classical demonstrations of the setting to work of psychoanalysis\u2014namely, Freud\u2019s major case histories: from the Studies on Hysteria, to the cases of Dora, Little Hans, the Rat Man, Senatspr\u00e4sident Schreber, and the Wolf Man. Attention will also be devoted to Freud\u2019s papers on technique. In order to link Freud\u2019s texts to more recent developments in theory and cultural studies, we shall be considering them through the lens of the commentaries devoted to them by Jacques Lacan, as well as important subsequent interventions by Jacqueline Rose, Juliet Mitchell, Nicolas Abraham &amp; Maria Torok, Jacques Derrida, Friedrich Kittler, Avital Ronell, and Eric Santner.

We will  examine how lyric poetry teaches us about these approaches and the  relationship between them, and to what extent poems contains their own  ars poetica (\u201cthe art of poetry\u201d)\u2013 or how reading poetry can teach us  how to read in general.We will focus on a selection of poems by the  following authors: Sappho, Pindar, Du Fu, Li Po; William Wordsworth,  Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Robert Browning; Emily Dickinson,  Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop, Anne Carson; Friedrich  H\u00f6lderlin, Rainer Maria Rilke; Charles Baudelaire, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9,  Paul Celan; Yehuda Amichai, Octavio Paz.    The seminar will instruct students in basic and advanced skills of  interpreting lyric poetry, and in recognizing the differences between  periods, forms, and poets. It is also intended as a reflection on the  field of comparative literature by reading comparatively a range of  poets from distinct backgrounds and traditions.

G29.2610, G91.2610, G65.2614         Sight enables representation ,  which is when the subject is opposed to the relatively stable object or image. Seeing  is directly linked with naming and the recognition of \u201cessences\u201d in things.  Doing is a pure activity that avoids any semantic or  essentialist crystallization of meaning. Doing is traditionally repressed by  Seeing, Making-- by the final product of labor. This repression of activity by  the product reflects an overall domination of commodities and forms. The course  will focus on the activity of Doing from the points of view of Plato and  Aristotle to modern thinkers. We will discuss different ways that form unfolds  without reaching a point of finality (weaving, ornament, music etc.). We will  analyze films and different kinds of performances that oppose the notion of  form. We will study productivist    art of the 1920s. Special attention  will be paid to the problem of expressivity   ( Meyerhold , Eisenstein) and pathos in Warburg\u2019s theorization. We will also discuss relations  between expressivity and the inform ( Bataille ), the idea of disequilibrium as the origin of  meaning. The discussion of Doing allows us to question temporality in different  media and to overcome the established model of art criticism based on the  notion of representation.

G29.1951    The intersections of literature, film, and  policing have fundamentally shaped the emergence, development, use, and abuse  of key concepts such as identity, identification, subject, writing, evidence,  authorship, and authority. While writers, filmmakers and police agents have  their own ways of doing things with words and images, this course wagers that  an interdisciplinary exploration can throw light on obscure corners as well as  cornerstones of literary and film studies, as well as on the potential and  limits of the disciplines and of interdisciplinary work. In the course of this  exploration, we will ask questions such as: How do the police translate a life  into a text\u2014the police file? What do the techniques used in this translation, such  as identifying, describing, characterizing, have to do with literary history? What  were film cameras doing in the Gulag and in the Nazi camps? And how was the  moving image affected by its excursion through these camps?           Organized thematically in units such as \u201c Criminal Subjects: Identity,  Identification, Individuation,\u201d \u201cFemale Criminals,\u201d \u201cClues, Signs and  Symptoms,\u201d \u201cThe Novel and the Police,\u201d \u201cRevising the Crime: Cinematic  Reenactments,\u201d and \u201cAesthetics and Policing,\u201d the      readings and screenings range from criminology manuals and  treatises to secret police files and films, and on to more common fare of  literary and film studies, as described below.
