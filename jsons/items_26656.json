We will do everything in our power, to release decisions before and after the typical school day in America tomorrow.    This means decisions will be released in waves. Some decisions will be released before sunrise (here in New York City). Others will be sent in the late afternoon. We do this to minimize disruption to students during their school day here in the United States.   For students who will be admitted, a packet of materials &#8211; including an official admission letter &#8211; will be mailed &#8211; the old fashioned way &#8211; tomorrow.   For students who are offered admission, who met our February 15 financial aid application deadline, and who qualified for an award, we will post financial aid information online via our NYU Albert website tomorrow evening.   Admission decisions will not be posted online, nor will they be available over the phone until Monday, March 30.   We were humbled once again by the volume of interest in NYU this year and we truly appreciated the opportunity to read and learn about the 60,000+ students who applied for admission this year.                       16 Comments                I cant wait!

To clarify, students who are admitted will receive and email, and also a packet? or just the packet by mail? And does this apply to international applicants as well? thanks, Chris                             chris                   March 26, 2015                                                    Are the results for opportunity programs also coming tomorrow?

He received notice of being wait listed at NYU. If, by some wonderful alignment of the stars and moons, he is offered a space off the wait list, will it be an offer to Tisch specifically?   Thanks so much for your consideration!                             M.H.C.                   March 27, 2015                                                    What is the acceptance rate like for the class of 2019?

Was kinda excited to find out that I am wait-listed, until I realized there are approximately 9,000 applicants on the wait-list lol!!! Really?                             K                   March 27, 2015                                                    I checked online and my admission decision was posted. What does this mean? Is it not a real offer?                             K                   March 27, 2015                                                    Do you think you can leave us a post on how many students RSVP for wait-list this year? I am assuming not all 9,000 applicants RSVP for wait list.

Who can I contact to ask?                             Katarina                   March 28, 2015                                                    Hello,   I am glad to be accepted into Polytechnic School of Engineering at New York University. But I was wondering what I should do if I can not view my financial aid package. When I click on the financial aid summary after logging onto Albert, I am unable to click onto the aid year. This is what it looks like, http://gyazo.com/67e1280bbe81fc409f788107a033cff1 . Is it possible they are still in the process of uploading the financial aid packages?   Thank You for the help.
