The ultrasound intervention was effective when individuals were allowed to make different shapes with their tongue in order to produce the \u201cr\u201d sound, rather than being instructed to make a specific shape. The findings appear online in the Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research.   The \u201cr\u201d sound is one of the most frequent speech errors, and can be challenging to correct. For other sounds \u2013 such as \u201ct\u201d or \u201cp\u201d \u2013 speech pathologists can give clear verbal, visual or tactile cues to help children understand how the sound is created. \u201cR\u201d is difficult to show or describe in an easy-to-understand fashion.   In addition, most speech sounds are produced in the same way, but with \u201cr,\u201d normal speakers use widely different tongue shapes to create the sound. The two primary strategies to create the \u201cr\u201d sound include a retroflex tongue shape, where the tongue tip is pointed up, and the bunched tongue shape, where the tongue tip is pointed down and body of tongue bunches up toward the top of the mouth.   Up to 10 percent of children have speech sound disorders, according to the National Institutes of Health. Some children respond well to conventional forms of speech therapy, but others have errors that persist despite their therapists\u2019 best efforts. A growing body of evidence suggests that treatment incorporating visual biofeedback, which uses various technologies to create a dynamic visual representation of speech, could fill this need.   \u201cThe idea that you could get around the challenges with \u2018r\u2019 sounds by showing children their tongues as they are talking is really appealing to clinicians,\u201d says Tara McAllister Byun , an assistant professor in NYU Steinhardt\u2019s Department of Communicative Sciences and Disorders and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cThat's what ultrasound technology lets us do.\u201d   Linguists have used ultrasound in the past to study basic functions of speech, and in recent years, speech pathologists have begun exploring using ultrasound to treat children with speech errors. An ultrasound probe \u2013 similar to ones used in cardiac and tissue imaging \u2013 is held under the chin, and sound waves capture real-time images of the tongue. The images provide both the child and speech pathologist with information about the tongue\u2019s position and shape.   Using the ultrasound images as a guide, children learn how to manipulate their tongues, and speech pathologists advise them on how to make adjustments to better achieve different sounds.   Several case studies and small studies suggest that ultrasound biofeedback can successfully correct \u201cr\u201d speech errors. Byun and her colleagues set out to gather systematic evidence on the effectiveness of the treatment, studying eight children with difficulty pronouncing \u201cr\u201d sounds. Seven of the eight had previous speech therapy that was unsuccessful.   Four children participated in the initial eight-week study. They were taught to make a bunched tongue shape, guided by ultrasound, in an effort to better pronounce \u201cr.\u201d The researchers saw only small improvements among the four participants.   However, while trying to create a bunched tongue, one child stumbled upon a retroflex tongue shape and was able to improve her \u201cr\u201d sound. As a result of her success, the researchers altered their study design to allow participants to choose their own tongue shape, with individualized guidance from speech language pathologists.   A different four children participated in the second study over an eight-week period. Using ultrasound to visualize their tongues, all four participants in the second study showed significant improvement in their \u201cr\u201d sounds.   \u201cOur second study offers evidence that when flexibility is given to choose a tongue shape, rather than a one-size-fits all approach, ultrasound biofeedback treatment can be a highly effective intervention for children with trouble pronouncing \u2018r\u2019 sounds,\u201d Byun says.   The researchers noted that the two studies were not a controlled comparison, thus additional systematic research is needed before drawing strong conclusions about the importance of individualized tongue shapes.   In addition to McAllister Byun, study authors include Elaine R. Hitchcock and Michelle T. Swartz of Montclair State University.

She studies the way that people produce speech sounds, focusing mainly on children who have trouble saying the /r/ sound. She is experimenting with the use of ultrasound probes to give speakers visual feedback to help them find the way their own mouth can make the correct sound.   She welcomed us back into her \u201clab,\u201d which was a small double room that had a sound-proofed room separated from another tiny room by a door and a window. This setup makes it so that a subject can sit in the quiet space and make sounds and the researcher can sit in front of the computer (seeing the same screen the subject sees) and both can see each other without sharing noise.   After we all introduced ourselves, she gave us an overview of her work. She showed us the software they have used in the past called Sona-match, which allows a user to see a visualization of their speech sounds and potentially try to match that visualization with a preset of the \u201ccorrect\u201d sound.   We talked about a bunch of different aspects of her lab\u2019s work in a general conversational interview style. She mentioned that it had been tough to get enough appropriate candidate kids for her study until her lab got press in the Wall Street Journal. Because of the article, she had plenty of kids to work with and she was eager to develop a project that could lead to more positive exposure for her work. The idea of using a museum setting to get a wider sample of participants was particularly appealing. The obvious challenges in doing something like that would be 1) getting demographic details from each user, 2) noisy recordings, 3) getting an ultrasound machine and recorder system (and maintaining it), and 4) providing a trained docent or other helper that could stay with the exhibit.   She also showed us some resources we could take a look at to get up to speed with the content for our design planning. This included an amazing site that showed fMRI videos of speech production from USC &#8211; they even cataloged a person beatboxing .       sona-matchVideo     Debrief &#8211; Brainstorm Session One   After our initial interview with Dr. Byun, we got together to rough out some possibilities. We started off by tossing out the things we each were drawn to about the research. We agreed fairly quickly that we would begin by considering a museum-based experience, since all of us (including Dr. Byun) thought that could be both engaging and possibly useful for gathering data. We also felt that going for something more playful than a direct representation of information would be a better approach.   Brainstorming can be more productive by actively using tangents and looser associations, so we came at the concepts from a couple of different angles. We broke out the concepts on the whiteboard, at first without much regard for real feasibility. Then we considered pros and cons for different ideas, from costs to experience constraints. We also did a little exercise where we just played with some free association of anything /R/ related. We cast a wide net there, catching ideas as divergent as pirates from around the world with different accents, to ways /R/ can go wrong, to a bunch of alliteration of the epic varrrriety.   Because we still want to get feedback from Dr. Byun before whittling our concepts down too much, we decided to select the best three ideas for her to consider. It makes more sense to see what she thinks before going too far into one particular conceptual hole, but we have some solid possibilities.
