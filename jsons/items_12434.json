Curriculum Vitae              Bio   Barbara Weinstein's research has focused on postcolonial Latin America, particularly Brazil. Her courses and publications explore questions of labor, gender, race, and political economy in regions as diverse as the Amazon, with the world's largest rainforest, and the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Latin America\u2019s leading industrial center. Weinstein\u2019s book in progress--Race, Region, Nation: S\u00e3o Paulo and the Formation of Brazilian National Identities (forthcoming, Duke University Press)--considers a period in Brazilian history when the state of S\u00e3o Paulo emerged as the nation\u2019s dominant economic center and political force. Tracing elite and scholarly discourses in this period, she explores the way in which paulistas (natives of S\u00e3o Paulo), deploying highly racialized discourses, constructed a notion of S\u00e3o Paulo exceptionalism that produced a hierarchical, almost imperial view of the region\u2019s position within the Brazilian nation.

She has explored the relationship between medieval sign theory and both the concept of and markers of personal identity. Her investigation of medieval definitions of person and identity has revealed that loci of singularity and distinction did not necessarily overlap with or result in the creation of individuality.
