The lamp will be a three-dimensional set of vertices, each a 3D printed city-node designed based on descriptions of various cities in the Calvino\u2019s Invisible Cities. The cities will serve a purpose of little light bulbs with LEDs inside them, that will visualize a computer algorithm running on\u00a0Raspberry Pi solving the traveling salesman problem in real time between the cities.   Here is the first node-city I have modeled in Rhino, Valdrada:                                       Posted in Uncategorized                                                            Filleted Elliptical Mortise &amp; Tenon                   Posted on February 24, 2015  by  Gabriel Weintraub                          For another class, Subtraction, I&#8217;m experimenting with CNC joinery.
