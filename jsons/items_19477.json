[{"detail": [{"content": "PIRE on Mathematics, Mechanics, and Materials Science       Science at the Triple Point between Mathematics, Mechanics and Materials Science       January 2011 marks the initiation of a project \"Science at  the Triple Point between Mathematics, Mechanics, and  Materials Science,\" funded by NSF's PIRE program.  This collaborative, multi-institutional project involves  faculty from 4 US institutions and 5 European sites. Its  scientific themes involve applications of nonlinear PDE, the  calculus of variations, and scientific computing to problems from materials science, such as energy-driven pattern formation  and the evolution of material microstructure.   For more information see the project's main website .        Postdoc and PhD opportunities       Applications are due 12/17/10 for an NYU-based postdoctoral position. The postdoctoral scientist will work closely with Robert Kohn, and will interact extensively with groups at the project's other domestic and international nodes. In  particular, the postdoctoral scientist will have a senior  European PIRE partner as co-mentor, and will spend two  semesters at the co-mentor's institution. Priority will be  given to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. For more details and to apply, see www.mathjobs.org .      This project also has funding for an NYU-based PhD student.  Like the PIRE postdoc, this student will work closely with  Robert Kohn, and will interact extensively with groups at  the project's other domestic and international nodes. In  particular, the student will have a senior European PIRE  partner as co-mentor, and will spend a semester at the  co-mentor's institution. Priority will be given to U.S.  citizens and permanent residents. Prospective PhD  students interested in this opportunity should contact  Professor Kohn (kohn@cims.nyu.edu) while also applying  in the usual way through GSAS (see the math department  website for requirements and instructions)."}]}]
