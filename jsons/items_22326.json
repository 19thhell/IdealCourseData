The intent seems to be to purchase\u00a0data\u00a0infrastructure talent\u2014and very particular talent at that.   Basically, Apple needed to get into NoSQL database technology in a bad way. These alternatives to traditional relational databases (long known as SQL systems) offer speed and flexibility that older-style databases can only dream of.
