Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           This course examines the behavioral foundation for policy design, using urban transportation as examples. We introduce multiple frameworks of understanding travel behavior, rational or irrational, contrasting the perspectives of classic economic theory with behavioral economics and social psychology, and suggest corresponding policy interventions: a behavior--theory--policy mapping. Then we present a spectrum of instruments for positively influencing behavior and improving welfare: from manipulating information and changing perceptions of time and space, to pricing and framing, to inducing emotions of pride and shame, exploiting peer pressure or enhancing self-control and motivation, and to nudging and preference shaping. Most importantly the course challenges students 1) to critique, design, implement and interpret experiments that nudge travel behavior; and 2) to bring behavioral insights to creative design of transport polices, programs and plans\u2014making them not only efficient and equitable but also simpler, consistent, transparent, acceptable, and adaptive to behavioral changes.

The Center draws upon faculty and graduate students from NYU to conduct research on issues such as cities and mobility, the role of communications in mobility, the neuroscience of walking, and aviation and economic development.   NYU's\u00a0Rudin Center explores key issues in transportation, including information technology, the location of economic activity, and emerging trends in travel and work. We have built a Mobility Factbook exploring the 27 modes of transportation in New York City, and continue to research the use of CitiBike, social media in transit, and the future of mobility.\u00a0In addition, the Rudin Center has received national recognition for its\u00a0 research on super-commuting .   The Rudin Center was named in recognition of a gift from civic leader Lewis Rudin and receives support from leading firms in transportation, finance, and communications. The director of the Center is Mitchell L. Moss, Henry Hart Rice Professor of Urban Policy and Planning.
