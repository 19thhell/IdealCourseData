In an almost emblematic way, this position and function seems to be embodied in our image of the far-distant caravan trader, traversing on the so-called \u201cSilk roads\u201d the vast expanses between China and the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. However, it was not only traders that connected the civilizations of the ancient world via Central Asia: with and next to the traders\u2019 caravans traveled diplomats, missionaries, artists and many more; and vast parts of Eurasia were, again and again, connected and controlled by confederations and empires of nomadic origin. We inquire into the many facets, which characterize the resulting network, oscillating around Central Asia, from the Bronze Age onwards up to the days of the Mongol Empire, taking a multi-disciplinary approach to a considerable variety of primary evidence, ranging from ancient travel reports and business letters to spectacular archaeological artifacts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus Major social, cultural, and political transformation of the Middle East from late antiquity through the mid-thirteenth century, considered in the context of the formation and evolution of Islamic culture and polity. Examines the emergence of key concepts, practices, and cultural motifs of the medieval Islamic tradition. Also examines the emergence of the idea/concept of the \"Middle East\", the history and background of European interest in the region, as well as the crucial role of cultural encounter and dialogue (e.g., through trade, colonization, polemics) in the formation and development of identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 503, Cultures &amp; Contexts: South Asia Prof. Rajagopal (Media, Culture, &amp; Communication)  syllabus The South Asian subcontinent is in many ways at the heart of contemporary globalization. Few regions contain a higher density of population experiencing faster rates of social change. South Asia is the site of massive social transformations, ranging from new modes of consumption and aspiration, to accelerated urbanization, rising social inequality, and violent inter- and intra-state conflict. A little analyzed, yet central catalyst for these transformations is represented by media industries, which have grown at a rate greater than that of the economy as a whole for several years now. The current centrality of media to social life as neither entirely new, nor unprecedented, and provides entry points--from print and visual culture, to cinema, television, internet (including social media such as Youtube), and cellphones--for understanding both media history and South Asia, the relationship between culture and technology, the South Asian diaspora, mediated religion, and a range of inter-related topics. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 510, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Russia Prof. Kotsonis (History)  syllabus Focuses on distinctive historical and geographical dichotomies and issues in Russian culture. Emphasis is on primary documents, including literary works, travel notes, works of art, and political statements from all periods, chosen to establish the particular matrix of competing positions that make up the Russian national and cultural identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 512, Cultures &amp; Contexts: China Prof. Zhang (East Asian Studies)  syllabus  An introduction to the main issues and foundational texts of imperial and modern China. Selected readings include excerpts from early Chinese classics such as Classic of Odes and the Analects to the vernacular novels of late imperial China. The classical canon is then coupled with central texts from modern China, from the initial reflections of the mandarin scholars on a rapidly changing world, to writings on revolution, the modern state, and the new culture of the enlightened individual by leading Chinese intellectuals in the 20th century. Rather than a display of cultural and literary edifices, our intellectual and critical interest is to rethink Chinese traditions, both imperial and modern, in terms of continuity as well as discontinuity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Fleming (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 515, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 529, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Beltr\u00e1n (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus  Explores the political, social, and cultural practices of Latinos in the   United States using a historical and interdisciplinary approach. Draws   on literature, history, politics, as well as social and political   theory to address issues of participation, under-representation, and   civic and economic empowerment. Topics include immigration, social   movements, figures of resistance, identities, popular culture, and   language. Of particular concern is the idea and representation of a   pan-ethnic \u201cLatino\u201d identity encompassing all the diverse national   groups, and the emergence of this concept in both the cultural and   political life of these communities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 532, Cultures &amp; Contexts: African Diaspora Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  The dispersal of Africans to various parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their relationship to both African and to non-African influences. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 536, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Indigenous Australia Prof. Myers (Anthropology)  syllabus  The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively \"Other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the \"Primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 539, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures Prof. Saranillio (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus Examines significant historical and contemporary moments through an analysis of culture and power and how cultural productions--film, television dramas, novels, visual art, national monuments and memorials, among others--produce ideas, stories and silences in different historical moments about different Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders that have contemporary resonance today. For instance, how is it that the bikini, which most people associate with suggestive beach wear, has its origins in the U.S. nuclear testing of the first hydrogen bomb on the Bikini Atoll that irradiated much of the Pacific? How do historical representations of Asian American men make the meteoric rise of basketball star Jeremy Lin so unexpected and anomalous? How do histories of U.S. wars in Asia coupled with anti-Asian immigrant legislation shape ideas about Asian Americans as \u201cperpetual foreigners\u201d even centuries after Asian migration to the United States? Using different methods of cultural inquiry such as visual and popular culture, sports and media studies, literary critique, political economy and legal studies, we examine the complex ways that ideas about race, gender, sexuality, and indigeneity produce unequal power relations in U.S. society. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 540, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Mongol Asia and Its Legacy Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus The Mongol Empire was one of the greatest empires in world history, covering virtually all of Eurasia from the Pacific Ocean to the outskirts of Central Europe. Its impact went far beyond its physical boundaries and lasted well after it disappeared. We examine the history of that nomadic empire from a world history perspective emphasizing the way in which it shaped major cultures and civilizations all over Asia, Europe, and north Africa. Themes include nomadic life and culture, the structure of a nomadic empire, how that nomadic empire interacted with the various settled states it conquered, and ramifications of the Mongol conquest on economy and trade, medicine, science and technology, food and art, culture and religion, as well as social and intellectual developments across Eurasia, during the time period from approximately 1200 to 1450 C.E. Our primary sources will be narratives of Mongols generals, stories of peoples they conquered, and travelogues of people who travelled in Mongol territories, and we also look at visual depictions of the Mongols in art and cinema, pay special attention to the environment and how it shaped the life of the Mongols, dedicate time to the image of Genghis Khan, the role played by women, both from the commoner society and from the elite, and interactions with Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, and Islam. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 544, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology)  syllabus  Spanish modernity, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic: Spain has not been a major world power in over 200 years, during which its competitors and successor empires (France, Britain, and the U.S.) branded it, via a conglomeration of ideas called the \u201cBlack Legend,\u201d as a backwards and feudal bastion of superstition and intolerance, good only for anthropologists and tourists. A hotbed of state-building in antiquity, Spain emerged as a center of Renaissance learning under Arab and Berber rule. While the rest of Europe languished in feudalism, its seven centuries co-existence of Christians, Muslims, and Jews saw the rebirth of classical knowledge, the spread of literacy, the development of a human-centered cosmology, the emergence of narrative self-making and the novel, and Europe\u2019s first primarily urban society, where philosophy, the sciences, architecture, and the arts flourished. After Christian princes defeated the last Islamic foothold in the Peninsula in 1492, Castilian language and culture was the backbone of Spain\u2019s imperial expansion across the Atlantic and produced the first modern, disciplining state, the privileging of individualism, private property, and capitalism, and theses of popular sovereignty, the nation state, and theories of racial inequality. Outpaced in industrialization by the late 18th-century, still Spain (and the new nations of Spanish America) kept pace with liberal reforms that culminated in the clash of competing fascist-capitalist and democratic-socialist ideologies, leading to the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the Cold War, and the re-birth of Spanish democracy in the post-Franco and European Union era, and Spain\u2019s current avant-garde role in culture and the arts. Materials include history, ethnography, literature, and film. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 552, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Empires and the Political Imagination Prof. Burbank (History) and Prof. Cooper (History)  syllabus  Comparative study of empires, from the Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture. Empires--polities that maintained social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people--have been one of the most common and durable forms of political organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must take account of how people lived in empires--sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. The study of empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is natural and necessary. We investigate how empires were held together--and where they were weak--from perspectives that focus on political and economic connections over long distances and long time periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 555, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Brazil Prof. Weinstein (History)  syllabus Brazil's transformation from a colonial, agrarian, slave society to a predominantly urban, industrialized nation, and an aspiring world power. Considers how Brazil became both a major industrial power and a society with all the classic social ills of a \u201cGlobal South\u201d nation. We also explore the relationship between mainstream notions of modernity and development, and the many different social and cultural initiatives that have produced Brazil\u2019s hybrid popular culture and multiple national identities. Topics include slavery, racism, and emancipation, urban life, immigration and industrialization, changing gender roles, carnaval and popular culture, and democratization.  Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Rowson (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies)  syllabus  The Islamic world from about the year 600 to about 1300. Despite very large variations in culture across time and space, it is meaningful to speak of a single Islamic civilization during this period, and we ask why. Although the dominance of the religion of Islam, in one way or another, serves to define and unify the societies under examination, and religion will be a major topic of study, attention is also paid to philosophy and science, literature and music, and art and architecture. Reading are English translations of Arabic works written by the inhabitants of this world themselves. A chief objective is to help students appreciate just how different a culture different from their own--and especially one in the distant past--can be, and yet make perfect sense to its participants. By reading, analyzing, and discussing what those participants have to say about a myriad of topics, students gain insights into how cultures in general, including their own, work; and although the modern world is not included, study of the Islamic past will also enhance students\u2019 understanding of Islam and Islamic cultures today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 505, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 507, Cultures and Contexts: Japan Prof. Kaffen (East Asian Studies)  syllabus Japan from 1945 to the present, through cinema, animation, photography, manga, television, kami shibai, pop songs, and other creative forms of expression and documentation, with emphasis on various points of view both within Japan (women, youth, burakumin, Okinawan), and externally (the US-Japan relationship, Japan\u2019s relationship with its East- Asian neighbors). We consider the ways Japan is framed and imagined, as well as the tensions, contradictions, and variety of perspectives at work in those imaginations; the processes of mediation through which history and place are constructed; and issues such as war responsibility, high economic growth, political radicalism, technology and consumption, and \u201clost decades,\u201d and what they might mean for a consideration of Japan\u2019s place in the world at present. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 509, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology)  syllabus  Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Jassen (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 516, Cultures &amp; Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology)  syllabus  Utilizing a variety of sources\u2014novels, films, and academic scholarship\u2014students are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and contemporarily. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 537, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 541, Cultures &amp; Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Tortorici (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus  What was America before it was called \u201cAmerica\u201d? How did indigenous peoples understand and document their first encounters with Europeans and Africans? We focus on how the convergence of indigenous, African, European, and Asian peoples in the Americas created complex cultures, societies, ethnicities, and forms of religiosity. Beginning with the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the \u201cIndies\u201d by Christopher Columbus in 1492, we work our way thematically and chronologically through the centuries of conquest and colonial rule, up until the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. We also examine the historical context before 1492 in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East (with an emphasis on how particular Old World encounters affected New World encounters). SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 545, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus  Ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period, 1550-1069 BCE. During this period of imperial conquest, the ancient Egyptian civilization, already more than sixteen centuries old, increasingly interacted with the peoples and civilizations beyond its borders. We examine the remains of this newly cosmopolitan pharaonic culture, including a variety of primary sources\u2014texts (literature, popular stories, religious writings, letters, and administrative documents), as well as material culture (works of art, architecture, archaeological remains). Students learn how scholars analyze this material to reconstruct New Kingdom cultural life and use these methods themselves to gain insight into the Egyptians' religious beliefs, social forms and organizations, and conventions and achievements of their literature, art, and architecture, as well as to critically evaluate the interpretations and reconstructions in the secondary scholarship. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 549, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Ortolano (History)  syllabus Introduces students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the British Isles. Today home to a pair of European states, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this grouping of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe has historically been home to an astonishing variety of peoples, kingdoms, religions, nations, and states. Rather than collapsing this diversity into a study of the English people or the British state, we think about the United Kingdom as a multinational formation, produced through the experience of repeated invasions, encounters, and migrations. Our ultimate goals are twofold: to learn about the peoples of the British Isles, and to use this knowledge to think critically about claims regarding national characteristics, ethnic stability, or cultural homogeneity--in Britain, and beyond. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 553, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Pagan Europe, 60\u20131600 C.E. Prof. Bedos-Rezak (History)  syllabus  In pre-modern Europe, where a Christian outlook prevailed, the existence of pre-Christian cultures drove a master narrative that all but cast them off as the heterodox mythology and magic of primitive religions. We examine both the medieval evidence for the nature of European pagan cultures and the tendency of modern scholarship to endorse the medieval self-proclaimed image of a monolithic Christian occident. The medieval discourse on paganism cannot be reduced to its condemnation and rejection; this would ignore the ways that the predominant culture had in fact integrated elements of paganism into its theology, philosophy, rituals, calendar, life-cycle events, scientific knowledge, intellectual categories, literary creations, artistic repertoire, and physical environment. As we consider a millennium of European civilization (60 c.e.-1600 c.e.) from the perspective of paganism, we cross-pollinate multiple streams of evidence (textual, archeological, artifactual) with various epistemologies (history, anthropology, folklore, literary criticism), which will allow a new chronology and a new geography to emerge. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 554, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Merjian (Italian)  syllabus  The culture of modern Italy\u2014a nation younger than the United States, yet steeped in all manner of millennial traditions, linguistic dialects, and regional artistic and economic customs. \u201cWe have made Italy; we must now make Italians.\u201d Thus declared the politician and writer Massimo d\u2019Azeglio following the country\u2019s belated unification in 1861. How has Italy attempted to \u201cmake Italians\u201d over the last century? What forms of culture could unify a people so diverse in origins and aspirations? Has the country managed to transform itself from a \u201cgeographic idea\u201d to a cultural reality? Aside from commonplaces\u2014rolling hills, historical landmarks, beloved cuisine, fashion runways\u2014what are the bel paese\u2019s most salient cultural characteristics, and why do they matter? We examine cultural manifestations in various visual, verbal, and material forms: manifestos, cinema, literature, popular music, poetry, architecture, painting, television, exhibitions, and journalism.

We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 539, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures Prof. Saranillio (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus Examines significant historical and contemporary moments through an analysis of culture and power and how cultural productions--film, television dramas, novels, visual art, national monuments and memorials, among others--produce ideas, stories and silences in different historical moments about different Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders that have contemporary resonance today. For instance, how is it that the bikini, which most people associate with suggestive beach wear, has its origins in the U.S. nuclear testing of the first hydrogen bomb on the Bikini Atoll that irradiated much of the Pacific? How do historical representations of Asian American men make the meteoric rise of basketball star Jeremy Lin so unexpected and anomalous? How do histories of U.S. wars in Asia coupled with anti-Asian immigrant legislation shape ideas about Asian Americans as \u201cperpetual foreigners\u201d even centuries after Asian migration to the United States? Using different methods of cultural inquiry such as visual and popular culture, sports and media studies, literary critique, political economy and legal studies, we examine the complex ways that ideas about race, gender, sexuality, and indigeneity produce unequal power relations in U.S. society. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 540, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Mongol Asia and Its Legacy Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus The Mongol Empire was one of the greatest empires in world history, covering virtually all of Eurasia from the Pacific Ocean to the outskirts of Central Europe. Its impact went far beyond its physical boundaries and lasted well after it disappeared. We examine the history of that nomadic empire from a world history perspective emphasizing the way in which it shaped major cultures and civilizations all over Asia, Europe, and north Africa. Themes include nomadic life and culture, the structure of a nomadic empire, how that nomadic empire interacted with the various settled states it conquered, and ramifications of the Mongol conquest on economy and trade, medicine, science and technology, food and art, culture and religion, as well as social and intellectual developments across Eurasia, during the time period from approximately 1200 to 1450 C.E. Our primary sources will be narratives of Mongols generals, stories of peoples they conquered, and travelogues of people who travelled in Mongol territories, and we also look at visual depictions of the Mongols in art and cinema, pay special attention to the environment and how it shaped the life of the Mongols, dedicate time to the image of Genghis Khan, the role played by women, both from the commoner society and from the elite, and interactions with Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, and Islam. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 544, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology)  syllabus  Spanish modernity, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic: Spain has not been a major world power in over 200 years, during which its competitors and successor empires (France, Britain, and the U.S.) branded it, via a conglomeration of ideas called the \u201cBlack Legend,\u201d as a backwards and feudal bastion of superstition and intolerance, good only for anthropologists and tourists. A hotbed of state-building in antiquity, Spain emerged as a center of Renaissance learning under Arab and Berber rule. While the rest of Europe languished in feudalism, its seven centuries co-existence of Christians, Muslims, and Jews saw the rebirth of classical knowledge, the spread of literacy, the development of a human-centered cosmology, the emergence of narrative self-making and the novel, and Europe\u2019s first primarily urban society, where philosophy, the sciences, architecture, and the arts flourished. After Christian princes defeated the last Islamic foothold in the Peninsula in 1492, Castilian language and culture was the backbone of Spain\u2019s imperial expansion across the Atlantic and produced the first modern, disciplining state, the privileging of individualism, private property, and capitalism, and theses of popular sovereignty, the nation state, and theories of racial inequality. Outpaced in industrialization by the late 18th-century, still Spain (and the new nations of Spanish America) kept pace with liberal reforms that culminated in the clash of competing fascist-capitalist and democratic-socialist ideologies, leading to the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the Cold War, and the re-birth of Spanish democracy in the post-Franco and European Union era, and Spain\u2019s current avant-garde role in culture and the arts. Materials include history, ethnography, literature, and film. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 552, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Empires and the Political Imagination Prof. Burbank (History) and Prof. Cooper (History)  syllabus  Comparative study of empires, from the Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture. Empires--polities that maintained social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people--have been one of the most common and durable forms of political organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must take account of how people lived in empires--sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. The study of empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is natural and necessary. We investigate how empires were held together--and where they were weak--from perspectives that focus on political and economic connections over long distances and long time periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 555, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Brazil Prof. Weinstein (History)  syllabus Brazil's transformation from a colonial, agrarian, slave society to a predominantly urban, industrialized nation, and an aspiring world power. Considers how Brazil became both a major industrial power and a society with all the classic social ills of a \u201cGlobal South\u201d nation. We also explore the relationship between mainstream notions of modernity and development, and the many different social and cultural initiatives that have produced Brazil\u2019s hybrid popular culture and multiple national identities. Topics include slavery, racism, and emancipation, urban life, immigration and industrialization, changing gender roles, carnaval and popular culture, and democratization.  Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Rowson (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies)  syllabus  The Islamic world from about the year 600 to about 1300. Despite very large variations in culture across time and space, it is meaningful to speak of a single Islamic civilization during this period, and we ask why. Although the dominance of the religion of Islam, in one way or another, serves to define and unify the societies under examination, and religion will be a major topic of study, attention is also paid to philosophy and science, literature and music, and art and architecture. Reading are English translations of Arabic works written by the inhabitants of this world themselves. A chief objective is to help students appreciate just how different a culture different from their own--and especially one in the distant past--can be, and yet make perfect sense to its participants. By reading, analyzing, and discussing what those participants have to say about a myriad of topics, students gain insights into how cultures in general, including their own, work; and although the modern world is not included, study of the Islamic past will also enhance students\u2019 understanding of Islam and Islamic cultures today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 505, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 507, Cultures and Contexts: Japan Prof. Kaffen (East Asian Studies)  syllabus Japan from 1945 to the present, through cinema, animation, photography, manga, television, kami shibai, pop songs, and other creative forms of expression and documentation, with emphasis on various points of view both within Japan (women, youth, burakumin, Okinawan), and externally (the US-Japan relationship, Japan\u2019s relationship with its East- Asian neighbors). We consider the ways Japan is framed and imagined, as well as the tensions, contradictions, and variety of perspectives at work in those imaginations; the processes of mediation through which history and place are constructed; and issues such as war responsibility, high economic growth, political radicalism, technology and consumption, and \u201clost decades,\u201d and what they might mean for a consideration of Japan\u2019s place in the world at present. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 509, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology)  syllabus  Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Jassen (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 516, Cultures &amp; Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology)  syllabus  Utilizing a variety of sources\u2014novels, films, and academic scholarship\u2014students are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and contemporarily. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 537, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 541, Cultures &amp; Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Tortorici (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus  What was America before it was called \u201cAmerica\u201d? How did indigenous peoples understand and document their first encounters with Europeans and Africans? We focus on how the convergence of indigenous, African, European, and Asian peoples in the Americas created complex cultures, societies, ethnicities, and forms of religiosity. Beginning with the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the \u201cIndies\u201d by Christopher Columbus in 1492, we work our way thematically and chronologically through the centuries of conquest and colonial rule, up until the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. We also examine the historical context before 1492 in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East (with an emphasis on how particular Old World encounters affected New World encounters). SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 545, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus  Ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period, 1550-1069 BCE. During this period of imperial conquest, the ancient Egyptian civilization, already more than sixteen centuries old, increasingly interacted with the peoples and civilizations beyond its borders. We examine the remains of this newly cosmopolitan pharaonic culture, including a variety of primary sources\u2014texts (literature, popular stories, religious writings, letters, and administrative documents), as well as material culture (works of art, architecture, archaeological remains). Students learn how scholars analyze this material to reconstruct New Kingdom cultural life and use these methods themselves to gain insight into the Egyptians' religious beliefs, social forms and organizations, and conventions and achievements of their literature, art, and architecture, as well as to critically evaluate the interpretations and reconstructions in the secondary scholarship. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 549, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Ortolano (History)  syllabus Introduces students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the British Isles. Today home to a pair of European states, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this grouping of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe has historically been home to an astonishing variety of peoples, kingdoms, religions, nations, and states. Rather than collapsing this diversity into a study of the English people or the British state, we think about the United Kingdom as a multinational formation, produced through the experience of repeated invasions, encounters, and migrations. Our ultimate goals are twofold: to learn about the peoples of the British Isles, and to use this knowledge to think critically about claims regarding national characteristics, ethnic stability, or cultural homogeneity--in Britain, and beyond. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 553, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Pagan Europe, 60\u20131600 C.E. Prof. Bedos-Rezak (History)  syllabus  In pre-modern Europe, where a Christian outlook prevailed, the existence of pre-Christian cultures drove a master narrative that all but cast them off as the heterodox mythology and magic of primitive religions. We examine both the medieval evidence for the nature of European pagan cultures and the tendency of modern scholarship to endorse the medieval self-proclaimed image of a monolithic Christian occident. The medieval discourse on paganism cannot be reduced to its condemnation and rejection; this would ignore the ways that the predominant culture had in fact integrated elements of paganism into its theology, philosophy, rituals, calendar, life-cycle events, scientific knowledge, intellectual categories, literary creations, artistic repertoire, and physical environment. As we consider a millennium of European civilization (60 c.e.-1600 c.e.) from the perspective of paganism, we cross-pollinate multiple streams of evidence (textual, archeological, artifactual) with various epistemologies (history, anthropology, folklore, literary criticism), which will allow a new chronology and a new geography to emerge. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 554, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Merjian (Italian)  syllabus  The culture of modern Italy\u2014a nation younger than the United States, yet steeped in all manner of millennial traditions, linguistic dialects, and regional artistic and economic customs. \u201cWe have made Italy; we must now make Italians.\u201d Thus declared the politician and writer Massimo d\u2019Azeglio following the country\u2019s belated unification in 1861. How has Italy attempted to \u201cmake Italians\u201d over the last century? What forms of culture could unify a people so diverse in origins and aspirations? Has the country managed to transform itself from a \u201cgeographic idea\u201d to a cultural reality? Aside from commonplaces\u2014rolling hills, historical landmarks, beloved cuisine, fashion runways\u2014what are the bel paese\u2019s most salient cultural characteristics, and why do they matter? We examine cultural manifestations in various visual, verbal, and material forms: manifestos, cinema, literature, popular music, poetry, architecture, painting, television, exhibitions, and journalism.

{"detail": [{"content": "Cultures & Contexts    | The College Core Curriculum, College of Arts and Science | New York Univeristy                          NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE             The College Core Curriculum            Back to Home       Cultures & Contexts | 2014-2015 Note: * indicates draft/sample syllabus Fall 2014 FALL 2014 CORE-UA 500, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Topics\u2014The Silk Road and Central Asia Prof. Stark (Institute for the Study of the Ancient World)  syllabus For centuries Central Asia has been a conduit for a variety of cultural encounters and transfers between China, India, the Near East and the Mediterranean. In an almost emblematic way, this position and function seems to be embodied in our image of the far-distant caravan trader, traversing on the so-called \u201cSilk roads\u201d the vast expanses between China and the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. However, it was not only traders that connected the civilizations of the ancient world via Central Asia: with and next to the traders\u2019 caravans traveled diplomats, missionaries, artists and many more; and vast parts of Eurasia were, again and again, connected and controlled by confederations and empires of nomadic origin. We inquire into the many facets, which characterize the resulting network, oscillating around Central Asia, from the Bronze Age onwards up to the days of the Mongol Empire, taking a multi-disciplinary approach to a considerable variety of primary evidence, ranging from ancient travel reports and business letters to spectacular archaeological artifacts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus Major social, cultural, and political transformation of the Middle East from late antiquity through the mid-thirteenth century, considered in the context of the formation and evolution of Islamic culture and polity. Examines the emergence of key concepts, practices, and cultural motifs of the medieval Islamic tradition. Also examines the emergence of the idea/concept of the \"Middle East\", the history and background of European interest in the region, as well as the crucial role of cultural encounter and dialogue (e.g., through trade, colonization, polemics) in the formation and development of identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 503, Cultures &amp; Contexts: South Asia Prof. Rajagopal (Media, Culture, &amp; Communication)  syllabus The South Asian subcontinent is in many ways at the heart of contemporary globalization. Few regions contain a higher density of population experiencing faster rates of social change. South Asia is the site of massive social transformations, ranging from new modes of consumption and aspiration, to accelerated urbanization, rising social inequality, and violent inter- and intra-state conflict. A little analyzed, yet central catalyst for these transformations is represented by media industries, which have grown at a rate greater than that of the economy as a whole for several years now. The current centrality of media to social life as neither entirely new, nor unprecedented, and provides entry points--from print and visual culture, to cinema, television, internet (including social media such as Youtube), and cellphones--for understanding both media history and South Asia, the relationship between culture and technology, the South Asian diaspora, mediated religion, and a range of inter-related topics. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 510, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Russia Prof. Kotsonis (History)  syllabus Focuses on distinctive historical and geographical dichotomies and issues in Russian culture. Emphasis is on primary documents, including literary works, travel notes, works of art, and political statements from all periods, chosen to establish the particular matrix of competing positions that make up the Russian national and cultural identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 512, Cultures &amp; Contexts: China Prof. Zhang (East Asian Studies)  syllabus  An introduction to the main issues and foundational texts of imperial and modern China. Selected readings include excerpts from early Chinese classics such as Classic of Odes and the Analects to the vernacular novels of late imperial China. The classical canon is then coupled with central texts from modern China, from the initial reflections of the mandarin scholars on a rapidly changing world, to writings on revolution, the modern state, and the new culture of the enlightened individual by leading Chinese intellectuals in the 20th century. Rather than a display of cultural and literary edifices, our intellectual and critical interest is to rethink Chinese traditions, both imperial and modern, in terms of continuity as well as discontinuity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Fleming (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 515, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 529, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Beltr\u00e1n (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus  Explores the political, social, and cultural practices of Latinos in the   United States using a historical and interdisciplinary approach. Draws   on literature, history, politics, as well as social and political   theory to address issues of participation, under-representation, and   civic and economic empowerment. Topics include immigration, social   movements, figures of resistance, identities, popular culture, and   language. Of particular concern is the idea and representation of a   pan-ethnic \u201cLatino\u201d identity encompassing all the diverse national   groups, and the emergence of this concept in both the cultural and   political life of these communities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 532, Cultures &amp; Contexts: African Diaspora Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  The dispersal of Africans to various parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their relationship to both African and to non-African influences. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 536, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Indigenous Australia Prof. Myers (Anthropology)  syllabus  The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively \"Other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the \"Primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 539, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures Prof. Saranillio (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus Examines significant historical and contemporary moments through an analysis of culture and power and how cultural productions--film, television dramas, novels, visual art, national monuments and memorials, among others--produce ideas, stories and silences in different historical moments about different Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders that have contemporary resonance today. For instance, how is it that the bikini, which most people associate with suggestive beach wear, has its origins in the U.S. nuclear testing of the first hydrogen bomb on the Bikini Atoll that irradiated much of the Pacific? How do historical representations of Asian American men make the meteoric rise of basketball star Jeremy Lin so unexpected and anomalous? How do histories of U.S. wars in Asia coupled with anti-Asian immigrant legislation shape ideas about Asian Americans as \u201cperpetual foreigners\u201d even centuries after Asian migration to the United States? Using different methods of cultural inquiry such as visual and popular culture, sports and media studies, literary critique, political economy and legal studies, we examine the complex ways that ideas about race, gender, sexuality, and indigeneity produce unequal power relations in U.S. society. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 540, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Mongol Asia and Its Legacy Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus The Mongol Empire was one of the greatest empires in world history, covering virtually all of Eurasia from the Pacific Ocean to the outskirts of Central Europe. Its impact went far beyond its physical boundaries and lasted well after it disappeared. We examine the history of that nomadic empire from a world history perspective emphasizing the way in which it shaped major cultures and civilizations all over Asia, Europe, and north Africa. Themes include nomadic life and culture, the structure of a nomadic empire, how that nomadic empire interacted with the various settled states it conquered, and ramifications of the Mongol conquest on economy and trade, medicine, science and technology, food and art, culture and religion, as well as social and intellectual developments across Eurasia, during the time period from approximately 1200 to 1450 C.E. Our primary sources will be narratives of Mongols generals, stories of peoples they conquered, and travelogues of people who travelled in Mongol territories, and we also look at visual depictions of the Mongols in art and cinema, pay special attention to the environment and how it shaped the life of the Mongols, dedicate time to the image of Genghis Khan, the role played by women, both from the commoner society and from the elite, and interactions with Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, and Islam. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 544, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology)  syllabus  Spanish modernity, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic: Spain has not been a major world power in over 200 years, during which its competitors and successor empires (France, Britain, and the U.S.) branded it, via a conglomeration of ideas called the \u201cBlack Legend,\u201d as a backwards and feudal bastion of superstition and intolerance, good only for anthropologists and tourists. A hotbed of state-building in antiquity, Spain emerged as a center of Renaissance learning under Arab and Berber rule. While the rest of Europe languished in feudalism, its seven centuries co-existence of Christians, Muslims, and Jews saw the rebirth of classical knowledge, the spread of literacy, the development of a human-centered cosmology, the emergence of narrative self-making and the novel, and Europe\u2019s first primarily urban society, where philosophy, the sciences, architecture, and the arts flourished. After Christian princes defeated the last Islamic foothold in the Peninsula in 1492, Castilian language and culture was the backbone of Spain\u2019s imperial expansion across the Atlantic and produced the first modern, disciplining state, the privileging of individualism, private property, and capitalism, and theses of popular sovereignty, the nation state, and theories of racial inequality. Outpaced in industrialization by the late 18th-century, still Spain (and the new nations of Spanish America) kept pace with liberal reforms that culminated in the clash of competing fascist-capitalist and democratic-socialist ideologies, leading to the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the Cold War, and the re-birth of Spanish democracy in the post-Franco and European Union era, and Spain\u2019s current avant-garde role in culture and the arts. Materials include history, ethnography, literature, and film. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 552, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Empires and the Political Imagination Prof. Burbank (History) and Prof. Cooper (History)  syllabus  Comparative study of empires, from the Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture. Empires--polities that maintained social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people--have been one of the most common and durable forms of political organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must take account of how people lived in empires--sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. The study of empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is natural and necessary. We investigate how empires were held together--and where they were weak--from perspectives that focus on political and economic connections over long distances and long time periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 555, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Brazil Prof. Weinstein (History)  syllabus Brazil's transformation from a colonial, agrarian, slave society to a predominantly urban, industrialized nation, and an aspiring world power. Considers how Brazil became both a major industrial power and a society with all the classic social ills of a \u201cGlobal South\u201d nation. We also explore the relationship between mainstream notions of modernity and development, and the many different social and cultural initiatives that have produced Brazil\u2019s hybrid popular culture and multiple national identities. Topics include slavery, racism, and emancipation, urban life, immigration and industrialization, changing gender roles, carnaval and popular culture, and democratization.  Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Rowson (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies)  syllabus  The Islamic world from about the year 600 to about 1300. Despite very large variations in culture across time and space, it is meaningful to speak of a single Islamic civilization during this period, and we ask why. Although the dominance of the religion of Islam, in one way or another, serves to define and unify the societies under examination, and religion will be a major topic of study, attention is also paid to philosophy and science, literature and music, and art and architecture. Reading are English translations of Arabic works written by the inhabitants of this world themselves. A chief objective is to help students appreciate just how different a culture different from their own--and especially one in the distant past--can be, and yet make perfect sense to its participants. By reading, analyzing, and discussing what those participants have to say about a myriad of topics, students gain insights into how cultures in general, including their own, work; and although the modern world is not included, study of the Islamic past will also enhance students\u2019 understanding of Islam and Islamic cultures today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 505, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 507, Cultures and Contexts: Japan Prof. Kaffen (East Asian Studies)  syllabus Japan from 1945 to the present, through cinema, animation, photography, manga, television, kami shibai, pop songs, and other creative forms of expression and documentation, with emphasis on various points of view both within Japan (women, youth, burakumin, Okinawan), and externally (the US-Japan relationship, Japan\u2019s relationship with its East- Asian neighbors). We consider the ways Japan is framed and imagined, as well as the tensions, contradictions, and variety of perspectives at work in those imaginations; the processes of mediation through which history and place are constructed; and issues such as war responsibility, high economic growth, political radicalism, technology and consumption, and \u201clost decades,\u201d and what they might mean for a consideration of Japan\u2019s place in the world at present. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 509, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology)  syllabus  Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Jassen (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 516, Cultures &amp; Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology)  syllabus  Utilizing a variety of sources\u2014novels, films, and academic scholarship\u2014students are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and contemporarily. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 537, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 541, Cultures &amp; Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Tortorici (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus  What was America before it was called \u201cAmerica\u201d? How did indigenous peoples understand and document their first encounters with Europeans and Africans? We focus on how the convergence of indigenous, African, European, and Asian peoples in the Americas created complex cultures, societies, ethnicities, and forms of religiosity. Beginning with the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the \u201cIndies\u201d by Christopher Columbus in 1492, we work our way thematically and chronologically through the centuries of conquest and colonial rule, up until the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. We also examine the historical context before 1492 in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East (with an emphasis on how particular Old World encounters affected New World encounters). SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 545, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus  Ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period, 1550-1069 BCE. During this period of imperial conquest, the ancient Egyptian civilization, already more than sixteen centuries old, increasingly interacted with the peoples and civilizations beyond its borders. We examine the remains of this newly cosmopolitan pharaonic culture, including a variety of primary sources\u2014texts (literature, popular stories, religious writings, letters, and administrative documents), as well as material culture (works of art, architecture, archaeological remains). Students learn how scholars analyze this material to reconstruct New Kingdom cultural life and use these methods themselves to gain insight into the Egyptians' religious beliefs, social forms and organizations, and conventions and achievements of their literature, art, and architecture, as well as to critically evaluate the interpretations and reconstructions in the secondary scholarship. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 549, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Ortolano (History)  syllabus Introduces students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the British Isles. Today home to a pair of European states, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this grouping of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe has historically been home to an astonishing variety of peoples, kingdoms, religions, nations, and states. Rather than collapsing this diversity into a study of the English people or the British state, we think about the United Kingdom as a multinational formation, produced through the experience of repeated invasions, encounters, and migrations. Our ultimate goals are twofold: to learn about the peoples of the British Isles, and to use this knowledge to think critically about claims regarding national characteristics, ethnic stability, or cultural homogeneity--in Britain, and beyond. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 553, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Pagan Europe, 60\u20131600 C.E. Prof. Bedos-Rezak (History)  syllabus  In pre-modern Europe, where a Christian outlook prevailed, the existence of pre-Christian cultures drove a master narrative that all but cast them off as the heterodox mythology and magic of primitive religions. We examine both the medieval evidence for the nature of European pagan cultures and the tendency of modern scholarship to endorse the medieval self-proclaimed image of a monolithic Christian occident. The medieval discourse on paganism cannot be reduced to its condemnation and rejection; this would ignore the ways that the predominant culture had in fact integrated elements of paganism into its theology, philosophy, rituals, calendar, life-cycle events, scientific knowledge, intellectual categories, literary creations, artistic repertoire, and physical environment. As we consider a millennium of European civilization (60 c.e.-1600 c.e.) from the perspective of paganism, we cross-pollinate multiple streams of evidence (textual, archeological, artifactual) with various epistemologies (history, anthropology, folklore, literary criticism), which will allow a new chronology and a new geography to emerge. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 554, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Merjian (Italian)  syllabus  The culture of modern Italy\u2014a nation younger than the United States, yet steeped in all manner of millennial traditions, linguistic dialects, and regional artistic and economic customs. \u201cWe have made Italy; we must now make Italians.\u201d Thus declared the politician and writer Massimo d\u2019Azeglio following the country\u2019s belated unification in 1861. How has Italy attempted to \u201cmake Italians\u201d over the last century? What forms of culture could unify a people so diverse in origins and aspirations? Has the country managed to transform itself from a \u201cgeographic idea\u201d to a cultural reality? Aside from commonplaces\u2014rolling hills, historical landmarks, beloved cuisine, fashion runways\u2014what are the bel paese\u2019s most salient cultural characteristics, and why do they matter? We examine cultural manifestations in various visual, verbal, and material forms: manifestos, cinema, literature, popular music, poetry, architecture, painting, television, exhibitions, and journalism.

Fulfillment of the College's expository writing requirement is a prerequisite to all dramatic literature courses.    Survey Courses in Dramatic Literature    Introduction to Drama and Theatre DRLIT-UA 101 Offered periodically. 4 points. A general introduction to the study of dramatic literature as well as to the very notion of theatre and its place in our cultural life, both past and present. Topics include the emergence of new dramatic genres and forms, the relation between \u201chigh culture\u201d and popular performance, the changing nature and activity of play-going, theories of character and action, the aesthetics of theatre production, the politics of representation, the idea of human and inhuman in performance, the globalization of theatre, and the urbanization of the performing arts, especially in New York. Eight to ten representative plays are read and discussed alongside various writing about the theatre. History of Drama and Theatre I, II DRLIT-UA 110, 111 Identical to ENGL-UA 125, 126. Either term may be taken alone for credit. 4 points per term.   Examines selected plays central to the development of world drama, with critical emphasis on a cultural, historical, and theatrical analysis of these works. The first semester covers the major periods of Greek and Roman drama; Japanese classical theatre; medieval drama; theatre of the English, Italian, and Spanish Renaissance; and French neoclassical drama. The second semester begins with English Restoration and 18th-century comedy and continues through romanticism, naturalism, and realism to an examination of antirealism and the major dramatic currents of the 20th century, including postcolonial theatre in Asia, Africa, and Australia.    Advanced Electives in Dramatic Literature    Acting Medieval Literature   DRLIT-UA 35 Identical to MEDI-UA 868. 4 points.   Presents medieval literature as a set of springboards to performance rather than as a series of \"books\" to be read. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach this \"literature\" as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests, and stage medieval works. For their final project, students participate in staging and putting on a play, perform a substantial piece of narrative poetry, sing or play a body of medieval songs, or a similar endeavor.    Naturalism   DRLIT-UA 113 Identical to THEA-UA 705. 4 points.   A study of the origins and development of the most influential dramatic movements of the 20th century. Specific topics vary by term and instructor.    Modern Drama: Expressionism and Beyond   DRLIT-UA 114 Identical to THEA-UA 602. 4 points.   A study of the various formal movements that developed in reaction to realism. After examining several 19th-century antecedents, including Buchner, we study the most important experimental styles of each successive era: symbolism, expressionism, surrealism, epic theatre, the theatre of the absurd, and postmodernism. Authors covered include Maeterlinck, Kaiser, Pirandello, Lorca, Beckett, Genet, Bond, Handke, Muller, and Benmussa. The philosophical context is explored through reading Freud, Marx, Sartre, and Derrida; theoretical readings include essays by Artaud and Brecht. While the class focus is on the many styles that evolved in the 20th-century search for a more expressive form, some attention is given to how this search still very much influences theatre artists today.    Theory of Drama   DRLIT-UA 130 Identical to ENGL-UA 130. 4 points.   Explores the relationship between two kinds of theories: theories of meaning and theories of practice. Among the theories of meaning to be studied are semiotics, deconstruction, feminism, psychoanalysis, new historicism, and postmodernism. Theories of practice include naturalism, dadaism, futurism, epic theatre, theatre of cruelty, poor theatre, and environmental theatre. Theories are examined through theoretical essays and representative plays.    Gay and Lesbian Theatre   DRLIT-UA 137 Identical to THEA-UA 624. 4 points.   A survey of contemporary lesbian and gay plays from The Boys in the Band to Angels in America. The goal is to familiarize students with lesbian and gay plays written since 1968 as a discrete body of work within the field of contemporary theatre. The course focuses on plays and playwrights that have had a significant impact in the representation of homosexual life onstage. In addition, students consider the historical, political, and cultural developments from which gay theatre emerged and, through independent research projects, examine the communities that emerged in the process of creating gay theatre.    Popular Performance   DRLIT-UA 138 Identical to THEA-UA 621. 4 points.   A reevaluation of a wide variety of European and American forms that, beginning in the 16th century, were separated from \"high culture\" theatre. These include fairground performance, commedia dell'arte, mummers' plays, circus, pantomime, minstrel shows, vaudeville, and carnival, puppet, and mask theatre. Exploration of what popular performance does differently than \"high culture\" theatre, how it does so, and to whom it addresses itself. A study of characteristic forms and techniques of popular performance, the connection between Western and non-Western forms, and the central role of popular performance in 20th-century theatre.    Topics in Italian Culture: Futurism in Italy   DRLIT-UA 174 Identical to ITAL-UA 173. 4 points.   Arguably the first avant-garde movement of the 20th century, futurism saw itself as a violent explosion that would drastically redefine not only the artistic landscape but reality as a whole. The futurists produced a theoretical program to overhaul literature, painting, theatre, architecture, music, politics, and even cooking. The approach of the movement's 100th birthday is an opportunity to assess its relevance for our understanding of modernity. This is an interdisciplinary course.    Tragedy   DRLIT-UA 200 Identical to ENGL-UA 720, COLIT-UA 110. 4 points.   Historical and critical study of the idea and practice of tragedy from Greek times to the present.    Greek Drama: Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides   DRLIT-UA 210 Identical to CLASS-UA 143. 4 points.   Of the many gifts of the ancient Greeks to Western culture, one of the most celebrated and influential is the art of drama. This course covers, by way of the best available translations, the masterpieces of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, including the place of the plays in the history of the drama and the continuing influence they have had on serious playwrights, including those of the 20th century.    Comedies of Greece and Rome   DRLIT-UA 211 Identical to CLASS-UA 144. 4 points.   Study of early comedy, its form, content, and social and historical background. Covers the Old Comedy of fifth-century Athens through the Attic New Comedy and Roman comedy. Authors include Aristophanes (11 comedies are studied, and one is staged); Euripides, whose tragedies revolutionized the form of both comedy and tragedy; Menander, whose plays were only recently discovered; and Plautus and Terence, whose works profoundly influenced comedy in Western Europe.    Shakespeare I, II   DRLIT-UA 225, 226 Identical to ENGL-UA 410, 411. Either term may be taken alone for credit. 4 points per term.   Introduction to the reading of Shakespeare. Examines about 10 plays each term, generally in chronological order. First term: the early comedies, tragedies, and histories up to Hamlet. Second term: the later tragedies, the problem plays, and the romances, concluding with The Tempest.    Colloquium: Shakespeare   DRLIT-UA 230 Identical to ENGL-UA 415. Assumes some familiarity with Shakespeare's works. Beginning students should take DRLIT-UA 225, 226. 4 points.   Explores the richness and variety of Shakespearean drama through an emphasis on the mastery of selected major plays. Six to eight plays are read intensively and examined thoroughly in discussion.    Restoration and 18th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 235 4 points.   The Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 brought an end to a 20-year period of civil war and military rule in England. As a postwar culture, Restoration England was a divided society, but also a society ripe for social change and cultural innovation. The London public theatres in this period, reopened after twenty years of prohibition, can be variously characterized as progressive vanguard and conservative rearguard, both an open forum for new ideas and subversive critique of the dominant culture, and a bastion of aristocratic privilege and state hegemony. This course considers the cultural activity of the Restoration public theatres from both outlooks. Embracing the divided nature of the art and culture of this period, the readings are organized into a series of unlikely pairings: urban comedies and classical tragedies, closet dramas and box-office successes, propaganda pieces and broad satires, puritan reform and libertine excess. Playwrights include Dryden, Davenant, Cavendish, Etherege, Wycherley, Rochester, Milton, Centlivre, Shadwell, Otway, and Farquhar.    Feminism and Theatre   DRLIT-UA 240 Identical to THEA-UA 623. 4 points.   A study of plays by female playwrights and feminist theatre from the perspective of contemporary feminist theory. Considerations include strategies for asserting new images of women on stage, the dramatic devices employed by female playwrights, lesbian aesthetics, race, class, and the rejection of realism. Possible plays and performance texts treated include those of Maria Irene Fornes, Caryl Churchill, Sarah Daniels, Wendy Wasserstein, Ntozake Shange, Adrienne Kennedy, Susan Glaspell, Aphra Behn, Alice Childress, Tina Howe, Holly Hughes, Karen Finley, Darrah Cloud, and Suzan-Lori Parks.    Modern British Drama   DRLIT-UA 245 Identical to ENGL-UA 614. 4 points.   Studies in the modern drama of England and Ireland, always focusing on a specific period, a specific group of playwrights, a specific dramatic movement of theatre, or a specific topic. Among playwrights covered at different times are Shaw, Synge, O'Casey, Behan, Osborne, Pinter, Stoppard, Bond, Friel, Storey, Hare, Edgar, Brenton, Gems, Churchill, and Daniels.    Modern American Drama   DRLIT-UA 250 Identical to ENGL-UA 650, SCA-UA 842. 4 points.   Study of the drama and theatre of America since 1900, including Eugene O'Neill, Susan Glaspell, the Group Theatre, Thornton Wilder, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Edward Albee, Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Maria Irene Fornes, and David Henry Hwang.    Theatrical Genres   DRLIT-UA 251 Identical to THEA-UA 632. 4 points.   This course (different each time) explores one or more distinctive theatrical genres, such as tragedy, comedy, melodrama, satire, or farce, or plays of distinctive theatrical types, such as theatre of the absurd, the documentary play, or theatre of witness. Since theatrical genres and theatrical types come into being because playwrights respond to historical necessity by visualizing specific worldviews, the course presents a study of the role and function of the theatre within societies, as a response to historical, psychological, and spiritual forces.    Modern U.S. Drama   DRLIT-UA 253 Identical to ENGL-UA 650, THEA-UA 608. 4 points.   A study of drama and theatre in the United States since 1900, including Eugene O'Neill, Susan Glaspell, Sophie Treadwell, Elmer Rice, Clifford Odets and the Group Theatre, Thorton Wilder, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Edward Albee, Emily Mann, Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Maria Irene Fornes, Adrienne Kennedy, August Wilson, Lorraine Hansberry, David Henry Hwang, David Rabe, Luis Valdez, and Tony Kushner. We explore these writers and their texts as they relate to the page, to the stage, and to U.S. culture at large. We discuss how these writers (and others) represent themselves and notions of \"American-ness\" in their dramatic works. We include important works from the margins, as well as those that represent the mainstream. Does modern U.S. drama lead or follow U.S. culture? Does it tend to be a design for living or a reflection of custom? We also explore the role of gender in culture as demonstrated in these works. Does U.S. drama question the status quo or reinforce it? These and other interrogations inform our readings, discussions, and written assignments.    Major Playwrights   DRLIT-UA 254 Identical to ENGL-UA 652, THEA-UA 618. 4 points.

The study of African American dramatic traditions from early minstrelsy to turn-of-the-century musical extravaganzas; from the Harlem Renaissance folk plays to realistic drama of the 1950s; from the militant protest drama of the 1960s to the historical and experimental works of the present. Issues of race, gender, class; of oppression and empowerment; of marginality and assimilation are explored in the works of such playwrights as Langston Hughes, Alice Childress, Lorraine Hansberry, Amiri Baraka, Adrienne Kennedy, Charles Fuller, George C. Wolfe, Ntozake Shange, August Wilson, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Anna Deavere Smith. The sociohistorical context of each author is also briefly explored. Asian American Theatre   DRLIT-UA 256 Identical to THEA-UA 606. 4 points.   Acts as both an introduction to the genre of Asian American theatre and an interrogation into how this genre has been constituted. Through a combination of play analysis and historical discussion\u2014starting with Frank Chen's The Chickencoop Chinaman, the first Asian American play produced in a mainstream venue\u2014the class looks at the ways Asian American drama and performance intersect with a burgeoning Asian American consciousness. We review the construction of Asian American history through such plays as Genny Lim's Paper Angels and more recent works such as Chay Yew's A Language of Their Own. We also read theoretical and historical texts that provide the basis for a critical examination of the issues surrounding Asian American theatre. Orientalism, media representation, and theories of genealogy inform our discussion.    Political Theatre   DRLIT-UA 258 Identical to THEA-UA 622. 4 points.

Comparative Study: 20th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 261 4 points.   The two decades or so following World War II were a particularly exciting period in the history of drama in Europe and America. This course focuses on five playwrights\u2014Samuel Beckett, Tennessee Williams, Jean Genet, Adrienne Kennedy, and Peter Weiss\u2014whose engagements with postwar history and politics shaped the form and content of their works for the stage. Questions include modes of representing historical experience, theatre and historical forms of spectatorship, and challenges to genre. The presumption is that we cannot know in advance what it means to describe a play as \"political.\" Readings include Beckett's Waiting for Godot, Endgame, and selected shorter plays; Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and Orpheus Descending; Genet's The Balcony, The Blacks, and The Screens; Kennedy's Funnyhouse of a Negro, The Owl Answers, and A Movie Star Has to Star in Black and White; and Weiss's Marat/Sade and The Investigation.    17th-Century Theatre   DRLIT-UA 290 4 points.

Theatre of Latin America   DRLIT-UA 293 Identical to THEA-UA 748. 4 points.   An introduction to the history, theories, and practices of Latin American drama, focusing on the 20th century. We pay special attention to the historical reinvention of European-based theatrical forms in the Americas through their continuous interaction with non-European cultural forms. Through the plays of leading dramatists\u2014including Jorge Diaz, Egon Wolff, and Sergio Vodanovic (Chile); Jose Triana (Cuba); Rene Marquez and Luis Rafael Sanchez (Puerto Rico); Isaac Chocron (Venezuela); Emilio Carballido, Luisa Josefina Hernandez, Sabina Berman, and Elena Garro (Mexico); and Osvaldo Dragun, Eduardo Pavlovsky, Roberto Cossa, and Griselda Gambaro (Argentina)\u2014we explore the significance of modernist and postmodernist dramatic forms in cultures where industrial modernity is an insecure social context. We study the wealth of oppositional theatre in Latin America\u2014exemplified by Augusto Boal's \"theatre of the oppressed\"\u2014in relation to the historical use (or abuse) of theatrical spectacle as a political means to control peoples, from the early Spanish conquerors to recent authoritarian state leaders. We read postcolonial Latin American theories of culture and art, such as hybridity, transculturation, Brazil's modernist and anticolonial antropofagia, and the \"aesthetics of hunger,\" drawing on the work of Fernando Ortiz, Angel Rama, and Nestor Garcia Canclini, among others. We consider \"magical realism\" in the theatre as a social poetics of scarcity.    Theatre in Asia   DRLIT-UA 294 Identical to THEA-UA 744. 4 points.

Types of performance studied include dadaist, surrealist, and futurist plays; multimedia happenings of Karpov, Oldenberg, and Whitman; conceptual self-works and solos of performers such as Vito Acconci, Karen Finley, Spalding Gray, and Diamanda Galas; and the work of avant-gardists such as Richard Foreman, Robert Wilson, Meredith Monk, Ping Chong, Mabou Mines, LeCompte's Wooster Group, and Pina Bausch. Readings are supplemented by slides, videotape, and attendance at suggested performance events.    Drama in Performance   DRLIT-UA 300 Identical to ENGL-UA 132. 4 points.

Contemporary European Theatre   DRLIT-UA 609 4 points.   The European theatre scene of the last two decades has witnessed the emergence of a new wave of dramatists who share a dark, desperate, depressive, yet humorous Weltanschauung and style. They have encountered controversy and shock in reception but could not be ignored, gradually gaining a significant place in recent theatre history. We study and discuss work by Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, David Harrower, Roland Schimmelpfennig, Koffi Kwahule, Yasmina Reza, Juan Mayorga, Biljana Srbljanovi, Gianina Carbunariu, Hristo Boytchev, Matei Visniec, Goran Stefanovski, Vassily Sigarev, and their forerunners Beckett, Ionesco, Orton, Churchill, Koltes, Havel, Mrozek, et al.    Irish Dramatists   DRLIT-UA 700 Identical to THEA-UA 603, IRISH-UA 700. 4 points.

Playwrights covered include John Millington Synge, Sean O'Casey, Samuel Beckett, Brendan Behan, Brian Friel, Tom Murphy, Frank McGuinness, and Anne Devlin. Issues of Irish identity, history, and postcoloniality are engaged alongside an appreciation of the emotional texture, poetic achievements, and theatrical innovations that characterize this body of dramatic work.    Gender and Performance in the Italian Theatre   DRLIT-UA 720 Identical to ITAL-UA 720. 4 points.   Examines plays that explicitly highlight and question the status and performance of gender, as well as selections from political treatises, books of manners, and historiography of the early modern period (1350-1700). Topics such as cross-dressing, the emergence of the actress and commedia dell'arte troupes, the dynamics of spectatorship, the development of perspective in painting and theatre, and court power relations are considered, as well as the \"revisions\" that women playwrights and writers made to a largely male-dominated canon.    20th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 730 4 points.   Transportable Drama: Stock character types, dramatic figures, and archetypal plots are to a certain extent independent and transportable terms that appear and reappear in multiple play texts, versions of those texts, and in diverse media. Beyond that, the experience of what we call \"drama\" is not limited to play texts and their presentation; it is present in fiction, news, film, television, the visual and electronic arts, and advertising. In this course, we explore how the dramatic impulse of several plots, figures, and characters is expressed in play texts and other media across several historical periods. For example, we may choose to look at Zola's novel and play of Therese Raquin, followed by Marcel Carne's 20th-century film adaptation. Or, we might examine one or more of the historical Don Juan plays in combination with the Byron poem, the Mozart opera, and/or a modern film treatment. Similarly, Shakespearean texts have been widely adapted to the present day, not only in theatrical spin-offs and films, but also through renderings by visual artists. A play based upon a news event, such as Treadwell's Machinal, may be examined in light of the original reportage and public records. By looking at clusters of related works in tandem, rather than as freestanding objects of study, we will gain a greater understanding of drama as a transportable art form and of adaptation in both its practical and theoretical aspects.

This course (different every time) introduces students to the specific choices that a director must make to transform the \"printed word\" into a visual auditory experience. For example, point of view becomes a challenge of camera shots; a described room becomes a matter of lighting, color, and sound; and the sense of time becomes a product of editing, rhythm, music, and splicing. Throughout the course, we pit a director's view against an author's view to examine how the same story may express different agendas, depending on the rendering. Works may include Euripides' Medea (Pasolini), Nabokov's Lolita (Kubrick), Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire (Kazan), Paul Schrader's Taxi Driver (Scorsese), Virginia Woolf's Orlando (Potter), and Thomas Hardy's Tess (Polanski).

Requires a commitment of 8 to 12 hours of work per week in an unpaid position to be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. The intern's duties on-site should involve some substantive aspect of work in drama. The student is expected to fulfill the obligation of the internship itself, and a written evaluation is solicited from the outside sponsor at the end. The grade for the course is based on a final project submitted to a faculty director with whom the student has been meeting regularly over the semester to discuss the progress of the internship.    Independent Study   DRLIT-UA 997, 998 Prerequisite: permission of the director of undergraduate studies. May not duplicate the content of a regularly offered course. Intended for qualified upper-class majors or minors in this department, but may not be used to fulfill the minimum requirements of either the major or the minor. 2 or 4 points per term.   Requires a paper of considerable length that should embody the results of a semester's reading, thinking, and frequent conferences with the student's director. The paper should show the student's ability to investigate, collect, and evaluate his or her material, finally drawing conclusions that are discussed in a sound and well-written argument. In the 2-point course, the student is held to the same high standard as is the student who is working for 4 points, but the investigation and the paper are of proportionate length.    Honors Seminar    The subject of the Honors Seminar changes each year and is decided on by the faculty member teaching the seminar. The seminar is a small class (limited to 12) that ideally prepares students for the senior thesis; the primary focus is on research and the application of critical methodologies. Each year, one of the Department of English Junior Honors Seminars is also designated as the drama studies Honors Seminar, with at least a partial focus on drama. Drama studies majors normally take this seminar to complete the seminar requirement. (English majors in honors may also take this designated seminar if they choose to, subject to the 12-student limit.) Dramatic literature majors in honors may also satisfy the seminar requirement by taking, with the instructor's permission, the Honors Seminar in the undergraduate Department of Drama at Tisch School of the Arts.    Admission to the Drama Studies honors program is competitive. The Honors Seminars are limited to 12 students. The minimum GPA for admission to any College of Arts and Science honors program is 3.65 or better (both overall and in the major). In addition, students must have completed the two core courses History of Drama and Theatre I and II (DRLIT-UA 110 and 111) by the end of the semester in which they apply for the honors track.
