Honors in Research Programs     Honors in Research Programs were established to motivate and encourage NYU College of Dentistry students to become involved in oral health related research (basic, biomaterials, clinical, or behavioral) at NYUCD. These Honors in Research programs are flexible to fit the diversity of projects and changing goals of our students as they progress through the dental school curriculum.                                                    NYUCD Summer Research Experience                               The annual Summer Research Experience held at NYU College of Dentistry introduces incoming dental and nursing students to research at an early stage in their careers - inspiring them and helping them see that research can be an exciting and fulfilling career trajectory. Participants in the summer program work with faculty mentors on their research studies full time and attend seminars three times a week during the eight-week program. Seminar topics include health disparities, ethics, lab safety, DNA, animal research, and evidence-based practice. Students learn to prepare poster presentations, teaching tools in research environments. At the end of the eight weeks, there is a poster session in which the students present posters describing the studies on which they worked.   One rationale for the program is the concept that dental students should be able to understand the science behind what they are doing and apply it to their practices. &quot;We want to capture those who are turned on by science,&quot; says Louis Terracio, PhD, Vice Dean for Research and Professor, Department of Basic Science and Craniofacial Biology, NYU College of Dentistry, who adds that starting people early in research changes their thinking fundamentally. &quot;Whether you're a dentist or a stockbroker, you should want to look at data critically and make good decisions based on it.&quot; The program began in the summer of 2001 with a small group of students and funding from the National Institutes of Health with its goal to encourage dental students to consider careers in academia.

D1 Honors in Research                               This course is designed to provide selected first year dental students with the opportunity to participate in a research project being conducted at NYUCD. This course is a 6 credit elective, graded as A, B, or F and runs from the beginning of March till the end of July. Some of the topics covered as lectures include the basics of clinical and basic research, lab safety, bioethics, animal issues, and career opportunities. There are two mechanisms to complete the course requirements:     Mechanism 1: First year dental students will attend lectures and work on their research projects with their mentors for three hours per week for the Spring semester.   Mechanism 2: First year dental students are eligible only if they have successfully completed the eight-week summer research program as incoming dental students. They will spend four hours per week working on their research projects with their mentors in the Spring semester. While they must attend the STUDENT PRESENTATIONS, they are exempt from the rest of the lectures.     Both mechanisms require full-time (~35 hrs/week in NYC) participation in the five-week summer program between the D1 and D2 years. Students will be selected for admission to this course based on the quality of their application (http://www.nyu.edu/dental/intranet/ under online forms) and availability of matching mentors and research projects.   Applications are due mid-January, notices of acceptance are released in the beginning of February, and the program runs from approximately March 1 to the end of July. The program ends with mandatory participation in the Summer Poster Day at the end of July.

Mentors are full-time faculty members at NYUCD and most research faculty members are available as sponsors ( click here for a listing of faculty members' areas of research ).   Alternatively, students should search the student abstract books (http://www.nyu.edu/dental/intranet/) for interesting topics to identify possible mentors. Once students find a research topic that interests them, they must consult with potential mentors about possible projects to obtain the faculty member's permission to apply to the program. Students are referred to the NYUCD chapter of the Student Research Group for additional guidance and help in establishing connections to the like-minded researchers. Once these avenues have been explored, students can contact the course coordinator, Dr. Kathleen Kinnally , for additional assistance.   Once accepted into the program, students and their mentors sign a contact and provide a copy to the course director (Dr. Kinnally) before they begin working on their projects.

Honors in Research Program for D2-D4 students                               This research program is designed to provide selected students with the opportunity to be involved in a research project being conducted at NYU College of Dentistry. Students who have participated in the D1 Honors in Research program have the opportunity to continue or change research directions and thus be active in research throughout their dental education at NYU College of Dentistry. Students who have not participated in previous Honors in Research programs have the opportunity to gain research experience at NYU College of Dentistry.   There are two honors in research courses that differ in their intent and requirements. The Honors in Research course is a three-credit course, while the Independent Research course is a one-credit course; course descriptions are listed below. Both courses must be applied for each semester, with deadlines on August 1 for the fall semester and December 15 for the spring semester. The application is online on the intranet under online forms at www.nyu.edu/dental/intranet/ .   Students must identify a mentor BEFORE applying to this program.

Once accepted into the program, students and their mentor sign a contact and provide a copy to the course director (Dr. Kinnally) before they are registered and begin working on their projects. A project summary approved by the mentor must be submitted to the course director before the end of each semester before a grade will be assigned.     Honors in Research: This course is a three-credit course that requires a commitment of nine hours/week for 15 weeks or a total of 135 hours/semester. Students should track their time and a sample Excel spreadsheet can be downloaded here . The intent of this course is for students to be involved in a research project and gain hands-on laboratory and/or clinical experience as well as an understanding of the science behind their projects through readings of the scientific literature. In consultation with their mentor, students will work on their projects with a goal of being able to present their project to their peers and the faculty at Research Day (usually in mid-April) as well as outside the college, eg, at national meetings. Note, clinical projects require IRB approval prior to application. This elective course is only open to select students in academic good-standing and permission of the faculty member that will guide the research project is required for registration.

One rationale for the program is the concept that dental students should be able to understand the science behind what they are doing and apply it to their practices. &quot;We want to capture those who are turned on by science,&quot; says Louis Terracio, PhD, Vice Dean for Research and Professor, Department of Basic Science and Craniofacial Biology, NYU College of Dentistry, who adds that starting people early in research changes their thinking fundamentally. &quot;Whether you're a dentist or a stockbroker, you should want to look at data critically and make good decisions based on it.&quot; The program began in the summer of 2001 with a small group of students and funding from the National Institutes of Health with its goal to encourage dental students to consider careers in academia.

D1 Honors in Research                               This course is designed to provide selected first year dental students with the opportunity to participate in a research project being conducted at NYUCD. This course is a 6 credit elective, graded as A, B, or F and runs from the beginning of March till the end of July. Some of the topics covered as lectures include the basics of clinical and basic research, lab safety, bioethics, animal issues, and career opportunities. There are two mechanisms to complete the course requirements:     Mechanism 1: First year dental students will attend lectures and work on their research projects with their mentors for three hours per week for the Spring semester.   Mechanism 2: First year dental students are eligible only if they have successfully completed the eight-week summer research program as incoming dental students. They will spend four hours per week working on their research projects with their mentors in the Spring semester. While they must attend the STUDENT PRESENTATIONS, they are exempt from the rest of the lectures.     Both mechanisms require full-time (~35 hrs/week in NYC) participation in the five-week summer program between the D1 and D2 years. Students will be selected for admission to this course based on the quality of their application (http://www.nyu.edu/dental/intranet/ under online forms) and availability of matching mentors and research projects.   Applications are due mid-January, notices of acceptance are released in the beginning of February, and the program runs from approximately March 1 to the end of July. The program ends with mandatory participation in the Summer Poster Day at the end of July.

Mentors are full-time faculty members at NYUCD and most research faculty members are available as sponsors ( click here for a listing of faculty members' areas of research ).   Alternatively, students should search the student abstract books (http://www.nyu.edu/dental/intranet/) for interesting topics to identify possible mentors. Once students find a research topic that interests them, they must consult with potential mentors about possible projects to obtain the faculty member's permission to apply to the program. Students are referred to the NYUCD chapter of the Student Research Group for additional guidance and help in establishing connections to the like-minded researchers. Once these avenues have been explored, students can contact the course coordinator, Dr. Kathleen Kinnally , for additional assistance.   Once accepted into the program, students and their mentors sign a contact and provide a copy to the course director (Dr. Kinnally) before they begin working on their projects.

Honors in Research Program for D2-D4 students                               This research program is designed to provide selected students with the opportunity to be involved in a research project being conducted at NYU College of Dentistry. Students who have participated in the D1 Honors in Research program have the opportunity to continue or change research directions and thus be active in research throughout their dental education at NYU College of Dentistry. Students who have not participated in previous Honors in Research programs have the opportunity to gain research experience at NYU College of Dentistry.   There are two honors in research courses that differ in their intent and requirements. The Honors in Research course is a three-credit course, while the Independent Research course is a one-credit course; course descriptions are listed below. Both courses must be applied for each semester, with deadlines on August 1 for the fall semester and December 15 for the spring semester. The application is online on the intranet under online forms at www.nyu.edu/dental/intranet/ .   Students must identify a mentor BEFORE applying to this program.

Once accepted into the program, students and their mentor sign a contact and provide a copy to the course director (Dr. Kinnally) before they are registered and begin working on their projects. A project summary approved by the mentor must be submitted to the course director before the end of each semester before a grade will be assigned.     Honors in Research: This course is a three-credit course that requires a commitment of nine hours/week for 15 weeks or a total of 135 hours/semester. Students should track their time and a sample Excel spreadsheet can be downloaded here . The intent of this course is for students to be involved in a research project and gain hands-on laboratory and/or clinical experience as well as an understanding of the science behind their projects through readings of the scientific literature. In consultation with their mentor, students will work on their projects with a goal of being able to present their project to their peers and the faculty at Research Day (usually in mid-April) as well as outside the college, eg, at national meetings. Note, clinical projects require IRB approval prior to application. This elective course is only open to select students in academic good-standing and permission of the faculty member that will guide the research project is required for registration. Once accepted into the program, students and their mentors sign a contact and provide a copy to the course director (Dr. Kinnally) before they begin working on their projects.

Independent Research: This course is a one-credit course that requires a commitment of three hours/week for 15 weeks, or a total of 45 hours/semester. Students should track their time and a sample excel sheet can be downloaded here . This course is designed to provide students with the opportunity to be involved in clinical, educational, and/or evidence-based research being conducted at NYU College of Dentistry. The intent of this course is for students to be introduced to research practices and gain experience with in-depth literature searches and evidence-based practices as well as an understanding of the significance of their projects. This course may be used as a prequel to Honors in Research or to prepare an IRB proposal for clinical research projects. In consultation with their mentor, students will work on their projects with a goal of producing a document that summarizes their results and that may be presented as a poster to their peers and the faculty at the Educational Showcase.

Participants in the summer program work with faculty mentors on their research studies full time and attend seminars three times a week during the eight-week program. Seminar topics include health disparities, ethics, lab safety, DNA, animal research, and evidence-based practice. Students learn to prepare poster presentations and use teaching tools in research environments. At the end of the eight weeks, there is a poster session in which the students present posters describing the studies on which they worked.   This eight-week program runs from June 1, 2015, to July 24, 2015, and students must be available to participate for the entire eight weeks. The online application is below; the deadline for the submission of applications is March 1, 2015 . Applicants will be informed about acceptance by about March 15, 2015 . Students who complete a research project will have several opportunities to present their research at various professional meetings and at our Annual Student Research Days in April.

This can be accomplished with a vibrant research program that is commensurate with the vision of the College, by exposing as many of our students as possible to research through a high quality hands-on experience, and by making evidence-based practice an integral part of our education program so that our students appreciate the fact that only through a thorough evaluation of the research can appropriate practice decisions be made.   The Office of Research contributes to this mission by managing the Summer Research Experience for incoming Dental students, and by supporting the Honors in Research program. In addition, students are encouraged to present their work at national and international meetings, and receive financial support to aid them in doing so.   Honors in Research Programs     Honors in Research Programs were established to motivate and encourage NYU College of Dentistry students to become involved in oral health related research (basic, biomaterials, clinical, or behavioral) at NYUCD. These Honors in Research programs are flexible to fit the diversity of projects and changing goals of our students as they progress through the dental school curriculum.                                                    NYUCD Summer Research Experience                               The annual Summer Research Experience held at NYU College of Dentistry introduces incoming dental and nursing students to research at an early stage in their careers - inspiring them and helping them see that research can be an exciting and fulfilling career trajectory. Participants in the summer program work with faculty mentors on their research studies full time and attend seminars three times a week during the eight-week program. Seminar topics include health disparities, ethics, lab safety, DNA, animal research, and evidence-based practice. Students learn to prepare poster presentations, teaching tools in research environments. At the end of the eight weeks, there is a poster session in which the students present posters describing the studies on which they worked.   One rationale for the program is the concept that dental students should be able to understand the science behind what they are doing and apply it to their practices. &quot;We want to capture those who are turned on by science,&quot; says Louis Terracio, PhD, Vice Dean for Research and Professor, Department of Basic Science and Craniofacial Biology, NYU College of Dentistry, who adds that starting people early in research changes their thinking fundamentally. &quot;Whether you're a dentist or a stockbroker, you should want to look at data critically and make good decisions based on it.&quot; The program began in the summer of 2001 with a small group of students and funding from the National Institutes of Health with its goal to encourage dental students to consider careers in academia.

D1 Honors in Research                               This course is designed to provide selected first year dental students with the opportunity to participate in a research project being conducted at NYUCD. This course is a 6 credit elective, graded as A, B, or F and runs from the beginning of March till the end of July. Some of the topics covered as lectures include the basics of clinical and basic research, lab safety, bioethics, animal issues, and career opportunities. There are two mechanisms to complete the course requirements:     Mechanism 1: First year dental students will attend lectures and work on their research projects with their mentors for three hours per week for the Spring semester.   Mechanism 2: First year dental students are eligible only if they have successfully completed the eight-week summer research program as incoming dental students. They will spend four hours per week working on their research projects with their mentors in the Spring semester. While they must attend the STUDENT PRESENTATIONS, they are exempt from the rest of the lectures.     Both mechanisms require full-time (~35 hrs/week in NYC) participation in the five-week summer program between the D1 and D2 years. Students will be selected for admission to this course based on the quality of their application (http://www.nyu.edu/dental/intranet/ under online forms) and availability of matching mentors and research projects.   Applications are due mid-January, notices of acceptance are released in the beginning of February, and the program runs from approximately March 1 to the end of July. The program ends with mandatory participation in the Summer Poster Day at the end of July.

Mentors are full-time faculty members at NYUCD and most research faculty members are available as sponsors ( click here for a listing of faculty members' areas of research ).   Alternatively, students should search the student abstract books (http://www.nyu.edu/dental/intranet/) for interesting topics to identify possible mentors. Once students find a research topic that interests them, they must consult with potential mentors about possible projects to obtain the faculty member's permission to apply to the program. Students are referred to the NYUCD chapter of the Student Research Group for additional guidance and help in establishing connections to the like-minded researchers. Once these avenues have been explored, students can contact the course coordinator, Dr. Kathleen Kinnally , for additional assistance.   Once accepted into the program, students and their mentors sign a contact and provide a copy to the course director (Dr. Kinnally) before they begin working on their projects.

Honors in Research Program for D2-D4 students                               This research program is designed to provide selected students with the opportunity to be involved in a research project being conducted at NYU College of Dentistry. Students who have participated in the D1 Honors in Research program have the opportunity to continue or change research directions and thus be active in research throughout their dental education at NYU College of Dentistry. Students who have not participated in previous Honors in Research programs have the opportunity to gain research experience at NYU College of Dentistry.   There are two honors in research courses that differ in their intent and requirements. The Honors in Research course is a three-credit course, while the Independent Research course is a one-credit course; course descriptions are listed below. Both courses must be applied for each semester, with deadlines on August 1 for the fall semester and December 15 for the spring semester. The application is online on the intranet under online forms at www.nyu.edu/dental/intranet/ .   Students must identify a mentor BEFORE applying to this program. Mentors are fulltime faculty members at NYUCD and most research faculty members are available as sponsors ( click here to see listing of faculty members' areas of research ).

Once accepted into the program, students and their mentor sign a contact and provide a copy to the course director (Dr. Kinnally) before they are registered and begin working on their projects. A project summary approved by the mentor must be submitted to the course director before the end of each semester before a grade will be assigned.     Honors in Research: This course is a three-credit course that requires a commitment of nine hours/week for 15 weeks or a total of 135 hours/semester. Students should track their time and a sample Excel spreadsheet can be downloaded here . The intent of this course is for students to be involved in a research project and gain hands-on laboratory and/or clinical experience as well as an understanding of the science behind their projects through readings of the scientific literature. In consultation with their mentor, students will work on their projects with a goal of being able to present their project to their peers and the faculty at Research Day (usually in mid-April) as well as outside the college, eg, at national meetings. Note, clinical projects require IRB approval prior to application. This elective course is only open to select students in academic good-standing and permission of the faculty member that will guide the research project is required for registration. Once accepted into the program, students and their mentors sign a contact and provide a copy to the course director (Dr. Kinnally) before they begin working on their projects.

Participants in the summer program work with faculty mentors on their research studies full time and attend seminars three times a week during the eight-week program. Seminar topics include health disparities, ethics, lab safety, DNA, animal research, and evidence-based practice. Students learn to prepare poster presentations and use teaching tools in research environments. At the end of the eight weeks, there is a poster session in which the students present posters describing the studies on which they worked.   This eight-week program runs from June 1, 2015, to July 24, 2015, and students must be available to participate for the entire eight weeks. The online application is below; the deadline for the submission of applications is March 1, 2015 . Applicants will be informed about acceptance by about March 15, 2015 . Students who complete a research project will have several opportunities to present their research at various professional meetings and at our Annual Student Research Days in April.

Schools of the health professions typically do not have a preference for the type of research that  you conduct (bench, translational/clinical, honors work); it is more about the demonstration of your intellectual  curiosity and scholarly development.      Some professional programs incorporate research requirements into their curricula and therefore expect applicants to  have demonstrated an interest in conducting research at the undergraduate level. If you are considering a PhD (MD/PhD,  DO/PhD, etc.) you should plan to gain significant research experience as part of your application portfolio.      As with the other elements of your prehealth preparation, it is critical to seek out and get involved in meaningful  activities that help you grow as an individual, preprofessional student, and academic. If a research opportunity arises  and it aligns with your interests, we encourage you to add this type of experience to your portfolio.
