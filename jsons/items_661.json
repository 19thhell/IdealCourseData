Screenplay by Marguerite Duras (Special Award at the  1959 Cannes Film Festival).            - Breathless (1960) by Jean-Luc Godard      A  penniless young thug who models himself on the film persona of Humphrey Bogart\u2026  On the run from the police, he turns to his American girlfriend, a student and  aspiring journalist, who sells the New York Herald Tribune on the streets of  Paris... A film that symbolizes the \u00ab New Wave \u00bb for its bold visual  style (1960 Jean Vigo Prize).            - Tout va bien (1972) by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin      How can cinema have  a real impact on society ? Godard and Gorin explore the intersections of  radicalism with cinema and modernism in the wake of the May 68\u2019 riots.            - Diva (1981) by Jean-Jacques Beineix      The  story of a young postal carrier with a passion for music. A film whose camera movements, soundtrack,  stylishness and\u2026 blue lighting testify to the crisis of political modernism in  France in the 1980s.            - Hate (1995) by Mathieu Kassovitz      The  story of three young friends in an impoverished multi-ethnic housing project in  the aftermath of a great riot (Best Director Award for 28 years old Kassovitz  at the Cannes Film Festival).             - A Self  Made Hero (1996) by Jacques  Audiard      How an  ordinary young man reinvents himself during after the liberation of France by  storing and memorizing data to become a hero of the French Resistance.

I investigate how mass audiences embrace films on the basis of myths and sensibilities that may revive or adjust ancient narratives to modern times. Literature, aesthetics, history, geography and sociology are key in my attempt to excavate these resurgences. I have written on the relationships between film and literature, theory, space, and politics. My current research focuses on how French film theorists and critics laid the foundation for a sociological approach to film prior to the advent of political modernism.

Examples of questions include : what  is editing ? a deep focused shot ? a tracking shot ? a low  angle, etc ?

Films to be studied and discussed:               (the list might be modified)            - Selection of films by the Lumi\u00e8re  brothers and Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s (1895-1902)      Two  conceptions of cinema : reality captured through the lens of the Lumi\u00e8re  brothers and the bold special effects of M\u00e9li\u00e8s, the  \u00ab Cinemagician \u00bb.            - The Age of Gold (1930) by Luis Bu\u00f1uel      At the  forefront of cinematic Surrealism , The Age of Gold is the most blasphemous  and anti-bourgeois of all Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s films. A ban was placed on the film for 50  years\u2026            - L\u2019Atalante (1934) by Jean Vigo      \u00ab  Classical, almost violent and always tormented, fevered, overflowing with ideas  and with fantasy \u00bb (Elie Faure).

The  French government banned it, but after the War it has come to be seen by many  film critics and directors as one of the greatest films of all time.            - My Uncle (1958) by Jacques Tati      A satire  of postwar France's infatuation with modern architecture, mechanical efficiency  and American-style consumerism (special Prize at the 1958 Cannes Film  Festival ; 1959 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film).             - Hiroshima My Love (1959) by Alain  Resnais      A film  about the impossible relationship between a French woman and a Japanese man  questioning, love, war and memory. A film made by one of the most influential  French modernist director. Screenplay by Marguerite Duras (Special Award at the  1959 Cannes Film Festival).            - Breathless (1960) by Jean-Luc Godard      A  penniless young thug who models himself on the film persona of Humphrey Bogart\u2026  On the run from the police, he turns to his American girlfriend, a student and  aspiring journalist, who sells the New York Herald Tribune on the streets of  Paris... A film that symbolizes the \u00ab New Wave \u00bb for its bold visual  style (1960 Jean Vigo Prize).            - Tout va bien (1972) by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin      How can cinema have  a real impact on society ? Godard and Gorin explore the intersections of  radicalism with cinema and modernism in the wake of the May 68\u2019 riots.            - Diva (1981) by Jean-Jacques Beineix      The  story of a young postal carrier with a passion for music. A film whose camera movements, soundtrack,  stylishness and\u2026 blue lighting testify to the crisis of political modernism in  France in the 1980s.            - Hate (1995) by Mathieu Kassovitz      The  story of three young friends in an impoverished multi-ethnic housing project in  the aftermath of a great riot (Best Director Award for 28 years old Kassovitz  at the Cannes Film Festival).             - A Self  Made Hero (1996) by Jacques  Audiard      How an  ordinary young man reinvents himself during after the liberation of France by  storing and memorizing data to become a hero of the French Resistance.

I investigate how mass audiences embrace films on the basis of myths and sensibilities that may revive or adjust ancient narratives to modern times. Literature, aesthetics, history, geography and sociology are key in my attempt to excavate these resurgences. I have written on the relationships between film and literature, theory, space, and politics. My current research focuses on how French film theorists and critics laid the foundation for a sociological approach to film prior to the advent of political modernism.

Rather than focusing exclusively on film adaptations  of texts, the course treats the problems of film, novels and theater as a  literary phenomenon. While French film plays a key part in the structure of the  course, the films to be shown and the reading assigned reflect a wider  international spectrum. There will be emphasis on the connection between  different cultures in different time frames, and stress will also be placed on  works that have a special relationship with the concerns of humanity.          The  course is interdisciplinary and uses critical methods pertinent to the media  involved. Its juxtaposition of one of the most important art forms of the 20 th   century against literature serves the needs of a contemporary liberal education  and aims to lead the student to question assumptions about both cinema and  literature. Films to be shown:     Fritz Lang's Metropolis , an  exploration of a silent masterpiece and its visual effects in relationship to  literature concerning oppression under industrialization and society's social  structure.      Alain Resnais's Hiroshima mon amour ,  among the influential New Wave films and closely related artistically to the  characteristics of the New Novel, as well as a film that entwines personal  relationships with moral questions.       Richard Boleslawski's Les Miserables ,  the classic 1935 film based on Victor Hugo's masterpiece of 19 th   century French literature that has also been adapted for musical theater.       Euzhan Palcy's Sugar Cane Alley (Rue  case Negres), a powerful drama set in 1931 and revealing the family life  and struggle of black plantation workers in Martinique during the 1930s. Based  on a novel by Joseph Zobel.       Luchino Visconti's Death in Venice, the  great Italian director's adaptation of Thomas Mann's internationally acclaimed  work and a study of the challenge for film to capture literary metaphor.       Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451, a  dramatic expression of humankind's quest for the preservation of intellectual  freedom in the face of repression. An important film selected from the works of  France's influential New Wave  director.
