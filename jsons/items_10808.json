We will introduce, evaluate and develop various service learning pedagogical strategies that have proven to be effective and impactful upon students and their community partners. The seminar will demonstrate how service learning can be embedded within Living and Learning communities. The socio-historical and cultural patterns of gendering justice that have disenfranchised, silenced or diminished the voices and experiences of women and girls will frame the service learning approaches. The seminar will examine service learning pedagogical strategies that connect students to communities of women and girls who have been subject to social, legal and/or political policies that have served to diminish their basic human rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.     Special attention will be given to how to develop courses that include a service learning component, and that are based upon a social justice model that focuses on the lived experiences of women and girls. The intentional design of service learning courses that recognize the various intersectional experiences of women and girls as their identities are constructed and responded to based on race, class, gender, sexual preference, and cultural markers will govern the seminar discussions and experiences.        Convener:     Cynthia Spence is an associate professor of sociology at Spelman College and director of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF)/Mellon Programs.

Return to top              Beauty: The Fortunes and Transformations of an Ancient Greek Idea     The Program     Beauty is a trillion dollar business, an icon of desirability (just look at any advertisement, whether for cars, watches, or ice cream), an object of criticism by feminists and moralists, a threat (the \"femme fatale\"), an exalted spiritual quality (for example, the beauty of the Virgin Mary), and a key term in aesthetics, much debated but still at the core of our response to art in every form. But what is beauty? Is it a universal idea, hard-wired in our systems as a result of evolution (cf. the popular book The Survival of the Prettiest )? Is it an intrinsically sexist notion (why do we call women \"beautiful\" or \"pretty\" but call men \"handsome\")? Why do we think of princesses as beautiful? Does beauty vary from one culture to another - and are there societies that do not have a conception of beauty, or at least no conceptions that resemble our own? And what about art - is the beauty of a work of art like that of a beautiful woman? Can a painting of a repulsive object be beautiful?      It is widely agreed that ancient Greece set the tone for modern conceptions of beauty; as Michael Squire has written, \"like it or not - and there have been many reasons for not liking it - antiquity has supplied the mould for all subsequent attempts to figure and figure out the human body.\" So we will begin by examining how beauty was conceived in classical antiquity: in Greece, in Rome, and in the Bible. We shall consider the close connection between beauty and desire, and ask why Plato believed that the transcendent ideas, visible only to the mind, were beautiful. We will look at the connection between beauty and social class (what I call \"beauty and the best\"), beauty and sexuality (including ancient Greek pederasty), and beauty and religion. With this as background, we will look at how ideas of beauty evolved and changed over the centuries, from the Renaissance to today. We will discuss the role of fashion in relation to beauty: is our modern notion of beauty wholly commercialized? Can we simply dismiss the contributions of such major designers as Coco Chanel or Balenciaga?     Readings for the course will include portions of David Konstan's book on beauty, and selections from Nancy Etcoff, The Survival of the Prettiest (1999); Ruby Blondell, Helen of Troy (2013); Gabrielle Starr, Feeling Beauty: The Neuroscience of Aesthetic Experience (2013); Wendy Steiner, Venus in Exile: The Rejection of Beauty in Twentieth-Century Art (2001); Plato's Symposium ; Roger Scruton, Beauty (2009); and Alexander Nehamas, The Promise of Happiness: The Place of Beauty in a World of Art (2007). Guest speakers will be invited as well, particularly from the world of fashion and art.     Convener:      David Konstan is Professor of Classics at New York University. Among the books he has published are Roman Comedy (1983); Sexual Symmetry: Love in the Ancient Novel and Related Genres (1994); Greek Comedy and Ideology (1995); Friendship in the Classical World (1997); Pity Transformed (2001); The Emotions of the Ancient Greeks: Studies in Aristotle and Classical Literature (2006), which was awarded the American Philological Association's Charles J. Goodwin Award of Merit; \"A Life Worthy of the Gods\": The Materialist Psychology of Epicurus (2008); Terms for Eternity: Aionios and Aidios in Classical and Christian Texts (with Ilaria Ramelli, 2007); and Before Forgiveness: The Origins of a Moral Idea (2010). His most recent book is Beauty: The Fortunes of an Ancient Greek Idea (2014). He has been awarded numerous grants, including the ACLS, NEH, and Guggenheim fellowships, and has taught in Egypt, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, and Scotland, among other places. He has served as president of the American Philological Association (1999), and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and Honorary Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities.                                             Return to top          Ditch the In-Class Lecture - Add Active Learning     The Program     Active learning refers to any course-related activity (in or out of class) that provides an opportunity for students to take a participatory role in learning. Practice, discussion, problem solving, and other active learning techniques serve to make knowledge more meaningful and memorable.     In active learning, students build on prior knowledge while working individually or in groups to integrate, evaluate, and apply new ideas and information. This process motivates students to be more fully engaged with course content and fosters a sense of personal responsibility for learning, which - as ample research demonstrates - directly correlates with successful academic performance. In contrast to more passive modes of learning, such as listening to lectures, meaningful activities can ensure that students feel ownership over their education by optimizing participation in the classroom.     This interactive seminar will provide a hands-on design experience with a variety of active learning strategies for students. In conjunction with readings and discussion, participants will have the opportunity to create their own active learning experiences using related technologies for education. Participants will also be encouraged to share the methods they develop with the group in order to receive feedback and learn from each other's insights.     By the end of the seminar, participants will be able to:            evaluate the relative effectiveness and use of various active learning strategies in their course;       apply various active learning strategies to their course;       design a lesson (or several) using active learning strategies; and       demonstrate and lead a discussion on how they plan to incorporate active learning strategies in their course.

Return to top            Globalization and the Making of Latin American Cities     Co-sponsored by the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York University     The Program     This seminar will examine current transformation space across Latin American cities involving rapid urbanization, the growth of neoliberal developments, and the transformation of creative industries and economies across the region. We will focus on post -1980s transformations, when we see new modes of globalization across the region that presented new openings, but also constraints with regards to the development of enclave urbanism, new types of segregation and new imaginaries of class and \"urban\" identities. Topics will include the rise of tourism and creative economies around art and media; Latin American urban design and new urbanisms; the neo-liberalization of labor and the rise of informal economies, and immigration. We also will touch on how Latin American immigration is transforming urban imaginaries in the major cities across the United States.       Readings will be drawn from geography, urban studies, anthropology and cultural studies.             Convener:     Arlene Davila is Professor of Anthropology and American Studies, She's author of Barrio Dreams: Puerto Ricans, Latinos and the Neoliberal City , (NYU Press), Culture Works: Space, Value and Mobility Across the Neoliberal Americas (NYU Press), and \"El Mall: The Spatial and Class Politics of Shopping Malls in Latin America\" In Contract with UC Press.                  Return to top                    Louis Armstrong and New Orleans Jazz: Musical and Cultural Significance     The Program     Jazz emerged from the New Orleans African American population during the turbulent 1890s as an exciting new dance music that also served as a metaphor for democracy. In its local role as a folk music, jazz was used in and for a wide variety of settings and activities. With its spread across America, jazz inspired the rebellious and free spirited 1920s \"Jazz Age\" generation. Although jazz became a commercial catch-all term that was swept up into the growing music business and dance craze, much authentic jazz was performed in northern nightclubs, where it was widely recorded and influenced new styles and generations of musicians.     New Orleans-born trumpeter and singer Louis Armstrong rose from a life of poverty and hardship to become the first major jazz soloist and also one of the most visible and influential figures in the history of American music and culture. His meteoric rise gained impetus during the 1920s in Chicago and New York, where he made a series of recordings that helped to change the direction of jazz and open new possibilities for musicians, composers and arrangers. As a singer his offbeat phrasing, scat singing and euphoric feeling influenced scores of vocalists into the present. The most musically and culturally significant parts of Armstrong's life can be divided into three periods, each marked by stylistic changes as well as shifting levels of fame and critical acceptance. There has been much discussion and controversy regarding Armstrong's style, image, film roles, repertoire, political views, importance and enduring legacy.     This seminar will include lecture and discussion, and will be supplemented by films, recordings, photographs, guests, live musical demonstration and a field trip. Assigned readings include three books on Louis Armstrong, as well as some of Professor White's publications, including: \"Traditional New Orleans Jazz as a Metaphor for American Life\" (available as a \"Foreseeable Futures\" publication on the Imagining America website: http//imaginingamerica.org/); \"Reflections of an Authentic Jazz Life in Pre-Katrina New Orleans\" in the Journal of American History (94, Dec. 2007); and \"Dr. Michael White: The Doc Paulin Years, 1975-79\" in the Tulane Jazz Archivist (vol. XXIII; 2010)        Convener:     Convener: Michael Gerard White is the Keller Endowed Chair in the Humanities at Xavier University in New Orleans where he has served as a professor of Spanish and African-American music for over 30 years. He studied the clarinet in high school and later learned jazz in brass band street parades, funerals and community events. He played alongside several dozen jazz musicians born between the late 1890s and 1910. White is highly visible on the jazz scene as a band leader, recording artist, composer, writer and lecturer. He has appeared on over 60 recordings, including several under his own name and also with a variety of artists like Wynton Marsalis, Beausoleil, Eric Clapton, Taj Mahal and Paul Simon. Dr. White has won numerous honor and awards, including the Chevalier of Arts and Letters from France, The NEH National Heritage Fellowship Award, the LEH Louisiana State Humanist of the Year Award, and the Tulane University President's Medal. He has recently completed producing and recording on a CD of New Orleans brass bands for the Smithsonian Institution.                                 Return to top               Reading Rigorously, Writing Eloquently&mdash;and Persuasively - Across Disciplines     The Program     Under the auspices of a Mellon Foundation grant, my work at Hendrix College for the last two years has focused on helping teachers in the disciplines learn new ways of teaching writing. Ten faculty members from Art History, African History, Psychology, Philosophy, English, and Creative Writing have taken up the task of teaching a rigorous essay course outside the confines of their own disciplines. Our faculty workshops and classroom teaching have dwelt on reading and representing complex written texts and experience, conceiving and substantiating ideas, and developing those ideas in essays that often run against the grain of argument. We have sought to concentrate on practices that rarely find their way into either composition texts or disciplinary classrooms. Instead of concentrating on proof, our written work has thrived on continual inquiry and revision, ideas rather than theses, and rigorous written conversations that aim to be inclusive as they reach out to embrace contradiction and complexity. The aim of our project has been to take new forms of public writing back into each of the represented disciplines.     Our summer workshop at NYU will draw its sustenance from this experimental work as we concern ourselves with the relationship between reading and conception, between reading and the inductive process, and between reading and writing. Our aim will be to improve our own pedagogy - even as we work together this summer - so that we can in turn improve our students' written expression.     A Story of Necessity     Almost a decade ago, I discovered that my students were paying primary attention only to the personal connections they could make with the assigned written texts; they showed little interest in the larger body of ideas or the way those ideas were presented. Their habits led to hasty conclusions about meaning--to an erasure of central parts of the text under consideration. Diverted by a thesis chase , they were looking for a single point instead of a network of complementary ideas.     Instead of learning to reason from evidence, most students had learned to take shortcuts, moving habitually from thesis to highly selective evidence - leaving out contradictions, challenges, complications. The learned emphasis had been not on the rigorous analysis of evidence but on a fact-based, highly structured response: thesis, proposition, and examples.     The examination of evidence rarely leads to certainty or to a thesis that can, out of necessity, be proved; it leads instead to discovery, to the rigorous combination and application of analysis and imagination, to ideas that must, like the evidence itself, be continually reassessed and re-conceptualized to represent more accurately whatever truth the evidence suggests to the researching writer. At the heart of this inductive process of discovery lies the complex business of reading complex written texts that do not reveal themselves to cursory examination.      For the writer, grappling with lively ideas leads eventually to clarification and the use of nuanced language, to a more complex form of expression than a formulaic set of declarations and a series of examples can provide. The act of writing - writing itself - is central to learning, just as the act of reading is central to writing.     The inductive process is, of course, the same process that leads to discovery in science or in any other academic discipline. It provides the foundation for making sense of research, no matter what the subject matter. Crucial to all academic work, we are left partially blind without it, unable to determine what the evidence means, unable to discover what we really have to say.     Convener:     Pat C. Hoy II directed the Expository Writing Program at NYU for twenty years. Now the Mellon Visiting Professor of English at Hendrix College, he has also held appointments at the U.S. Military Academy and Harvard. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania.     The author of numerous textbooks related to the study and teaching of composition, Professor Hoy's essays and reviews have appeared in Sewanee Review, Virginia Quarterly Review, Agni, Twentieth Century Literature, South Atlantic Review, and the Wall Street Journal . He was awarded the 2003 Cecil Woods, Jr. Prize for Nonfiction from the Fellowship of Southern Writers and recently received the Monroe K. Spears Essay Prize for the best essay published in Sewanee Review in 2014. He twice won New York University's Golden Dozen Award for excellence in teaching.                       Return to top            The Informatics Revolution: Using Data to Enhance Teaching Life Sciences     The Program     The recent Ebola outbreak underscores the challenges that infectious disease continues to raise in the world around us. Malaria kills roughly 600,000 people a year, and tuberculosis about twice as many. Closer to home, widespread overuse of antibiotics has provoked high levels of drug resistance in hospital-acquired infections, which are now also in the community. Key to confronting modern problems in biomedicine is the availability of powerful tools to investigate the molecular basis of disease as well as the complex biology of cells and organisms. Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing area that addresses the use of computers for the acquisition, management, and analysis of biological information. The explosion of interest in bioinformatics in the past few years has been driven by the tremendous growth of DNA sequencing technology. Huge repositories of sequence and structural information provide an amazing wealth of resources for researchers, teachers and students.     In this seminar, participants will become familiar with the bioinformatics-related databases that are available, and learn how to search them using modern software. We will emphasize how to use informatics to design course modules, class projects and case studies for students in biology, chemistry, public health, and environmental science.     This seminar is appropriate for faculty members in the natural sciences, health sciences, computer science, and mathematics. No prior programming experience is required.       Convener:     Stuart Brown , New York University, holds a Ph.D. from Cornell University and was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Plant Molecular Biology at the University of Manitoba. He subsequently was a Research Scientist at the United States Department of Agriculture before joining the NYU faculty. He serves as bioinformatics consultant for NYU's Medical Center, collaborating on a wide range of research projects. He contributes data management and data analysis expertise to multiple projects that make use of high-throughput Next-Generation DNA sequencing technology. He is currently engaged on projects that include metagenomics (Human Microbiome Project), analysis of the genetic variation in the malaria parasite, and analysis of RNA sequence data from a variety of clinical and basic science research projects. Other projects he has worked on include the discovery of antigens using a pattern-based search of complete genome sequences, searching for the bacterial genes linked to severe dental caries, and an evolutionary analysis of the mammalian genes involved in sugar metabolism. He has been Course Director for the Bioinformatics course in the Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences for 12 years, for which he has received the Dean's Recognition Citation for Excellence in Medical Education.                              Return to top          The Philosopher in the Marketplace: Market Morality and its Social Impact     The Program     This seminar will undertake a critical examination of how the marketplace embraces a morality that defines and governs the way transactions are conducted within its womb. Its tentacles are far reaching, insinuating themselves into the very fabric of the society that houses and nurtures it. These adopted values determine the content and direction of social policy, as well as our understanding of how the more general aspects of our commercial life should be contoured. On a personal level, it impacts upon notions of happiness and success, while playing a central role in the creation of our social image.     Our discussions will focus around the ways in which markets can and do crowd out morals, often leading to the cynicism expressed by social realists - those who see the moral assessment of markets and business as inappropriate, as if commercial enterprise gets a free pass from morally based critique. It will become apparent as a result of our investigations that those who hold \"business ethics\" as an oxymoron are not only mistaken, but also divisive in promoting such a stance.     As a sampling, our studies will include questions concerning the moral limits of markets, and the determination of what money can or cannot, should or should not buy, i.e.,            Should we be able to buy and sell human organs, to treat citizenship papers and college admissions as commodities to be subject to purchase, etc.?       What are the moral consequences of adopting a \"bottom line\" perception of business practice?       What is the moral impact of the employment of the fear factor in marketing?       Why do we buy what we buy?       Do we have any obligations to protect and enhance the environment, to consider matters of sustainability and the fate of future generations in making economically based decisions?       Are we morally obliged to consider the plight and well-being of persons unknown to us, inhabitants of countries we will never come to visit while making marketplace decisions?       Is there a moral component to the determination of the social and personal ideals that we aggressively market, ideals concerned with class, race, and gender as well as those concerned with personal image, i.e., stature, weight and personal choice?          Our scrutiny will inexorably lead us to confront the most serious issues faced by our society today, namely matters of social justice, the inordinately unbalanced distribution of wealth, and the values that drive how our national budgetary pie is cut. Undoubtedly, we will join Michael Sandel in pondering his ongoing concern that we as a society may very well be drifting from HAVING a market economy to BEING a market society.      Reference will be made to the following works, engaging in style and content: Michael Sandel's What Money Can't Buy and Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do ; John Rawls' A Theory of Justice ; William Irvine's On Desire: Why We Want What We Want ; Paul Bloom's How Pleasure Works: The New Science of Why We Like What We Like ; Daniel Gilbert's Stumbling on Happiness ; Geoffrey Miller's Spent: Sex, Evolution, and Consumer Behavior ; Tony Judt's Ill Fares the Land ; and Sissela Bok's Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life , to offer but an entree into the broad panorama of arenas touched by our concerns.

Return to top           Voices of Contemporary Islam        The Program     The religion of Islam has been at the center of political discourse in recent years. Issues of terrorism, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the debate over the proposed Park 51 Islamic Center, \"the Arab Spring\" and the rise of ISIS/ISIL in Iraq and Syria have focused attention on Muslims and their religion. The ways in which Islam has been discussed within the media and certain corners of the academy since the tragic and morally inexcusable events of September 11, 2001, have often been problematic. Over the last decade there has been a veritable explosion of books and articles on Islam, many of which decry what they see as a lack of intellectual debate and moral discourse in the Islamic world. Pundits on cable news networks continually assert \"it is a shame that there are no anti-terrorist, pro-democratic voices within Islam.\" These same opinions are also found in academic circles.     These kinds of opinions are at best rooted in ignorance and, at their worst, in prejudice and hostility. While it is true that there are \"fundamentalist\" voices within Islam that resist complex and multi-vocal interpretations of the basic sources of the tradition, they do not now, nor have they ever, represented the mainstream of Muslim thought. Islam has always maintained a variety of philosophical, theological and mystical expressions. It is Islam's diversity and ability to adapt to changing historical and cultural circumstances that is one of its primary characteristics and greatest strengths. Among the numerous problems and issues that have drawn the attention of today's Muslim intellectuals has been the rise to prominence of \"fundamentalists\" and \"Islamists\" willing to use violence to achieve their goals. Not only are \"traditional\" Muslims critiquing and challenging movements like the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and ISIS/ISIL as theologically incorrect readings of Qu'ran and hadith , but there are also vibrant \"progressive\" movements that draw upon feminist theory and liberation theology to develop radical new expressions of Muslim piety and political action.     This seminar will explore some of these crucial issues and debates in the contemporary Muslim world and present examples of diverse theological, political, and social thought. Issues to be examined will include the compatibility of Islam with democracy, the connections between Islam and terrorism, the role of Wahabism in the construction of contemporary Islamic movements, feminist movements within Islam, Islam and pluralism, and Sufism in the contemporary context. The course will introduce teachable primary sources, including writings by Khaled Abou Fadl, Amina Wadud, Osama bin Laden, and Michael Muhammad Knight, as well as varied \"Muslim Voices\" through selected films and literary works. Special attention will be focused on how to introduce complex and controversial issues in the classroom. Core texts may include: Progressive Muslims on Justice, Gender and Pluralism (Omid Safi, ed.); Tariq Ramadan's In the Footsteps of the Prophet: Lessons from the Life of Muhammad ; and Fatemeh Keshavarz' Jasmine and Stars: Reading More than Lolita in Tehran .

Return to top           Women and the Civil Rights Movement in the United States     The Program     Before the publication in 1993 of the pioneering text, Women in the Civil Rights Movement: Trailblazers and Torchbearers, 1941-1965 (edited by Vicki Crawford et al.), historical studies of women's contributions to the most important freedom struggle in the 20th century in the United States were virtually non-existent. There is now a growing body of scholarship, autobiographies, memoirs, children's books, and documentaries that analyze and capture the pivotal role of Black and white women, in particular, during the civil rights and Black power movements of the fifties, sixties, and seventies.     Using a variety of texts and films, this seminar will explore the important roles of women in various freedom struggles and analyze the gendered nature of the civil rights movement (CRM). Employing Black feminist theoretical frameworks, we will revisit \"the Movement\" and discuss the silences, absences, erasures, and distortions that characterize dominant narratives about contemporary Black liberation struggles that fall under the rubric of \"the civil rights movement.\" Texts to be studied include Belinda Robnett's How Long? How Long?: African American Women in the Struggle for Civil Rights/Black Power , which examines the movement from the vantage point of social movement theory; Lynn Olson's Freedom's Daughters: The Unsung Heroines of the Civil Rights Movement from 1830-1970 ; Danielle McGuire's At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape and Resistance: A New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power , which is a revisionist history of the iconic figure Parks, as well as a reimagining of the CRM; Peter Ling's and Sharon Monteith's Gender and the Civil Rights Movement ; and Hands on the Freedom Plow: Personal Accounts by Women in SNCC , edited by Faith S. Holsaert and others. Documentaries to be viewed include \"Reflections Unheard: Black Women in Civil Rights\" by Nevline Nnaji and \"Mountains That Take Wing: Angela Davis and Yuri Kochiyama, A Conversation on Life, Struggles and Liberation\" by C.A. Griffith and H. L.T. Quan.                Convener:     Beverly Guy-Sheftall is Founding Director of the Women's Research and Resource Center and Anna Julia Cooper Professor of Women's Studies at Spelman College. She is past president of the National Women's Studies Association (NWSA). Along with her co-editors, she published the first anthology of Black women's literature, Sturdy Black Bridges: Visions of Black Women in Literature . Her recent books include Gender Talk: The Struggle for Women's Equality in African American Communities (with Johnnetta Betsch Cole) and Still Brave: The Evolution of Black Women's Studies (with Stanlie M. James and Frances Smith Foster). In progress is a study of the radical politics of Coretta Scott King.                    Return to top             World Cinema Through Global Genres     The Program     McLuhan's vision of the global village has never been more compelling than it is today. The world in which our students are coming of age - and which they are helping to create - calls for greater international understanding and cooperation. One way to give students greater access to lives and cultures beyond our national borders is through the window of world cinema. Movies have a way of making history, geography, and demographics come alive, transforming statistics and abstractions into compelling human stories. But movies made in different languages in other countries are not always readily accessible. Strange customs, unfamiliar faces, and subtitles can cloud the window.     This seminar explores a new approach to teaching about world cultures through film genres. By starting with familiar Hollywood film forms (action, horror, road movies, wedding films) and tracing their origins and influences abroad (horror in Japan and Italy, kung fu in Hong Kong, wuxia pian in mainland China, wedding films in India, road movies in Latin America), students get to widen their experience of other film traditions and the cultures that produce them. By studying the cultural flows and cross-currents shaping our most popular global genres, they can form a deeper appreciation not only of the films and their stories, but also of the people, societies, and beliefs behind these films - people, societies, and beliefs they will be encountering in one form or another throughout their lives.     Teachers and scholars from a variety of disciplines are invited to apply. Together, we will look at film clips and selected feature films from the perspectives of history, social institutions, economics, and aesthetics. Our method will be interactive and participatory, with a focus on direct application to each participant's curriculum.         Coordinator:     William Costanzo is a SUNY Distinguished Teaching Professor of English and Film and has taught courses in writing, literature, and film studies at Westchester Community College since 1970. A graduate of Columbia University, Dr. Costanzo has published six books on writing and film, including Reading the Movies (revised for Kindle, 2014), Great Films and How to Teach Them (NCTE, 2004), The Writer's Eye (McGraw-Hill), and World Cinema Through Global Genres (Wiley Blackwell, 2014). He is active in the Society for Cinema and Media Studies, where he serves on the Teaching Committee and has recently co-edited a dossier on \"New Approaches to Teaching World Cinema.\"                       Return to top           Yellow Peril !!! &ndash; Understanding Xenophobia     The Program        Fears of \"yellow peril\" (and brown \"turban tides\") run deep in the present and past of U.S. political and commercial culture. The stories and imagery of \"yellow peril\" are just beneath the surface of everyday discourse and always latent&mdash;readily triggered by an incident, real or fabricated. Fabricated WMDs, SARS fears, charges of Chinese \"pirating\" of U.S. cultural properties, the racial profiling of \"Arab-looking\" peoples, and claims that Asians are \"taking over\" U.S. higher education all illustrate contemporary forms of Asian \"peril.\" And most recently, amidst the Snowden NSA disclosures, there are regular charges of relentless \"Chinese hacking,\" as if the U.S. is an innocent victim. Americans are woefully unaware of this scapegoating tradition and its paranoid history, and consequently remain particularly vulnerable to its ideological and affective power.         The stakes of understanding \"yellow peril\" (Islamophobia and related) fears are high for the future of our nation. There is a need to cultivate more rigorous understanding across cultural differences, and discover our shared humanity. Fundamental epistemological questions of knowledge are at stake. How do we know what we know? And how are we, systematically, made unaware? How do \"yellow peril\" fears distract us from the real dialogues and real issues that must take place? Despite the explosive developments in so many cities and nations of Asia, the U.S. people are still fundamentally unaware of Asian countries, where they are, the languages they speak, the religions they practice and the types of governments they have.        Seminar participants will explore what can and must be done to counter these fallacies and practices. In addition to readings, discussion, and online materials, the seminar will involve visits to exhibitions and archives, such as the Museum of Chinese in America, the National Archives Records Administration at the Customs House, and New York University's Fales and Tamiment Libraries. Guest speakers may include Dylan Yeats (co-author and editor with Dr. Tchen of Yellow Peril! An Archive of Anti-Asian Fear , 2014) and documentary filmmakers Ric Burns and Li-Shin Yu (whose upcoming PBS American Experience documentary is on the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act).                                              Convener:     Jack (John Kuo Wei) Tchen is a historian, curator and dumpster diver, whose interests include understanding the multiple presents, pasts, and futures of New York City, trans-local cross-cultural communications, unpacking archives and archival absences, and practices of dialogue-driven pedagogy. Professor Tchen is the founding director of the A/P/A (Asian/Pacific/American) Studies Program and Institute at New York University and co-founded the Museum of Chinese in America in 1979-80, where he continues to serve as senior historian. Jack was awarded the Charles S. Frankel Prize from the National Endowment for the Humanities (renamed The National Medal of Humanities). He is author of the award-winning books New York before Chinatown: Orientalism and the Shaping of American Culture, 1776-1882 and Genthe's Photographs of San Francisco's Old Chinatown, 1895-1905 . He is co-principal investigator of \"Asian Americas and Pacific Islanders Facts, Not Fiction: Setting the Record Straight,\" produced with the College Board. Dr. Tchen and Dylan Yeats' book, Yellow Peril! An Archive of Anti-Asian Fear was published by Verso in 2014. He co-curated MoCA's core exhibition, \"With a Single Step: Stories in the Making of America,\" in a new space designed by Maya Lin. He has been the chief historian for the New-York Historical Society exhibit \"Chinese Americans: Exclusion/Inclusion.\" And most recently Tchen co-curated \"Haunted Files: The Eugenics Record Office\" at NYU. He is currently working on a book and digital storytelling app reframing the foundational history of New York City, focusing on the unrecognized tradition of the intermingling of peoples as the engine of creativity and improvisation at the core of the life of the city.

We will introduce, evaluate and develop various service learning pedagogical strategies that have proven to be effective and impactful upon students and their community partners. The seminar will demonstrate how service learning can be embedded within Living and Learning communities. The socio-historical and cultural patterns of gendering justice that have disenfranchised, silenced or diminished the voices and experiences of women and girls will frame the service learning approaches. The seminar will examine service learning pedagogical strategies that connect students to communities of women and girls who have been subject to social, legal and/or political policies that have served to diminish their basic human rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.     Special attention will be given to how to develop courses that include a service learning component, and that are based upon a social justice model that focuses on the lived experiences of women and girls. The intentional design of service learning courses that recognize the various intersectional experiences of women and girls as their identities are constructed and responded to based on race, class, gender, sexual preference, and cultural markers will govern the seminar discussions and experiences.        Convener:     Cynthia Spence is an associate professor of sociology at Spelman College and director of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF)/Mellon Programs.

Return to top              Beauty: The Fortunes and Transformations of an Ancient Greek Idea     The Program     Beauty is a trillion dollar business, an icon of desirability (just look at any advertisement, whether for cars, watches, or ice cream), an object of criticism by feminists and moralists, a threat (the \"femme fatale\"), an exalted spiritual quality (for example, the beauty of the Virgin Mary), and a key term in aesthetics, much debated but still at the core of our response to art in every form. But what is beauty? Is it a universal idea, hard-wired in our systems as a result of evolution (cf. the popular book The Survival of the Prettiest )? Is it an intrinsically sexist notion (why do we call women \"beautiful\" or \"pretty\" but call men \"handsome\")? Why do we think of princesses as beautiful? Does beauty vary from one culture to another - and are there societies that do not have a conception of beauty, or at least no conceptions that resemble our own? And what about art - is the beauty of a work of art like that of a beautiful woman? Can a painting of a repulsive object be beautiful?      It is widely agreed that ancient Greece set the tone for modern conceptions of beauty; as Michael Squire has written, \"like it or not - and there have been many reasons for not liking it - antiquity has supplied the mould for all subsequent attempts to figure and figure out the human body.\" So we will begin by examining how beauty was conceived in classical antiquity: in Greece, in Rome, and in the Bible. We shall consider the close connection between beauty and desire, and ask why Plato believed that the transcendent ideas, visible only to the mind, were beautiful. We will look at the connection between beauty and social class (what I call \"beauty and the best\"), beauty and sexuality (including ancient Greek pederasty), and beauty and religion. With this as background, we will look at how ideas of beauty evolved and changed over the centuries, from the Renaissance to today. We will discuss the role of fashion in relation to beauty: is our modern notion of beauty wholly commercialized? Can we simply dismiss the contributions of such major designers as Coco Chanel or Balenciaga?     Readings for the course will include portions of David Konstan's book on beauty, and selections from Nancy Etcoff, The Survival of the Prettiest (1999); Ruby Blondell, Helen of Troy (2013); Gabrielle Starr, Feeling Beauty: The Neuroscience of Aesthetic Experience (2013); Wendy Steiner, Venus in Exile: The Rejection of Beauty in Twentieth-Century Art (2001); Plato's Symposium ; Roger Scruton, Beauty (2009); and Alexander Nehamas, The Promise of Happiness: The Place of Beauty in a World of Art (2007). Guest speakers will be invited as well, particularly from the world of fashion and art.     Convener:      David Konstan is Professor of Classics at New York University. Among the books he has published are Roman Comedy (1983); Sexual Symmetry: Love in the Ancient Novel and Related Genres (1994); Greek Comedy and Ideology (1995); Friendship in the Classical World (1997); Pity Transformed (2001); The Emotions of the Ancient Greeks: Studies in Aristotle and Classical Literature (2006), which was awarded the American Philological Association's Charles J. Goodwin Award of Merit; \"A Life Worthy of the Gods\": The Materialist Psychology of Epicurus (2008); Terms for Eternity: Aionios and Aidios in Classical and Christian Texts (with Ilaria Ramelli, 2007); and Before Forgiveness: The Origins of a Moral Idea (2010). His most recent book is Beauty: The Fortunes of an Ancient Greek Idea (2014). He has been awarded numerous grants, including the ACLS, NEH, and Guggenheim fellowships, and has taught in Egypt, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, and Scotland, among other places. He has served as president of the American Philological Association (1999), and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and Honorary Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities.                                             Return to top          Ditch the In-Class Lecture - Add Active Learning     The Program     Active learning refers to any course-related activity (in or out of class) that provides an opportunity for students to take a participatory role in learning. Practice, discussion, problem solving, and other active learning techniques serve to make knowledge more meaningful and memorable.     In active learning, students build on prior knowledge while working individually or in groups to integrate, evaluate, and apply new ideas and information. This process motivates students to be more fully engaged with course content and fosters a sense of personal responsibility for learning, which - as ample research demonstrates - directly correlates with successful academic performance. In contrast to more passive modes of learning, such as listening to lectures, meaningful activities can ensure that students feel ownership over their education by optimizing participation in the classroom.     This interactive seminar will provide a hands-on design experience with a variety of active learning strategies for students. In conjunction with readings and discussion, participants will have the opportunity to create their own active learning experiences using related technologies for education. Participants will also be encouraged to share the methods they develop with the group in order to receive feedback and learn from each other's insights.     By the end of the seminar, participants will be able to:            evaluate the relative effectiveness and use of various active learning strategies in their course;       apply various active learning strategies to their course;       design a lesson (or several) using active learning strategies; and       demonstrate and lead a discussion on how they plan to incorporate active learning strategies in their course.

Return to top            Globalization and the Making of Latin American Cities     Co-sponsored by the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York University     The Program     This seminar will examine current transformation space across Latin American cities involving rapid urbanization, the growth of neoliberal developments, and the transformation of creative industries and economies across the region. We will focus on post -1980s transformations, when we see new modes of globalization across the region that presented new openings, but also constraints with regards to the development of enclave urbanism, new types of segregation and new imaginaries of class and \"urban\" identities. Topics will include the rise of tourism and creative economies around art and media; Latin American urban design and new urbanisms; the neo-liberalization of labor and the rise of informal economies, and immigration. We also will touch on how Latin American immigration is transforming urban imaginaries in the major cities across the United States.       Readings will be drawn from geography, urban studies, anthropology and cultural studies.             Convener:     Arlene Davila is Professor of Anthropology and American Studies, She's author of Barrio Dreams: Puerto Ricans, Latinos and the Neoliberal City , (NYU Press), Culture Works: Space, Value and Mobility Across the Neoliberal Americas (NYU Press), and \"El Mall: The Spatial and Class Politics of Shopping Malls in Latin America\" In Contract with UC Press.                  Return to top                    Louis Armstrong and New Orleans Jazz: Musical and Cultural Significance     The Program     Jazz emerged from the New Orleans African American population during the turbulent 1890s as an exciting new dance music that also served as a metaphor for democracy. In its local role as a folk music, jazz was used in and for a wide variety of settings and activities. With its spread across America, jazz inspired the rebellious and free spirited 1920s \"Jazz Age\" generation. Although jazz became a commercial catch-all term that was swept up into the growing music business and dance craze, much authentic jazz was performed in northern nightclubs, where it was widely recorded and influenced new styles and generations of musicians.     New Orleans-born trumpeter and singer Louis Armstrong rose from a life of poverty and hardship to become the first major jazz soloist and also one of the most visible and influential figures in the history of American music and culture. His meteoric rise gained impetus during the 1920s in Chicago and New York, where he made a series of recordings that helped to change the direction of jazz and open new possibilities for musicians, composers and arrangers. As a singer his offbeat phrasing, scat singing and euphoric feeling influenced scores of vocalists into the present. The most musically and culturally significant parts of Armstrong's life can be divided into three periods, each marked by stylistic changes as well as shifting levels of fame and critical acceptance. There has been much discussion and controversy regarding Armstrong's style, image, film roles, repertoire, political views, importance and enduring legacy.     This seminar will include lecture and discussion, and will be supplemented by films, recordings, photographs, guests, live musical demonstration and a field trip. Assigned readings include three books on Louis Armstrong, as well as some of Professor White's publications, including: \"Traditional New Orleans Jazz as a Metaphor for American Life\" (available as a \"Foreseeable Futures\" publication on the Imagining America website: http//imaginingamerica.org/); \"Reflections of an Authentic Jazz Life in Pre-Katrina New Orleans\" in the Journal of American History (94, Dec. 2007); and \"Dr. Michael White: The Doc Paulin Years, 1975-79\" in the Tulane Jazz Archivist (vol. XXIII; 2010)        Convener:     Convener: Michael Gerard White is the Keller Endowed Chair in the Humanities at Xavier University in New Orleans where he has served as a professor of Spanish and African-American music for over 30 years. He studied the clarinet in high school and later learned jazz in brass band street parades, funerals and community events. He played alongside several dozen jazz musicians born between the late 1890s and 1910. White is highly visible on the jazz scene as a band leader, recording artist, composer, writer and lecturer. He has appeared on over 60 recordings, including several under his own name and also with a variety of artists like Wynton Marsalis, Beausoleil, Eric Clapton, Taj Mahal and Paul Simon. Dr. White has won numerous honor and awards, including the Chevalier of Arts and Letters from France, The NEH National Heritage Fellowship Award, the LEH Louisiana State Humanist of the Year Award, and the Tulane University President's Medal. He has recently completed producing and recording on a CD of New Orleans brass bands for the Smithsonian Institution.                                 Return to top               Reading Rigorously, Writing Eloquently&mdash;and Persuasively - Across Disciplines     The Program     Under the auspices of a Mellon Foundation grant, my work at Hendrix College for the last two years has focused on helping teachers in the disciplines learn new ways of teaching writing. Ten faculty members from Art History, African History, Psychology, Philosophy, English, and Creative Writing have taken up the task of teaching a rigorous essay course outside the confines of their own disciplines. Our faculty workshops and classroom teaching have dwelt on reading and representing complex written texts and experience, conceiving and substantiating ideas, and developing those ideas in essays that often run against the grain of argument. We have sought to concentrate on practices that rarely find their way into either composition texts or disciplinary classrooms. Instead of concentrating on proof, our written work has thrived on continual inquiry and revision, ideas rather than theses, and rigorous written conversations that aim to be inclusive as they reach out to embrace contradiction and complexity. The aim of our project has been to take new forms of public writing back into each of the represented disciplines.     Our summer workshop at NYU will draw its sustenance from this experimental work as we concern ourselves with the relationship between reading and conception, between reading and the inductive process, and between reading and writing. Our aim will be to improve our own pedagogy - even as we work together this summer - so that we can in turn improve our students' written expression.     A Story of Necessity     Almost a decade ago, I discovered that my students were paying primary attention only to the personal connections they could make with the assigned written texts; they showed little interest in the larger body of ideas or the way those ideas were presented. Their habits led to hasty conclusions about meaning--to an erasure of central parts of the text under consideration. Diverted by a thesis chase , they were looking for a single point instead of a network of complementary ideas.     Instead of learning to reason from evidence, most students had learned to take shortcuts, moving habitually from thesis to highly selective evidence - leaving out contradictions, challenges, complications. The learned emphasis had been not on the rigorous analysis of evidence but on a fact-based, highly structured response: thesis, proposition, and examples.     The examination of evidence rarely leads to certainty or to a thesis that can, out of necessity, be proved; it leads instead to discovery, to the rigorous combination and application of analysis and imagination, to ideas that must, like the evidence itself, be continually reassessed and re-conceptualized to represent more accurately whatever truth the evidence suggests to the researching writer. At the heart of this inductive process of discovery lies the complex business of reading complex written texts that do not reveal themselves to cursory examination.      For the writer, grappling with lively ideas leads eventually to clarification and the use of nuanced language, to a more complex form of expression than a formulaic set of declarations and a series of examples can provide. The act of writing - writing itself - is central to learning, just as the act of reading is central to writing.     The inductive process is, of course, the same process that leads to discovery in science or in any other academic discipline. It provides the foundation for making sense of research, no matter what the subject matter. Crucial to all academic work, we are left partially blind without it, unable to determine what the evidence means, unable to discover what we really have to say.     Convener:     Pat C.

Return to top            The Informatics Revolution: Using Data to Enhance Teaching Life Sciences     The Program     The recent Ebola outbreak underscores the challenges that infectious disease continues to raise in the world around us. Malaria kills roughly 600,000 people a year, and tuberculosis about twice as many. Closer to home, widespread overuse of antibiotics has provoked high levels of drug resistance in hospital-acquired infections, which are now also in the community. Key to confronting modern problems in biomedicine is the availability of powerful tools to investigate the molecular basis of disease as well as the complex biology of cells and organisms. Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing area that addresses the use of computers for the acquisition, management, and analysis of biological information. The explosion of interest in bioinformatics in the past few years has been driven by the tremendous growth of DNA sequencing technology. Huge repositories of sequence and structural information provide an amazing wealth of resources for researchers, teachers and students.     In this seminar, participants will become familiar with the bioinformatics-related databases that are available, and learn how to search them using modern software. We will emphasize how to use informatics to design course modules, class projects and case studies for students in biology, chemistry, public health, and environmental science.     This seminar is appropriate for faculty members in the natural sciences, health sciences, computer science, and mathematics. No prior programming experience is required.

Return to top          The Philosopher in the Marketplace: Market Morality and its Social Impact     The Program     This seminar will undertake a critical examination of how the marketplace embraces a morality that defines and governs the way transactions are conducted within its womb. Its tentacles are far reaching, insinuating themselves into the very fabric of the society that houses and nurtures it. These adopted values determine the content and direction of social policy, as well as our understanding of how the more general aspects of our commercial life should be contoured. On a personal level, it impacts upon notions of happiness and success, while playing a central role in the creation of our social image.     Our discussions will focus around the ways in which markets can and do crowd out morals, often leading to the cynicism expressed by social realists - those who see the moral assessment of markets and business as inappropriate, as if commercial enterprise gets a free pass from morally based critique. It will become apparent as a result of our investigations that those who hold \"business ethics\" as an oxymoron are not only mistaken, but also divisive in promoting such a stance.     As a sampling, our studies will include questions concerning the moral limits of markets, and the determination of what money can or cannot, should or should not buy, i.e.,            Should we be able to buy and sell human organs, to treat citizenship papers and college admissions as commodities to be subject to purchase, etc.?       What are the moral consequences of adopting a \"bottom line\" perception of business practice?       What is the moral impact of the employment of the fear factor in marketing?       Why do we buy what we buy?       Do we have any obligations to protect and enhance the environment, to consider matters of sustainability and the fate of future generations in making economically based decisions?       Are we morally obliged to consider the plight and well-being of persons unknown to us, inhabitants of countries we will never come to visit while making marketplace decisions?       Is there a moral component to the determination of the social and personal ideals that we aggressively market, ideals concerned with class, race, and gender as well as those concerned with personal image, i.e., stature, weight and personal choice?          Our scrutiny will inexorably lead us to confront the most serious issues faced by our society today, namely matters of social justice, the inordinately unbalanced distribution of wealth, and the values that drive how our national budgetary pie is cut. Undoubtedly, we will join Michael Sandel in pondering his ongoing concern that we as a society may very well be drifting from HAVING a market economy to BEING a market society.      Reference will be made to the following works, engaging in style and content: Michael Sandel's What Money Can't Buy and Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do ; John Rawls' A Theory of Justice ; William Irvine's On Desire: Why We Want What We Want ; Paul Bloom's How Pleasure Works: The New Science of Why We Like What We Like ; Daniel Gilbert's Stumbling on Happiness ; Geoffrey Miller's Spent: Sex, Evolution, and Consumer Behavior ; Tony Judt's Ill Fares the Land ; and Sissela Bok's Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life , to offer but an entree into the broad panorama of arenas touched by our concerns.

Return to top           Voices of Contemporary Islam        The Program     The religion of Islam has been at the center of political discourse in recent years. Issues of terrorism, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the debate over the proposed Park 51 Islamic Center, \"the Arab Spring\" and the rise of ISIS/ISIL in Iraq and Syria have focused attention on Muslims and their religion. The ways in which Islam has been discussed within the media and certain corners of the academy since the tragic and morally inexcusable events of September 11, 2001, have often been problematic. Over the last decade there has been a veritable explosion of books and articles on Islam, many of which decry what they see as a lack of intellectual debate and moral discourse in the Islamic world. Pundits on cable news networks continually assert \"it is a shame that there are no anti-terrorist, pro-democratic voices within Islam.\" These same opinions are also found in academic circles.     These kinds of opinions are at best rooted in ignorance and, at their worst, in prejudice and hostility. While it is true that there are \"fundamentalist\" voices within Islam that resist complex and multi-vocal interpretations of the basic sources of the tradition, they do not now, nor have they ever, represented the mainstream of Muslim thought. Islam has always maintained a variety of philosophical, theological and mystical expressions. It is Islam's diversity and ability to adapt to changing historical and cultural circumstances that is one of its primary characteristics and greatest strengths. Among the numerous problems and issues that have drawn the attention of today's Muslim intellectuals has been the rise to prominence of \"fundamentalists\" and \"Islamists\" willing to use violence to achieve their goals. Not only are \"traditional\" Muslims critiquing and challenging movements like the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and ISIS/ISIL as theologically incorrect readings of Qu'ran and hadith , but there are also vibrant \"progressive\" movements that draw upon feminist theory and liberation theology to develop radical new expressions of Muslim piety and political action.     This seminar will explore some of these crucial issues and debates in the contemporary Muslim world and present examples of diverse theological, political, and social thought. Issues to be examined will include the compatibility of Islam with democracy, the connections between Islam and terrorism, the role of Wahabism in the construction of contemporary Islamic movements, feminist movements within Islam, Islam and pluralism, and Sufism in the contemporary context. The course will introduce teachable primary sources, including writings by Khaled Abou Fadl, Amina Wadud, Osama bin Laden, and Michael Muhammad Knight, as well as varied \"Muslim Voices\" through selected films and literary works. Special attention will be focused on how to introduce complex and controversial issues in the classroom. Core texts may include: Progressive Muslims on Justice, Gender and Pluralism (Omid Safi, ed.); Tariq Ramadan's In the Footsteps of the Prophet: Lessons from the Life of Muhammad ; and Fatemeh Keshavarz' Jasmine and Stars: Reading More than Lolita in Tehran .

Return to top           Women and the Civil Rights Movement in the United States     The Program     Before the publication in 1993 of the pioneering text, Women in the Civil Rights Movement: Trailblazers and Torchbearers, 1941-1965 (edited by Vicki Crawford et al.), historical studies of women's contributions to the most important freedom struggle in the 20th century in the United States were virtually non-existent. There is now a growing body of scholarship, autobiographies, memoirs, children's books, and documentaries that analyze and capture the pivotal role of Black and white women, in particular, during the civil rights and Black power movements of the fifties, sixties, and seventies.     Using a variety of texts and films, this seminar will explore the important roles of women in various freedom struggles and analyze the gendered nature of the civil rights movement (CRM). Employing Black feminist theoretical frameworks, we will revisit \"the Movement\" and discuss the silences, absences, erasures, and distortions that characterize dominant narratives about contemporary Black liberation struggles that fall under the rubric of \"the civil rights movement.\" Texts to be studied include Belinda Robnett's How Long? How Long?: African American Women in the Struggle for Civil Rights/Black Power , which examines the movement from the vantage point of social movement theory; Lynn Olson's Freedom's Daughters: The Unsung Heroines of the Civil Rights Movement from 1830-1970 ; Danielle McGuire's At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape and Resistance: A New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power , which is a revisionist history of the iconic figure Parks, as well as a reimagining of the CRM; Peter Ling's and Sharon Monteith's Gender and the Civil Rights Movement ; and Hands on the Freedom Plow: Personal Accounts by Women in SNCC , edited by Faith S. Holsaert and others. Documentaries to be viewed include \"Reflections Unheard: Black Women in Civil Rights\" by Nevline Nnaji and \"Mountains That Take Wing: Angela Davis and Yuri Kochiyama, A Conversation on Life, Struggles and Liberation\" by C.A. Griffith and H. L.T. Quan.

She is past president of the National Women's Studies Association (NWSA). Along with her co-editors, she published the first anthology of Black women's literature, Sturdy Black Bridges: Visions of Black Women in Literature . Her recent books include Gender Talk: The Struggle for Women's Equality in African American Communities (with Johnnetta Betsch Cole) and Still Brave: The Evolution of Black Women's Studies (with Stanlie M. James and Frances Smith Foster). In progress is a study of the radical politics of Coretta Scott King.                    Return to top             World Cinema Through Global Genres     The Program     McLuhan's vision of the global village has never been more compelling than it is today. The world in which our students are coming of age - and which they are helping to create - calls for greater international understanding and cooperation. One way to give students greater access to lives and cultures beyond our national borders is through the window of world cinema. Movies have a way of making history, geography, and demographics come alive, transforming statistics and abstractions into compelling human stories. But movies made in different languages in other countries are not always readily accessible. Strange customs, unfamiliar faces, and subtitles can cloud the window.     This seminar explores a new approach to teaching about world cultures through film genres. By starting with familiar Hollywood film forms (action, horror, road movies, wedding films) and tracing their origins and influences abroad (horror in Japan and Italy, kung fu in Hong Kong, wuxia pian in mainland China, wedding films in India, road movies in Latin America), students get to widen their experience of other film traditions and the cultures that produce them. By studying the cultural flows and cross-currents shaping our most popular global genres, they can form a deeper appreciation not only of the films and their stories, but also of the people, societies, and beliefs behind these films - people, societies, and beliefs they will be encountering in one form or another throughout their lives.     Teachers and scholars from a variety of disciplines are invited to apply. Together, we will look at film clips and selected feature films from the perspectives of history, social institutions, economics, and aesthetics. Our method will be interactive and participatory, with a focus on direct application to each participant's curriculum.         Coordinator:     William Costanzo is a SUNY Distinguished Teaching Professor of English and Film and has taught courses in writing, literature, and film studies at Westchester Community College since 1970. A graduate of Columbia University, Dr. Costanzo has published six books on writing and film, including Reading the Movies (revised for Kindle, 2014), Great Films and How to Teach Them (NCTE, 2004), The Writer's Eye (McGraw-Hill), and World Cinema Through Global Genres (Wiley Blackwell, 2014). He is active in the Society for Cinema and Media Studies, where he serves on the Teaching Committee and has recently co-edited a dossier on \"New Approaches to Teaching World Cinema.\"                       Return to top           Yellow Peril !!! &ndash; Understanding Xenophobia     The Program        Fears of \"yellow peril\" (and brown \"turban tides\") run deep in the present and past of U.S. political and commercial culture. The stories and imagery of \"yellow peril\" are just beneath the surface of everyday discourse and always latent&mdash;readily triggered by an incident, real or fabricated. Fabricated WMDs, SARS fears, charges of Chinese \"pirating\" of U.S. cultural properties, the racial profiling of \"Arab-looking\" peoples, and claims that Asians are \"taking over\" U.S. higher education all illustrate contemporary forms of Asian \"peril.\" And most recently, amidst the Snowden NSA disclosures, there are regular charges of relentless \"Chinese hacking,\" as if the U.S. is an innocent victim. Americans are woefully unaware of this scapegoating tradition and its paranoid history, and consequently remain particularly vulnerable to its ideological and affective power.         The stakes of understanding \"yellow peril\" (Islamophobia and related) fears are high for the future of our nation. There is a need to cultivate more rigorous understanding across cultural differences, and discover our shared humanity. Fundamental epistemological questions of knowledge are at stake. How do we know what we know? And how are we, systematically, made unaware? How do \"yellow peril\" fears distract us from the real dialogues and real issues that must take place? Despite the explosive developments in so many cities and nations of Asia, the U.S. people are still fundamentally unaware of Asian countries, where they are, the languages they speak, the religions they practice and the types of governments they have.        Seminar participants will explore what can and must be done to counter these fallacies and practices. In addition to readings, discussion, and online materials, the seminar will involve visits to exhibitions and archives, such as the Museum of Chinese in America, the National Archives Records Administration at the Customs House, and New York University's Fales and Tamiment Libraries. Guest speakers may include Dylan Yeats (co-author and editor with Dr. Tchen of Yellow Peril! An Archive of Anti-Asian Fear , 2014) and documentary filmmakers Ric Burns and Li-Shin Yu (whose upcoming PBS American Experience documentary is on the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act).                                              Convener:     Jack (John Kuo Wei) Tchen is a historian, curator and dumpster diver, whose interests include understanding the multiple presents, pasts, and futures of New York City, trans-local cross-cultural communications, unpacking archives and archival absences, and practices of dialogue-driven pedagogy. Professor Tchen is the founding director of the A/P/A (Asian/Pacific/American) Studies Program and Institute at New York University and co-founded the Museum of Chinese in America in 1979-80, where he continues to serve as senior historian. Jack was awarded the Charles S. Frankel Prize from the National Endowment for the Humanities (renamed The National Medal of Humanities). He is author of the award-winning books New York before Chinatown: Orientalism and the Shaping of American Culture, 1776-1882 and Genthe's Photographs of San Francisco's Old Chinatown, 1895-1905 .

By tracing the shadow of Irish language literary traditions in and alongside the emerging Irish literary traditions in English, we will consider the interplay of literature and national identity, and the role of literature and other forms of print culture in a variety of social processes, including politicization, the language shift, and textual representations of violence, domestic life, cultural memory, national and international economy, and forms of agency. Major authors including Jonathan Swift, Bishop Berkeley, Edmund Burke, Maria Edgeworth, Sydney Owenson, Thomas Moore, Samuel Ferguson, and James Clarence Mangan are considered, as well as the development of Irish forms of poetry, drama, and prose in English. It is the aim of the course to give students a detailed grasp of Irish literary history before the cataclysmic social changes wrought by the Irish famine, and to introduce students to the concepts and terminology employed in contemporary Irish literary scholarship.

At a time when cinema itself is migrating from analogue to digital, many of the most important writers and directors are preoccupied by questions of invisibility, dematerialization and disappearance. Spectres of Marx; revenant marginals; the ghosts of industrial towns, political utopias and migrant labour: this class \u2013 covering a diverse range of intellectual and aesthetic approaches \u2013 will include pulpy TV dramas, gallery films, experimental documentaries. The work of directors such as Jeremy Deller, Derek Jarman, John Akomfrah/ Black Audio Film Collective, Nigel (Quatermass and the Pit) Kneale will be examined alongside music (Zomby, record labels such as Ghost Box and Mordant Music), and critical/ imaginative writings by Simon Reynolds, Tom McCarthy, Hito Steyerl.

Readings will include basic texts by Saussure, Barthes, Bakhtin, Derrida, Althusser, Lacan, Foucault, and Fanon. Philosophical tradition from Hegel to Freud will contextualize what is a single movement of thought defined by continuity rather than by ruptures. The course will begin and end with literary texts, including Shakespeare, to measure what the theoretical tradition brings to both practical criticism and literary and cultural history. Open to both graduate students and advanced undergraduates.      Engl.GA.2075.001   Individualizing Writing: Journal Publication: Seminar/Workshop    John Maynard   Thursday 6:20-8:20pm \u2013 244 Green Street, Room 306   This seminar/workshop is about moving graduate work toward publication quality. Participants should have at least one paper that they wish to develop up to the level appropriate for a publishable journal article--usually a matter of further thinking and research, followed by revision. The course develops students\u2019 critical abilities in each aspect of this process: conceptualization, research base, critical approach, enhancements (photos, graphs, etc.), organization, finish. Students will prepare evaluations of each other\u2019s work in the various areas of critique and work together to find better ideas and information to develop their articles; they will then revise their own work for re-submission, further critique and, if necessary, further revision.   Developing students\u2019 critical abilities as they assess their own and other students\u2019 writing is the immediate object of the seminar. Excellence in work to be submitted for publication will be the individual student\u2019s goal. The seminar/workshop should be useful in developing similar skills in writing and revising dissertation chapters and in revising the completed dissertation for publication as articles and/or a book.   Open to Ph.D and second year M.A. students.

Workshop activities will include discussing and critiquing pre-circulated papers or works-in-progress presented by NYU faculty, visiting scholars, and members of the Workshop; learning and practicing the protocols for submitting papers for conferences and various forms of publication, and for writing grant proposals; designing teaching strategies; and discovering and experimenting with new research tools. In all of these activities Workshop participants will also engage with overarching issues of concern to the field such as the benefits and limitations of periodization and the role of Medieval and Renaissance Studies in the academy and in society at large. Enrollment in the Workshop for two semesters, preferably over the course of one academic year, is a requirement for the Concentration in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, but the Workshop is also open to students who are not pursuing the Concentration, and all students working in the Middle Ages and Renaissance are welcome to attend the Workshop even if they are not enrolled in it as a course.      Engl.GA.2323.001   Law and Shakespeare    John Archer   Tuesday 3:30-5:30pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 306   How can the plays and poems of Shakespeare help introduce us both to the history of law in the Anglo-American and Roman civil-law traditions and to current theories about law and political power? Beginning with legal history and comic drama, our seminar will compare common law and equity in England as rival systems that place competing versions of the public good (inheritance as common wealth, and commonwealth as state power) above particular interests. Then, through a range of tragedies and late tragicomedies, we will consider different versions of \u201cpolitical theology\u201d in the Renaissance, that is, the place of the sovereign both inside and outside divine, natural and human concepts of law. We will read a selection of Shakespeare\u2019s works along with a critical article or two each week. The plays may include The Comedy of Errors, Romeo and Juliet, The Merchant of Venice, Measure for Measure, King Lear and The Tempest. Theorists and critics include Giorgio Agamben, Lorna Hutson, Paul Raffield, and Julia Reinhard Lupton. Previous reading in either the historical context for literature from the medieval period forward or in literary theory is highly recommended for enrollment in this seminar. A presentation and two research papers will make up the grade along with informed and lively class participation.      Engl.GA.2450.001   Narrative Strategies    Mary Poovey   TBA   This course examines the strategies used to launch, develop, and bring narratives to a close. The primary goal is to develop descriptive and analytic tools for understanding and using these narrative strategies. The course engages a range of genres in several media forms: short stories, poems, literary criticism and theory, historical writing, autobiography, print journalism, a TV series, film, and several digital genres. Most of the course\u2019s texts were originally published, released, or broadcast in the U.K. or U. S. between 1800 and the present. The topics we will address include: getting things going in medias res, the mythic origins of \u201conce upon a time,\u201d serialization, foreshadowing, the use and abuse of cliff hangers, the layering and juxtaposition of characters and themes, tying up loose ends, white space and silence, interruptions both planned and unplanned, and the modes of attention elicited by print and digital texts.      Engl.GA.2661.001   Victorian Studies: Ekphrastic Imperialism: Image and Other from Tennyson to Forster    Jeff Spear   Thursday 3:30-5:30pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 306   The starting point for the seminar will be the work of W.J.T. Mitchell and other contemporary critics who have expanded Ekphrasis from a very specific category (the verbal creation, or recreation, of a work of visual art) into a more inclusive, even aggressive mode. Mitchell\u2019s exposition focuses on gender questions; but, he argues: \u201cgender is not the unique key to the workings of ekphrasis, but only one among many figures of difference that energize the dialectic of the imagetext.\u201d We will explore that proposition beginning with the poetic tradition from Tennyson and Browning down to poets of the nineties such as Arthur Symons and \u201cMichael Field.\u201d We will also \u201cread\u201d Victorian paintings that contain or interpret texts. The ekphrastic horror show will take up the rhetoric of \u201cdegeneration\u201d and compare ekphrastic scenes from such works as Dracula with Symbolist art. Our consideration of the racial other will begin with the representation of the Jew and include two weeks on Daniel Deronda as a text that combines ekphrastic representation of race, and gender with the question of whether or not there can be a musical analogue to ekphrasis. Finally we will explore the colonial other. Beginning with an exploration of colonial photography, we will move on to Wilde\u2019s Salome and the figure of the \u201cdancing girl,\u201d including Kipling stories and a revisionist look backward by the playwright Tripurari Sharma: \u201cA Tale from the Year 1857: Azizun Nisa; a translation of her San Sattawan ka Qissa: Azizun Nisa. We will consider the figure of the \u201cBabu\u201d as configured by Kipling with selected Indian texts and Kalighat painting. We will conclude with Tagore\u2019s The Home and the World and Forster\u2019s A Passage to India, which records the failure of reconciliation and, paradoxically, a collapse of visual and verbal signification that names the uncreating word.      Engl.GA.2838.001   19th Century African American Lit    Elizabeth McHenry   Thursday 10:00am-12:00pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 306   This course examines the development of black literary expression in the nineteenth century United States by reading a diverse selection of texts. Through novels, slave narratives, autobiographies and memoirs, speeches and journalism we will trace the dynamic circulation and transmission of ideas by African Americans, free and slave, as well as the relationship between cultural production and historical phenomena. We will pay particular attention to the ways that African Americans negotiated and troubled the divide between history and fictional forms, and how their fictions worked to produce alternative understandings of national history and civil liberty than that which had emerged from the \u201cfounding fathers.\u201d The second part of the semester will take up post-emancipation literature: why, we will ask, did black authors return their readers to antebellum slavery in the post-bellum years seemingly at the very moment they wished to cultivate their imagine as \u201cnew Negroes\u201d and self-consciously create a Negro literature with a lasting impact in the twentieth century? How did African Americans negotiate through language and in literary terms the competing and contested concerns of heritage and historical memory, on the one hand, with the deterioration of race relations and rise of slavery\u2019s legacy of racial thought in the years W.E.B. Du Bois famously identified with the \u201cproblem of the color line\u201d? The course takes on these questions, exploring how black literature engages with the politics of cultural identity formation, notions of freedom, citizenship, and aesthetic forms.      Engl.GA.2900.001   Literary Dictatorships    Jini Watson   Thursday 1:00-3:00pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 105   This seminar explores representations of dictatorships in postcolonial literature, film and theory. How have fictional texts reflected upon and narrated the emergence of authoritarian regimes, especially in relation to decolonization and its liberation struggles? How might they help us move beyond the tired paradigms of failed states and \u201cmad\u201d third-world dictators? How might such texts attempt to counter or resist the monopoly of meaning held by an oppressive regime? Can we talk of a narrative genre of dictatorship literature as a kind of \u201cworld literature\u201d?   Framing our analyses with Hannah Arendt\u2019s seminal work on totalitarianism and Frantz Fanon\u2019s early account of neocolonialism, we will engage with a range of imaginative texts that respond to and figure emergencies, coups and dictatorships. Our corpus draws from Africa, Latin America, East and South Asia, and our task will be to investigate and compare representations of the rise of authoritarian regimes, the dictator figure, everyday life under states of emergency, tropes of resistance and complicity, and psychic and social constructions of power. We will also consider questions of narrative form, structure and genre, in particular, the use of allegory, humor, the grotesque, and various modes of realism.   Likely fictional texts include works by: V. S. Naipaul, Raoul Peck, Nuruddin Farah, Julia Alvarez, Rohinton Mistry, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o, Jessica Hagedorn, and Yi Mun-yol. Relevant theoretical readings that will help us consider issues of sovereignty, authority, violence, gender and the nation-state will draw from Achille Mbembe, Giorgio Agamben, Rajeswari Sunder Rajan, David Scott, Mahmood Mamdani and others. The course\u2019s broader objective will be to raise questions about what the study of dictatorship literatures can tell us about contemporary issues of power and sovereignty. If imaginative texts offer us access to new conceptualizations of power, how might the political be construed in and through literary and aesthetic regimes?   While some background in postcolonial literary studies is desirable but not necessary, a willingness to engage rigorously with theoretical texts and to read widely across genres, disciplines and geographies is a must.      Engl.GA.2917.001   International Modernism    Peter Nicholls   Monday 1:00-3:00pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 306   The course will explore some canonical works of Anglo-American literary modernism in relation to the developments in European writing that frequently provided their context and instigation. Texts studied may include works by Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarm\u00e9, Val\u00e9ry, Proust, Marinetti, Pound, Joyce, Eliot, Lewis, Stein, Tzara, Brecht, Breton, Aragon, Rilke, Artaud, Pessoa, Brecht, Kafka, Borges and Beckett. We shall consider problems of translation and transmission (the publication of Joyce\u2019s Work in Progress in transition, for example), and we shall pursue some of the connections between the work of modernist writers and philosophers (e.g., Proust/Lewis/Bergson, Rilke/ Heidegger, and Beckett/Adorno). All works will be read in English translation.      Engl.GA.2927.001   Postwar Visual Poetics    Lytle Shaw   Monday 3:30-5:30pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 105   This course examines the generative traffic between the categories of art and experimental writing from the early 1950s to the present within an international context. To set the scene we will spend several weeks considering New York School poets\u2019 take on Abstract Expressionism in relation to dominant critical accounts; then we will move through subsequent developments between and across the disciplines by dividing them into five loose headings: minimalism and conceptualism; concrete poetry; Fluxus and performance, site-specificity; institutional critique. Writers will include O\u2019Hara, Ashbery, Schuyler, Brainard, Pignatari, the de Campos brothers, Gomringer, Finlay, Fahlstrom, Coolidge, Mayer, Watten, Mac Low, Knowles, Eigner, Robertson, Darragh, Howe, Silliman, Cha, Farrell, Davies and Bernstein. Artists: Pollock, de Kooning, Rauschenberg, Johns, Warhol, Broodthaers, Judd, Morris, Andre, Smithson, Acconci, Piper, Graham, Kelley, McCarthy, Laderman Ukeles, Green and Dion. Critics: Rosenberg, Greenberg, Fried, Kotz, Krauss, Buchloh. The course will also trouble these neat categories of writer, artist and critic.      Engl.GA.2971.001   Practicum in Digital Humanities   Deena Engel and Marion Thain   Monday 6:00-8:00pm; Lab Tuesday 1:00-3:00pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 105   The interface of technology and the humanities represents a key to the future, yet many students feel they lack the skills to access this potential. This course offers an introduction to web development and digital publication especially created for students in the Humanities, with a view to equipping you with knowledge foundational for reflective engagement with the new media of literary creation and dissemination. Students will survey the principles of current technologies and apply them through practice as they learn the skills and techniques for formatting and publishing archival materials in a web-based environment. The course builds towards the creation of a digital edition, giving you the opportunity to work with primary source materials available through NYU's rich archival collections (these include a wide variety of printed texts, manuscripts and images from which to select according to your interests).   The course will consist of a traditional classroom lecture and discussion format as well as computer lab sessions to promote and assist students as they work on each of their three projects in this course. Each student will have an account on a production webserver to post their work and learn to install and configure a Wordpress site specifically tailored to his or her primary source materials. Topics and assigned projects will begin with an introduction to mark-up languages and building a site of related web pages followed by a project centered on encoding and annotating digital texts for scholarly purposes. The final project involves photographing or scanning, transcribing, and encoding digital texts to build an on-line archive, which has the potential to be published and housed on a server as a lasting contribution to the world of online open-access scholarship.      Engl.GA.2980.001   MA Proseminar: Introduction to Advanced Literary Study    Maureen McLane   Tuesday 4:00-6:00pm \u2013 19 University Place, Room 305   What is Literature? Why study \u201cit\u201d? How study \u201cit\u201d? Does \u201cliterature\u201d exist? How has it been, how is it now, and how might it yet be studied, imagined, engaged, and/or critiqued? And how might advanced literary study be inflected by other advanced studies\u2014of, for example, media history and ecology, book history, historiography, the human sciences (linguistics, psychoanalysis, anthropology)? This course offers a series of intense experimental gambits: with assigned readings in a variety of methodological and theoretical keys, from a range of historical periods, we will begin to consider where literary study has been, where it is, and where it might be going. We will engage the pleasure of the text and the rigor of the text and may confront as well the displeasure of the text: our task will be to register each of these possibilities.      Engl.GA.2980.002   MA Proseminar: Introduction to Advanced Literary Study    Juliet Fleming   Wednesday 11:00am-1:00pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 105   Criticism Practical and Impractical.   Practical criticism is a method of close reading designed to enhance our responsiveness to what we read. It develops a knowledge of literary forms, and provides technical language for describing the ways in which writers achieve their effects. As prescribed by I. A. Richards in the 1920s it treats literature as something separate from social and economic spheres and from the personal concerns of its author: had you taken an exam prepared by the followers of Richards at Cambridge you would have been required to produce a close analysis of, organised response to, and finally judgement of three pieces of literary writing that were unnamed and undated. Part of the work of this seminar will be to prepare you for (a modified version of) that exam -- and, beyond that, for a career founded upon your skills of close reading and your ability to recognise the presence and consequences of literary forms, metres, punctuation, rhyme schemes, diction, syntax and layout. In every meeting we will practice reading, talking and writing about literary forms. The other part of our work will be to familiarise ourselves with a different type of close-reading, one that is famously not a method, and that eschews the pleasures of judgment. Deconstruction is the unsatisfactory name for what is, above all, a heightened commitment to reading -- one that refuses the limits of any criticism that would be practical but that nevertheless offers a profound education in thinking about literary texts. Throughout the semester we will use Derrida's writing to lighten, baffle, enrich and deflect our own developing attempts at literary analysis and judgment.   Requirements: regular attendance at and informed participation in each class, four short (3 page) papers and -- of course, but don't panic -- a final exam.      Engl.GA.2980.003   MA Proseminar: Introduction to Advanced Literary Study    Pat Crain   Wednesday 3:30-5:30pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 306   Drawing for much of our work on the genre of the tale, a nineteenth-century mass-market print commodity and an object of extensive theoretical and critical writing in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, this seminar brings to the surface the sometimes suppressed or embarrassed questions of how we read, what we read for, and what we imagine and strive for in our own writing. What are our objects and our objectives? Critical, historical, and theoretical texts will help us to think about essential concepts and practices\u2014\u201cauthor,\u201d \u201cmedia,\u201d \u201creading,\u201d \u201carchive,\u201d \u201cdigital,\u201d \u201cprint culture,\u201d for some examples\u2014and engage current conversations about them.   Your answer to the seminar\u2019s large baggy questions will take the form of collaborative and individual exercises and experiments as well a (trim and elegant) essay on a text of your choosing (on or off the syllabus), worked through in stages during the term. Hands-on sessions in Bobst and in Fales special collections will help to hone research skills.      Engl.GA.3323.001   Renaissance Mediaology    John Guillory and Juliet Fleming   Monday 11:00-1:00pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 306   In this course, we will inquire into the various forms of Renaissance writing from the perspective of recent media theory. We will read examples of Renaissance writing in the full range of their materializations, including both oral and written, manuscript and print, and even supposedly ephemeral forms of writing such as marginalia and grafitti. Against the background of this vast cosmos of writing, canonical works of literature appear as a rarified form of writing, only a tiny fraction of that universe. Accordingly we will study not only familiar canonical works of literature but the generic and material forms of literary transmission, such as ballads, songs, woodcuts, prints, anthologies, letters, pamplets, sermons, treatises, lectures, and stage plays. We are especially interested in revisiting the \u201cprint revolution\u201d as the \u201cremediation\u201d of writing, and to focus rigorous historical and theoretical attention on print as a medium that changed the status and function of writing in early modern England. During the sixteenth century the development of print technology re-drew writing's relations with speech, and directed its potencies into new cultural and institutional locations.   Alongside the primary texts of the course, we will be reading works in media and print theory, including McLuhan, Derrida, Ong, Chartier, Eisenstein, Adrian Johns, Peter Stallybras, Ann Blair and others.      Engl.GA.3536.001   History of System    Cliff Siskin   Monday 3:30-5:30pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 306   As part of his proposal to advance knowledge (1605), Francis Bacon drew up a wish list of 130 different histories that had to be written. But the one he was particularly worried about as being particularly deficient was \u201cLiterary History.\u201d As the history of the literary in its formerly broad sense of learning, Bacon imagined it as a \u201cstory of learning\u201d that would track \u201cthe kinds of learning and arts that have flourished and decayed in various parts of the world at various times\u201d in order to \"make men wise in the use and administration of knowledge.\" We will compare this story to the one we tell in English Departments. For those of you seeking period coverage of the latter, our reading list of the literary in both senses of the term will start with Bacon and Galileo, mine the long 18th century, and venture into the present. Our touchstone will be the form that writing and learning assumed with increasing frequency during those periods--\"system.\" For everyone's practical benefit in getting their own work done, we will also take a second cue from Bacon--his emphasis on new tools. Developed by one of your predecessors in the doctoral program, Mark Algee-Hewitt, I call this novum organon \"Tectonics.\" Drawing from our databases, such as EEBO and ECCO, this practice, by mapping historical adjacencies of words and concepts, identifies and visualizes the conditions of possibility that enabled earlier changes in knowledge--and that might speak to how those changes are changing today. [To add to your repertoire for producing long-form knowledge--such as theses and dissertations--we'll also run a voluntary lab on the Kindle as a research instrument.]      Engl.GA.3900.001   Marxist Philosophies of Language    Robert Young   Tuesday 3:30-5:30pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 105   The language question has been a recurrent conundrum within Marxist philosophy since Marx himself. What is a Marxist philosophy of language, or what could it be? Can language be revolutionary? Can language be controlled by the state or is an anarchic, demotic force? What should a materialist analysis of language involve? What is the relation of language, and literary language, to class, and to class conflict? What is its relation to questions of gender and race? To what extent can language be analysed as an ideological form, as a phenomenon of the superstructure? If so, how can the language of analysis separate itself from its object? In this course we shall be both examining Marxist theories of language, and also considering other philosophies and theories of language, for example Saussure, ideas of language families, and of standard languages, from a Marxist perspective. Our reading should include books or essays by Karl Marx, Valentin Volosinov, Mikhail Bakhtin, Roman Jakobson, Nikolai Troubetzkoy, Walter Benjamin, Antonio Gramsci, Joseph Stalin, Nicholai Marr, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Julia Kristeva, Michel Foucault, Pierre Calvet, Jacques Derrida, Pier Paolo Pasoloni, and Jacques Ranci\u00e8re.

We will introduce, evaluate and develop various service learning pedagogical strategies that have proven to be effective and impactful upon students and their community partners. The seminar will demonstrate how service learning can be embedded within Living and Learning communities. The socio-historical and cultural patterns of gendering justice that have disenfranchised, silenced or diminished the voices and experiences of women and girls will frame the service learning approaches. The seminar will examine service learning pedagogical strategies that connect students to communities of women and girls who have been subject to social, legal and/or political policies that have served to diminish their basic human rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.     Special attention will be given to how to develop courses that include a service learning component, and that are based upon a social justice model that focuses on the lived experiences of women and girls. The intentional design of service learning courses that recognize the various intersectional experiences of women and girls as their identities are constructed and responded to based on race, class, gender, sexual preference, and cultural markers will govern the seminar discussions and experiences.        Convener:     Cynthia Spence is an associate professor of sociology at Spelman College and director of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF)/Mellon Programs.

Return to top              Beauty: The Fortunes and Transformations of an Ancient Greek Idea     The Program     Beauty is a trillion dollar business, an icon of desirability (just look at any advertisement, whether for cars, watches, or ice cream), an object of criticism by feminists and moralists, a threat (the \"femme fatale\"), an exalted spiritual quality (for example, the beauty of the Virgin Mary), and a key term in aesthetics, much debated but still at the core of our response to art in every form. But what is beauty? Is it a universal idea, hard-wired in our systems as a result of evolution (cf. the popular book The Survival of the Prettiest )? Is it an intrinsically sexist notion (why do we call women \"beautiful\" or \"pretty\" but call men \"handsome\")? Why do we think of princesses as beautiful? Does beauty vary from one culture to another - and are there societies that do not have a conception of beauty, or at least no conceptions that resemble our own? And what about art - is the beauty of a work of art like that of a beautiful woman? Can a painting of a repulsive object be beautiful?      It is widely agreed that ancient Greece set the tone for modern conceptions of beauty; as Michael Squire has written, \"like it or not - and there have been many reasons for not liking it - antiquity has supplied the mould for all subsequent attempts to figure and figure out the human body.\" So we will begin by examining how beauty was conceived in classical antiquity: in Greece, in Rome, and in the Bible. We shall consider the close connection between beauty and desire, and ask why Plato believed that the transcendent ideas, visible only to the mind, were beautiful. We will look at the connection between beauty and social class (what I call \"beauty and the best\"), beauty and sexuality (including ancient Greek pederasty), and beauty and religion. With this as background, we will look at how ideas of beauty evolved and changed over the centuries, from the Renaissance to today. We will discuss the role of fashion in relation to beauty: is our modern notion of beauty wholly commercialized? Can we simply dismiss the contributions of such major designers as Coco Chanel or Balenciaga?     Readings for the course will include portions of David Konstan's book on beauty, and selections from Nancy Etcoff, The Survival of the Prettiest (1999); Ruby Blondell, Helen of Troy (2013); Gabrielle Starr, Feeling Beauty: The Neuroscience of Aesthetic Experience (2013); Wendy Steiner, Venus in Exile: The Rejection of Beauty in Twentieth-Century Art (2001); Plato's Symposium ; Roger Scruton, Beauty (2009); and Alexander Nehamas, The Promise of Happiness: The Place of Beauty in a World of Art (2007). Guest speakers will be invited as well, particularly from the world of fashion and art.     Convener:      David Konstan is Professor of Classics at New York University. Among the books he has published are Roman Comedy (1983); Sexual Symmetry: Love in the Ancient Novel and Related Genres (1994); Greek Comedy and Ideology (1995); Friendship in the Classical World (1997); Pity Transformed (2001); The Emotions of the Ancient Greeks: Studies in Aristotle and Classical Literature (2006), which was awarded the American Philological Association's Charles J. Goodwin Award of Merit; \"A Life Worthy of the Gods\": The Materialist Psychology of Epicurus (2008); Terms for Eternity: Aionios and Aidios in Classical and Christian Texts (with Ilaria Ramelli, 2007); and Before Forgiveness: The Origins of a Moral Idea (2010). His most recent book is Beauty: The Fortunes of an Ancient Greek Idea (2014). He has been awarded numerous grants, including the ACLS, NEH, and Guggenheim fellowships, and has taught in Egypt, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, and Scotland, among other places. He has served as president of the American Philological Association (1999), and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and Honorary Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities.                                             Return to top          Ditch the In-Class Lecture - Add Active Learning     The Program     Active learning refers to any course-related activity (in or out of class) that provides an opportunity for students to take a participatory role in learning. Practice, discussion, problem solving, and other active learning techniques serve to make knowledge more meaningful and memorable.     In active learning, students build on prior knowledge while working individually or in groups to integrate, evaluate, and apply new ideas and information. This process motivates students to be more fully engaged with course content and fosters a sense of personal responsibility for learning, which - as ample research demonstrates - directly correlates with successful academic performance. In contrast to more passive modes of learning, such as listening to lectures, meaningful activities can ensure that students feel ownership over their education by optimizing participation in the classroom.     This interactive seminar will provide a hands-on design experience with a variety of active learning strategies for students. In conjunction with readings and discussion, participants will have the opportunity to create their own active learning experiences using related technologies for education. Participants will also be encouraged to share the methods they develop with the group in order to receive feedback and learn from each other's insights.     By the end of the seminar, participants will be able to:            evaluate the relative effectiveness and use of various active learning strategies in their course;       apply various active learning strategies to their course;       design a lesson (or several) using active learning strategies; and       demonstrate and lead a discussion on how they plan to incorporate active learning strategies in their course.

Participants should plan on bringing their laptops to this seminar.                               Return to top            Globalization and the Making of Latin American Cities     Co-sponsored by the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York University     The Program     This seminar will examine current transformation space across Latin American cities involving rapid urbanization, the growth of neoliberal developments, and the transformation of creative industries and economies across the region. We will focus on post -1980s transformations, when we see new modes of globalization across the region that presented new openings, but also constraints with regards to the development of enclave urbanism, new types of segregation and new imaginaries of class and \"urban\" identities. Topics will include the rise of tourism and creative economies around art and media; Latin American urban design and new urbanisms; the neo-liberalization of labor and the rise of informal economies, and immigration. We also will touch on how Latin American immigration is transforming urban imaginaries in the major cities across the United States.       Readings will be drawn from geography, urban studies, anthropology and cultural studies.             Convener:     Arlene Davila is Professor of Anthropology and American Studies, She's author of Barrio Dreams: Puerto Ricans, Latinos and the Neoliberal City , (NYU Press), Culture Works: Space, Value and Mobility Across the Neoliberal Americas (NYU Press), and \"El Mall: The Spatial and Class Politics of Shopping Malls in Latin America\" In Contract with UC Press.                  Return to top                    Louis Armstrong and New Orleans Jazz: Musical and Cultural Significance     The Program     Jazz emerged from the New Orleans African American population during the turbulent 1890s as an exciting new dance music that also served as a metaphor for democracy. In its local role as a folk music, jazz was used in and for a wide variety of settings and activities. With its spread across America, jazz inspired the rebellious and free spirited 1920s \"Jazz Age\" generation. Although jazz became a commercial catch-all term that was swept up into the growing music business and dance craze, much authentic jazz was performed in northern nightclubs, where it was widely recorded and influenced new styles and generations of musicians.     New Orleans-born trumpeter and singer Louis Armstrong rose from a life of poverty and hardship to become the first major jazz soloist and also one of the most visible and influential figures in the history of American music and culture. His meteoric rise gained impetus during the 1920s in Chicago and New York, where he made a series of recordings that helped to change the direction of jazz and open new possibilities for musicians, composers and arrangers. As a singer his offbeat phrasing, scat singing and euphoric feeling influenced scores of vocalists into the present. The most musically and culturally significant parts of Armstrong's life can be divided into three periods, each marked by stylistic changes as well as shifting levels of fame and critical acceptance. There has been much discussion and controversy regarding Armstrong's style, image, film roles, repertoire, political views, importance and enduring legacy.     This seminar will include lecture and discussion, and will be supplemented by films, recordings, photographs, guests, live musical demonstration and a field trip. Assigned readings include three books on Louis Armstrong, as well as some of Professor White's publications, including: \"Traditional New Orleans Jazz as a Metaphor for American Life\" (available as a \"Foreseeable Futures\" publication on the Imagining America website: http//imaginingamerica.org/); \"Reflections of an Authentic Jazz Life in Pre-Katrina New Orleans\" in the Journal of American History (94, Dec. 2007); and \"Dr. Michael White: The Doc Paulin Years, 1975-79\" in the Tulane Jazz Archivist (vol. XXIII; 2010)        Convener:     Convener: Michael Gerard White is the Keller Endowed Chair in the Humanities at Xavier University in New Orleans where he has served as a professor of Spanish and African-American music for over 30 years. He studied the clarinet in high school and later learned jazz in brass band street parades, funerals and community events. He played alongside several dozen jazz musicians born between the late 1890s and 1910. White is highly visible on the jazz scene as a band leader, recording artist, composer, writer and lecturer. He has appeared on over 60 recordings, including several under his own name and also with a variety of artists like Wynton Marsalis, Beausoleil, Eric Clapton, Taj Mahal and Paul Simon. Dr. White has won numerous honor and awards, including the Chevalier of Arts and Letters from France, The NEH National Heritage Fellowship Award, the LEH Louisiana State Humanist of the Year Award, and the Tulane University President's Medal. He has recently completed producing and recording on a CD of New Orleans brass bands for the Smithsonian Institution.                                 Return to top               Reading Rigorously, Writing Eloquently&mdash;and Persuasively - Across Disciplines     The Program     Under the auspices of a Mellon Foundation grant, my work at Hendrix College for the last two years has focused on helping teachers in the disciplines learn new ways of teaching writing. Ten faculty members from Art History, African History, Psychology, Philosophy, English, and Creative Writing have taken up the task of teaching a rigorous essay course outside the confines of their own disciplines. Our faculty workshops and classroom teaching have dwelt on reading and representing complex written texts and experience, conceiving and substantiating ideas, and developing those ideas in essays that often run against the grain of argument. We have sought to concentrate on practices that rarely find their way into either composition texts or disciplinary classrooms. Instead of concentrating on proof, our written work has thrived on continual inquiry and revision, ideas rather than theses, and rigorous written conversations that aim to be inclusive as they reach out to embrace contradiction and complexity. The aim of our project has been to take new forms of public writing back into each of the represented disciplines.     Our summer workshop at NYU will draw its sustenance from this experimental work as we concern ourselves with the relationship between reading and conception, between reading and the inductive process, and between reading and writing. Our aim will be to improve our own pedagogy - even as we work together this summer - so that we can in turn improve our students' written expression.     A Story of Necessity     Almost a decade ago, I discovered that my students were paying primary attention only to the personal connections they could make with the assigned written texts; they showed little interest in the larger body of ideas or the way those ideas were presented. Their habits led to hasty conclusions about meaning--to an erasure of central parts of the text under consideration. Diverted by a thesis chase , they were looking for a single point instead of a network of complementary ideas.     Instead of learning to reason from evidence, most students had learned to take shortcuts, moving habitually from thesis to highly selective evidence - leaving out contradictions, challenges, complications. The learned emphasis had been not on the rigorous analysis of evidence but on a fact-based, highly structured response: thesis, proposition, and examples.     The examination of evidence rarely leads to certainty or to a thesis that can, out of necessity, be proved; it leads instead to discovery, to the rigorous combination and application of analysis and imagination, to ideas that must, like the evidence itself, be continually reassessed and re-conceptualized to represent more accurately whatever truth the evidence suggests to the researching writer. At the heart of this inductive process of discovery lies the complex business of reading complex written texts that do not reveal themselves to cursory examination.      For the writer, grappling with lively ideas leads eventually to clarification and the use of nuanced language, to a more complex form of expression than a formulaic set of declarations and a series of examples can provide. The act of writing - writing itself - is central to learning, just as the act of reading is central to writing.     The inductive process is, of course, the same process that leads to discovery in science or in any other academic discipline. It provides the foundation for making sense of research, no matter what the subject matter. Crucial to all academic work, we are left partially blind without it, unable to determine what the evidence means, unable to discover what we really have to say.     Convener:     Pat C. Hoy II directed the Expository Writing Program at NYU for twenty years. Now the Mellon Visiting Professor of English at Hendrix College, he has also held appointments at the U.S. Military Academy and Harvard. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania.

Return to top            The Informatics Revolution: Using Data to Enhance Teaching Life Sciences     The Program     The recent Ebola outbreak underscores the challenges that infectious disease continues to raise in the world around us. Malaria kills roughly 600,000 people a year, and tuberculosis about twice as many. Closer to home, widespread overuse of antibiotics has provoked high levels of drug resistance in hospital-acquired infections, which are now also in the community. Key to confronting modern problems in biomedicine is the availability of powerful tools to investigate the molecular basis of disease as well as the complex biology of cells and organisms. Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing area that addresses the use of computers for the acquisition, management, and analysis of biological information. The explosion of interest in bioinformatics in the past few years has been driven by the tremendous growth of DNA sequencing technology. Huge repositories of sequence and structural information provide an amazing wealth of resources for researchers, teachers and students.     In this seminar, participants will become familiar with the bioinformatics-related databases that are available, and learn how to search them using modern software. We will emphasize how to use informatics to design course modules, class projects and case studies for students in biology, chemistry, public health, and environmental science.     This seminar is appropriate for faculty members in the natural sciences, health sciences, computer science, and mathematics. No prior programming experience is required.       Convener:     Stuart Brown , New York University, holds a Ph.D. from Cornell University and was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Plant Molecular Biology at the University of Manitoba. He subsequently was a Research Scientist at the United States Department of Agriculture before joining the NYU faculty. He serves as bioinformatics consultant for NYU's Medical Center, collaborating on a wide range of research projects. He contributes data management and data analysis expertise to multiple projects that make use of high-throughput Next-Generation DNA sequencing technology. He is currently engaged on projects that include metagenomics (Human Microbiome Project), analysis of the genetic variation in the malaria parasite, and analysis of RNA sequence data from a variety of clinical and basic science research projects. Other projects he has worked on include the discovery of antigens using a pattern-based search of complete genome sequences, searching for the bacterial genes linked to severe dental caries, and an evolutionary analysis of the mammalian genes involved in sugar metabolism. He has been Course Director for the Bioinformatics course in the Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences for 12 years, for which he has received the Dean's Recognition Citation for Excellence in Medical Education.                              Return to top          The Philosopher in the Marketplace: Market Morality and its Social Impact     The Program     This seminar will undertake a critical examination of how the marketplace embraces a morality that defines and governs the way transactions are conducted within its womb. Its tentacles are far reaching, insinuating themselves into the very fabric of the society that houses and nurtures it. These adopted values determine the content and direction of social policy, as well as our understanding of how the more general aspects of our commercial life should be contoured. On a personal level, it impacts upon notions of happiness and success, while playing a central role in the creation of our social image.     Our discussions will focus around the ways in which markets can and do crowd out morals, often leading to the cynicism expressed by social realists - those who see the moral assessment of markets and business as inappropriate, as if commercial enterprise gets a free pass from morally based critique. It will become apparent as a result of our investigations that those who hold \"business ethics\" as an oxymoron are not only mistaken, but also divisive in promoting such a stance.     As a sampling, our studies will include questions concerning the moral limits of markets, and the determination of what money can or cannot, should or should not buy, i.e.,            Should we be able to buy and sell human organs, to treat citizenship papers and college admissions as commodities to be subject to purchase, etc.?       What are the moral consequences of adopting a \"bottom line\" perception of business practice?       What is the moral impact of the employment of the fear factor in marketing?       Why do we buy what we buy?       Do we have any obligations to protect and enhance the environment, to consider matters of sustainability and the fate of future generations in making economically based decisions?       Are we morally obliged to consider the plight and well-being of persons unknown to us, inhabitants of countries we will never come to visit while making marketplace decisions?       Is there a moral component to the determination of the social and personal ideals that we aggressively market, ideals concerned with class, race, and gender as well as those concerned with personal image, i.e., stature, weight and personal choice?          Our scrutiny will inexorably lead us to confront the most serious issues faced by our society today, namely matters of social justice, the inordinately unbalanced distribution of wealth, and the values that drive how our national budgetary pie is cut. Undoubtedly, we will join Michael Sandel in pondering his ongoing concern that we as a society may very well be drifting from HAVING a market economy to BEING a market society.      Reference will be made to the following works, engaging in style and content: Michael Sandel's What Money Can't Buy and Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do ; John Rawls' A Theory of Justice ; William Irvine's On Desire: Why We Want What We Want ; Paul Bloom's How Pleasure Works: The New Science of Why We Like What We Like ; Daniel Gilbert's Stumbling on Happiness ; Geoffrey Miller's Spent: Sex, Evolution, and Consumer Behavior ; Tony Judt's Ill Fares the Land ; and Sissela Bok's Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life , to offer but an entree into the broad panorama of arenas touched by our concerns.

Return to top           Voices of Contemporary Islam        The Program     The religion of Islam has been at the center of political discourse in recent years. Issues of terrorism, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the debate over the proposed Park 51 Islamic Center, \"the Arab Spring\" and the rise of ISIS/ISIL in Iraq and Syria have focused attention on Muslims and their religion. The ways in which Islam has been discussed within the media and certain corners of the academy since the tragic and morally inexcusable events of September 11, 2001, have often been problematic. Over the last decade there has been a veritable explosion of books and articles on Islam, many of which decry what they see as a lack of intellectual debate and moral discourse in the Islamic world. Pundits on cable news networks continually assert \"it is a shame that there are no anti-terrorist, pro-democratic voices within Islam.\" These same opinions are also found in academic circles.     These kinds of opinions are at best rooted in ignorance and, at their worst, in prejudice and hostility. While it is true that there are \"fundamentalist\" voices within Islam that resist complex and multi-vocal interpretations of the basic sources of the tradition, they do not now, nor have they ever, represented the mainstream of Muslim thought. Islam has always maintained a variety of philosophical, theological and mystical expressions. It is Islam's diversity and ability to adapt to changing historical and cultural circumstances that is one of its primary characteristics and greatest strengths. Among the numerous problems and issues that have drawn the attention of today's Muslim intellectuals has been the rise to prominence of \"fundamentalists\" and \"Islamists\" willing to use violence to achieve their goals. Not only are \"traditional\" Muslims critiquing and challenging movements like the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and ISIS/ISIL as theologically incorrect readings of Qu'ran and hadith , but there are also vibrant \"progressive\" movements that draw upon feminist theory and liberation theology to develop radical new expressions of Muslim piety and political action.     This seminar will explore some of these crucial issues and debates in the contemporary Muslim world and present examples of diverse theological, political, and social thought. Issues to be examined will include the compatibility of Islam with democracy, the connections between Islam and terrorism, the role of Wahabism in the construction of contemporary Islamic movements, feminist movements within Islam, Islam and pluralism, and Sufism in the contemporary context. The course will introduce teachable primary sources, including writings by Khaled Abou Fadl, Amina Wadud, Osama bin Laden, and Michael Muhammad Knight, as well as varied \"Muslim Voices\" through selected films and literary works. Special attention will be focused on how to introduce complex and controversial issues in the classroom. Core texts may include: Progressive Muslims on Justice, Gender and Pluralism (Omid Safi, ed.); Tariq Ramadan's In the Footsteps of the Prophet: Lessons from the Life of Muhammad ; and Fatemeh Keshavarz' Jasmine and Stars: Reading More than Lolita in Tehran .

Return to top           Women and the Civil Rights Movement in the United States     The Program     Before the publication in 1993 of the pioneering text, Women in the Civil Rights Movement: Trailblazers and Torchbearers, 1941-1965 (edited by Vicki Crawford et al.), historical studies of women's contributions to the most important freedom struggle in the 20th century in the United States were virtually non-existent. There is now a growing body of scholarship, autobiographies, memoirs, children's books, and documentaries that analyze and capture the pivotal role of Black and white women, in particular, during the civil rights and Black power movements of the fifties, sixties, and seventies.     Using a variety of texts and films, this seminar will explore the important roles of women in various freedom struggles and analyze the gendered nature of the civil rights movement (CRM). Employing Black feminist theoretical frameworks, we will revisit \"the Movement\" and discuss the silences, absences, erasures, and distortions that characterize dominant narratives about contemporary Black liberation struggles that fall under the rubric of \"the civil rights movement.\" Texts to be studied include Belinda Robnett's How Long? How Long?: African American Women in the Struggle for Civil Rights/Black Power , which examines the movement from the vantage point of social movement theory; Lynn Olson's Freedom's Daughters: The Unsung Heroines of the Civil Rights Movement from 1830-1970 ; Danielle McGuire's At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape and Resistance: A New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power , which is a revisionist history of the iconic figure Parks, as well as a reimagining of the CRM; Peter Ling's and Sharon Monteith's Gender and the Civil Rights Movement ; and Hands on the Freedom Plow: Personal Accounts by Women in SNCC , edited by Faith S. Holsaert and others. Documentaries to be viewed include \"Reflections Unheard: Black Women in Civil Rights\" by Nevline Nnaji and \"Mountains That Take Wing: Angela Davis and Yuri Kochiyama, A Conversation on Life, Struggles and Liberation\" by C.A. Griffith and H. L.T. Quan.                Convener:     Beverly Guy-Sheftall is Founding Director of the Women's Research and Resource Center and Anna Julia Cooper Professor of Women's Studies at Spelman College. She is past president of the National Women's Studies Association (NWSA). Along with her co-editors, she published the first anthology of Black women's literature, Sturdy Black Bridges: Visions of Black Women in Literature . Her recent books include Gender Talk: The Struggle for Women's Equality in African American Communities (with Johnnetta Betsch Cole) and Still Brave: The Evolution of Black Women's Studies (with Stanlie M. James and Frances Smith Foster). In progress is a study of the radical politics of Coretta Scott King.                    Return to top             World Cinema Through Global Genres     The Program     McLuhan's vision of the global village has never been more compelling than it is today. The world in which our students are coming of age - and which they are helping to create - calls for greater international understanding and cooperation. One way to give students greater access to lives and cultures beyond our national borders is through the window of world cinema. Movies have a way of making history, geography, and demographics come alive, transforming statistics and abstractions into compelling human stories. But movies made in different languages in other countries are not always readily accessible. Strange customs, unfamiliar faces, and subtitles can cloud the window.     This seminar explores a new approach to teaching about world cultures through film genres. By starting with familiar Hollywood film forms (action, horror, road movies, wedding films) and tracing their origins and influences abroad (horror in Japan and Italy, kung fu in Hong Kong, wuxia pian in mainland China, wedding films in India, road movies in Latin America), students get to widen their experience of other film traditions and the cultures that produce them. By studying the cultural flows and cross-currents shaping our most popular global genres, they can form a deeper appreciation not only of the films and their stories, but also of the people, societies, and beliefs behind these films - people, societies, and beliefs they will be encountering in one form or another throughout their lives.     Teachers and scholars from a variety of disciplines are invited to apply. Together, we will look at film clips and selected feature films from the perspectives of history, social institutions, economics, and aesthetics. Our method will be interactive and participatory, with a focus on direct application to each participant's curriculum.         Coordinator:     William Costanzo is a SUNY Distinguished Teaching Professor of English and Film and has taught courses in writing, literature, and film studies at Westchester Community College since 1970. A graduate of Columbia University, Dr. Costanzo has published six books on writing and film, including Reading the Movies (revised for Kindle, 2014), Great Films and How to Teach Them (NCTE, 2004), The Writer's Eye (McGraw-Hill), and World Cinema Through Global Genres (Wiley Blackwell, 2014). He is active in the Society for Cinema and Media Studies, where he serves on the Teaching Committee and has recently co-edited a dossier on \"New Approaches to Teaching World Cinema.\"                       Return to top           Yellow Peril !!! &ndash; Understanding Xenophobia     The Program        Fears of \"yellow peril\" (and brown \"turban tides\") run deep in the present and past of U.S. political and commercial culture. The stories and imagery of \"yellow peril\" are just beneath the surface of everyday discourse and always latent&mdash;readily triggered by an incident, real or fabricated. Fabricated WMDs, SARS fears, charges of Chinese \"pirating\" of U.S. cultural properties, the racial profiling of \"Arab-looking\" peoples, and claims that Asians are \"taking over\" U.S. higher education all illustrate contemporary forms of Asian \"peril.\" And most recently, amidst the Snowden NSA disclosures, there are regular charges of relentless \"Chinese hacking,\" as if the U.S. is an innocent victim. Americans are woefully unaware of this scapegoating tradition and its paranoid history, and consequently remain particularly vulnerable to its ideological and affective power.         The stakes of understanding \"yellow peril\" (Islamophobia and related) fears are high for the future of our nation. There is a need to cultivate more rigorous understanding across cultural differences, and discover our shared humanity. Fundamental epistemological questions of knowledge are at stake. How do we know what we know? And how are we, systematically, made unaware? How do \"yellow peril\" fears distract us from the real dialogues and real issues that must take place? Despite the explosive developments in so many cities and nations of Asia, the U.S. people are still fundamentally unaware of Asian countries, where they are, the languages they speak, the religions they practice and the types of governments they have.        Seminar participants will explore what can and must be done to counter these fallacies and practices. In addition to readings, discussion, and online materials, the seminar will involve visits to exhibitions and archives, such as the Museum of Chinese in America, the National Archives Records Administration at the Customs House, and New York University's Fales and Tamiment Libraries. Guest speakers may include Dylan Yeats (co-author and editor with Dr. Tchen of Yellow Peril! An Archive of Anti-Asian Fear , 2014) and documentary filmmakers Ric Burns and Li-Shin Yu (whose upcoming PBS American Experience documentary is on the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act).                                              Convener:     Jack (John Kuo Wei) Tchen is a historian, curator and dumpster diver, whose interests include understanding the multiple presents, pasts, and futures of New York City, trans-local cross-cultural communications, unpacking archives and archival absences, and practices of dialogue-driven pedagogy.

By tracing the shadow of Irish language literary traditions in and alongside the emerging Irish literary traditions in English, we will consider the interplay of literature and national identity, and the role of literature and other forms of print culture in a variety of social processes, including politicization, the language shift, and textual representations of violence, domestic life, cultural memory, national and international economy, and forms of agency. Major authors including Jonathan Swift, Bishop Berkeley, Edmund Burke, Maria Edgeworth, Sydney Owenson, Thomas Moore, Samuel Ferguson, and James Clarence Mangan are considered, as well as the development of Irish forms of poetry, drama, and prose in English. It is the aim of the course to give students a detailed grasp of Irish literary history before the cataclysmic social changes wrought by the Irish famine, and to introduce students to the concepts and terminology employed in contemporary Irish literary scholarship.

At a time when cinema itself is migrating from analogue to digital, many of the most important writers and directors are preoccupied by questions of invisibility, dematerialization and disappearance. Spectres of Marx; revenant marginals; the ghosts of industrial towns, political utopias and migrant labour: this class \u2013 covering a diverse range of intellectual and aesthetic approaches \u2013 will include pulpy TV dramas, gallery films, experimental documentaries. The work of directors such as Jeremy Deller, Derek Jarman, John Akomfrah/ Black Audio Film Collective, Nigel (Quatermass and the Pit) Kneale will be examined alongside music (Zomby, record labels such as Ghost Box and Mordant Music), and critical/ imaginative writings by Simon Reynolds, Tom McCarthy, Hito Steyerl.

Readings will include basic texts by Saussure, Barthes, Bakhtin, Derrida, Althusser, Lacan, Foucault, and Fanon. Philosophical tradition from Hegel to Freud will contextualize what is a single movement of thought defined by continuity rather than by ruptures. The course will begin and end with literary texts, including Shakespeare, to measure what the theoretical tradition brings to both practical criticism and literary and cultural history. Open to both graduate students and advanced undergraduates.

Participants should have at least one paper that they wish to develop up to the level appropriate for a publishable journal article--usually a matter of further thinking and research, followed by revision. The course develops students\u2019 critical abilities in each aspect of this process: conceptualization, research base, critical approach, enhancements (photos, graphs, etc.), organization, finish. Students will prepare evaluations of each other\u2019s work in the various areas of critique and work together to find better ideas and information to develop their articles; they will then revise their own work for re-submission, further critique and, if necessary, further revision.   Developing students\u2019 critical abilities as they assess their own and other students\u2019 writing is the immediate object of the seminar. Excellence in work to be submitted for publication will be the individual student\u2019s goal. The seminar/workshop should be useful in developing similar skills in writing and revising dissertation chapters and in revising the completed dissertation for publication as articles and/or a book.

Workshop activities will include discussing and critiquing pre-circulated papers or works-in-progress presented by NYU faculty, visiting scholars, and members of the Workshop; learning and practicing the protocols for submitting papers for conferences and various forms of publication, and for writing grant proposals; designing teaching strategies; and discovering and experimenting with new research tools. In all of these activities Workshop participants will also engage with overarching issues of concern to the field such as the benefits and limitations of periodization and the role of Medieval and Renaissance Studies in the academy and in society at large. Enrollment in the Workshop for two semesters, preferably over the course of one academic year, is a requirement for the Concentration in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, but the Workshop is also open to students who are not pursuing the Concentration, and all students working in the Middle Ages and Renaissance are welcome to attend the Workshop even if they are not enrolled in it as a course.      Engl.GA.2323.001   Law and Shakespeare    John Archer   Tuesday 3:30-5:30pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 306   How can the plays and poems of Shakespeare help introduce us both to the history of law in the Anglo-American and Roman civil-law traditions and to current theories about law and political power? Beginning with legal history and comic drama, our seminar will compare common law and equity in England as rival systems that place competing versions of the public good (inheritance as common wealth, and commonwealth as state power) above particular interests. Then, through a range of tragedies and late tragicomedies, we will consider different versions of \u201cpolitical theology\u201d in the Renaissance, that is, the place of the sovereign both inside and outside divine, natural and human concepts of law. We will read a selection of Shakespeare\u2019s works along with a critical article or two each week. The plays may include The Comedy of Errors, Romeo and Juliet, The Merchant of Venice, Measure for Measure, King Lear and The Tempest. Theorists and critics include Giorgio Agamben, Lorna Hutson, Paul Raffield, and Julia Reinhard Lupton. Previous reading in either the historical context for literature from the medieval period forward or in literary theory is highly recommended for enrollment in this seminar. A presentation and two research papers will make up the grade along with informed and lively class participation.      Engl.GA.2450.001   Narrative Strategies    Mary Poovey   TBA   This course examines the strategies used to launch, develop, and bring narratives to a close. The primary goal is to develop descriptive and analytic tools for understanding and using these narrative strategies. The course engages a range of genres in several media forms: short stories, poems, literary criticism and theory, historical writing, autobiography, print journalism, a TV series, film, and several digital genres. Most of the course\u2019s texts were originally published, released, or broadcast in the U.K. or U. S. between 1800 and the present. The topics we will address include: getting things going in medias res, the mythic origins of \u201conce upon a time,\u201d serialization, foreshadowing, the use and abuse of cliff hangers, the layering and juxtaposition of characters and themes, tying up loose ends, white space and silence, interruptions both planned and unplanned, and the modes of attention elicited by print and digital texts.      Engl.GA.2661.001   Victorian Studies: Ekphrastic Imperialism: Image and Other from Tennyson to Forster    Jeff Spear   Thursday 3:30-5:30pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 306   The starting point for the seminar will be the work of W.J.T. Mitchell and other contemporary critics who have expanded Ekphrasis from a very specific category (the verbal creation, or recreation, of a work of visual art) into a more inclusive, even aggressive mode. Mitchell\u2019s exposition focuses on gender questions; but, he argues: \u201cgender is not the unique key to the workings of ekphrasis, but only one among many figures of difference that energize the dialectic of the imagetext.\u201d We will explore that proposition beginning with the poetic tradition from Tennyson and Browning down to poets of the nineties such as Arthur Symons and \u201cMichael Field.\u201d We will also \u201cread\u201d Victorian paintings that contain or interpret texts. The ekphrastic horror show will take up the rhetoric of \u201cdegeneration\u201d and compare ekphrastic scenes from such works as Dracula with Symbolist art. Our consideration of the racial other will begin with the representation of the Jew and include two weeks on Daniel Deronda as a text that combines ekphrastic representation of race, and gender with the question of whether or not there can be a musical analogue to ekphrasis. Finally we will explore the colonial other. Beginning with an exploration of colonial photography, we will move on to Wilde\u2019s Salome and the figure of the \u201cdancing girl,\u201d including Kipling stories and a revisionist look backward by the playwright Tripurari Sharma: \u201cA Tale from the Year 1857: Azizun Nisa; a translation of her San Sattawan ka Qissa: Azizun Nisa. We will consider the figure of the \u201cBabu\u201d as configured by Kipling with selected Indian texts and Kalighat painting. We will conclude with Tagore\u2019s The Home and the World and Forster\u2019s A Passage to India, which records the failure of reconciliation and, paradoxically, a collapse of visual and verbal signification that names the uncreating word.      Engl.GA.2838.001   19th Century African American Lit    Elizabeth McHenry   Thursday 10:00am-12:00pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 306   This course examines the development of black literary expression in the nineteenth century United States by reading a diverse selection of texts. Through novels, slave narratives, autobiographies and memoirs, speeches and journalism we will trace the dynamic circulation and transmission of ideas by African Americans, free and slave, as well as the relationship between cultural production and historical phenomena. We will pay particular attention to the ways that African Americans negotiated and troubled the divide between history and fictional forms, and how their fictions worked to produce alternative understandings of national history and civil liberty than that which had emerged from the \u201cfounding fathers.\u201d The second part of the semester will take up post-emancipation literature: why, we will ask, did black authors return their readers to antebellum slavery in the post-bellum years seemingly at the very moment they wished to cultivate their imagine as \u201cnew Negroes\u201d and self-consciously create a Negro literature with a lasting impact in the twentieth century? How did African Americans negotiate through language and in literary terms the competing and contested concerns of heritage and historical memory, on the one hand, with the deterioration of race relations and rise of slavery\u2019s legacy of racial thought in the years W.E.B. Du Bois famously identified with the \u201cproblem of the color line\u201d? The course takes on these questions, exploring how black literature engages with the politics of cultural identity formation, notions of freedom, citizenship, and aesthetic forms.      Engl.GA.2900.001   Literary Dictatorships    Jini Watson   Thursday 1:00-3:00pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 105   This seminar explores representations of dictatorships in postcolonial literature, film and theory. How have fictional texts reflected upon and narrated the emergence of authoritarian regimes, especially in relation to decolonization and its liberation struggles? How might they help us move beyond the tired paradigms of failed states and \u201cmad\u201d third-world dictators? How might such texts attempt to counter or resist the monopoly of meaning held by an oppressive regime? Can we talk of a narrative genre of dictatorship literature as a kind of \u201cworld literature\u201d?   Framing our analyses with Hannah Arendt\u2019s seminal work on totalitarianism and Frantz Fanon\u2019s early account of neocolonialism, we will engage with a range of imaginative texts that respond to and figure emergencies, coups and dictatorships. Our corpus draws from Africa, Latin America, East and South Asia, and our task will be to investigate and compare representations of the rise of authoritarian regimes, the dictator figure, everyday life under states of emergency, tropes of resistance and complicity, and psychic and social constructions of power. We will also consider questions of narrative form, structure and genre, in particular, the use of allegory, humor, the grotesque, and various modes of realism.   Likely fictional texts include works by: V. S. Naipaul, Raoul Peck, Nuruddin Farah, Julia Alvarez, Rohinton Mistry, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o, Jessica Hagedorn, and Yi Mun-yol. Relevant theoretical readings that will help us consider issues of sovereignty, authority, violence, gender and the nation-state will draw from Achille Mbembe, Giorgio Agamben, Rajeswari Sunder Rajan, David Scott, Mahmood Mamdani and others. The course\u2019s broader objective will be to raise questions about what the study of dictatorship literatures can tell us about contemporary issues of power and sovereignty. If imaginative texts offer us access to new conceptualizations of power, how might the political be construed in and through literary and aesthetic regimes?   While some background in postcolonial literary studies is desirable but not necessary, a willingness to engage rigorously with theoretical texts and to read widely across genres, disciplines and geographies is a must.      Engl.GA.2917.001   International Modernism    Peter Nicholls   Monday 1:00-3:00pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 306   The course will explore some canonical works of Anglo-American literary modernism in relation to the developments in European writing that frequently provided their context and instigation. Texts studied may include works by Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarm\u00e9, Val\u00e9ry, Proust, Marinetti, Pound, Joyce, Eliot, Lewis, Stein, Tzara, Brecht, Breton, Aragon, Rilke, Artaud, Pessoa, Brecht, Kafka, Borges and Beckett. We shall consider problems of translation and transmission (the publication of Joyce\u2019s Work in Progress in transition, for example), and we shall pursue some of the connections between the work of modernist writers and philosophers (e.g., Proust/Lewis/Bergson, Rilke/ Heidegger, and Beckett/Adorno). All works will be read in English translation.      Engl.GA.2927.001   Postwar Visual Poetics    Lytle Shaw   Monday 3:30-5:30pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 105   This course examines the generative traffic between the categories of art and experimental writing from the early 1950s to the present within an international context. To set the scene we will spend several weeks considering New York School poets\u2019 take on Abstract Expressionism in relation to dominant critical accounts; then we will move through subsequent developments between and across the disciplines by dividing them into five loose headings: minimalism and conceptualism; concrete poetry; Fluxus and performance, site-specificity; institutional critique. Writers will include O\u2019Hara, Ashbery, Schuyler, Brainard, Pignatari, the de Campos brothers, Gomringer, Finlay, Fahlstrom, Coolidge, Mayer, Watten, Mac Low, Knowles, Eigner, Robertson, Darragh, Howe, Silliman, Cha, Farrell, Davies and Bernstein. Artists: Pollock, de Kooning, Rauschenberg, Johns, Warhol, Broodthaers, Judd, Morris, Andre, Smithson, Acconci, Piper, Graham, Kelley, McCarthy, Laderman Ukeles, Green and Dion. Critics: Rosenberg, Greenberg, Fried, Kotz, Krauss, Buchloh. The course will also trouble these neat categories of writer, artist and critic.      Engl.GA.2971.001   Practicum in Digital Humanities   Deena Engel and Marion Thain   Monday 6:00-8:00pm; Lab Tuesday 1:00-3:00pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 105   The interface of technology and the humanities represents a key to the future, yet many students feel they lack the skills to access this potential. This course offers an introduction to web development and digital publication especially created for students in the Humanities, with a view to equipping you with knowledge foundational for reflective engagement with the new media of literary creation and dissemination. Students will survey the principles of current technologies and apply them through practice as they learn the skills and techniques for formatting and publishing archival materials in a web-based environment. The course builds towards the creation of a digital edition, giving you the opportunity to work with primary source materials available through NYU's rich archival collections (these include a wide variety of printed texts, manuscripts and images from which to select according to your interests).   The course will consist of a traditional classroom lecture and discussion format as well as computer lab sessions to promote and assist students as they work on each of their three projects in this course. Each student will have an account on a production webserver to post their work and learn to install and configure a Wordpress site specifically tailored to his or her primary source materials. Topics and assigned projects will begin with an introduction to mark-up languages and building a site of related web pages followed by a project centered on encoding and annotating digital texts for scholarly purposes. The final project involves photographing or scanning, transcribing, and encoding digital texts to build an on-line archive, which has the potential to be published and housed on a server as a lasting contribution to the world of online open-access scholarship.      Engl.GA.2980.001   MA Proseminar: Introduction to Advanced Literary Study    Maureen McLane   Tuesday 4:00-6:00pm \u2013 19 University Place, Room 305   What is Literature? Why study \u201cit\u201d? How study \u201cit\u201d? Does \u201cliterature\u201d exist? How has it been, how is it now, and how might it yet be studied, imagined, engaged, and/or critiqued? And how might advanced literary study be inflected by other advanced studies\u2014of, for example, media history and ecology, book history, historiography, the human sciences (linguistics, psychoanalysis, anthropology)? This course offers a series of intense experimental gambits: with assigned readings in a variety of methodological and theoretical keys, from a range of historical periods, we will begin to consider where literary study has been, where it is, and where it might be going. We will engage the pleasure of the text and the rigor of the text and may confront as well the displeasure of the text: our task will be to register each of these possibilities.      Engl.GA.2980.002   MA Proseminar: Introduction to Advanced Literary Study    Juliet Fleming   Wednesday 11:00am-1:00pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 105   Criticism Practical and Impractical.   Practical criticism is a method of close reading designed to enhance our responsiveness to what we read. It develops a knowledge of literary forms, and provides technical language for describing the ways in which writers achieve their effects. As prescribed by I. A. Richards in the 1920s it treats literature as something separate from social and economic spheres and from the personal concerns of its author: had you taken an exam prepared by the followers of Richards at Cambridge you would have been required to produce a close analysis of, organised response to, and finally judgement of three pieces of literary writing that were unnamed and undated. Part of the work of this seminar will be to prepare you for (a modified version of) that exam -- and, beyond that, for a career founded upon your skills of close reading and your ability to recognise the presence and consequences of literary forms, metres, punctuation, rhyme schemes, diction, syntax and layout. In every meeting we will practice reading, talking and writing about literary forms. The other part of our work will be to familiarise ourselves with a different type of close-reading, one that is famously not a method, and that eschews the pleasures of judgment. Deconstruction is the unsatisfactory name for what is, above all, a heightened commitment to reading -- one that refuses the limits of any criticism that would be practical but that nevertheless offers a profound education in thinking about literary texts. Throughout the semester we will use Derrida's writing to lighten, baffle, enrich and deflect our own developing attempts at literary analysis and judgment.   Requirements: regular attendance at and informed participation in each class, four short (3 page) papers and -- of course, but don't panic -- a final exam.      Engl.GA.2980.003   MA Proseminar: Introduction to Advanced Literary Study    Pat Crain   Wednesday 3:30-5:30pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 306   Drawing for much of our work on the genre of the tale, a nineteenth-century mass-market print commodity and an object of extensive theoretical and critical writing in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, this seminar brings to the surface the sometimes suppressed or embarrassed questions of how we read, what we read for, and what we imagine and strive for in our own writing. What are our objects and our objectives? Critical, historical, and theoretical texts will help us to think about essential concepts and practices\u2014\u201cauthor,\u201d \u201cmedia,\u201d \u201creading,\u201d \u201carchive,\u201d \u201cdigital,\u201d \u201cprint culture,\u201d for some examples\u2014and engage current conversations about them.   Your answer to the seminar\u2019s large baggy questions will take the form of collaborative and individual exercises and experiments as well a (trim and elegant) essay on a text of your choosing (on or off the syllabus), worked through in stages during the term. Hands-on sessions in Bobst and in Fales special collections will help to hone research skills.      Engl.GA.3323.001   Renaissance Mediaology    John Guillory and Juliet Fleming   Monday 11:00-1:00pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 306   In this course, we will inquire into the various forms of Renaissance writing from the perspective of recent media theory. We will read examples of Renaissance writing in the full range of their materializations, including both oral and written, manuscript and print, and even supposedly ephemeral forms of writing such as marginalia and grafitti. Against the background of this vast cosmos of writing, canonical works of literature appear as a rarified form of writing, only a tiny fraction of that universe. Accordingly we will study not only familiar canonical works of literature but the generic and material forms of literary transmission, such as ballads, songs, woodcuts, prints, anthologies, letters, pamplets, sermons, treatises, lectures, and stage plays. We are especially interested in revisiting the \u201cprint revolution\u201d as the \u201cremediation\u201d of writing, and to focus rigorous historical and theoretical attention on print as a medium that changed the status and function of writing in early modern England. During the sixteenth century the development of print technology re-drew writing's relations with speech, and directed its potencies into new cultural and institutional locations.   Alongside the primary texts of the course, we will be reading works in media and print theory, including McLuhan, Derrida, Ong, Chartier, Eisenstein, Adrian Johns, Peter Stallybras, Ann Blair and others.      Engl.GA.3536.001   History of System    Cliff Siskin   Monday 3:30-5:30pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 306   As part of his proposal to advance knowledge (1605), Francis Bacon drew up a wish list of 130 different histories that had to be written. But the one he was particularly worried about as being particularly deficient was \u201cLiterary History.\u201d As the history of the literary in its formerly broad sense of learning, Bacon imagined it as a \u201cstory of learning\u201d that would track \u201cthe kinds of learning and arts that have flourished and decayed in various parts of the world at various times\u201d in order to \"make men wise in the use and administration of knowledge.\" We will compare this story to the one we tell in English Departments. For those of you seeking period coverage of the latter, our reading list of the literary in both senses of the term will start with Bacon and Galileo, mine the long 18th century, and venture into the present. Our touchstone will be the form that writing and learning assumed with increasing frequency during those periods--\"system.\" For everyone's practical benefit in getting their own work done, we will also take a second cue from Bacon--his emphasis on new tools. Developed by one of your predecessors in the doctoral program, Mark Algee-Hewitt, I call this novum organon \"Tectonics.\" Drawing from our databases, such as EEBO and ECCO, this practice, by mapping historical adjacencies of words and concepts, identifies and visualizes the conditions of possibility that enabled earlier changes in knowledge--and that might speak to how those changes are changing today. [To add to your repertoire for producing long-form knowledge--such as theses and dissertations--we'll also run a voluntary lab on the Kindle as a research instrument.]      Engl.GA.3900.001   Marxist Philosophies of Language    Robert Young   Tuesday 3:30-5:30pm \u2013 244 Greene Street, Room 105   The language question has been a recurrent conundrum within Marxist philosophy since Marx himself. What is a Marxist philosophy of language, or what could it be? Can language be revolutionary? Can language be controlled by the state or is an anarchic, demotic force? What should a materialist analysis of language involve? What is the relation of language, and literary language, to class, and to class conflict? What is its relation to questions of gender and race? To what extent can language be analysed as an ideological form, as a phenomenon of the superstructure? If so, how can the language of analysis separate itself from its object? In this course we shall be both examining Marxist theories of language, and also considering other philosophies and theories of language, for example Saussure, ideas of language families, and of standard languages, from a Marxist perspective. Our reading should include books or essays by Karl Marx, Valentin Volosinov, Mikhail Bakhtin, Roman Jakobson, Nikolai Troubetzkoy, Walter Benjamin, Antonio Gramsci, Joseph Stalin, Nicholai Marr, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Julia Kristeva, Michel Foucault, Pierre Calvet, Jacques Derrida, Pier Paolo Pasoloni, and Jacques Ranci\u00e8re.

Our mission is to prepare students   to be thought leaders and successful global citizens. We do this by   creating unique academic opportunities for student and faculty   engagement that emphasize research and scholarly communication. Part of   the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced Honors Seminars place   students in small classes with distinguished faculty to study topics   that have the potential to change how we think and how we work. As such,   they are ideal gateways for the intellectually stimulating discussions   we aim to foster. They challenge students and faculty to engage   intensively within and beyond their fields of study, and they inspire   intellectual responsibility towards the scholarly community and the   wider world. In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science   launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic   principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to upper-level courses   (open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors). Distinguished professors   drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s   professional schools, and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural,   and governmental leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances,   the seminars are cross-listed with departments and students may count   the classes toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes   will count only as electives. Advanced Honors Seminars have three   central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between   exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students intellectually   through honors-level work in critical thinking, writing, and conversing;   and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in and aptitude for conducting   independent research (e.g. a DURF grant or a Senior Honors Thesis). They   are designed to foster scholarly insight and debate and to nurture the   intellectual passions of students and faculty alike. We encourage you to   try one this year! G.

How do we determine where it lies? Who has more and who less? How do we study its mechanisms and effects, above all in view of the intuition that it is at its most effective when least observable by both agents and observers? Is power at its most effective when most imperceptible, and, if so, how are we to study it? What are the relations between the concept of \u201cpower\u201d and such related concepts as \u201cauthority,\u201d \u201cinfluence,\u201d \u201cmanipulation,\u201d \u201ccoercion,\u201d \u201cforce,\u201d and \u201cviolence\u201d? What is the relationship between so-called \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d power? We will look at some classical writings (from Thomas Hobbes to Max Weber), at modern writers (such as Hannah Arendt, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel Foucault), and at work by contemporary political scientists and sociologists. Abstract discussion will be leavened throughout by case studies exemplifying the conceptual discussion. Cross-listed with Sociology as SOC-UA 935.001. This course can count towards the major in Sociology as either an advanced seminar or elective. Steven Lukes is Professor of Sociology. He studied philosophy, politics, and economics at Oxford, where he obtained his doctorate, writing a thesis on Durkheim under the supervision of the anthropologist E. E. Evans-Prichard. He has previously held posts in Politics and Sociology at Balliol College, Oxford; in Political and Social Theory at the European University Institute in Florence; in Moral Philosophy at the University of Siena; and in Sociology at the London School of Economics. He is a Fellow of the British Academy and an editor of the European Journal of Sociology. His writing and teaching have ranged over political science, political and moral philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and the philosophy of the social sciences. His published works include Emile Durkheim: His Life and Work; Individualism, Marxism, and Morality ; Liberals and Cannibals: The Implications of Diversity ; The Curious Enlightenment of Professor Caritat: A Comedy of Ideas (a novel soon to be reissued); and Power: A Radical View , which recently appeared in a much-expanded second edition. He is also co-editor of Rationality and Relativism and The Category of the Person: Anthropology, Philosophy, History . His most recent book is Moral Relativism . What is Memory? AHSEM-UA 187 (class # 19746)  Instructor: Suzanne England Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia. Thanks to the written records that serve as our cultural memory, we know that memory has been a topic of inquiry at least since those records began. Today\u2019s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as how is memory embodied? How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self\u2014and with language and story-telling\u2014and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center\u2019s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that serves their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed. Cross-listed with the Silver School of Social Work as UNDSW-US 79.001. Suzanne England is a Professor at the Silver School of Social Work at NYU. She holds degrees from the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Illinois Chicago, and Tulane University. She was Dean of the Silver School at NYU from 2001 to 2009 and Dean at the Tulane Graduate School of Social Work from 1994 to 2001. Professor England\u2019s teaching includes methods of human inquiry, social policy and politics, narrative approaches to policy and advocacy, management and organizational practice, and ethical leadership. Her current research is on narratives\u2014literary, dramatic, autobiographical, and popular culture representations of aging, old age, memory, caregiving and domestic space. This research is at the nexus of moral philosophy and memory studies as she seeks to develop frameworks for examining memory and forgetting in moral performances, and the expressions of meta-narratives and archetypes of aging, old age and age-related dementias in contemporary literature and popular culture. Making History: Culture and Politics in the Caribbean AHSEM-UA 204 (class # 11940)  Instructor: Sibylle Fischer Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m. In this seminar we will study the culture and politics of the Caribbean. The class is organized around key moments of Caribbean history: \u201cDiscovery;\u201d slavery and the struggles against it; colonialism and independence movements; U.S. occupations, dictatorships and revolutionary movements; the massive growth of a Caribbean diaspora; and the transformation of the Caribbean islands into so many tourist destinations. While the Spanish-speaking islands (Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic) are at the center, the French and English-speaking Caribbean (and questions that concern the Caribbean as a region), will be part of the discussion. Readings are drawn from primary sources (slave testimonies, declarations of independence, revolutionary discourses), literary texts, film, and important essays in cultural studies/critical theory, anthropology, and history. The class will be taught in English. Reading of texts in the original language is encouraged. Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 551.002 and with History as HIST-UA 760.001. Sibylle Fischer holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and Spanish from Columbia University. She has held teaching positions at Duke as well as at Princeton and now teaches in the Department of Spanish &amp; Portuguese and the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU, with affiliations with Comparative Literature and Africana Studies.

Jewish Women in Modern History AHSEM-UA 219 (class # 23214)  Instructor: Marion Kaplan Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. This course will approach Jewish women\u2019s history from the perspective of social history. After an introduction to the normative role of women in Judaism, the body of the course will focus on Jewish women in Modern Europe and America, analyzing their history in a variety of countries from the American and French Revolutions, through the bourgeois 19th century, World War I, the interwar era, the Nazi era, and postwar Europe and the United States. Students will read secondary sources but we will pay particular attention to memoirs, diaries, and letters. Students will learn about the prescriptive roles of Jewish women in the home, family, religion, and worlds of work and social life. They will focus, however, on the actual activities of Jewish women, what they did, rather than what they were supposed to do. They will investigate the rich variety of responsibilities and tasks that women performed in the (often intersecting) private and public spheres of life, how they both preserved religion in the modern era and also mediated non-Jewish culture for their families. They will further note that women both kept the Jewish family and community together and reached out to non-Jews, joining in secular women\u2019s organizations, local community projects, and the field of social work and teaching. They will discover that women\u2019s roles were often contested and always crucial to the Jewish community.

Anthropology in the Horror Film AHSEM-UA 220 (class # 23219)  Instructor: Edward Hubbard Thursday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. Anthropologists have appeared as protagonists and key characters in many horror films. Films like The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988), Ganja and Hess (1973), Candyman (1992) and Cannibal Holocaust (1980), have pitted the anthropologist against powerful spirits and demons, accursed artifacts, mutant beasts, malevolent sorcerers and ferocious cannibals. This course is a critical examination of the anthropologist and anthropological research as conventions of the horror film. Through weekly screenings, reading and discussions, we will examine filmic representations of the anthropologist as a liminal figure \u2013 a hapless intermediary between science and superstition, between modernity and arcane tradition \u2013 who grapples methodologically with both rationalist and non-rationalist epistemes. We will also examine cinematic depictions of fieldwork as a terrifying, ill-advised crossing of social, cultural, geographic, and temporal boundaries. These films will be used as a basis to consider the major disciplinary problems, anxieties and even phobias arising out of anthropology\u2019s troubled place in the history of the West. We will look at the often complimentary roles played by anthropological science and the horror genre in constructing, popularizing and sometimes challenging Western notions of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality and citizenship.

Migration, Citizenship, and Belonging AHSEM-UA 221 (class # 23220)  Instructor: Arely Zimmerman Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m. New modalities of economic organization and relationships, innovations in technology and communication, and the sheer rate of growth of Latin American migration to U.S. cities has impacted the modes and practices of identity, community and membership in U.S. Latino communities. This course examines the normative and political dilemmas around issues of citizenship, belonging, and national identity amongst U.S. Latinos- brought about by immigration, transnationalism, neoliberalism, and globalization. These dilemmas revolve around themes national identity and sovereignty, democratic citizenship, and the rights of immigrants. The class will draw from a wide array of readings in political and legal theory, sociology, anthropology, and U.S. Latino studies. By the end of the class, students will be able to articulate and understand political theories of nation-state citizenship, including its historical, sociological, and legal underpinnings. Importantly, students will have a deep understanding of how citizenship is transformed as both a legal status and a set of practices that constitute contemporary political and social membership.

Empire and Decolonization AHSEM-UA 222 (class # 23573)  Instructor: Manu Goswami Thursday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. This class examines the global history of empire and decolonization, focusing on the case studies of the Spanish Empire from the nineteenth century and the British Empire in the twentieth century. These two great empires \u2013 the first running from the 15th to the 19th centuries, the second from the 18th to the 20th \u2013 are often contrasted as opposites: where the Spanish Empire is seen as the great bastion of medieval Catholicism, the British Empire is taken as Protestant and liberal. Where the first is thought of as founded through conquest and war, the second is often described as taking place through settlement and commerce. This course will question these oppositions, examining how both colonial projects of rule, and the nationalist movements that emerged against them, helped create the ideas and institutions associated with liberalism and democracy. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 569.001 . Manu Goswami is Associate Professor of History and the author of Producing India: From Colonial Economy to National Space (2004).

Rival Monarchies: Old Regime Spain and France AHSEM-UA 223 (class # 23574)  Instructor: Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schaub Wednesday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. In the memory of the history of Western Europe, the 16th century was Spanish, the 17th French, and the 18th British. The aim of this seminar is to tell the story of a 200 year duel between two archenemies: France and Spain from the Late Middle Ages to the eve of the Enlightenment. Both powers alternatively dominated during these 200 years. At the end of the period, Spain was still the most powerful European colonial empire and France the most threatening continental power upon the European soil. This is a story of wars, conquest and frontiers. The seminar will provide students with a dynamic overview of the rivalry of the two most powerful European monarchies and empires in the Early Modern Times, before the rising of the British power.

The Search for Authenticity AHSEM-UA 225 (class # 23681) Instructor: David Samuels Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. How should human beings sound? This is a question that has linked ideas about music to ideas about ethics for 100 years or more. The social and ethical dilemmas of two world wars and the global spread of industrial modernity created a challenge: how can we maintain our true humanity in the face of these traumas and disruptions? In this course we will explore three areas of musical life: folk music revivals, ethnomusicology, and historical performance movements. By attending to links between them, we will attempt to address questions about the role of \u201cauthenticity\u201d in musical and ethical discourse; how concerns about authenticity have colored critical responses to various musical styles and performers; and whether, in the end, authenticity is really what people have been worried about at all. Cross-listed with Music as MUSIC-UA 153.002. David Samuels is Associate Professor of Music at NYU. He is a linguistic anthropologist, folklorist, and ethnomusicologist, and received his Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Texas. His book Putting A Song On Top of It: Music and Identity on the San Carlos Apache Reservation (University of Arizona Press, 2004) was the first book-length monograph exploring popular music\u2019s place in the formation of contemporary Indigenous identities. His current work is focused in two main areas: how missionary encounters refigured Indigenous ideologies of language, culture, and aesthetics; and the ethical ideas suffusing various musical movements in the 20th and 21st centuries. Literature and Machines AHSEM-UA 226 (class # 24031) Instructor: Nicola Cipani Tuesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Machine metaphors play an important role in modern literature, conveying beliefs, anxieties, shifts, and reflections on key topics, including the nature of consciousness and creativity; the dynamics of desire and gratification; gender roles; the organization of society; the meaning of \"nature\"; and the function of technology. This course explores different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal; and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines). Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural contexts, primarily from the late 19th and 20th century (e.g., Belle \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion. Nicola Cipani is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Department of Italian Studies and has been working at NYU for ten years. His interests include reception of antiquity in medieval and early modern culture, Renaissance philosophy, the intersection of verbal/ visual forms (such as the art of memory, emblem books, and representations of dreams), and 20th-century experimental literature. At the Italian Department he has served in the capacity of Director of Language Programs (since 2005), Director of Summer Programs (2011-12), and Director of Undergraduate Studies (2011, 2013). Latin America's 1968 AHSEM-UA 229 (class # 24553)  Instructor: Jill Lane Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. In Latin America, the year 1968 marked a turning point in the social, political, and cultural transformations that had had been unfolding in the wake of the Cuban Revolution of 1959. For Latin America, as for the rest of the world, the sixties were shaped by the geopolitics of the Cold War and of anti-colonial struggles across the globe. Yet they are most remembered by those who lived them as a time when ordinary people felt, like never before and perhaps never after, that they could change the course of history. Millions of youth in student movements, advocates for indigenous rights, workers, campesinos, educators, intellectuals, and artists, along with guerrillas and other armed insurgents, were self-aware actors in world-historical projects of radical social, political, economic, and cultural change. In these years, the personal became political, politics became theatrical, theatre became a weapon, and the lines between self, art, and politics were forever changed. In this course we study the complex relations between revolution, counterculture, and authoritarian rule as they emerged in Latin America\u2019s 1968: the emergence of Brazil\u2019s Cinema Novo, Cuba\u2019s imperfect cinema, and militant documentary across the region; the rise of rock and activist nueva canci\u00f3n; and the apogee of student activism and the counterculture in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. We encounter 1968 through art, music, film, fiction, journalism and news coverage, along with other primary documents from the period. No knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese is needed for this course; students with these languages may read texts in the original. Jill Lane is Director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, and Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at NYU.
