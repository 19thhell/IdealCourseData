These pages on the web are  placed here by students working with Prof. Dougherty, see the   HTML Gesellschaft .  They are not always up to date.    COURSE DESCRIPTION: This class introduces  students to the basic computational tools available for formulating linguistic  and psycho-linguistic models of competence and performance. We will discuss  classical problems in perception and description of verb particle constructions,  questions, passives and garden path sentences. Formulations will be in Chomsky's  grammar (Minimalism), GPSG, HPSG, and LFG. We will consider how parsers operate  in structurally different languages such as Chinese, English, French, and  German. Students will learn sufficient computer skills (Unix, lisp, and Prolog)  to run programs that model a human being's language production and perception  capacities. Students will have computer accounts in the PC Lab and on a Unix  system and obtain hands on experience with artificial intelligence and expert  systems programs using symbolic logical based computer languages. Students will  use the World Wide Web and the Internet. Students may base their research on  existing programs or they may write their own.       Basics This document.

Students must have permission of the  instructor or have taken one of the introductory courses in the Language and  Mind major. See the catalog or contact  Prof. Dougherty for details. We assume that students are unfamiliar with  computational concepts ( level, parser, bottom-up, morphology, etc),  Chomsky's minimalist program, and the computer language Prolog.       COURSE REQUIREMENTS: The requirements are  detailed in the document:   Course Final Project . There are four projects due  during the term. These add together to yield a final project. As a final  project, each student will write a Prolog program to pair English coordinate  expressions incorporating the quantifiers (each, all, both, and so on), the  coordinating conjunctions (and, or, nor), and the distributive adverbs  (simultaneously, en masse, and so on) with a logical form. Students may write  their Prolog program using other languages (French, Spanish, etc.). We will show   how to link the various language particular parsers via the logical form to  obtain a simple translation machine.    Due at lecture 6, Project 1, 10% of final grade.    Due at lecture 11, Project 2, 10% of final grade.    Due at lecture 15, Project 3, 10% of final grade.    Due at lecture 20, Project 4, 10% of final grade.

We discuss classical problems in perception and cognition of the sounds, syntax, and meanings of human and animal languages in works by Chomsky, Hauser, Fitch, Pinker, and Lieberman. Equal time is given to (a) computational models to assign phrase markers, finite state graphs, etc. to sentences and nominal   compounds and (b) recent mathematical models to explain the relation of human language to animal communication and the evolution of human language complexity. We discuss some of the work by Wolfram on biological complexity using Cellular Automata. No computer expertise is assumed. Students will be introduced to everything relevant to computation in the class. All software is on the NYU system. Students will learn to run public domain software to parse, analyze, and synthesize the signals of human an animal communication as discussed by Chomsky in his Minimalist Perspective. Computational Linguistics and Mathematical Linguistics are fields currently in turmoil owing to new hardware, software, and conceptual studies. Students will learn what the fundamental issues are and see demonstrations of the problems and solutions on computer facilities available to any NYU student. Most of the readings are in recently published articles (after 2000).     Updated on 04&#047;16&#047;2014       Back to top             Contact us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
