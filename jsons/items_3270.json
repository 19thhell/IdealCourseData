Established in 1958 as NYU's first global academic center, NYU Madrid offers students with little or no Spanish language skills a Fast-Track Spanish for Beginners program that includes a set of four courses designed to bring them to proficiency in one semester. During the spring semester, students with advanced Spanish language skills may enroll in up to two courses at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM). Homestays with Spanish host families encourage students to build a deeper connection with Spanish culture and provides an opportunity to practice speaking in a more casual environment. An Intercambio Program brings NYU Madrid students together with local college students to practice their Spanish and make friends.       Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of the liveliest and friendliest capital cities in Europe, replete with magnificent architecture, world-class museums, and delicious cuisine. Students at NYU Madrid enjoy a semester of rich cultural experiences that complement their studies, whether they\u2019re on a class trip to the Museo del Prado to learn firsthand about Goya's masterpieces or at an out-of-the way tapas bar on Cava Baja.

New York has been a  meeting point for Spanish and Latin American writers and journalists since the  19th century and a home to many of them. Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed (Cuba), Gabriela Mistral  (Chile), Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca (Spain), Julia de Burgos (Puerto Rico),  Francisco Ayala (Spain), Pedro Pietri (Puerto Rico) Manuel Ramos Otero (Puerto  Rico), Manuel Puig (Argentina) and Reinaldo Arenas (Cuba), among many others,  have in the past either settled in New York or spent extended periods of time  there.           The end of the 20th century has seen this community of  writers grow considerably both in visibility and cultural significance.  Nowadays many Spanish and Latin American writers, such as Carmen Boullosa (M\u00e9xico),  Cecilia Vicu\u00f1a (Chile ), Eduardo Lago (Spain), Mercedes Roff\u00e9 (Argentina),  Carmen Valle (Puerto Rico) and Roger Santiv\u00e1\u00f1ez (Peru) make of New York their permanent home.

Established in 1958 as NYU's first global academic center, NYU Madrid offers students with little or no Spanish language skills a Fast-Track Spanish for Beginners program that includes a set of four courses designed to bring them to proficiency in one semester. During the spring semester, students with advanced Spanish language skills may enroll in up to two courses at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM). Homestays with Spanish host families encourage students to build a deeper connection with Spanish culture and provides an opportunity to practice speaking in a more casual environment. An Intercambio Program brings NYU Madrid students together with local college students to practice their Spanish and make friends.       Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of the liveliest and friendliest capital cities in Europe, replete with magnificent architecture, world-class museums, and delicious cuisine. Students at NYU Madrid enjoy a semester of rich cultural experiences that complement their studies, whether they\u2019re on a class trip to the Museo del Prado to learn firsthand about Goya's masterpieces or at an out-of-the way tapas bar on Cava Baja.

New York has been a  meeting point for Spanish and Latin American writers and journalists since the  19th century and a home to many of them. Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed (Cuba), Gabriela Mistral  (Chile), Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca (Spain), Julia de Burgos (Puerto Rico),  Francisco Ayala (Spain), Pedro Pietri (Puerto Rico) Manuel Ramos Otero (Puerto  Rico), Manuel Puig (Argentina) and Reinaldo Arenas (Cuba), among many others,  have in the past either settled in New York or spent extended periods of time  there.           The end of the 20th century has seen this community of  writers grow considerably both in visibility and cultural significance.  Nowadays many Spanish and Latin American writers, such as Carmen Boullosa (M\u00e9xico),  Cecilia Vicu\u00f1a (Chile ), Eduardo Lago (Spain), Mercedes Roff\u00e9 (Argentina),  Carmen Valle (Puerto Rico) and Roger Santiv\u00e1\u00f1ez (Peru) make of New York their permanent home.
