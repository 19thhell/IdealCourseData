General Pedagogical Core Syllabi and Course Descriptions          Course ID Title Description             TCHL-GE 2000    Field Consultations    On-site consultation for in-service personnel by faculty on such problems as goal selection, curriculum development, or evaluation. In-service personnel and faculty sponsor mutually identify a problem and develop and implement a plan. May be taken on group or individual basis. Registration requires submission of field consultation from and approval of faculty sponsor and program director.          TCHL-GE 2010    Inquiries Into Teaching &amp; Learning III    Introduces graduate level preservice teachers to the complexities of teaching by exploring four major themes -- learning, knowledge and knowing, teachers and teaching, schools and schooling. Each theme is investigated by analyzing issues of the learner's autobiography, the challenges of diversity, the power of collaboration, and uses of reflection. Students read and respond to a range of relevant tests, engage in observation of an elementary or secondary school classroom, create a classroom portrait with a focus on a particular learner, and produce a learning portfolio.          TCHL-GE 2013    Applied Research Design    Based on the formal principles of experimental and survey design, this course prepares students to design sound quantitative research studies that take into account the practical constraints of the real world. Topics include formulating research questions, identifying relevant target populations, selecting and sampling study participants, choosing which predictors to study, defining comparison groups, identifying appropriate measures, determining sample size, and evaluating the outcomes. Appropriate for doctoral students preparing to write a dissertation proposal.

Strategies for general and special education teachers to meet the cognitive, emotional, and social needs of adolescents in urban contexts.
