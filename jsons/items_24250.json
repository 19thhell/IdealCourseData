Rangan            Prerequisites : Undergraduate linear     algebra.            Linear algebra is two things in one: a general methodology     for solving linear systems, and a beautiful abstract     structure underlying much of mathematics and the sciences.     This course will try to strike a balance between both. We     will follow the book of our own Peter Lax, which does a     superb job in describing the mathematical structure of     linear algebra, and complement it with applications and     computing. The most advanced topics include spectral theory,     convexity, duality, and various matrix decompositions.             Text : Lax, P.D. (2007).

Prerequisites : Elements of linear algebra and the     theory of rings and fields.            The objects of study in algebraic geometry are systems     defined by polynomial equations. Here are some examples:      1. x^2+y^2+z^2-w^2=0;      2. y^2=x^3-2x      3. x^2+y^2=u^2, x^2+z^2=v^2, y^2+z^2=w^2, x^2+y^2+z^2=t^2.            The first example gives a projective quadric; the second one     defines an elliptic curve. The rational solutions of the     third one provide a rectangular box such that the lengths of     the edges, face diagonals, and long diagonals are rational     numbers. The existence of such a solution is still not     known.            We will start this introductory course with some topics from     the commutative algebra, such as ideals in polynomial rings     and the famous Nullstellensatz theorem. We will also discuss     some projective geometry in dimension two. A large part of     the course will be devoted to the study of elliptic curves     over various fields: finite fields, fields of rational or     complex numbers. For elliptic curves defined over finite     fields we will discuss as well applications in cryptography.                                                                        MATH-GA     2170.001 INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY      3 points. Fall term.      Monday, 11:00-12:50, O. Regev.                 Prerequisites : Strong mathematical     background.            The primary focus of this course will be on definitions and     constructions of various cryptographic objects, such as     pseudo-random generators, encryption schemes, digital     signature schemes, message authentication codes, block     ciphers, and others time permitting. We will try to     understand what security properties are desirable in such     objects, how to properly define these properties, and how to     design objects that satisfy them. Once we establish a good     definition for a particular object, the emphasis will be on     constructing examples that provably satisfy the definition.     Thus, a main prerequisite of this course is mathematical     maturity and a certain comfort level with proofs. Secondary     topics that we will cover only briefly will be current     cryptographic practice and the history of cryptography and     cryptanalisys.

Undergraduate     students planning to take this course must have V63.0343     Algebra I or permission of the Department.            After introducing metric and general topological spaces, the     emphasis will be on the algebraic topology of manifolds and     cell complexes. Elements of algebraic topology to be covered     include fundamental groups and covering spaces, homotopy and     the degree of maps and its applications. Some differential     topology will be introduced including transversality and     intersection theory. Some examples will be taken from knot     theory.             Recommended Texts : Hatcher, A.

Prerequisites : (Serial) programming experience with     C/C++ or FORTRAN (C will mostly be used in class), and some     familiarity with numerical methods.           This class will be an introduction to the fundamentals of     parallel scientific computing. We will establish a basic     understanding of modern computer architectures (CPUs and     accelerators, memory hierarchies, interconnects) and of     parallel approaches to programming these machines (distributed     vs. shared memory parallelism: MPI, OpenMP, OpenCL). Issues     such as load balancing, communication, and synchronization     will be covered and illustrated in the context of parallel     numerical algorithms. Since a prerequisite for good parallel     performance is good serial performance, this aspect will also     be addressed. Along the way you will be exposed to important     tools for high performance computing such as debuggers,     schedulers, visualization, and version control systems.           This will be a hands-on class, with several parallel (and     serial) computing assignments, in which students can and will     have to explore material independently. Students will learn     some Unix in this course.           Text : Rauber, T., &amp; Runger, G. (2013). Parallel                       Programming for Multicore and Cluster Systems (2nd     ed.).

Fall Term             Prerequisites : Univariate statistics, multivariate     calculus, linear algebra, and basic computing (e.g.     familiarity with MATLAB or co-registration in Computing in     Finance).           A comprehensive introduction to the theory and     practice of portfolio management, the central component of     which is risk management. Econometric techniques are     surveyed and applied to these disciplines. Topics covered     include: factor and principal-component models, CAPM,     dynamic asset pricing models, Black-Litterman, forecasting     techniques and pitfalls, volatility modeling,     regime-switching models, and many facets of risk management,     both theory and practice.                 Spring Term                Risk Management is arguably one of the most     important tools for managing a trading book and quantifying     the effects of leverage and diversification (or lack     thereof).            This course is an introduction to risk-management techniques     for portfolios of (i) equities and delta-1 securities and     futures (ii) equity derivatives (iii) fixed income     securities and derivatives, including credit derivatives,     and (iv) mortgage-backed securities.            A systematic approach to the subject is adopted, based on     selection of risk factors, econometric analysis,     extreme-value theory for tail estimation, correlation     analysis, and copulas to estimate joint factor     distributions. We will cover the construction of     risk-measures (e,g. VaR and Expected Shortfall) and     historical back-testing of portfolios. We also review     current risk-models and practices used by large financial     institutions and clearinghouses.            If time permits, the course will also cover models for     managing the liquidity risk of portfolios of financial     instruments.

The first part of the course will cover the theoretical     aspects of portfolio construction and optimization. The     focus will be on advanced techniques in portfolio     construction, addressing the extensions to traditional     mean-variance optimization including robust optimization,     dynamical programming and Bayesian choice. The second part     of the course will focus on the econometric issues     associated with portfolio optimization. Issues such as     estimation of returns, covariance structure, predictability,     and the necessary econometric techniques to succeed in     portfolio management will be covered. Readings will be drawn     from the literature and extensive class notes.                MATH-GA 2753.001 ADVANCED RISK     MANAGEMENT      3 points. Spring term.      Monday, 7:10-9:00, Instructor TBA.           Prerequisites : Derivative     Securities, Computing in Finance or equivalent programming.            The importance of financial risk management has been     increasingly recognized over the last several years. This     course gives a broad overview of the field, from the     perspective of both a risk management department and of a     trading desk manager, with an emphasis on the role of     financial mathematics and modeling in quantifying risk. The     course will discuss how key players such as regulators, risk     managers, and senior managers interact with trading.     Specific techniques for measuring and managing the risk of     trading and investment positions will be discussed for     positions in equities, credit, interest rates, foreign     exchange, commodities, vanilla options, and exotic options.     Students will be trained in developing risk sensitivity     reports and using them to explain income, design static and     dynamic hedges, and measure value-at-risk and stress tests.     Students will create Monte Carlo simulations to determine     hedge effectiveness. Extensive use will be made of examples     drawn from real trading experience, with a particular     emphasis on lessons to be learned from trading disasters.             Text : Allen, S.L. (2003).

MATH-GA 2797.001 CREDIT MARKETS     AND MODELS      3 points. Fall term.      Wednesday, 7:10-9:00, Instructor TBA.           Prerequisites : Computing in     Finance (or equivalent), Derivative Securities (or     equivalent), familiarity with analytical methods applied to     interest rate derivatives.            This course addresses a number of practical issues concerned     with modeling, pricing and risk management of a range of     fixed-income securities and structured products exposed to     default risk. Emphasis is on developing intuition and     practical skills in analyzing pricing and hedging problems.     In particular, significant attention is devoted to credit     derivatives.            We begin with discussing default mechanism and its     mathematical representation. Then we proceed to building     risky discount curves from market prices and applying this     analytics to pricing corporate bonds, asset swaps, and     credit default swaps. Risk management of credit books will     be addressed as well. We will next examine pricing and     hedging of options on assets exposed to default risk.            After that, we will discuss structural (Merton-style) models     that connect corporate debt and equity through the firm\u2019s     total asset value. Applications of this approach include the     estimation of default probability and credit spread from     equity prices and effective hedging of credit curve     exposures.            A final segment of the course will focus on credit     structured products. We start with cross-currency swaps with     a credit overlay. We will next analyze models for pricing     portfolio transactions using Merton-style approach. We also     will discuss portfolio loss model based on a transition     matrix approach. These models will then be applied to the     pricing of collateralized debt obligation tranches and     pricing counterparty credit risk taking wrong-way exposure     into account.

Thursday, 5:10-7:00, Instructor TBA.           Prerequisites : Derivative     Securities, Stochastic Calculus, and Computing in Finance     (or equivalent familiarity with financial models, stochastic     methods, and computing skills).            The course is divided into two parts. The first addresses     the fixed-income models most frequently used in the finance     industry, and their applications to the pricing and hedging     of interest-based derivatives. The second part covers the     foreign exchange derivatives markets, with a focus on     vanilla options and first-generation (flow) exotics.     Throughout both parts, the emphasis is on practical aspects     of modeling, and the significance of the models for the     valuation and risk management of widely-used derivative     instruments.

Prerequisites : Knowledge of PDE,     complex analysis, numerical methods, and experience in     programming are strongly recommended.            This course will be an introduction to several numerical     methods known as \"fast analysis-based algorithms,\" including     fast multiple methods, butterfly algorithms, hierarchical     matrix compression and fast direct solvers. These     algorithms can be used to solve many of the PDE governing     classical mathematical physics, namely electromagnetics,     acoustics, heat diffusion, and fluid dynamics. There are     additional applications in signal processing and data     analysis. Methods from potential theory, applied     analysis, functional analysis, numerical linear algebra,     complex analysis, and asymptotic analysis are central to the     construction of almost all such algorithms.            Grading will be based on a course project.                MATH-GA     2830.003 ADVANCED TOPICS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS (Convex     Duality in Math Finance)      3 points. Fall term.

Spring term.      Monday, 1:25-3:15, C.      Fernandez-Granda .             Prerequisites : Basic knowledge of probability and     linear algebra.             In recent years, optimization-based techniques have had     a major impact in two areas of data analysis: inverse     problems and statistical estimation in high-dimensional     spaces. The main principle underlying these techniques is to     exploit nonparametric prior knowledge about the data by     solving tractable optimization problems. Some representative     examples include sparse regression analysis of genomic data,     compressed sensing in medical imaging and signal processing,     and low-rank models in recommender systems and computer     vision. This course provides an introduction to     optimization-based methods by describing the theoretical     tools used to analyze them, the computational algorithms     developed to implement them and some of their main     applications.

Tuesday, 9:00-10:50, D. Giannakis .           This course serves as an introduction to     the fundamentals of geophysical fluid dynamics. No prior     knowledge of fluid dynamics will be assumed, but the course     will move quickly into the subtopic of rapidly rotating,     stratified flows. Topics to be covered include (but are not     limited to): the advective derivative, momentum conservation     and continuity, the rotating Navier-Stokes equations and     non-dimensional parameters, equations of state and     thermodynamics of Newtonian fluids, atmospheric and oceanic     basic states, the fundamental balances (thermal wind,     geostrophic and hydrostatic), the rotating shallow water     model, vorticity and potential vorticity, inertia-gravity     waves, geostrophic adjustment, the quasi-geostrophic     approximation and other small-Rossby number limits, Rossby     waves, baroclinic and barotropic instabilities, Rayleigh and     Charney-Stern theorems, geostrophic turbulence. Students     will be assigned bi-weekly homework assignments and some     computer exercises, and will be expected to complete a final     project. This course will be supplemented with out-of-class     instruction.             Recommended Texts : Vallis, G.K. (2006).

Tuesday, 1:25-3:15, O.     Pauluis .           What effects the large scale circulation of the     atmosphere? Like the antiquated heating system of     a New York apartment, solar radiation unevenly warms the     Earth, leading to gradients in energy in both altitude and     latitude. But unlike the simple convection of air in     your drafty home, the effects of rotation, stratification, and     moisture lead to exotic variations in weather and climate,     giving us something to chat about over morning coffee... and     occasionally bringing modern life to a standstill.           The goals of this course are to describe and understand the     processes that govern atmospheric fluid flow, from the Hadley     cells of the tropical troposphere to the polar night jet of     the extratropical stratosphere, and to prepare you for     research in the climate sciences. Building on your     foundation in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, we will explore how     stratification and rotation regulate the atmosphere's response     to gradients in heat and moisture. Much of our work will     be to explain the zonal mean circulation of the atmosphere,     but in order to accomplish this we\u2019ll need to learn a great     deal about deviations from the zonal mean: eddies and     waves. It turns out that eddies and waves, planetary,     synoptic (weather system size) and smaller in scale, are the     primary drivers of the zonal mean circulation throughout much,     if not all, of the atmosphere.           There will also be a significant numerical modeling component     to the course. You will learn how to run an atmospheric     model on NYU's High Performance Computing facility, and then     design and conduct experiments to test the theory developed in     class for a final course project.

Amidst the shouting over climate change and what action should     be taken about it, this course seeks to focus in on the     science of climate prediction. We will work our way through     the components of state-of-the-art climate models, endeavoring     to understand, or at least appreciate, the science and     approximations that lie behind predictions of future climate     change. The course will proceed in seminar format.     Participants will be expected to read background material on     climate models and complete a research oriented project,     running and/or analyzing the output from an IPCC class climate     model. No experience in climate modeling is required, but a     basic knowledge of fluid dynamics and physics will help.           Our goal is to work through the key components of a climate     model. The Earth\u2019s climate is determined by interactions     between the atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere (ice sheets,     glaciers, sea ice) and land surfaces (terrestrial hydrology,     biology, etc.). This course will be biased towards the     atmospheric component of a climate model, but we will seek to     understand how interactions between the atmosphere and the     other elements of the climate system are represented in     models.

A feature of this course is that such     concepts, usually presented in advanced mathematical     settings, are here described in a more elementary framework     requiring no knowledge of measure theory; nevertheless,     analytical thinking and mathematical rigor will still be     required at the level of a graduate course (undergraduate     courses on relevant topics include MATH-UA 233, 234 and     235). Topics include: probability spaces, random variables,     distributions, expectations and variances, law of large     numbers, central limit theorem, Markov chains, random walk,     diffusion processes including Brownian motion, and     martingales.

To understand the behavior of a deterministic or random     dynamical system, it is often useful to find and study     stationary regimes or invariant distributions, since they     govern long-term statisticalproperties of the system. From     this point of view, existence and uniqueness of invariant     distributions and, more generally, description of all     invariant distributions along with convergence to     equilibrium become important questions that this course will     be centered around.            The course will begin with a discussion of deterministic     dynamics, then proceed to Markov processes and random     dynamics. The state space      for Markov processes will be consecutively assumed to be     finite, countable, finite dimensional, infinite dimensional,     and appropriate methods and notions will be discussed such     as compactness, Krylov--Bogolyubov method, coupling,     regularity conditions of minorization type, Doeblin and     Harris conditions, strong Feller property, Lyapunov     functions, asymptotic strong Feller property, asymptotic     coupling, one force -- one solution principle. In the end of     this course, these notions will be applied to stochastic     PDEs such as stochastic Navier--Stokes system and stochastic     Burgers equation.            Good knowledge of probability and measure theory is required     (at the level of Probability: Limit Theorems 1). No     knowledge of ergodic theory, dynamical systems, or Markov     processes will be assumed (although acquaintance with those     subjects will make the course more meaningful). A     significant amount of time in this course will be devoted to     material that may be viewed as preparatory.
