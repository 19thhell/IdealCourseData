The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems. Read more...

Our counselor is professionally trained and familiar with the many types of challenges typically faced by college students. Students can speak with the counselor regarding various academic issues such as:      time management    test preparation    test-taking anxiety    conquering procrastination    goal-setting     The Counselor works with students to improve in these areas, address any academic deficiencies, and build on their strengths.   Study Skills Development   To expose students to better study techniques, the TRIO Scholars Program requires all new students to attend a Study Skills Seminar, a crash course in the basic skills needed for college survival. We also offer in-depth coverage of developing study skills during a monthly workshop series deigned to help students improve academic performance.   Personal Counseling   We offer individual counseling to help students deal with a wide range of personal issues that may impair their academic performance or well-being. The personal counseling program can help students with family matters, personal adjustment, career planning, financial issues, and mental health concerns. Students generally meet with the counselor every other week, or as needed, to address these issues and limit the stress they can cause. While the TRIO counselor can assist students with some mental health issues, more complex issues are treated at the NYU Counseling and Wellness Center.   Graduate School Planning   Various activities to encourage students to pursue a graduate school education take place throughout the academic year. We offer workshops on how to research graduate schools, complete applications, and apply for financial aid. Individualized graduate school planning and counseling is also available to TRIO students.   Career Counseling and Assessment   We offer a variety of ways for students to get help determining their career paths. Students have the opportunity to complete an individualized career assessment and can speak to the counselor about how to choose a career that fits their abilities and interests. We also organize career workshops on topics such as resume writing and interviewing skills throughout the academic year.   Financial Aid Counseling   We assist students in securing the most appropriate financial aid resources available through individual counseling, workshops, and technical assistance sessions.
