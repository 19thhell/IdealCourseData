Throughout the semester, we will  read bodies of different sorts: the criminal body and the discourses of  discipline and exemplarity that it joins together, the saintly body as  a double of the diabolically possessed body and the scripts of ecstasy  that differ in their readings but not in the symptoms they manifest,  the witch\u2019s body as a site of seductive excess, the body of a married  woman as the meeting place of surveillance and subjectivity, the  tortured body and its strange alliance with truth, the monarch\u2019s body  as a site of power and impotence, the cross-dressed body and the way it  exposes the constructedness of gender categories, the Other\u2019s body  (Jew, morisco, Amerindian) and the challenges to legibility that it  presents, the medicalized or inquired body that at once requires  examination (a compulsory cure) and resists diagnosis. We will ground  our readings of literary texts by turning also to bodily discourses of  a slightly different order: early modern anatomical treatises that  place the body at the center of a theater of dissection, political arbitrios   that propose cures of various sorts for a national body deemed  diseased, maps that chart the globe in terms of a body, Inquisitorial  torture manuals, tracts on the disciplining and containment of errant  women and the particular threat of sexual contagion (syphillis) that  they represent, spiritual exercises, witch-hunting treatises, documents  on blood purity, etc. Finally, we will read various critical and  theoretical works that take up bodily concerns from different vantage  points.
