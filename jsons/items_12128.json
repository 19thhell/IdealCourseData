Click here to download the CV              Professor Becker's research interests include Christian martyrdom in the Sasanian Empire, Jewish-Christian relations in Late Antiquity, the social and intellectual history of the Syriac (Christian Aramaic) tradition, the missionary encounter in the nineteenth century, and the theoretical problems relating to the study of religion in pre-modernity. His book, Fear of God and the Beginning of Wisdom: The School of Nisibis and the Development of Christian Scholastic Culture in Late Antique Mesopotamia (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006), is a history of the East Syrian (i.e. Syriac \"Nestorian\" Christian) school movement and includes material on the reception of the Neoplatonic version of Aristotelian logic in Mesopotamia in the sixth century CE. He has also published an annotated translation of some of the most important East Syrian school sources. His most recent book, Revival and Awakening: American Evangelical Missionaries and the Origins of Assyrian Nationalism (forthcoming March 2015) addresses the interaction between American Evangelical missionaries and the indigenous Christian community of upper Mesoptamia in the nineteenth and early twentieth century and the secular ethnic nationalism that resulted from this encounter. He is currently working on Syriac sources from late fifth century upper Mesopotamia to address the question of Christianity and inculturation. Prof. Becker's background is in philology and history of religions in antiquity, but he regularly teaches courses on secularism and social theoretical approaches to religion. His undergraduate lecture courses include \"Introduction to the New Testament,\" \"Martyrdom: Ancient and Modern,\" and \"Utopias and Dystopias.\" He often reads Latin, Greek, and Syriac sources with students.

                 Jan 07, 2011                                The\u00a0 Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York University , seeks to make\u00a0 an appointment (tenured or tenure-track, rank open) of a wide-ranging scholar in the languages, literatures, and cultures of the Near East in the Roman, Late Antique, and early Islamic periods. The principal areas of interest should be in the Semitic languages (Aramaic, Syriac, and Arabic, in particular) rather than in Greek, but specialization is less important than broad interests and connections with neighboring regions and cultures. We seek individuals of scholarly distinction whose work will benefit from freedom from departmental structures and who will be stimulated by working closely with colleagues in other disciplines, approaches, periods, or geographical areas and who are committed to helping develop the intellectual life of such a community. Applicants with a history of interdisciplinary exchange are particularly welcome. The Institute\u2019s graduate program emphasizes individual supervision and research seminars. The faculty is involved in choosing a group of visiting researchers each year.    Applications (letter, curriculum vitae, and list of referees) should be made through the NYU online system at\u00a0 www.nyuopsearch.com/applicants/Central?quickFind=50564 . Review of candidates will begin on November 1, 2010. For questions, please email Ms. Kathryn Lawson at\u00a0 kathryn.lawson@nyu.edu .
