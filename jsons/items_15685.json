We conduct our research in partnership with community organizations, shelters, schools, and agencies. We work with student members of our research team to act as advocates for our research participants from various marginalized groups. Our current research projects include the following:    E m p o werment-Based Intervention for Domestic Violence Survivors    For this project, we are examining the effects of empowerment-based intervention for women residing in domestic violence shelters. We are collaborating on this project with Dr. Robert Hawkins of the NYU Silver School of Social Work.    The New York Advising Corps Project    In this project, we are partnering with low-income high schools in which we have placed recent NYU graduates as full-time paid college admissions advisers. Our research team members work with the advisors to support students in their goal of gaining admission to colleges by helping them envision plans for their future.    D e velopment of a Scale to Measure Safety for Domestic Violence Survivors    In this project, we are partnering with domestic violence experts (including domestic violence survivors) to develop a scale to measure the construct of safety. The scale will be used to assess changes in the experience of safety as survivors enter shelter housing and move into transitional housing and beyond.    P e r c eptions of Masculinity: Men with Disabilities Who Have Survived Domestic Violence    A counseling center for women with disabilities who survived domestic violence (DV) also serves a number of men with disabilities. Men with disabilities who have experienced DV are not represented in the literature on disability and DV. In this qualitative, exploratory project, we are interviewing men with disabilities who are receiving counseling services to describe their experience of DV and how it relates to their perceptions of themselves as men.    Dr. LaRue Allen The Child and Family Policy Center    The Child and Family Policy Center at NYU Steinhardt works to bring state-of-the field knowledge about how to promote children's healthy development and school success to the forefront of policymaking, program design, and practice. Currently, the Center is seeking volunteers to assist with the Authentic Assessment &amp; Reading Readiness Project and the Ci vic Engagement Project .    Authentic Assessment &amp; Reading Readiness Project    The goal of this project is to support children&rsquo;s reading readiness by helping teachers utilize the authentic assessment data they collect regularly throughout the school year to better prepare 4-year-olds for reading success. This will be accomplished through a series of Forum events, working groups, and a coaching hotline for teachers.    Civic Engagement Project    The civic engagement project comprises several different studies on American, French, Greek, and Polish youths' engagement in both formal and informal political and civic systems, with a specific focus on parents&rsquo; influence on these processes.    Dr. Clancy Blair &amp; Dr. Cybele Raver NYU Neuroscience and Education Lab    Lab Description: Our lab focuses on children&rsquo;s cognitions, emotions and behavior in early educational settings. We study the ways that home and classroom environments support healthy brain development so that young children are ready to succeed in preschool programs such as Head Start. The success of our research depends on successful collaboration among our research team, members of school administration, staff and teachers, and families. We work together, combining scientific knowledge and practitioners&rsquo; expertise to improve educational systems for young children.    The ABC Project    The project aims to implement and evaluate an evidence-based parenting intervention called PALS for children and families facing high levels of adversity with partnering Early Head Start (EHS) grantees in New York City. We will study: (1) if the intervention can be implemented with a high degree of fidelity, (2) the efficacy of the intervention using an experiential design, and (3) the ways that living in poverty links to exposure to toxic stress.    The Pre K Executive Function Project    This project is a partnership with Dr. Michael Willoughby at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. The project aims to validate a battery of computer based tasks measuring executive function that were once paper and pencil. We are currently recruiting a diverse population of 3 to 5 year old in New York City. This is a school based study &ndash; all assessments will take place at school.    Dr. Anil Chacko Families and Children Experiencing Success (FACES) Lab    Lab Description: The Families and Children Experiencing Success (FACES) Lab focuses on the development of accessible, engaging, effective, and sustainable prevention, intervention and service delivery models for youth at-risk for or affected with disruptive behavior disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; oppositional defiant disorder; conduct disorder) and their families. Students have the opportunity to work on the following projects:    Mental Health in Pediatric Care Project    This projects aims to support primary care pediatric settings in providing evidence-informed assessment and treatment of disruptive behavior disorders through the use of technology and through utilizing novel personnel to increase service capacity.    My MFG Project    This project aims to develop/evaluate mobile health technology (My MFG) as an adjunctive intervention to a family-focused intervention (i.e., Multiple Family Groups; MFG) for youth with disruptive behavior disorders and their families within outpatient mental health settings.    Improving ADHD System of Care    This project aims to collaborate with mental health clinicians and administrators on improving evidence-based systems of care to improve engagement in and maintain longer-term benefits of treatment for youth with ADHD in outpatient mental health settings.    Novel ADHD Treatment Project    This project aims to develop novel neurocognitive and skills-based interventions for the treatment of academic, social, and emotional deficits in youth with ADHD in specialized ADHD clinics at NYU School of Medicine and at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.    Improving Family Engagement and Child Competencies in Head Start Project    This project aims to help support family service providers in engaging families in preventive and treatment-focused care for their preschool child in the context of Head Start. Additionally, the project will explore the preliminary efficacy of novel neurocognitive trainings to improve academic readiness in preschool children.    Dr. Arnold Grossman    Dr. Grossman&rsquo;s research project for the 2011-15 longitudinal study is focused on the risk and protective factors of suicidality regarding lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) individuals aged 15-21. The research takes place on and around the Washington Square campus.    Dr. Perry Halkitis &amp; Dr. Farzana Kapadia Center for Health, Identity, Behavior, and Prevention Studies (CHIBPS)    Lab Description : The Center for Health, Identity, Behavior and Prevention Studies (CHIBPS) in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development at New York University is a leading HIV, substance abuse, mental health, and behavior research center that is focused on the well-being of all people, including sexual, racial, ethnic and cultural minorities and other marginalized populations. We train the future generation of behavioral and public health researchers, and work with community partners to conduct research that resides on the hyphen between theory and practice.    Project 18 (P18) is a longitudinal developmental study of risk and resiliencies in a sample of 18 and 19 year old gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, focusing on sexual behavior, substance use, HIV risk factors, and mental health.    Project Gold II , a study being conducted in partnership with the Spencer Cox Center for Health, is aimed at assessing the long-term neurocognitive and mental health effects of HIV in HIV positive men and women over the age of 50.    Geospatial Methods in YMSM is a pilot study that will provide an assessment of the feasibility of using real-time geospatial methods to explore spatial contexts of substance use and HIV risk in young men who have sex with men.    Dr. Diane Hughes  Th e Center for Research on Culture, Development, and Education (CRCDE )    Lab Description: The mission of the CRCDE is to examine the influences of home and school experiences on the cognitive, social, and emotional development of children from diverse ethnic backgrounds. The CRCDE focuses on examining the intersection between culture and developmental processes as they influence children&rsquo;s transitions to school (preschool and high school) in children and youth from diverse ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds.    Under the instruction of principal investigators Diane Hughes and Niobe Way, this lab looks at mother and child interviews for signs of racial and gender socialization and the types of messages (if any) that are picked up by the child from the mother. In this group, we read interviews for both subtle and direct messages at the intersections of race/ethnicity and gender that are demonstrated by mother or child. We also look at this over time, to see if there is an increase or decrease in socialization. Each week we come together as a group to discuss a family and the summary analysis done by a member of the team and discuss the different types of socialization and ways to interpret socialization. From this, we discuss the meaningful ways children learn about race and gender simultaneously.    In addition, in another lab, we took adolescents&rsquo; grades and engagement levels to think about how their grades relate with their own and their parents&rsquo; perceptions of school. In this lab, we look at the academic outcomes of diverse youth throughout middle school, especially in terms of how they and their parents talk about school and academics in their in-depth interviews.    Dr. Shabnam Javdani  The Community and Oppression Research Engagement Lab ( CORE)    W R IT E ON (Writing and Reflecting on Identity To Empower Ourselves as Narrators)    WRITE ON is a creative writing intervention designed for incarcerated adolescents. It is being implemented within the New York City Division of Youth and Family Justice. The intervention harnesses promising research findings on written self-expression to deliver a meaningful intervention to underserved youth. Particularly novel aspects of WRITE ON are that it a) integrates components of evidence-based therapies, b) utilizes an original and structured curriculum, and c) employs a mixed-methods evaluation protocol. Our team hopes to understand the processes and outcomes associated with the intervention, comparing youth receiving WRITE ON to youth receiving a control psychoeducation intervention.    Dr. Sam Juni    Project Description: The Social Psychology Language Project is part of a study of cross cultural propaganda where we are trying to understand the nuances of language as they differ across languages and cultures.    Dr. Gigliana Melzi &amp; Dr. Adina Schick Latino Family Engagement and Language Development (NYU-L-FELD)    Lab Description: Broadly speaking, all of our projects address the socio-cultural context of Latino child development. Specifically, our research explores the ways culture, as transmitted in daily adult-child interactions both at home and school, shape Latino preschoolers&rsquo; development of school readiness skills, as well as the relation between Latino family engagement in children&rsquo;s development. Currently, our work is focused on scaling-up, implementing, and testing the efficacy of a classroom-based oral storytelling intervention for preschool classrooms serving low-income Latino children.    Ind e p e nd e n t Projects: Undergraduate students on our team are encouraged to develop independent research ideas and are allowed to use some of our data for their independent or honors&rsquo; projects.    Dr. Edward Seidman    Understanding the Role of Teaching Practices and Classroom Processes in Fostering Children&rsquo;s Cognitive and Socio-emotional Development    This project grew out of the parent project: Opportunities for Equitable Access to Quality Basic Education (OPEQ) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It endeavors to assess teaching practices and classroom process as they relate to child outcomes and to develop a tool that can also serve as a useful feedback device for teachers to improve their performance. This project has been extended to include Ugandan classrooms, under the tutelage of the UPPET project. In the spring of 2014, field staff videotaped classrooms in the Uganda. These classroom segments are now going to be evaluated using TIPPS to measure the impact of the teacher training component of the UPPET project.    Dr. Selcuk Sirin    The New York City Academic and Social Engagement Study (NYCASES)    The goal of this mixed methods longitudinal study is to understand adolescents&rsquo; academic engagement and psychological well-being. The study is designed to identify the degree to which individual, family, and school characteristics predict the changes in psychological and educational outcomes of youth throughout their high school years, from 10th grade to 12th grade. We have already completed the data gathering phase of this project. This year we will be focusing on qualitative and quantitative data analysis so we are looking for advanced undergraduate students for this study.    Meta-Analysis of the Paradox (MAP):    Why do new immigrants tend to have more positive developmental and educational outcomes than those who are more acculturated to the United States? We have designed a meta- analysis to answer this much debated question of immigrant paradox .    NYU-Bahcesehir Collaborative Project    This is an international collaboration to build research capacity and to create an opportunity for Turkish and American students and faculty to better understand each other&rsquo;s cultures through research and scholarship. This year we gathered data from Syrian refugee children. We are also in the field for a new cultural validation on moral reasoning in Turkey.
