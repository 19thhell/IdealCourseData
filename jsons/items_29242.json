Home > Undergraduate Program     Undergraduate Program Undergraduate students in the department study, create, and perform music in an environment that combines the benefits of a well-rounded liberal arts education with the resources of a major research university.      Resources    Our students have a wealth of resources available for their research, performance, and creative work. The Shorin Music Performance Center offers a large number of rehearsal and practice rooms and the Department has its own intimate, loft-likeperformance space that serves as a recording studio and as a venue for recitals and concerts. Two cutting-edge technology labs - The Washington Square Computer Music Studio and the Media Lab - provide digital resources for composition and research. Professional sound recording and video equipment is available for check-out. The Department hosts the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society , the Collegium Musicum, and the Washington Square Harp and Shamrock Orchestra , the only Irish music ensemble in any university in the U.S. Our students can also join ensembles sponsored by the Steinhardt School of Education , such as the NYU Symphony Orchestra. The Department's greatest asset, however, is its location in the heart of New York City, one of the world's great cultural centers. Many of our courses are structured around live performances at venues ranging from the city's  top concert halls to its most obscure performance spaces. We also encourage students to take advantage of our location by pursuing internships with NYC-based recording companies, music magazines, or major performing arts organizations.      The Undergraduate Program    Students pursuing a major or minor in music gain proficiency in theory, history, criticism, and interpretation of music traditions throughout the world. At the same time, our students develop skills in analysis, critical thinking, composition, and writing that are valuable across disciplines. As a result, the major and minor in music constitute excellent preparation for graduate study in music and related fields in the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences; for careers in music, media, and culture industries; or for any occupation demanding clear and original thinking, command of the written word, analytical skills, and creativity.    In addition to a curriculum designed for majors and minors, we offer a wide range of innovative courses - in historical musicology, ethnomusicology, popular music, music theory, composition, historical performance, jazz, and the emerging field of sound studies - that are addressed to the general student. Recent and upcoming undergraduate courses include:               Harmony and Counterpoint (4 semesters) History of European Music (4 semesters)    Popular Music in Latin/o American and the Caribbean Music, War and Memory Twelve Masterworks of 20th century Music    Principles of Composition: Electroacoustic Music    Advanced Seminar in Jazz Studies    Introduction to Celtic Music    The Art of Listening: From Bach to Bjork on the Streets of New York    Global Hip Hop and the Politics of Culture    Musical 'Complexities'/Theoretical Perplexity    Anthropology of Improvisation    Alternate Canons: The Black Rock Coalition    Native American Music and Poetics    Spectral Music: A Chord or and Attitude?

Or, if you find a course that you suspect could count towards something other than what it is allocated for below, please ask - because it just might! WHAT COUNTS AS AN ELECTIVE? Courses in the following schools will count as ELECTIVES only (no exceptions): CAS-Creative Writing (CRWRI-UA) Gallatin (XXXX-UG) Nursing (XXXX-UN) Social Work (XXXX-US) Steinhardt (XXXX-UE) Stern (XXXX-UB) Wagner (XXXX-GP) Poly (XXXX-UY) (Cool tech courses found here in Integrated Digital Media. ) Any course relating to MUSIC, or any course with MUSIC in the title, will count as an ELECTIVE only, except for and PHYS-UA 10 Sound and Music. Tisch students are able to take ONE COURSE PER SEMESTER on a   pass/fail basis, for a maximum of 32 credits towards their degree.

Home > Undergraduate Program     Undergraduate Program Undergraduate students in the department study, create, and perform music in an environment that combines the benefits of a well-rounded liberal arts education with the resources of a major research university.      Resources    Our students have a wealth of resources available for their research, performance, and creative work. The Shorin Music Performance Center offers a large number of rehearsal and practice rooms and the Department has its own intimate, loft-likeperformance space that serves as a recording studio and as a venue for recitals and concerts. Two cutting-edge technology labs - The Washington Square Computer Music Studio and the Media Lab - provide digital resources for composition and research. Professional sound recording and video equipment is available for check-out. The Department hosts the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society , the Collegium Musicum, and the Washington Square Harp and Shamrock Orchestra , the only Irish music ensemble in any university in the U.S. Our students can also join ensembles sponsored by the Steinhardt School of Education , such as the NYU Symphony Orchestra. The Department's greatest asset, however, is its location in the heart of New York City, one of the world's great cultural centers. Many of our courses are structured around live performances at venues ranging from the city's  top concert halls to its most obscure performance spaces. We also encourage students to take advantage of our location by pursuing internships with NYC-based recording companies, music magazines, or major performing arts organizations.      The Undergraduate Program    Students pursuing a major or minor in music gain proficiency in theory, history, criticism, and interpretation of music traditions throughout the world. At the same time, our students develop skills in analysis, critical thinking, composition, and writing that are valuable across disciplines. As a result, the major and minor in music constitute excellent preparation for graduate study in music and related fields in the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences; for careers in music, media, and culture industries; or for any occupation demanding clear and original thinking, command of the written word, analytical skills, and creativity.

Some of the most important and interesting Anglophone writers of recent times belong to Britain's former colonies in Africa, South Asia, or the Caribbean, whether living in the countries of their origin or in the West. The postcolonial literary canon includes writers who have won international recognition, marked by awards like the Nobel Prize for Literature (Wole Soyinka, V. S. Naipaul, Derek Walcott) or the Man Booker Prize in Britain (Salman Rushdie, Arundhati Roy, Kiran Desai). They are admired for their often innovative use of the English language, their oppositional politics, and their historical centrality. Narratology ENGL-UA 710 Prerequisite: Literary Interpretation (ENGL-UA 200). Offered every other year. 4 points. Examines the nature of discourse, with focus on the novel and special emphasis on contemporary critical theory (e.g., semiotics, deconstruction) and the status of nonliterary prose discourse (usually Freud) as narrative in its own right. Readings survey the history of English and American fiction and critically examine the notion of literary history. Major Texts in Critical Theory ENGL-UA 712 Prerequisite: Literary Interpretation (ENGL-UA 200). Offered every year. 4 points. Major texts in critical theory from Plato to Derrida, considered in relation to literary practice. The first half of the course focuses on four major types of critical theory: mimetic, ethical, expressive, and formalist. The second half turns to 20th-century critical schools, such as Russian and American formalism, archetypal criticism, structuralism, psychoanalytic criticism, feminism, reader theory, deconstruction, and historicism. Literature and Psychology ENGL-UA 715 Prerequisite: Literary Interpretation (ENGL-UA 200). Offered periodically. 4 points. Freudian and post-Freudian psychological approaches to the reading and analysis of literary works. Covers manifest and latent meaning, the unconscious, childhood as a source of subject matter, sublimation, and gender and sexuality. Readings are chosen from such writers as Emily Bront\u00eb, Mary Shelley, Hawthorne, Dostoevsky, Dickens, Melville, James, Woolf, and Faulkner. South Asian Literature in English ENGL-UA 721 Prerequisite: British Literature II (ENGL-UA 220). Offered every other year. 4 points. Explores the rich cross-cultural perspectives of 20th-century Indian English literature. Moving from the classic British writers about India (Kipling and Forster) to the contemporary voices of Salman Rushdie, R. K. Narayan, Anita Desai, Bapsi Sidhwa, Sarah Suleri, Vikram Seth, Bharati Mukherjee, and others, the course focuses on key experiences of empire, the partition of India and Pakistan, and diaspora. Themes of identity, memory, alienation, assimilation, and resistance, and of encountering and crossing boundaries, define culture, nation, and language in complex interrelations and link Indian English literature to writing in other colonial/postcolonial settings in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory ENGL-UA 735 Prerequisite: Literary Interpretation (ENGL-UA 200). Offered every year. 4 points. Topics vary from term to term. Representations of Women ENGL-UA 755 Identical to SCA-UA 734. Prerequisite: Literary Interpretation (ENGL-UA 200). Offered every other year. 4 points. Broadly speaking, feminist theory and studies have been concerned with three central problems or issues: (1) describing the organization of power differences between men and women, (2) explaining the \u201corigins\u201d of sexual and gender difference, and (3) accounting for differences among women (and among men) that complicate notions of sexual and gender difference. This course surveys representations of sexual and gender difference in literary and cultural production, focusing especially on texts authored by women. Students consider theories of gender and sexuality that enable us to consider how literature depicts and engages social relations and, conversely, how our reading practices enact (or transform) social conventions regarding gender difference.
