These small classes are taught by faculty from across the University and from the wider New York community. In some instances students may count the classes toward their major or minor, if the departments consider this appropriate; other classes will count simply as electives.    Collegiate Honors Seminars have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. In sum, these courses are meant to foster an environment in which learning is an exciting experience for students and faculty alike.    Sophomores and juniors have priority in registering for most of the Collegiate Honors Seminars. If seats remain after the end of early registration, seniors may also enroll.    Course Descriptions    Home of the Brave: Legal Aspects of American Use of Force since World War II (V28.0103; call # 75346) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Wednesday, 8:00-10:30 a.m.    The creation of the United Nations ushered in a new era in the international legal regulation of the use of force by states. Under the UN regime, states may use force in well-circumscribed circumstances, notably in self-defense against an armed attack or pursuant to a decision of the UN Security Council, to bring about a termination of a breach of the peace or a threat to the peace of the international community. The United States, both during and after the Cold War, has not shied away from the use of its considerable force, often provoking national and international controversy. Some instances, such as the Cuban missile crisis or the Vietnam War, have had profound effects on the self-understanding of the polity. The \"War on Terrorism\" has ushered in yet a new challenge in this area. This seminar first examines the international legal framework and then surveys the principal instances of American use of force, from Korea to Iraq. At issue are both the legality of past and present American practices and the adequacy of controlling international law and institutions. Junior and senior prelaw students will have priority in registering for this seminar.       J. H. H. Weiler is University Professor and European Union Jean Monnet Chair at NYU Law School. He serves as Chairman of the NYU Global Law School Program and is also Director of the Jean Monnet Center for International and Regional Economic Law and Justice. He was previously Professor of Law at the Michigan Law School and then the Manley Hudson Professor of Law and Jean Monnet Chair at the Harvard Law School. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as a World Trade Organization Panel Member. He is a founding editor of the European Journal of International Law , of the European Law Journal , and of the World Trade Review . His recent publications include The European Court of Justice (with G. de Burca), The EU, the WTO and the NAFTA , The Constitution of Europe , and a novella, Der Fall Steinmann .    Collective Urban Violence in America (V28.0105; call # 72296) Instructor: Daniel J. Walkowitz Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar examines the urban origins, character, and changing patterns of violence in American cities. It focuses on collective violence rather than on individual acts of violence, regardless of how many victims an individual may have claimed. One part of the course considers the extent to which American culture and political institutions encourage, sanctify, or militate against aggressive behavior and create a climate for or against violence. In that context, some of our concerns must be comparative, cross-cultural, and transnational. In addition, we address broad interdisciplinary conceptual questions that anthropologists, psychologists, and sociologists, in particular, ask about human nature, gender conditioning in Western cultures, and \"deviant\" subcultures. In creating a typology for the analysis of violence in American cities over time, we distinguish between forms of violence, the direction of changes sought, and the social and material characteristics of the antagonists -- is the conflict generated, for example, by a privileged elite seeking to protect authority it feels jeopardized by aspiring newcomers, or is it rooted in efforts by the dispossessed struggling to gain some notion of a fair share?    Daniel J. Walkowitz is Professor of History and Director of College Honors. A specialist in labor and working-class history, he has written numerous articles and co-edited or authored five books, including Working with Class: Social Workers and the Politics of Middle-Class Identity and Memory and the Impact of Political Transformation in Public Space . In addition, as co-founder and co-director of NYU's Graduate Program in Public History, he has pioneered efforts to bring America's past to broad general audiences through film and video. The subjects of his documentary projects have ranged from iron and cotton worker protests in Troy, New York, to a miners' strike in Donetsk, Ukraine.    20th-Century Europe in Literature and Memory (V28.0109; call # 75345) Instructor: Tony Judt Monday, 3:30-6:15 p.m.    This seminar addresses aspects of the history of Europe in the years 1914-1989 through the medium of literature: novels, essays, memoirs. The seminar will pay close attention to the books themselves. But we shall also be concerned with the world of their authors, with their subject matter, with their contemporary setting, and with their cultural impact (then and since). Among the themes to be addressed -- in the readings, the class discussion, and, eventually, the final papers -- are the following: the impact of the First World War, at the front and at home; the consequences of post-World War I imperial collapse and the lost culture of Central Europe; Italian society under Fascism; the Spanish Civil War; the show trials and the Stalinist terror; the Holocaust in literature and memory; life in post-Stalinist Eastern Europe; the origins of the Yugoslav catastrophe; literature, memory, and memoirs as historical sources for extreme experience. For their final paper, students will select a theme or topic from the period covered by this course and then, with the instructor's assistance, identify additional works of European fiction or memoir literature for discussion and analysis.    Tony Judt is Erich Maria Remarque Professor of European Studies and Director of the Remarque Institute at NYU. A Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he has written widely on modern French and Central European history, as well as on contemporary affairs in Europe and the United States. He is a regular contributor to the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, the Times Literary Supplement, and the New Republic . He directed a long-term international collaborative research project called \"Rethinking World War II and Its Aftermath in Europe.\" His book Postwar: A History of Europe since 1945 was published in 2005.    Geology and Antiquity in the Mediterranean (V28.0114; call # 75524) Instructor: Steven Soter Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Over timescales of centuries and millennia, geological forces have worked profound changes on the landscape of the Mediterranean. Gradual processes of silting, erosion, and local sea level change, as well as infrequent but catastrophic natural disasters -- earthquakes and tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and major floods -- have all left their marks. Many ancient sites are now deeply buried, while others lie exposed to the elements. Great ancient seaports now lie stranded miles inland from the nearest shore, while thepalace of Cleopatra is submerged. The oracle of Delphi, the legendary Atlantis, and the one-eyed giants of the Odyssey have origins in geological phenomena. This course explores the impact of geological forces on the natural and human environments of the ancient Mediterranean world. Special attention is given to the site of Helike -- a Greek city destroyed and submerged in the Early Bronze Age and again in Classical times -- which the instructor has been exploring.    Steven Soter is a Scientist-in-Residence at NYU's Center for Ancient Studies and a Research Associate in the Department of Astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History. He co-directs an interdisciplinary scientific team excavating the Early Bronze Age, Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman settlements at Helike, a coastal site on the Gulf of Corinth in Greece. He was co-author with Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan of the Cosmos television series and co-author of the two Hayden Planetarium space shows.    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V28.0116; call # 75332) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court's interpretation and application of the Constitution, and the Court's new, self-defined role, have adversely affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \"Imperial Judiciary.\" Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them, and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis, the Court's participation in the debate, and the effect that nine people appointed for life (the justices) have on how we live. Topics include abortion, euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights, gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; affirmative action; college speech codes, including \"hate\" speech, verbal sexual harassment, group liable and symbolic speech; prayer in school and students' right of privacy; and racial and ethnic profiling, government's right to detain accused terrorists, and the USA PATRIOT Act. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the political spectrum.    Alan J. Pomerantz, Esq. , is a practicing lawyer and partner of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, LLP, a major international law firm. A graduate of the NYU School of Law, he also studied in Chile and received an advanced legal degree from the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands). He has lectured and taught widely, including at the NYU School of Law, the University of Amsterdam, Columbia Graduate School, the University of Concepcion (Chile), the School of Visual Arts, and Hunter College High School. He has published numerous articles and contributed to several treatises on legal topics and is recognized in the International Who's Who -- Lawyers . Mr. Pomerantz and Weil, Gotshal have participated in important and controversial matters affecting individual rights, including death penalty appeals, rights of public artistic expression, political asylum applications, voting rights, right of privacy for acts of consenting adults, equal access laws for disabled persons, and numerous free speech cases.    The Port of New York (V28.0117; call # 72304) Instructor: Bryan Waterman Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This course offers an interdisciplinary approach to the study of New York City cultures through the prism of its waterfront and harbor, a source not only of the city's economic development but also of its multicultural and polyglot character. From a \"home base\" meeting location at NYU's Broome Street residence hall, the seminar seeks to make the city itself the classroom: at least half of the seminar is conducted out of doors or in cultural institutions downtown and elsewhere, including the South Street Seaport Museum, the Museum of Chinese in the Americas, Ellis Island Immigration Museum, the New-York Historical Society, and others. Incorporating discussions from the disciplines of architectural history, archaeology, literary studies, and history, the seminar foregrounds problems of discipline and method in the study of the city's cultures and therefore seeks participation from the range of disciplines and departments that make up CAS. Topics include the founding of New Amsterdam, slavery in British Manhattan and the early American Republic, immigration's perpetual reshaping of city cultures, the emergence of popular forms such as blackface minstrelsy, the \"destruction\" of lower Manhattan in the 20th century, the decline of the port and its marketplaces, the development of the World Trade Center, and the ongoing effects of the 9/11 attacks.    Bryan Waterman , Assistant Professor of English, received his Ph.D. from Boston University in American Studies; since 2001 he has been a member of NYU's English department, where he teaches courses in early American literature and \"Writing New York\" (with Professor Cyrus Patell). He is the author of articles on late 18th-century New York City's literary and intellectual cultures, as well as Republic of Intellect: The Friendly Club of New York City and the Enlightenment Origins of American Literature (forthcoming). He is a Faculty Fellow in Residence at Broome Street and is currently at work on a book about seduction narratives in the era of the American and French Revolutions.    The Security Council and Peacekeeping Operations in the 21st Century (V28.0120; call # 72308) Instructor: Elisabeth Lindenmayer Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    This course focuses on the role of the Security Council of the United Nations as a decision-making body in the maintenance of international peace and security. It examines the evolution of the Security Council since the end of the Cold War and reviews how its decisions have deeply affected international relations. It also reviews the evolution of peacekeeping operations through a selective examination of the literature and case studies, some of which will be based on the instructor's experience. The course explores some of the major successes and setbacks of the Security Council and the many lessons learned. It focuses on the varying responses of the international community to humanitarian crises. We will ask the question \"Whose responsibility is it to protect?\" Finally, the course seeks to demonstrate the need for reforms to address the unprecedented challenges of the 21st century, including the reform of the Security Council. Students who have taken V50.0363 may not register for this course.    Elisabeth Lindenmayer has had a long career with the United Nations, where she served as the Deputy Chef de Cabinet and as the Executive Assistant to the current Secretary General, Kofi Annan. In addition, she carried substantive responsibilities relating to peacekeeping operations dealing with the crises in Iraq-Kuwait,Somalia,Rwanda, and the Great Lakes region. She has also taught at Columbia University.    Machiavelli's Wake (V28.0121; call # 72309) Instructor: William Klein Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    How influential can a writer be? Do people hear what they aren't prepared by history to hear? Can readers in one set of circumstances do anything but distort or misunderstand or ironically overturn what was written in another set of circumstances? It is one thing to ask these sorts of questions about the influence of an original literary mind on others, but perhaps another when the writer experiments not only with literary forms but with social, moral, religious, political, or military ones as well. Machiavelli was a writer whose wake caused disturbances in all of these areas -- so much so that to study it, in all of its complexity and ambiguity, is to study the emergence of modernity itself. In our readings, we will look for areas in which the early modern world seemed to be ready for Machiavelli's recovery of the ancient Greek awareness of the agony of political life. We will also look for those areas in which the readiness may not have been anticipated by Machiavelli himself (such as in moral attitudes toward the growth of capitalism). We will look for areas where people professed not to be ready, and at those where apparent readiness competed with deep unease (as may have been the case with Shakespeare). These historical explorations would be of limited interest if they did not push us to ask what our own era (of multinational corporations and unmanned war machines and feminism and pornography...) can make of Machiavelli. Have we outgrown him, or are we still engaged? If the latter, would that be a good thing?    William Klein teaches the history of political discourse in NYU's General Studies Program. In the College of Arts and Science he has also taught in both the Morse Academic Plan and the Freshman Honors Seminar Program. He writes on a range of topics, from Renaissance political thought to constitutional history and to modern crime.    The Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan (V28.0124; call # 75344) Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller Tuesday, Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    The operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were composed during a period of intense change in the world of symphonic music and opera in the 19th century. This seminar examines nine of the major works and their historical, cultural, and musical contexts. It also examines the lives of the composer and the librettist and their respective milieux -- Sullivan as one of the few English composers of the century to achieve international recognition, and Gilbert in terms of the various literary movements to which he belonged and which he parodied. In addition, it considers the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and its activities; the singers, scenic designers, choreographers, and costumers who functioned with the company; and the principal sources for the music, a majority of which are housed currently in New York City's J. Pierpont Morgan Library, along with numerous artifacts from the productions.    Rena Charnin Mueller, Clinical Associate Professor of Music, specializes in 19th-century music, in particular, the compositional aesthetic of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. Her most recent publications include an essay for the volume Liszt and His World , in conjunction with the 2006 Bard Festival, and an article on performances of Liszt and Wagner in New York between 1840 and 1890. Her work on the Liszt Lieder appears in the Cambridge Companion to the Lied (2004). She has published new editions of Les Preludes (1997), the Trois Etudes de Concert (1996), and the two Ballades (1996). With Maria Eckhardt, she is the author of the Franz Liszt \"List of Works\" for The New Grove 2000 , and they are also co-authoring the forthcoming Franz Liszt Thematic Catalogue . In 2003, she was a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.    Introduction to Cognitive Science (V28.0125; call # 75343) Instructor: Bob Rehder Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Cognitive science is the study of cognition or intelligent behavior -- of its nature, characteristics, and processes. It is a multidisciplinary approach to the study of cognition and intelligent systems that incorporates elements of psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, and computer science. It claims to provide answers to controversies such as the nature of mind, the role of the brain in cognitive processes, the possibility of artificial intelligence, and the relation of the mind/brain to culture and the outside world. Because cognitive science is intimately tied to issues in philosophy of mind and science, the course also discusses cognitive science's philosophical aspects and its historical development. The class addresses some of the traditional challenges to cognitive science (e.g., the problems of intentionality and consciousness), as well as a number of more recent challenges (e.g., connectionism, neuroscience, and situated action and culture). No prior knowledge of cognitive science is required.    Bob Rehder received a B.S. in computer science and B.A. in physics from Washington University at St. Louis, an M.S. in artificial intelligence from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He has been a member of NYU's Psychology Department since 2001. His work has been published in a number of scholarly journals, including the Journal of Experimental Psychology and the Journal of Educational Psychology.    Beauty Matters (V28.0127; call # 75342) Instructor: Deborah Willis Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    This seminar explores the problematics of beauty -- a subject that is contested in art, in the media, and in everyday culture. It looks at the ways in which our contemporary understanding of aesthetic pleasure is informed by and constructed from visual culture in museums, photography, advertising, film, and music. From the moment that photography was invented in 1839, people began to have their portraits made. These images offered a framework in which to imagine the history behind the photographic surface and to explore the notion of transformation. Class discussions will focus on how beauty has been imagined and realized. Using a series of case studies, we will consider the political image, race, class, and gender. The aim is to enable students to think critically about the notion of aesthetic pleasure and to consider the consequences of their views. The emphasis will be on reading, interpreting, and evaluating racialized, sexualized, and objectified images of men and women. We will look at the works of a broad range of photographic artists -- in fashion, narrative films, exhibitions, family images, and zine culture -- to examine viewers' responses. Open to TSOA students (priority to Photography students) and CAS students. TSOA students should contact Irene Cho in the Photography department to register.    Deborah Willis is University Professor and Professor of Photography and Imaging in the Tisch School of the Arts. Her many awards include a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, an Alfonse Fletcher, Jr. Fellowship, a Mac Arthur Fellowship, an Anonymous Was a Woman Foundation Award, and an International Center of Photography Infinity Award for Writing on Photography. As a former curator of exhibitions at the Smithsonian Institution's Center for African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and as the curator of photography and prints at the New York Public Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, she has organized exhibitions and lectured extensively on African American photography. She is the author of Picturing Us: African American Identity in Photography, Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers, 1840 to the Present, The Black Female Body: A Photographic History (with Carla Williams), Black: A Celebration of Culture, and, most recently, Family History Memory: Recording African American Life.    Origins of World War I (V28.0128; call # 75341) Instructor: Stewart A. Stehlin Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The course explores the instability of the European state system in the pre-1914 era and the causes and responsibility for the war by examining the contributions of each of the major European states to the outbreak of war. It considers the Bismarckian system of European diplomacy and the balance of power as it existed before the war, the various diplomatic crises before 1914, the interrelation of internal events in the various countries to their foreign policy, and the various interpretations of the causes of the war. Topics include the Moroccan crises, the weaknesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Anglo-German naval and economic rivalries, the Balkan struggles for independence, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo, the personal responsibility of the individual statesmen, the ever-widening conflict, and the attempts to contain it.    Stewart A. Stehlin is Professor Emeritus of History. His areas of teaching have been the development of the modern European state system in the 19th and 20th centuries, the history of modern Germany, and European diplomatic history of the 19th and 20th centuries. His research has centered on European cultural history, diplomatic history, and German history, especially German-Vatican affairs. Among his publications are Bismarck and the Guelph Movement, 1866-1890 , a translation of Friedrich Ratzel's Sketches of Urban and Cultural Life in North America , and Weimar and the Vatican , German-Vatican Diplomatic Relations between the Wars, 1919-1933 . He is currently working on a book, Rome and the Reich: German-Vatican Relations during the Kaiserreich, 1870-1919 .    Rethinking Who We Are: Interpersonal Approaches to the Person (V28.0129; call # 75340) Instructor: Michael Westerman Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    There are unresolved tensions in the field of psychology between individual-centered models of the person and interpersonal ones. The seminar is based on the belief that in order to make progress on these unresolved issues we need to recognize that they refer to a long-standing fundamental question philosophers began wondering about centuries before the discipline of psychology came into existence -- What place do our relationships with other people have in our lives? Moreover, we need to engage in an inquiry that involves a dynamic interplay between psychological considerations and philosophical ones. Participants in the seminar learn about work in several specific areas where these tensions appear, including models of child development, approaches to psychopathology, and basic questions about psychotherapy. We also consider more \"interpersonal\" versus more individual-centered ways in which psychologists think about interpersonal interaction itself. The final topic concerns the philosophy of the social sciences. We look at recent contributions by psychologists and philosophers suggesting that we replace traditional concepts of the process of psychological research with a social view of that process. Throughout the seminar, we refer to classic philosophical texts and contributions by historians of ideas to explore critically the ways in which contemporary efforts by psychologists reflect concepts of the person from our philosophical tradition. Students who have taken V50.0247 may not register for this seminar.    Michael A. Westerman is Associate Professor of Psychology. His area is clinical psychology. He has conducted research on several topics concerning interpersonal relationships, including studies of mother-child interaction, family systems, and the patient-therapist relationship in psychotherapy. His publications also include articles on issues in philosophical psychology. He is currently involved in a program of research based on an interpersonal reconceptualization of psychological defenses he has developed that is called the theory of interpersonal defense.    Representing Animals: The Discourse of Species in Contemporary Art and Media (V28.0130; call # 75339) Instructor: Una Chaudhuri Friday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 noon    Claude Levi-Strauss said that animals feature so prominently in myth and ritual \"not because they are 'good to eat' but because they are ' good to think .'\" The history of art and literature suggests that they are also good to paint, sculpt, photograph, film, and write about. A new interdisciplinary field of study has begun to move the animal out of its niche in science and insert it into fields that have, perhaps, constituted themselves in (unconscious) opposition to it: the \"humanities.\" Animal studies explores the meaning of cultural animal practices, ranging from literary genres like fables and fairy-tales to animal acts in circuses and fairs, to social practices like pet-keeping, cock-fighting, dog shows, equestrian displays, rodeos, bullfighting, hunting, fur-wearing, and meat-eating. These and other animal practices constitute an ever-changing and vastly complicated \"discourse of species,\" which in turn informs our accounts of the human, the \"Other\" (including the racial and ethnic Other), and the world. We will study a range of contemporary representations of animals -- in fiction, poetry, film, television, fashion, and popular culture -- with a view to understanding the current state of the discourse of species. How does the imagery of mass culture shape our attitudes to animals? How do artists, activists, and ordinary people disrupt those attitudes? How are we feeling about, imagining, living with, and \"thinking\" animals today?Readings will also include works of philosophy (Nietzsche, Derrida, Deleuze and Guattari, Singer) and recent animal studies books such as Steven Baker's The Postmodern Animal , Akira Lippit's The Electric Animal , Donna Haraway's A Companion Species Manifesto , and the Animal Studies Group's Killing Animals.    Una Chaudhuri is Professor of English and Drama. She is the author of No Man's Stage: A Semiotic Study of Jean Genet's Plays and Staging Place: The Geography of Modern Drama , editor of Rachel's Brain and Other Storms: The Performance Scripts of Rachel Rosenthal , and co-editor, with Elinor Fuchs, of the recently published critical anthology Land/Scape/Theater . She is currently working on a project that explores the intersections of theater and performance with the emerging field of animal studies.    Jews and Germans: Old Memories and New Beginnings in Postwar Germany (V28.0131; call # 75337) Instructor: Marion Kaplan Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    This course explores the interactions of Jews and Germans after World War II, noting their interlocking histories and memories even after the Holocaust. Students learn about the immediate postwar turmoil, the displaced persons, Allied occupation, and \"denazification.\" They analyze how Germans -- East and West -- did or did not come to terms with the Nazi past. They read Jewish perspectives on their lives in West and East Germany, why they remained, how they experienced their citizenship, how they interacted with Germans, and how re-unification (in 1990) affected them.Readings analyze conflicting German and Jewish historical memories, including the silence about the Holocaust of the early postwar years, the student rebellion of 1968, the viewing of the American TV series Holocaust , the Historians' Debate of the 1980s and 1990s, and the building of museums and monuments about Jewish history and the Holocaust. The seminar entails advanced work in research and conceptual skills. Thus, students not only learn about the history of postwar Germany but also discuss debates surrounding this history.    Marion Kaplan is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History. She is the author of The Jewish Feminist Movement in Germany : The Campaigns of the Judischer Frauenbund, l904-l938 (1979), The Making of the Jewish Middle Class: Women, Family, and Identity in Imperial Germany (1991), and Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany (1998). The last two won the National Jewish Book Award in their respective years. She has edited books on European women's history: When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany and The Marriage Bargain: Dowries in European History . Her most recent books are Jewish Daily Life in Germany , 1618-1945 and Judische Welten: Juden in Deutschland vom 18. Jahrhundert bis in die Gegenwart (a co-edited volume).    Readings in Modern Chinese Social Thought (V28.0132; call # 75335) Prerequisite: Completion of intermediate Chinese or equivalent Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, Wednesday 4:55-6:10 p.m.    This seminar introduces students with post-intermediate knowledge of Chinese to the major texts by leading writers and intellectuals of modern China. The goal is threefold: (1) to help students interested in modern China develop linguistic competence through intensive readings in cultural and intellectual discourses; (2) to prepare those who already have advanced language skills for a more in-depth encounter with the canon in modern Chinese culture; and (3) to familiarize students with the central arguments and stylistic mannerisms of the leading figures in modern Chinese culture and society through systematic interpretative-translational practice.Readings consist of foundational texts by canonic authors over the country's tumultuous modern period. Texts are selected either in full or in abridged form, with grammatical points and content-based annotations arranged in a way that allows close reading and interpretation. Under the broad rubric of social change and its intellectual reflections, specific topics include the Chinese Enlightenment, vernacular cultural revolution, women's rights and women's liberation, socialism and mass democracy, the attraction and problems of Westernization, the economic reform and new social liberty, the autonomy or \"subjectivity\" of Chinese culture, and the national debate on university reform. Authors include such modern classical writers as Liang Qichao, Hu Shi, Lu Xun, and Mao Zedong, as well as influential contemporary writers and intellectuals like Li Zehou, Gan Yang, Liu Xiaofeng, and Wang Anyi.    Jing Wang is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990's (2002). In 2000, she was the featured columnist/translator on foreign literature for the literary magazine Shanghai Literature . Her teaching and research interests include women writers in China and the West, literary translation, modern Chinese social thought, and comparative studies of cities and urban culture. In addition to literary translations, she also publishes personal essays.    Literature and Science: Pathways and Intersections (V28.0133; call # 75738) Instructors: Daniel Malamud and Martha Rust Tuesday, 5:00-7:30 p.m.    In 1959 C. P. Snow lectured on \"the two cultures,\" arguing that the life of the mind in Western culture was suffering from an increasing rift between two opposing factions: \"literary intellectuals at one pole -- at the other scientists . . . between the two a gulf of mutual incomprehension.\" This seminar analyzes the relationship between literature and science, asking if these are indeed two cultures or if, instead, they are two distinct yet related disciplines that interact synergistically -- as if they were on opposite sides of a semi-permeable membrane. The beauty of a semi-permeable membrane resides in the sheer elegance of a design that assures a regulated, bidirectional transfer of materials, which, in turn, supports the metabolism of living things. Something similar could be said of a metaphor, which transfers the meaning of a word from one conceptual realm to another, enabling \"fluid\" reasoning and bold \"leaps\" of imagination. This course explores another vital interface: the mutually informative matrix of connections between literature and science. It focuses on a series of topics that highlight the polarity between scientists and \"literary intellectuals\" : aesthetics, sex and gender, nature and nurture, life and death, health and disease, to name a few. In examining the diverse approaches that literature and science adopt in studying these topics and in disseminating their findings, we also seek to bring into view the productive interface the two disciplines share. In turn, we will discover some of the ways that Snow's \"two cultures\" might be influenced by and learn from the other.Readings are wide ranging: from Camus' The Plague to poetry by William Carlos Williams and Sharon Olds, to works by Sigmund Freud and Susan Sontag, to articles in scientific journals such as Nature and Science .    Daniel Malamud , Professor of Basic Sciences at the NYU College of Dentistry, is a biochemist working on pathogenesis and novel diagnostics for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. Prior to joining the NYU faculty in 2005, he taught courses in Literature and Science and the Literature of AIDS at the University of Pennsylvania.    Martha Rust , Assistant Professor of English, brings a background in health sciences to her career as a medievalist and teaches courses on both medieval English literature and medicine in literature in NYU's English department. Her first book, Imaginary Worlds in Medieval Books: Exploring the Manuscript Matrix , is forthcoming spring 2007, and she is at work on a second, entitled Item: Lists and the Poetics of Reckoning in Late-Medieval England .    Past and Present in Irish Archaeology (V28.0134; call # 75523) Instructor: Pam Crabtree Tuesday, Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.    Ireland has a rich archaeological heritage that includes hunter-gatherers of the Mesolithic Period, Megalithic tombs at Knowth and Newgrange, the Hill of Tara, early Christian monasteries such as Clonmacnoise, and the Viking settlements in Dublin itself. This course will consider how the Irish past has been constructed and what role that this construction of the Irish past has played in the modern world. We will review the archaeology of Ireland from its initial settlement in the Mesolithic through the British colonization of Northern Ireland in the early Modern Era. The course will also examine the impact of rapid economic development on Ireland's archaeological resources, including the current debate surrounding the site of Tara.    Pam Crabtree , Associate Professor of Anthropology, is a zooarchaeologist whose research interests center broadly on the uses of faunal remains to study past animal husbandry patterns, hunting practices, and diet. She is also interested in the use of archaeologically recovered animal remains to study trade, social status, ethnicity, and prehistoric ritual. Her primary area of interest is later prehistoric and early medieval Europe, but she has also worked on Natufian settlement and subsistence in the Southern Levant and 18th- and 19th-century sites in eastern North America. Crabtree is currently a member of an archaeological team that is surveying the Irish royal site of Dun Ailinne in Ireland. Her work has been published in a number of edited volumes and journals, including the Journal of Field Archaeology and World Archaeology . She and her co-author Bradley Adams recently completed a forthcoming book entitled Comparative Skeletal Morphology .    The Birth of the Mind: Genes, Evolution, and Human Nature (V28.0135; call # 75522) Instructor: Gary Marcus Tuesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.    This course explores the origins of the human mind from two perspectives: the origins of our species (a question about evolution) and the development of individuals, from conception to birth to educated adult. Questions that we will address include: What is the relation between nature and nurture? Has evolution played an important role in shaping the mind? Are we merely \"drifts in the currents\" of our genes? Are human beings optimal thinkers \"noble in reason,\" or is the mind better thought of as a jury-rigged Swiss-army knife of haphazard cognitive tools? Our approach will be interdisciplinary, drawing on fields ranging from genetics and developmental biology to psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience.Readings will include articles from the primary literature and four books written for the educated lay reader -- Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct (1994) and How the Mind Works (1997), and the instructor's own The Birth of the Mind (2004) and Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind (forthcoming).    Gary Marcus is Professor of Psychology and Director of the NYU Infant Language Learning Center. He is the author of two books about the origins and nature of the mind and editor of a third. His research on developmental cognitive neuroscience has been published in over 40 articles in leading journals such as Science , Nature , Cognition , Cognitive Psychology , and the Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development. In 1996 he won the Robert L. Fantz award for new investigators in cognitive development, and in 2002-03 he was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in Social and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford.    Pharmaceutical Drugs, Ethics, and Culture (V28.0136; call # 75521) Instructors: David A. Scicchitano and Andrea McKenzie Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar is designed to introduce students to contemporary issues in the realm of pharmaceuticals, focusing on drug design, safety, and distribution. Early in the seminar, students are introduced to the basic concepts of drug research and testing, with an emphasis on the Food and Drug Administration rules for bringing a drug to the clinic and eventually to the marketplace. This leads to the complex issues related to drug distribution inside and outside the United States, the societal implications associated with new therapeutic regimens, and the economic factors and laws that come into play. The seminar also develops students' writing, critical thinking, and presentation skills, with emphasis placed on researching, evaluating, and presenting evidence. Students who have taken V23.0005 may not register for this seminar.    David A. Scicchitano is Professor of Biology and also the CAS Director of Undergraduate Science Initiatives. His research interests include the way environmental agents, particularly chemicals, interact with and damage DNA, interfering with fundamental cellular process, and triggering pathology. His work is funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health.    Andrea McKenzie is the Director of Writing in the Disciplines with the Expository Writing Program. She collaborates with professors from a wide range of disciplines to incorporate writing and public speaking as active learning strategies in subject-specific courses. She has performed curriculum design work and taught graduate and undergraduate courses in writing and public speaking at NYU, MIT, and the University of Waterloo (Canada).    American Mythology and Its Biblical Sources (V28.0137; call # 75520) Instructor: Christopher Collins Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Especially in times of crisis, Americans tend to rally around leaders who reassure them that God has blessed theirs above all other nations -- given her a mission to feed, clothe, and enlighten the less fortunate, to liberate the world from tyranny and crime, and eventually to inaugurate an era of universal peace. This seminar will examine the biblical sources of this political mythology and the historical instances of its cynical use, for example, in representing North America as a Promised Land reserved for a new Chosen People, in identifying Indians and Africans as cursed races, and in regarding American foreign policy as divinely ordained and therefore exempt from international law. The Machiavellian exploitation of American religion is important to expose, but it is, of course, an old story. While this course will tell that story, in doing so it will keep as its major focus the credulity of the many, rather than the mendacity of the few. Unlike other contemporary critiques, this text-centered historical survey of American \"truthiness\" will raise that one, crucial, but seldom asked question: why is it that so many of us believe the lies we are told?    Christopher Collins is Professor of English and author of a number of books on the psychology and rhetoric of literature, including Reading the Written Image: Verbal Play, Interpretation, and the Roots of Iconophobia ; The Poetics of the Mind's Eye: Literature and the Psychology of Imagination ; and Authority Figures: Metaphors of Mastery from the Iliad to the Apocalypse . His latest book, Homeland Mythology: Biblical Narratives in American Culture, will be published in 2007.    Socrates and His Critics (V28.0138; call # 75739) Instructor: Vincent Renzi Tuesday, Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    Despite writing nothing himself, Socrates is, perhaps, the most influential philosopher in the Western tradition. With him, philosophy first moves from natural history to an explicit concern for human affairs. So great is this change that we continue to term those earlier thinkers \"pre-Socratic philosophers.\" So too, his name is given to a distinctive form of philosophical literature, the Socratic dialogue, and to an approach to philosophical inquiry and instruction, the Socratic method. In antiquity, his thought inspired Plato, Xenophon, the Stoics, the Skeptics, and the Cynics, beyond them to influence in Rome and Judea . . . and four centuries before Jesus, he already suffered martyrdom for his idiosyncratic political, philosophical, and religious views. In modernity, he both fascinates and repels Kierkegaard and Nietzsche; already in his own time, he endured criticisms of his way of life, notably from the comedian Aristophanes. Given the evidence, we can look only to the history of the reception of his thought to recover any sense of the \"historical Socrates.\" We must likewise ask whether he does not exert a greater influence as a result of his reputation than for his actual intellectual contributions. In short, had Socrates not existed, wouldn't the tradition essentially have had to create him, in its move from its origins to ethics and political philosophy? Even given that he did actually live, is what we have of him really just such a necessary fiction?    Vincent Renzi is Associate Director of the Morse Academic Plan for the Foundations of Contemporary Culture, where he regularly offers Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the 19th Century, in both regular and writing-intensive versions. He taught previously at Columbia University. In addition to his specialization in ancient Greek philosophy, he maintains interests in 19th- and 20th-century Continental philosophy, ancient studies, history of philosophy, and aesthetics.    Theater of War: Ancient Warfare in Ancient Drama (V28.0139; call # 75758) Instructor: Peter Meineck Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This seminar will examine ancient attitudes to war and its effects on society in ancient Greece as conveyed primarily in drama but also in art and literature. Why do we fight? Why is war still the most pervasive political force on the planet? What are the origins of attitudes to warfare in Western culture? The class will study ancient texts in translation and discuss vase painting, architecture, and sculpture to understand the cultural forces that created the Greek way of war and how military innovations and organization had a profound influence on the development of political and social institutions. We will read selections from Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Aris\u00adtophanes, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Plato, and Demosthenes. We will also examine pre-classical military structures, such as those in the ancient Near East, and look at the impact of Greek warfare on the Hellenistic period, on Rome, and on some of the military philosophies that prevail today.    Peter Meineck is Artistic Director of the Aquila Theatre Company, which has performed the Iliad at Lincoln Center and regularly produces classical plays in New York and on national tours. He is also Clinical Assistant Professor both in Classics and in Drama at NYU and Artist in Residence at NYU's Center for Ancient Studies. He has published several translations of Greek plays.    Writing in the Information Age (V28.0140; call # 75861) Instructor: Natalie Jeremijenko Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. ; lab, Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    Take a moment to ask yourself if there is any product you use, live with, or can see about which you could say how, by whom, or where it was made. Given that the manufacturing sector is the most poisonous of all sectors of all global human activities, is our collective ignorance defensible in an information society? The opportunity for change that new information technologies present could conceivably be an opportunity to promote innovation, sustainable manufacturing, transparent labor conditions, and environmental accountability. Likewise, it could promote a closed information context of trade secrets, nondisclosures, IP portfolios, labeling strategies, and closed doors. In this course we will lift the veil between production and consumption, each student taking on a case study to ask how and if open information context can promote innovation, and what structure of accountability will best facilitate this. Writing a visual essay for a wiki-based visual encyclopedia [howstuffismade.org], students will themselves learn standards of evidence and accountability involved in the production of information for the information commons, exploring their own responsibility and capacity for developing and proposing some of these changes.    Natalie Jeremijenko is a Global Distinguished Professor at NYU. An artist/experimenter and information engineer, she is one of the founders of the field of tangible media (also known as physical computing). Her work centers on structures of participation in the information age and the political and social possibilities (and limitations) of information technologies -- mostly through large-scale public experiments. In this vein, her work spans a range of media from statistical indices (such as the Despondency Index, which linked the Dow Jones to the suicide rate at San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge) to biological substrates (such as the installations of cloned trees in pairs in various urban micro-climates) to robotics (such as the development of feral robotic dog packs to investigate environmental hazards). Her graduate work at Stanford and the University of Queensland was in the fields of design engineering and information science. Previous faculty positions have included appointments in Yale University's Department of Mechanical Engineering, in the Department of Visual Art at the University of California at San Diego, and as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at Michigan State University.    Collegiate Honors Seminars Abroad    NYU in London    Builders of Britain (V28.9501; call # 75529) Instructor: Timothy Brittain-Catlin Monday,2:00-5:00 p.m.    This seminar presents the physical landscape of modern Britain, and particularly of London, through its buildings and through the working lives of the people who influenced it: the engineers, the builders, the visionaries. Students learn the basic tools of architectural and urban criticism by studying key structures, events, and personalities, and have the opportunity to demonstrate those tools through a series of different types of written and research assignments. By taking a number of central figures and presenting them and their biographies, students can not only build up historical knowledge of the major monuments of the city but also develop a useful contextual knowledge of the personalities and the period concerned. The course thus uses the architectural, urban, and engineering history of the capital as a way of introducing students to the cultural landscape of the country. Some of the characters featured in the course are architects; others are engineers, planners, or politicians. By presenting their life's work not only in the form of the built evidence but also in a biographical way, the course seeks to create a link between the many different sources of information and history, including literature and other artistic processes.    Timothy Brittain-Catlin is Intermediate General Studies Tutor at the Architectural Association in London, an architect, and a regular contributor to the Architectural Review. After working for ten years in urban design, he completed his doctorate at Cambridge University on AWN Pugin's houses. He is writing a book about English parsonages.    European Integration and the European Union as a Political System (V28.9502; call # 75709) Instructor: Eiko R. Thielemann Tuesday,9:00 a.m.-12:00noon    The European Union constitutes a uniquely ambitious project of international cooperation and governance beyond the state. This course explores the origins, development, institutions, major policies, policy-making, current problems, and matters of controversy of the European Community/Union. Students are also introduced to the major approaches applied to explain the complex system of EU policy-making. Among other things, we address questions such as why the Commission, Court, and Parliament have gained new powers, why market deregulation has proceeded faster than social and environmental protection, and why European elections do not work. Knowledge about the institutions and policy processes of the EU will help students to critically assess various questions that are facing Europe's citizens and leaders today: How should the single currency work? How can the EU's institutions be made more democratic? How far and how fast should the EU be enlarged? Should Europe develop into a federal (super) state?    Eiko R. Thielemann holds a Lectureship in European Politics and Policy at the London School of Economics. He completed the Ph.D. at Cambridge University. His research interests are in the areas of multilevel policy-making in the European Union; comparative analysis of public policy and institutions; new institutional theories; migrations; and state aid.

These small classes are taught by faculty from across the University and from the wider New York community. In some instances students may count the classes toward their major or minor, if the departments consider this appropriate; other classes will count simply as electives.    Collegiate Honors Seminars have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. In sum, these courses are meant to foster an environment in which learning is an exciting experience for students and faculty alike.    Sophomores and juniors have priority in registering for most of the Collegiate Honors Seminars. If seats remain after the end of early registration, seniors may also enroll.    Course Descriptions    Home of the Brave: Legal Aspects of American Use of Force since World War II (V28.0103; call # 75346) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Wednesday, 8:00-10:30 a.m.    The creation of the United Nations ushered in a new era in the international legal regulation of the use of force by states. Under the UN regime, states may use force in well-circumscribed circumstances, notably in self-defense against an armed attack or pursuant to a decision of the UN Security Council, to bring about a termination of a breach of the peace or a threat to the peace of the international community. The United States, both during and after the Cold War, has not shied away from the use of its considerable force, often provoking national and international controversy. Some instances, such as the Cuban missile crisis or the Vietnam War, have had profound effects on the self-understanding of the polity. The \"War on Terrorism\" has ushered in yet a new challenge in this area. This seminar first examines the international legal framework and then surveys the principal instances of American use of force, from Korea to Iraq. At issue are both the legality of past and present American practices and the adequacy of controlling international law and institutions. Junior and senior prelaw students will have priority in registering for this seminar.       J. H. H. Weiler is University Professor and European Union Jean Monnet Chair at NYU Law School. He serves as Chairman of the NYU Global Law School Program and is also Director of the Jean Monnet Center for International and Regional Economic Law and Justice. He was previously Professor of Law at the Michigan Law School and then the Manley Hudson Professor of Law and Jean Monnet Chair at the Harvard Law School. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as a World Trade Organization Panel Member. He is a founding editor of the European Journal of International Law , of the European Law Journal , and of the World Trade Review . His recent publications include The European Court of Justice (with G. de Burca), The EU, the WTO and the NAFTA , The Constitution of Europe , and a novella, Der Fall Steinmann .    Collective Urban Violence in America (V28.0105; call # 72296) Instructor: Daniel J. Walkowitz Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar examines the urban origins, character, and changing patterns of violence in American cities. It focuses on collective violence rather than on individual acts of violence, regardless of how many victims an individual may have claimed. One part of the course considers the extent to which American culture and political institutions encourage, sanctify, or militate against aggressive behavior and create a climate for or against violence. In that context, some of our concerns must be comparative, cross-cultural, and transnational. In addition, we address broad interdisciplinary conceptual questions that anthropologists, psychologists, and sociologists, in particular, ask about human nature, gender conditioning in Western cultures, and \"deviant\" subcultures. In creating a typology for the analysis of violence in American cities over time, we distinguish between forms of violence, the direction of changes sought, and the social and material characteristics of the antagonists -- is the conflict generated, for example, by a privileged elite seeking to protect authority it feels jeopardized by aspiring newcomers, or is it rooted in efforts by the dispossessed struggling to gain some notion of a fair share?    Daniel J. Walkowitz is Professor of History and Director of College Honors. A specialist in labor and working-class history, he has written numerous articles and co-edited or authored five books, including Working with Class: Social Workers and the Politics of Middle-Class Identity and Memory and the Impact of Political Transformation in Public Space . In addition, as co-founder and co-director of NYU's Graduate Program in Public History, he has pioneered efforts to bring America's past to broad general audiences through film and video. The subjects of his documentary projects have ranged from iron and cotton worker protests in Troy, New York, to a miners' strike in Donetsk, Ukraine.    20th-Century Europe in Literature and Memory (V28.0109; call # 75345) Instructor: Tony Judt Monday, 3:30-6:15 p.m.    This seminar addresses aspects of the history of Europe in the years 1914-1989 through the medium of literature: novels, essays, memoirs. The seminar will pay close attention to the books themselves. But we shall also be concerned with the world of their authors, with their subject matter, with their contemporary setting, and with their cultural impact (then and since). Among the themes to be addressed -- in the readings, the class discussion, and, eventually, the final papers -- are the following: the impact of the First World War, at the front and at home; the consequences of post-World War I imperial collapse and the lost culture of Central Europe; Italian society under Fascism; the Spanish Civil War; the show trials and the Stalinist terror; the Holocaust in literature and memory; life in post-Stalinist Eastern Europe; the origins of the Yugoslav catastrophe; literature, memory, and memoirs as historical sources for extreme experience. For their final paper, students will select a theme or topic from the period covered by this course and then, with the instructor's assistance, identify additional works of European fiction or memoir literature for discussion and analysis.    Tony Judt is Erich Maria Remarque Professor of European Studies and Director of the Remarque Institute at NYU. A Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he has written widely on modern French and Central European history, as well as on contemporary affairs in Europe and the United States. He is a regular contributor to the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, the Times Literary Supplement, and the New Republic . He directed a long-term international collaborative research project called \"Rethinking World War II and Its Aftermath in Europe.\" His book Postwar: A History of Europe since 1945 was published in 2005.    Geology and Antiquity in the Mediterranean (V28.0114; call # 75524) Instructor: Steven Soter Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Over timescales of centuries and millennia, geological forces have worked profound changes on the landscape of the Mediterranean. Gradual processes of silting, erosion, and local sea level change, as well as infrequent but catastrophic natural disasters -- earthquakes and tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and major floods -- have all left their marks. Many ancient sites are now deeply buried, while others lie exposed to the elements. Great ancient seaports now lie stranded miles inland from the nearest shore, while thepalace of Cleopatra is submerged. The oracle of Delphi, the legendary Atlantis, and the one-eyed giants of the Odyssey have origins in geological phenomena. This course explores the impact of geological forces on the natural and human environments of the ancient Mediterranean world. Special attention is given to the site of Helike -- a Greek city destroyed and submerged in the Early Bronze Age and again in Classical times -- which the instructor has been exploring.    Steven Soter is a Scientist-in-Residence at NYU's Center for Ancient Studies and a Research Associate in the Department of Astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History. He co-directs an interdisciplinary scientific team excavating the Early Bronze Age, Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman settlements at Helike, a coastal site on the Gulf of Corinth in Greece. He was co-author with Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan of the Cosmos television series and co-author of the two Hayden Planetarium space shows.    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V28.0116; call # 75332) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court's interpretation and application of the Constitution, and the Court's new, self-defined role, have adversely affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \"Imperial Judiciary.\" Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them, and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis, the Court's participation in the debate, and the effect that nine people appointed for life (the justices) have on how we live. Topics include abortion, euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights, gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; affirmative action; college speech codes, including \"hate\" speech, verbal sexual harassment, group liable and symbolic speech; prayer in school and students' right of privacy; and racial and ethnic profiling, government's right to detain accused terrorists, and the USA PATRIOT Act. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the political spectrum.    Alan J. Pomerantz, Esq. , is a practicing lawyer and partner of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, LLP, a major international law firm. A graduate of the NYU School of Law, he also studied in Chile and received an advanced legal degree from the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands). He has lectured and taught widely, including at the NYU School of Law, the University of Amsterdam, Columbia Graduate School, the University of Concepcion (Chile), the School of Visual Arts, and Hunter College High School. He has published numerous articles and contributed to several treatises on legal topics and is recognized in the International Who's Who -- Lawyers . Mr. Pomerantz and Weil, Gotshal have participated in important and controversial matters affecting individual rights, including death penalty appeals, rights of public artistic expression, political asylum applications, voting rights, right of privacy for acts of consenting adults, equal access laws for disabled persons, and numerous free speech cases.    The Port of New York (V28.0117; call # 72304) Instructor: Bryan Waterman Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This course offers an interdisciplinary approach to the study of New York City cultures through the prism of its waterfront and harbor, a source not only of the city's economic development but also of its multicultural and polyglot character. From a \"home base\" meeting location at NYU's Broome Street residence hall, the seminar seeks to make the city itself the classroom: at least half of the seminar is conducted out of doors or in cultural institutions downtown and elsewhere, including the South Street Seaport Museum, the Museum of Chinese in the Americas, Ellis Island Immigration Museum, the New-York Historical Society, and others. Incorporating discussions from the disciplines of architectural history, archaeology, literary studies, and history, the seminar foregrounds problems of discipline and method in the study of the city's cultures and therefore seeks participation from the range of disciplines and departments that make up CAS. Topics include the founding of New Amsterdam, slavery in British Manhattan and the early American Republic, immigration's perpetual reshaping of city cultures, the emergence of popular forms such as blackface minstrelsy, the \"destruction\" of lower Manhattan in the 20th century, the decline of the port and its marketplaces, the development of the World Trade Center, and the ongoing effects of the 9/11 attacks.    Bryan Waterman , Assistant Professor of English, received his Ph.D. from Boston University in American Studies; since 2001 he has been a member of NYU's English department, where he teaches courses in early American literature and \"Writing New York\" (with Professor Cyrus Patell). He is the author of articles on late 18th-century New York City's literary and intellectual cultures, as well as Republic of Intellect: The Friendly Club of New York City and the Enlightenment Origins of American Literature (forthcoming). He is a Faculty Fellow in Residence at Broome Street and is currently at work on a book about seduction narratives in the era of the American and French Revolutions.    The Security Council and Peacekeeping Operations in the 21st Century (V28.0120; call # 72308) Instructor: Elisabeth Lindenmayer Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    This course focuses on the role of the Security Council of the United Nations as a decision-making body in the maintenance of international peace and security. It examines the evolution of the Security Council since the end of the Cold War and reviews how its decisions have deeply affected international relations. It also reviews the evolution of peacekeeping operations through a selective examination of the literature and case studies, some of which will be based on the instructor's experience. The course explores some of the major successes and setbacks of the Security Council and the many lessons learned. It focuses on the varying responses of the international community to humanitarian crises. We will ask the question \"Whose responsibility is it to protect?\" Finally, the course seeks to demonstrate the need for reforms to address the unprecedented challenges of the 21st century, including the reform of the Security Council. Students who have taken V50.0363 may not register for this course.    Elisabeth Lindenmayer has had a long career with the United Nations, where she served as the Deputy Chef de Cabinet and as the Executive Assistant to the current Secretary General, Kofi Annan. In addition, she carried substantive responsibilities relating to peacekeeping operations dealing with the crises in Iraq-Kuwait,Somalia,Rwanda, and the Great Lakes region. She has also taught at Columbia University.    Machiavelli's Wake (V28.0121; call # 72309) Instructor: William Klein Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    How influential can a writer be? Do people hear what they aren't prepared by history to hear? Can readers in one set of circumstances do anything but distort or misunderstand or ironically overturn what was written in another set of circumstances? It is one thing to ask these sorts of questions about the influence of an original literary mind on others, but perhaps another when the writer experiments not only with literary forms but with social, moral, religious, political, or military ones as well. Machiavelli was a writer whose wake caused disturbances in all of these areas -- so much so that to study it, in all of its complexity and ambiguity, is to study the emergence of modernity itself. In our readings, we will look for areas in which the early modern world seemed to be ready for Machiavelli's recovery of the ancient Greek awareness of the agony of political life. We will also look for those areas in which the readiness may not have been anticipated by Machiavelli himself (such as in moral attitudes toward the growth of capitalism). We will look for areas where people professed not to be ready, and at those where apparent readiness competed with deep unease (as may have been the case with Shakespeare). These historical explorations would be of limited interest if they did not push us to ask what our own era (of multinational corporations and unmanned war machines and feminism and pornography...) can make of Machiavelli. Have we outgrown him, or are we still engaged? If the latter, would that be a good thing?    William Klein teaches the history of political discourse in NYU's General Studies Program. In the College of Arts and Science he has also taught in both the Morse Academic Plan and the Freshman Honors Seminar Program. He writes on a range of topics, from Renaissance political thought to constitutional history and to modern crime.    The Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan (V28.0124; call # 75344) Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller Tuesday, Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    The operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were composed during a period of intense change in the world of symphonic music and opera in the 19th century. This seminar examines nine of the major works and their historical, cultural, and musical contexts. It also examines the lives of the composer and the librettist and their respective milieux -- Sullivan as one of the few English composers of the century to achieve international recognition, and Gilbert in terms of the various literary movements to which he belonged and which he parodied. In addition, it considers the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and its activities; the singers, scenic designers, choreographers, and costumers who functioned with the company; and the principal sources for the music, a majority of which are housed currently in New York City's J. Pierpont Morgan Library, along with numerous artifacts from the productions.    Rena Charnin Mueller, Clinical Associate Professor of Music, specializes in 19th-century music, in particular, the compositional aesthetic of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. Her most recent publications include an essay for the volume Liszt and His World , in conjunction with the 2006 Bard Festival, and an article on performances of Liszt and Wagner in New York between 1840 and 1890. Her work on the Liszt Lieder appears in the Cambridge Companion to the Lied (2004). She has published new editions of Les Preludes (1997), the Trois Etudes de Concert (1996), and the two Ballades (1996). With Maria Eckhardt, she is the author of the Franz Liszt \"List of Works\" for The New Grove 2000 , and they are also co-authoring the forthcoming Franz Liszt Thematic Catalogue . In 2003, she was a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.    Introduction to Cognitive Science (V28.0125; call # 75343) Instructor: Bob Rehder Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Cognitive science is the study of cognition or intelligent behavior -- of its nature, characteristics, and processes. It is a multidisciplinary approach to the study of cognition and intelligent systems that incorporates elements of psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, and computer science. It claims to provide answers to controversies such as the nature of mind, the role of the brain in cognitive processes, the possibility of artificial intelligence, and the relation of the mind/brain to culture and the outside world. Because cognitive science is intimately tied to issues in philosophy of mind and science, the course also discusses cognitive science's philosophical aspects and its historical development. The class addresses some of the traditional challenges to cognitive science (e.g., the problems of intentionality and consciousness), as well as a number of more recent challenges (e.g., connectionism, neuroscience, and situated action and culture). No prior knowledge of cognitive science is required.    Bob Rehder received a B.S. in computer science and B.A. in physics from Washington University at St. Louis, an M.S. in artificial intelligence from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He has been a member of NYU's Psychology Department since 2001. His work has been published in a number of scholarly journals, including the Journal of Experimental Psychology and the Journal of Educational Psychology.    Beauty Matters (V28.0127; call # 75342) Instructor: Deborah Willis Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    This seminar explores the problematics of beauty -- a subject that is contested in art, in the media, and in everyday culture. It looks at the ways in which our contemporary understanding of aesthetic pleasure is informed by and constructed from visual culture in museums, photography, advertising, film, and music. From the moment that photography was invented in 1839, people began to have their portraits made. These images offered a framework in which to imagine the history behind the photographic surface and to explore the notion of transformation. Class discussions will focus on how beauty has been imagined and realized. Using a series of case studies, we will consider the political image, race, class, and gender. The aim is to enable students to think critically about the notion of aesthetic pleasure and to consider the consequences of their views. The emphasis will be on reading, interpreting, and evaluating racialized, sexualized, and objectified images of men and women. We will look at the works of a broad range of photographic artists -- in fashion, narrative films, exhibitions, family images, and zine culture -- to examine viewers' responses. Open to TSOA students (priority to Photography students) and CAS students. TSOA students should contact Irene Cho in the Photography department to register.    Deborah Willis is University Professor and Professor of Photography and Imaging in the Tisch School of the Arts. Her many awards include a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, an Alfonse Fletcher, Jr. Fellowship, a Mac Arthur Fellowship, an Anonymous Was a Woman Foundation Award, and an International Center of Photography Infinity Award for Writing on Photography. As a former curator of exhibitions at the Smithsonian Institution's Center for African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and as the curator of photography and prints at the New York Public Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, she has organized exhibitions and lectured extensively on African American photography. She is the author of Picturing Us: African American Identity in Photography, Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers, 1840 to the Present, The Black Female Body: A Photographic History (with Carla Williams), Black: A Celebration of Culture, and, most recently, Family History Memory: Recording African American Life.    Origins of World War I (V28.0128; call # 75341) Instructor: Stewart A. Stehlin Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The course explores the instability of the European state system in the pre-1914 era and the causes and responsibility for the war by examining the contributions of each of the major European states to the outbreak of war. It considers the Bismarckian system of European diplomacy and the balance of power as it existed before the war, the various diplomatic crises before 1914, the interrelation of internal events in the various countries to their foreign policy, and the various interpretations of the causes of the war. Topics include the Moroccan crises, the weaknesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Anglo-German naval and economic rivalries, the Balkan struggles for independence, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo, the personal responsibility of the individual statesmen, the ever-widening conflict, and the attempts to contain it.    Stewart A. Stehlin is Professor Emeritus of History. His areas of teaching have been the development of the modern European state system in the 19th and 20th centuries, the history of modern Germany, and European diplomatic history of the 19th and 20th centuries. His research has centered on European cultural history, diplomatic history, and German history, especially German-Vatican affairs. Among his publications are Bismarck and the Guelph Movement, 1866-1890 , a translation of Friedrich Ratzel's Sketches of Urban and Cultural Life in North America , and Weimar and the Vatican , German-Vatican Diplomatic Relations between the Wars, 1919-1933 . He is currently working on a book, Rome and the Reich: German-Vatican Relations during the Kaiserreich, 1870-1919 .    Rethinking Who We Are: Interpersonal Approaches to the Person (V28.0129; call # 75340) Instructor: Michael Westerman Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    There are unresolved tensions in the field of psychology between individual-centered models of the person and interpersonal ones. The seminar is based on the belief that in order to make progress on these unresolved issues we need to recognize that they refer to a long-standing fundamental question philosophers began wondering about centuries before the discipline of psychology came into existence -- What place do our relationships with other people have in our lives? Moreover, we need to engage in an inquiry that involves a dynamic interplay between psychological considerations and philosophical ones. Participants in the seminar learn about work in several specific areas where these tensions appear, including models of child development, approaches to psychopathology, and basic questions about psychotherapy. We also consider more \"interpersonal\" versus more individual-centered ways in which psychologists think about interpersonal interaction itself. The final topic concerns the philosophy of the social sciences. We look at recent contributions by psychologists and philosophers suggesting that we replace traditional concepts of the process of psychological research with a social view of that process. Throughout the seminar, we refer to classic philosophical texts and contributions by historians of ideas to explore critically the ways in which contemporary efforts by psychologists reflect concepts of the person from our philosophical tradition. Students who have taken V50.0247 may not register for this seminar.    Michael A. Westerman is Associate Professor of Psychology. His area is clinical psychology. He has conducted research on several topics concerning interpersonal relationships, including studies of mother-child interaction, family systems, and the patient-therapist relationship in psychotherapy. His publications also include articles on issues in philosophical psychology. He is currently involved in a program of research based on an interpersonal reconceptualization of psychological defenses he has developed that is called the theory of interpersonal defense.    Representing Animals: The Discourse of Species in Contemporary Art and Media (V28.0130; call # 75339) Instructor: Una Chaudhuri Friday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 noon    Claude Levi-Strauss said that animals feature so prominently in myth and ritual \"not because they are 'good to eat' but because they are ' good to think .'\" The history of art and literature suggests that they are also good to paint, sculpt, photograph, film, and write about. A new interdisciplinary field of study has begun to move the animal out of its niche in science and insert it into fields that have, perhaps, constituted themselves in (unconscious) opposition to it: the \"humanities.\" Animal studies explores the meaning of cultural animal practices, ranging from literary genres like fables and fairy-tales to animal acts in circuses and fairs, to social practices like pet-keeping, cock-fighting, dog shows, equestrian displays, rodeos, bullfighting, hunting, fur-wearing, and meat-eating. These and other animal practices constitute an ever-changing and vastly complicated \"discourse of species,\" which in turn informs our accounts of the human, the \"Other\" (including the racial and ethnic Other), and the world. We will study a range of contemporary representations of animals -- in fiction, poetry, film, television, fashion, and popular culture -- with a view to understanding the current state of the discourse of species. How does the imagery of mass culture shape our attitudes to animals? How do artists, activists, and ordinary people disrupt those attitudes? How are we feeling about, imagining, living with, and \"thinking\" animals today?Readings will also include works of philosophy (Nietzsche, Derrida, Deleuze and Guattari, Singer) and recent animal studies books such as Steven Baker's The Postmodern Animal , Akira Lippit's The Electric Animal , Donna Haraway's A Companion Species Manifesto , and the Animal Studies Group's Killing Animals.    Una Chaudhuri is Professor of English and Drama. She is the author of No Man's Stage: A Semiotic Study of Jean Genet's Plays and Staging Place: The Geography of Modern Drama , editor of Rachel's Brain and Other Storms: The Performance Scripts of Rachel Rosenthal , and co-editor, with Elinor Fuchs, of the recently published critical anthology Land/Scape/Theater . She is currently working on a project that explores the intersections of theater and performance with the emerging field of animal studies.    Jews and Germans: Old Memories and New Beginnings in Postwar Germany (V28.0131; call # 75337) Instructor: Marion Kaplan Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    This course explores the interactions of Jews and Germans after World War II, noting their interlocking histories and memories even after the Holocaust. Students learn about the immediate postwar turmoil, the displaced persons, Allied occupation, and \"denazification.\" They analyze how Germans -- East and West -- did or did not come to terms with the Nazi past. They read Jewish perspectives on their lives in West and East Germany, why they remained, how they experienced their citizenship, how they interacted with Germans, and how re-unification (in 1990) affected them.Readings analyze conflicting German and Jewish historical memories, including the silence about the Holocaust of the early postwar years, the student rebellion of 1968, the viewing of the American TV series Holocaust , the Historians' Debate of the 1980s and 1990s, and the building of museums and monuments about Jewish history and the Holocaust. The seminar entails advanced work in research and conceptual skills. Thus, students not only learn about the history of postwar Germany but also discuss debates surrounding this history.    Marion Kaplan is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History. She is the author of The Jewish Feminist Movement in Germany : The Campaigns of the Judischer Frauenbund, l904-l938 (1979), The Making of the Jewish Middle Class: Women, Family, and Identity in Imperial Germany (1991), and Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany (1998). The last two won the National Jewish Book Award in their respective years. She has edited books on European women's history: When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany and The Marriage Bargain: Dowries in European History . Her most recent books are Jewish Daily Life in Germany , 1618-1945 and Judische Welten: Juden in Deutschland vom 18. Jahrhundert bis in die Gegenwart (a co-edited volume).    Readings in Modern Chinese Social Thought (V28.0132; call # 75335) Prerequisite: Completion of intermediate Chinese or equivalent Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, Wednesday 4:55-6:10 p.m.    This seminar introduces students with post-intermediate knowledge of Chinese to the major texts by leading writers and intellectuals of modern China. The goal is threefold: (1) to help students interested in modern China develop linguistic competence through intensive readings in cultural and intellectual discourses; (2) to prepare those who already have advanced language skills for a more in-depth encounter with the canon in modern Chinese culture; and (3) to familiarize students with the central arguments and stylistic mannerisms of the leading figures in modern Chinese culture and society through systematic interpretative-translational practice.Readings consist of foundational texts by canonic authors over the country's tumultuous modern period. Texts are selected either in full or in abridged form, with grammatical points and content-based annotations arranged in a way that allows close reading and interpretation. Under the broad rubric of social change and its intellectual reflections, specific topics include the Chinese Enlightenment, vernacular cultural revolution, women's rights and women's liberation, socialism and mass democracy, the attraction and problems of Westernization, the economic reform and new social liberty, the autonomy or \"subjectivity\" of Chinese culture, and the national debate on university reform. Authors include such modern classical writers as Liang Qichao, Hu Shi, Lu Xun, and Mao Zedong, as well as influential contemporary writers and intellectuals like Li Zehou, Gan Yang, Liu Xiaofeng, and Wang Anyi.    Jing Wang is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990's (2002). In 2000, she was the featured columnist/translator on foreign literature for the literary magazine Shanghai Literature . Her teaching and research interests include women writers in China and the West, literary translation, modern Chinese social thought, and comparative studies of cities and urban culture. In addition to literary translations, she also publishes personal essays.    Literature and Science: Pathways and Intersections (V28.0133; call # 75738) Instructors: Daniel Malamud and Martha Rust Tuesday, 5:00-7:30 p.m.    In 1959 C. P. Snow lectured on \"the two cultures,\" arguing that the life of the mind in Western culture was suffering from an increasing rift between two opposing factions: \"literary intellectuals at one pole -- at the other scientists . . . between the two a gulf of mutual incomprehension.\" This seminar analyzes the relationship between literature and science, asking if these are indeed two cultures or if, instead, they are two distinct yet related disciplines that interact synergistically -- as if they were on opposite sides of a semi-permeable membrane. The beauty of a semi-permeable membrane resides in the sheer elegance of a design that assures a regulated, bidirectional transfer of materials, which, in turn, supports the metabolism of living things. Something similar could be said of a metaphor, which transfers the meaning of a word from one conceptual realm to another, enabling \"fluid\" reasoning and bold \"leaps\" of imagination. This course explores another vital interface: the mutually informative matrix of connections between literature and science. It focuses on a series of topics that highlight the polarity between scientists and \"literary intellectuals\" : aesthetics, sex and gender, nature and nurture, life and death, health and disease, to name a few. In examining the diverse approaches that literature and science adopt in studying these topics and in disseminating their findings, we also seek to bring into view the productive interface the two disciplines share. In turn, we will discover some of the ways that Snow's \"two cultures\" might be influenced by and learn from the other.Readings are wide ranging: from Camus' The Plague to poetry by William Carlos Williams and Sharon Olds, to works by Sigmund Freud and Susan Sontag, to articles in scientific journals such as Nature and Science .    Daniel Malamud , Professor of Basic Sciences at the NYU College of Dentistry, is a biochemist working on pathogenesis and novel diagnostics for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. Prior to joining the NYU faculty in 2005, he taught courses in Literature and Science and the Literature of AIDS at the University of Pennsylvania.    Martha Rust , Assistant Professor of English, brings a background in health sciences to her career as a medievalist and teaches courses on both medieval English literature and medicine in literature in NYU's English department. Her first book, Imaginary Worlds in Medieval Books: Exploring the Manuscript Matrix , is forthcoming spring 2007, and she is at work on a second, entitled Item: Lists and the Poetics of Reckoning in Late-Medieval England .    Past and Present in Irish Archaeology (V28.0134; call # 75523) Instructor: Pam Crabtree Tuesday, Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.    Ireland has a rich archaeological heritage that includes hunter-gatherers of the Mesolithic Period, Megalithic tombs at Knowth and Newgrange, the Hill of Tara, early Christian monasteries such as Clonmacnoise, and the Viking settlements in Dublin itself. This course will consider how the Irish past has been constructed and what role that this construction of the Irish past has played in the modern world. We will review the archaeology of Ireland from its initial settlement in the Mesolithic through the British colonization of Northern Ireland in the early Modern Era. The course will also examine the impact of rapid economic development on Ireland's archaeological resources, including the current debate surrounding the site of Tara.    Pam Crabtree , Associate Professor of Anthropology, is a zooarchaeologist whose research interests center broadly on the uses of faunal remains to study past animal husbandry patterns, hunting practices, and diet. She is also interested in the use of archaeologically recovered animal remains to study trade, social status, ethnicity, and prehistoric ritual. Her primary area of interest is later prehistoric and early medieval Europe, but she has also worked on Natufian settlement and subsistence in the Southern Levant and 18th- and 19th-century sites in eastern North America. Crabtree is currently a member of an archaeological team that is surveying the Irish royal site of Dun Ailinne in Ireland. Her work has been published in a number of edited volumes and journals, including the Journal of Field Archaeology and World Archaeology . She and her co-author Bradley Adams recently completed a forthcoming book entitled Comparative Skeletal Morphology .    The Birth of the Mind: Genes, Evolution, and Human Nature (V28.0135; call # 75522) Instructor: Gary Marcus Tuesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.    This course explores the origins of the human mind from two perspectives: the origins of our species (a question about evolution) and the development of individuals, from conception to birth to educated adult. Questions that we will address include: What is the relation between nature and nurture? Has evolution played an important role in shaping the mind? Are we merely \"drifts in the currents\" of our genes? Are human beings optimal thinkers \"noble in reason,\" or is the mind better thought of as a jury-rigged Swiss-army knife of haphazard cognitive tools? Our approach will be interdisciplinary, drawing on fields ranging from genetics and developmental biology to psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience.Readings will include articles from the primary literature and four books written for the educated lay reader -- Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct (1994) and How the Mind Works (1997), and the instructor's own The Birth of the Mind (2004) and Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind (forthcoming).    Gary Marcus is Professor of Psychology and Director of the NYU Infant Language Learning Center. He is the author of two books about the origins and nature of the mind and editor of a third. His research on developmental cognitive neuroscience has been published in over 40 articles in leading journals such as Science , Nature , Cognition , Cognitive Psychology , and the Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development. In 1996 he won the Robert L. Fantz award for new investigators in cognitive development, and in 2002-03 he was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in Social and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford.    Pharmaceutical Drugs, Ethics, and Culture (V28.0136; call # 75521) Instructors: David A. Scicchitano and Andrea McKenzie Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar is designed to introduce students to contemporary issues in the realm of pharmaceuticals, focusing on drug design, safety, and distribution. Early in the seminar, students are introduced to the basic concepts of drug research and testing, with an emphasis on the Food and Drug Administration rules for bringing a drug to the clinic and eventually to the marketplace. This leads to the complex issues related to drug distribution inside and outside the United States, the societal implications associated with new therapeutic regimens, and the economic factors and laws that come into play. The seminar also develops students' writing, critical thinking, and presentation skills, with emphasis placed on researching, evaluating, and presenting evidence. Students who have taken V23.0005 may not register for this seminar.    David A. Scicchitano is Professor of Biology and also the CAS Director of Undergraduate Science Initiatives. His research interests include the way environmental agents, particularly chemicals, interact with and damage DNA, interfering with fundamental cellular process, and triggering pathology. His work is funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health.    Andrea McKenzie is the Director of Writing in the Disciplines with the Expository Writing Program. She collaborates with professors from a wide range of disciplines to incorporate writing and public speaking as active learning strategies in subject-specific courses. She has performed curriculum design work and taught graduate and undergraduate courses in writing and public speaking at NYU, MIT, and the University of Waterloo (Canada).    American Mythology and Its Biblical Sources (V28.0137; call # 75520) Instructor: Christopher Collins Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Especially in times of crisis, Americans tend to rally around leaders who reassure them that God has blessed theirs above all other nations -- given her a mission to feed, clothe, and enlighten the less fortunate, to liberate the world from tyranny and crime, and eventually to inaugurate an era of universal peace. This seminar will examine the biblical sources of this political mythology and the historical instances of its cynical use, for example, in representing North America as a Promised Land reserved for a new Chosen People, in identifying Indians and Africans as cursed races, and in regarding American foreign policy as divinely ordained and therefore exempt from international law. The Machiavellian exploitation of American religion is important to expose, but it is, of course, an old story. While this course will tell that story, in doing so it will keep as its major focus the credulity of the many, rather than the mendacity of the few. Unlike other contemporary critiques, this text-centered historical survey of American \"truthiness\" will raise that one, crucial, but seldom asked question: why is it that so many of us believe the lies we are told?    Christopher Collins is Professor of English and author of a number of books on the psychology and rhetoric of literature, including Reading the Written Image: Verbal Play, Interpretation, and the Roots of Iconophobia ; The Poetics of the Mind's Eye: Literature and the Psychology of Imagination ; and Authority Figures: Metaphors of Mastery from the Iliad to the Apocalypse . His latest book, Homeland Mythology: Biblical Narratives in American Culture, will be published in 2007.    Socrates and His Critics (V28.0138; call # 75739) Instructor: Vincent Renzi Tuesday, Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    Despite writing nothing himself, Socrates is, perhaps, the most influential philosopher in the Western tradition. With him, philosophy first moves from natural history to an explicit concern for human affairs. So great is this change that we continue to term those earlier thinkers \"pre-Socratic philosophers.\" So too, his name is given to a distinctive form of philosophical literature, the Socratic dialogue, and to an approach to philosophical inquiry and instruction, the Socratic method. In antiquity, his thought inspired Plato, Xenophon, the Stoics, the Skeptics, and the Cynics, beyond them to influence in Rome and Judea . . . and four centuries before Jesus, he already suffered martyrdom for his idiosyncratic political, philosophical, and religious views. In modernity, he both fascinates and repels Kierkegaard and Nietzsche; already in his own time, he endured criticisms of his way of life, notably from the comedian Aristophanes. Given the evidence, we can look only to the history of the reception of his thought to recover any sense of the \"historical Socrates.\" We must likewise ask whether he does not exert a greater influence as a result of his reputation than for his actual intellectual contributions. In short, had Socrates not existed, wouldn't the tradition essentially have had to create him, in its move from its origins to ethics and political philosophy? Even given that he did actually live, is what we have of him really just such a necessary fiction?    Vincent Renzi is Associate Director of the Morse Academic Plan for the Foundations of Contemporary Culture, where he regularly offers Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the 19th Century, in both regular and writing-intensive versions. He taught previously at Columbia University. In addition to his specialization in ancient Greek philosophy, he maintains interests in 19th- and 20th-century Continental philosophy, ancient studies, history of philosophy, and aesthetics.    Theater of War: Ancient Warfare in Ancient Drama (V28.0139; call # 75758) Instructor: Peter Meineck Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This seminar will examine ancient attitudes to war and its effects on society in ancient Greece as conveyed primarily in drama but also in art and literature. Why do we fight? Why is war still the most pervasive political force on the planet? What are the origins of attitudes to warfare in Western culture? The class will study ancient texts in translation and discuss vase painting, architecture, and sculpture to understand the cultural forces that created the Greek way of war and how military innovations and organization had a profound influence on the development of political and social institutions. We will read selections from Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Aris\u00adtophanes, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Plato, and Demosthenes. We will also examine pre-classical military structures, such as those in the ancient Near East, and look at the impact of Greek warfare on the Hellenistic period, on Rome, and on some of the military philosophies that prevail today.    Peter Meineck is Artistic Director of the Aquila Theatre Company, which has performed the Iliad at Lincoln Center and regularly produces classical plays in New York and on national tours. He is also Clinical Assistant Professor both in Classics and in Drama at NYU and Artist in Residence at NYU's Center for Ancient Studies. He has published several translations of Greek plays.    Writing in the Information Age (V28.0140; call # 75861) Instructor: Natalie Jeremijenko Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. ; lab, Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    Take a moment to ask yourself if there is any product you use, live with, or can see about which you could say how, by whom, or where it was made. Given that the manufacturing sector is the most poisonous of all sectors of all global human activities, is our collective ignorance defensible in an information society? The opportunity for change that new information technologies present could conceivably be an opportunity to promote innovation, sustainable manufacturing, transparent labor conditions, and environmental accountability. Likewise, it could promote a closed information context of trade secrets, nondisclosures, IP portfolios, labeling strategies, and closed doors. In this course we will lift the veil between production and consumption, each student taking on a case study to ask how and if open information context can promote innovation, and what structure of accountability will best facilitate this. Writing a visual essay for a wiki-based visual encyclopedia [howstuffismade.org], students will themselves learn standards of evidence and accountability involved in the production of information for the information commons, exploring their own responsibility and capacity for developing and proposing some of these changes.    Natalie Jeremijenko is a Global Distinguished Professor at NYU. An artist/experimenter and information engineer, she is one of the founders of the field of tangible media (also known as physical computing). Her work centers on structures of participation in the information age and the political and social possibilities (and limitations) of information technologies -- mostly through large-scale public experiments. In this vein, her work spans a range of media from statistical indices (such as the Despondency Index, which linked the Dow Jones to the suicide rate at San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge) to biological substrates (such as the installations of cloned trees in pairs in various urban micro-climates) to robotics (such as the development of feral robotic dog packs to investigate environmental hazards). Her graduate work at Stanford and the University of Queensland was in the fields of design engineering and information science. Previous faculty positions have included appointments in Yale University's Department of Mechanical Engineering, in the Department of Visual Art at the University of California at San Diego, and as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at Michigan State University.    Collegiate Honors Seminars Abroad    NYU in London    Builders of Britain (V28.9501; call # 75529) Instructor: Timothy Brittain-Catlin Monday,2:00-5:00 p.m.    This seminar presents the physical landscape of modern Britain, and particularly of London, through its buildings and through the working lives of the people who influenced it: the engineers, the builders, the visionaries. Students learn the basic tools of architectural and urban criticism by studying key structures, events, and personalities, and have the opportunity to demonstrate those tools through a series of different types of written and research assignments. By taking a number of central figures and presenting them and their biographies, students can not only build up historical knowledge of the major monuments of the city but also develop a useful contextual knowledge of the personalities and the period concerned. The course thus uses the architectural, urban, and engineering history of the capital as a way of introducing students to the cultural landscape of the country. Some of the characters featured in the course are architects; others are engineers, planners, or politicians. By presenting their life's work not only in the form of the built evidence but also in a biographical way, the course seeks to create a link between the many different sources of information and history, including literature and other artistic processes.    Timothy Brittain-Catlin is Intermediate General Studies Tutor at the Architectural Association in London, an architect, and a regular contributor to the Architectural Review. After working for ten years in urban design, he completed his doctorate at Cambridge University on AWN Pugin's houses. He is writing a book about English parsonages.    European Integration and the European Union as a Political System (V28.9502; call # 75709) Instructor: Eiko R. Thielemann Tuesday,9:00 a.m.-12:00noon    The European Union constitutes a uniquely ambitious project of international cooperation and governance beyond the state. This course explores the origins, development, institutions, major policies, policy-making, current problems, and matters of controversy of the European Community/Union. Students are also introduced to the major approaches applied to explain the complex system of EU policy-making. Among other things, we address questions such as why the Commission, Court, and Parliament have gained new powers, why market deregulation has proceeded faster than social and environmental protection, and why European elections do not work. Knowledge about the institutions and policy processes of the EU will help students to critically assess various questions that are facing Europe's citizens and leaders today: How should the single currency work? How can the EU's institutions be made more democratic? How far and how fast should the EU be enlarged? Should Europe develop into a federal (super) state?    Eiko R. Thielemann holds a Lectureship in European Politics and Policy at the London School of Economics. He completed the Ph.D. at Cambridge University. His research interests are in the areas of multilevel policy-making in the European Union; comparative analysis of public policy and institutions; new institutional theories; migrations; and state aid.

One way the College has done so is through its Seminar program, which gives students the opportunity to participate in small, intellectually stimulating classes on important topics taught by distinguished professors drawn not only from the College's faculty but also from NYU's professional schools and from among New York's professional, cultural, and governmental leaders.    In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic principles behind the very successful Freshman Honors Seminars, offered since 1992, to upper-level courses. These small classes are taught by faculty from across the University and from the wider New York community. In some instances students may count the classes toward their major or minor, if the departments consider this appropriate; other classes will count simply as electives.    Advanced Honors Seminars have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. In sum, these courses are meant to foster an environment in which learning is an exciting experience for students and faculty alike.    Sophomores and juniors have priority in registering for most of the Advanced Honors Seminars. If seats remain after the end of early registration, seniors may also enroll.    Course Descriptions    Home of the Brave: Legal Aspects of American Use of Force since World War II (V28.0103; call # 72742) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Friday, 8:00 - 10:30 a.m.    The creation of the United Nations ushered in a new era in the international legal regulation of the use of force by states. Under the UN regime, states may use force in well-circumscribed circumstances, notably in self-defense against an armed attack or pursuant to a decision of the UN Security Council, to bring about a termination of a breach of the peace or a threat to the peace of the international community. The United States, both during and after the Cold War, has not shied away from the use of its considerable force, often provoking national and international controversy. Some instances, such as the Cuban missile crisis or the Vietnam War, have had profound effects on the self-understanding of the polity. The \"War on Terrorism\" has ushered in yet a new challenge in this area. This seminar first examines the international legal framework and then surveys the principal instances of American use of force, from Korea to Iraq. At issue are both the legality of past and present American practices and the adequacy of controlling international law and institutions. The seminar is taught at the Law School to law school standards \u2014 rigorous but academically and intellectually rewarding. Junior and senior prelaw students will have priority in registering for this seminar.       J. H. H. Weiler is University Professor and European Union Jean Monnet Chair at NYU Law School. He serves as Director of the Jean Monnet Center for International and Regional Economic Law and Justice. He was previously Professor of Law at the Michigan Law School and then the Manley Hudson Professor of Law and Jean Monnet Chair at the Harvard Law School. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as a World Trade Organization Panel Member. He is a founding editor of the European Journal of International Law , of the European Law Journal , and of the World Trade Review . His recent publications include The European Court of Justice (with G. de Burca), The EU, the WTO and the NAFTA , The Constitution of Europe , and a novella, Der Fall Steinmann .    Political Cinema and Representation of the Other (V28.0107; call # 75393) Instructor: Shimon Dotan Friday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00noon    Representation of the Other is a variation of the search for self-identity. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its political cinema exhibit a clear pattern in which the parties attribute to the Other qualities and traits that reflect their own distress and aspirations. But how does the concept of representation connect meaning to a sequence of successive images? Which of the following accounts (in a variation on Stuart Hall) will apply to a cinematic work? The reflective \u2014 does film reflect a meaning, which already exists in the real world? The intentional \u2014 does film express only what the filmmaker intends to express? The constructionist \u2014 is meaning constructed in and through the process of filmmaking? Each class consists of a screening followed by a discussion concentrating on representation in the context of the political conflict, variations in use of film language to achieve a subjective portrayal and modalities of representation and self-critique. Screenings include films such as The Battle of Algiers , by Bruno Pontecorvo; Divine Intervention , by Elia Suleiman; Fog of War , by Earl Morris; Final Cup , by Eran Riklis; and The Smile of the Lamb , by Shimon Dotan.    Shimon Dotan , a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with ten feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive ; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. Dotan has taught filmmaking at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal.    Cinema and Society in Europe since 1945 (V28.0112; call # 75329) Instructor: Tony Judt Tuesday, 3:30 - 6:00 p.m., and Thursday, 3:30 - 4:45 p.m.    This seminar addresses aspects of the history of European history since World War II through postwar European cinema. The seminar will pay attention to the films themselves, as art and as entertainment; but we shall also and above all be concerned with their subject matter, their contemporary setting, and their impact (at the time and since). Participants will meet twice weekly: once to see that week's film, once for discussion. In addition to watching the films, students will be required to read assigned works of history dealing with the period. Among the themes to be addressed \u2014 in the films, the readings, the class discussion, and, eventually, the final papers \u2014 are the following: war and civil war as represented and remembered in the postwar decades; the Cold War; decolonization; the European \"economic miracle\" and its attendant social impact; the \"sixties\"; different generations of migration, both into Europe and within and between countries; national identities and the attached stereotypes; the Yugoslav Wars; remembering (and forgetting) Communism; and the Holocaust in postwar European consciousness. A final paper will require students to choose one theme and then, with instructor's assistance, identify a body of related films to see and discuss.    Tony Judt is Erich Maria Remarque Professor of European Studies and Director of the Remarque Institute at NYU. A Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he has written widely on modern French and Central European history, as well as on contemporary affairs in Europe and the United States. He is a regular contributor to the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, the Times Literary Supplement, and the NewRepublic . He directed a long-term international collaborative research project called \"Rethinking World War II and Its Aftermath in Europe.\" His book Postwar: A History of Europe since 1945 was published in 2005.    The History of Disbelief (V28.0113; call # 75328) Instructor: Mitchell Stephens Wednesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    This seminar will take up an extended history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of religion). It will begin in Greece and then move on to a brief discussion of anthropological perspectives on belief, before returning to Greece, the Hebrews and Rome, to India and Baghdad, and then back to Europe during the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the Romantic period. Time will be spent in England and America in the 19th century, when disbelief was being tied to radical politics, before moving on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence of God will be considered. However, the main purpose of this course will be to force students to confront and grapple with some of the most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief. Authors whose works will be read may include Cicero, Hume, Holbach, Paine, Shelley, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Woolf, and Freud, among others.    Mitchell Stephens is Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication. He is the author of, among other books, the rise of the image the fall of the word and A History of News . Articles by him on media issues, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and other subjects have appeared in the New York Times , Washington Post , Los Angeles Times , FEED, and other publications. He has recorded radio commentaries for Marketplace and On the Media , and serves as history consultant to the Newseum in Washington, D.C. In 2001 he completed a trip around the world, during which he reported for public radio and a number of websites on cultural homogenization. He is also director of the Russian-American Journalism Institute in Rostov-on-Don.    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V28.0116; call # 72746) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Wednesday, 4:55 - 7:25 p.m.    The U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court's interpretation and application of the Constitution have adversely affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \"Imperial Judiciary.\" Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them, and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis, the Court's participation in the debate, and the effect that nine people appointed for life (the justices) have on how we live. Topics include abortion, euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights, gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; affirmative action; college speech codes, including \"hate\" speech and symbolic speech; and racial and ethnic profiling. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the political spectrum, and are expected to apply critical thinking to the topics.    Alan J. Pomerantz , Esq., is a practicing lawyer and partner of Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe, a major international law firm. A graduate of the NYU School of Law, he also studied in Chile and received an advanced legal degree from the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands). He has lectured and taught widely, including at the NYU School of Law, the University of Amsterdam, Columbia Graduate School, the University of Concepcion (Chile), the School of Visual Arts, and Hunter College High School. He has published numerous articles and contributed to several treatises on legal topics and is recognized in the International Who's Who-Lawyers . Mr. Pomerantz has participated in important and controversial matters affecting individual rights, including death penalty appeals, rights of public artistic expression, right of privacy for acts of consenting adults, and numerous free speech cases.       The Security Council and Peacekeeping Operations in the 21st Century (V28.0120; call # 72748) Instructor: Elisabeth Lindenmayer Friday, 11:00 a.m. - 1:30 p.m.    This course focuses on the role of the Security Council of the United Nations as a decision-making body in the maintenance of international peace and security. It examines the evolution of the Security Council since the end of the Cold War and reviews how its decisions have deeply affected international relations. It also reviews the evolution of peacekeeping operations through a selective examination of the literature and case studies, some of which will be based on the instructor's experience. The course explores some of the major successes and setbacks of the Security Council and the many lessons learned. It focuses on the varying responses of the international community to humanitarian crises. We will ask the question \"Whose responsibility is it to protect?\" Finally, the course seeks to demonstrate the need for reforms to address the unprecedented challenges of the 21st century, including the reform of the Security Council. Students who have taken V50.0363 may not register for this course.    Elisabeth Lindenmayer has had a long career with the United Nations, where she served as the Deputy Chef de Cabinet and as the Executive Assistant to the current Secretary General, Kofi Annan. In addition, she held substantive responsibilities relating to peacekeeping operations dealing with the crises in Iraq-Kuwait, Somalia, Rwanda, and the Great Lakes region. Born in West Africa, she has lived and worked in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, (then) French Indochina, Cote d'Ivoire, and Senegal. She has also taught at Columbia University, where she is currently Acting Director of the United Nations Studies Program. In 2006 she was awarded the Legion d'Honneur by the President of France.    Machiavelli's Wake (V28.0121; call # 72749) Instructor: William Klein Wednesday, 12:30 - 3:00 p.m.    Machiavelli's high literary talent, keen historical insight, and deep experience in politics congealed into a body of work \u2014 and one work in particular \u2014 that has become a difficult-to-dismiss touchstone of reflections on politics in the widest sense. His relentless study of the role of ruthlessness in public life has implications for fields as wide apart as Conflict Strategy and Ethics, while his hard-nosed study of republican institutions had great influence in the shaping of republican revolutions. After studying Machiavelli's main works, we will move on to an analysis of his first early modern disciples and detractors, and then on to modern works in, for example, ethics (Nagel), sociobiology (de Waal), and economic theory (Frank).    William Klein teaches social foundations in NYU's General Studies Program. In the College of Arts and Science he has also taught in both the Morse Academic Plan and the Freshman Honors Seminar Program. Before coming to NYU, he was at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he taught the history of Western social thought. He writes on a range of topics, from Renaissance political thought to constitutional history and (under a pen name) modern crime.    The Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan (V28.0124; call # 72750) Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller Tuesday, Thursday, 2:00 - 3:15 p.m.    The operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were composed during a period of intense change in the world of symphonic music and opera in the 19th century. This seminar examines nine of their major works and their historical, cultural, and musical contexts. It also examines the lives of the composer and the librettist and their respective milieux \u2014 Sullivan as one of the few English composers of the century to achieve international recognition, and Gilbert in terms of the various literary movements to which he belonged and which he parodied. In addition, it considers the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and its activities; the singers, scenic designers, choreographers, and costumers who functioned with the company; and the principal sources for the music, a majority of which are housed currently in New York City's J. Pierpont Morgan Library, along with numerous artifacts from the productions.    Rena Charnin Mueller , Clinical Associate Professor of Music, specializes in 19th-century music, in particular, the compositional aesthetic of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. Her most recent publications include an essay for the volume Liszt and His World , in conjunction with the 2006 Bard Festival, and an article on performances of Liszt and Wagner in New York between 1840 and 1890. Her work on the Liszt Lieder appears in the Cambridge Companion to the Lied (2004). She has published new editions of Les Preludes (1997), the Trois Etudes de Concert (1996), and the two Ballades (1996). With Maria Eckhardt, she is the author of the Franz Liszt \"List of Works\" for The New Grove 2000 , and they are also coauthoring the forthcoming Franz Liszt Thematic Catalogue . In 2003, she was a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.    Origins of World War I (V28.0128; call # 72753) Instructor: Stewart A. Stehlin Tuesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    The course explores the instability of the European state system in the pre-1914 era and the causes and responsibility for the war by examining the contributions of each of the major European states to the outbreak of war. It considers the Bismarckian system of European diplomacy and the balance of power as it existed before the war, the various diplomatic crises before 1914, the interrelation of internal events in the various countries to their foreign policy, and the various interpretations of the causes of the war. Topics include the Moroccan crises, the weaknesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Anglo-German naval and economic rivalries, the Balkan struggles for independence, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo, the personal responsibility of the individual statesmen, the ever-widening conflict, and the attempts to contain it.    Stewart A. Stehlin is Professor Emeritus of History. His areas of teaching have been the development of the modern European state system in the 19th and 20th centuries, the history of modern Germany, and European diplomatic history of the 19th and 20th centuries. His research has centered on European cultural history, diplomatic history, and German history, especially German-Vatican affairs. Among his publications are Bismarck and the Guelph Movement, 1866 - 1890 , a translation of Friedrich Ratzel's Sketches of Urban and Cultural Life in North America , and Weimar and the Vatican, German-Vatican Diplomatic Relations between the Wars, 1919 - 1933 . He is currently working on a book, Rome and the Reich: German-Vatican Relations during the Kaiserreich, 1870 - 1919 .    The Being of Character: Making Modern Subjects (V28.0141; call # 75327) Instructor: Elaine Freedgood Thursday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    This seminar examines how concepts of gender, sexuality, and race; mind and soul; true and false selves \u2014 all of these apparently \"natural\" categories and concepts \u2014 have been constructed, arranged, and rearranged in the past two hundred years. We will read, discuss, and write about film, cultural criticism, travel literature, fiction, psychoanalytic theory, and theories of gender performativity and racial passing in order to consider what it means to be, to seem to be, to try to be, to want to be, a given kind of self or character. The course will be based on rigorous analysis of textual material (including two films). Each student will prepare a formal oral presentation and lead 15 minutes of class discussion based on it. Final projects will emerge from early short papers that focus on research \u2014 in primary texts, in theoretical texts, in historical works, in unlikely locations and archives \u2014 and on how to use them effectively to write original, scholarly criticism.    Elaine Freedgood is an associate professor of English at NYU, where she teaches Victorian literature and critical theory. Before coming to NYU, she taught at the University of Pennsylvania. She is the author of two books: Victorian Writing about Risk: Imagining a Safe England in a Dangerous World (2000) and The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel (2006). She is interested in texts of all kinds: found, filmed, forgotten, forged, farfetched, and so on with other letters of the alphabet.    Abortion: Examining the Issues (V28.0142; call # 75332) Instructor: Evelyn Birge Vitz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00 - 3:15 p.m.    This multidisciplinary course takes as its purpose a careful and thought-provoking examination of many issues surrounding abortion today. In a seminar setting, we will read about and discuss legal, medical, historical, psychological, political, religious, ethical, and gender questions in a balanced manner, considering both \u2014 indeed, sometimes several \u2014 sides of the issues involved. We will also look at the representation of and attitudes toward abortion in contemporary literature and popular culture. This seminar will provide a forum for civil, informed, and open discussion of this difficult issue.    Evelyn (Timmie) Birge Vitz is Professor of French, and Affiliated Professor of Comparative Literature, Religious Studies, and Medieval and Renaissance Studies. She has published widely on both narrative and performance, as well as on many other aspects of medieval literature and culture. Recent books are Orality and Performance in Early French Romance (1999) and Performing Medieval Narrative , coedited with two NYU colleagues, Nancy Regalado and Marilyn Lawrence (2005). She has been researching and writing about abortion for several years, and has held workshops of a dramatic script about abortion, entitled \"Voices,\" in New York and Washington, D.C.    My Space: Writing Modern Selves, from the Diary to the Internet (V28.0143; call # 75326) Instructor: Thomas Augst Monday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    Why do people write diaries, and how should we read them? What kind of evidence do journals or blogs offer about the historical and social contexts from which they emerge? What can they tell us about the physical and virtual spaces in which people come to recognize themselves as individuals, and about cultural meanings and forms of individuality in general? This course explores the meaning and practice of diary-writing as it has evolved with technologies of manuscript, print, and digital computing. It has two major objectives. First, we will seek to situate contemporary internet sites of self-presentation such as Facebook, My Space, You Tube, and blogs in historical and literary perspective; we will consider how the diary has been shaped by religious traditions of self-examination, changing concepts of time, and the expansion of literacy, and define its relation to other literary genres such as the chronicle, autobiography, the novel, and the essay. Second, we will seek to develop a set of concepts to guide us in the interpretation and practice of self-representation across various media. Reading both celebrated and obscure examples of the diary, and conducting group research on contemporary digital culture, students will develop cross-cultural perspectives on literary practices of self-creation and the experiences of isolation, sincerity, narcissism, theatricality, privacy, and networking that inform them.    Thomas Augst is Associate Professor of English. He earned his Ph.D. from Harvard University and also taught there and at the University of Minnesota. He is the author of The Clerk's Tale: Young Men and Moral Life in 19th Century America , which explores how young businessmen used their diaries as tools for self-creation. He has also coedited two books on the history of libraries: Institutions of Reading: The Social Life of Librarians in the United States and Libraries as Agencies of Culture . He is currently writing a book about temperance, mass culture, and ethics in modern liberalism.    \"Varieties of Religious Experience\" Revisited (V28.0144; call # 75390) Instructor: James Gilligan Tuesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    This seminar will utilize but also update William James's pioneering approach to interpreting and understanding religion in psychological rather than theological terms. We will examine how the term \"religion\" is more confusing than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different stages of cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the phenomenon of \"political religions\" (nationalism, totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject modernity (the modern scientific mentality), in order to fill the vacuum that Sartre called \"the God-shaped hole in the soul of modern man\" that resulted when the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost their credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the political religions as resulting from psychological regression, and contrast them with the current moment in the evolution of religious consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of religious expression, understanding and experience that are consistent with the modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it. The seminar will conclude by examining whether this is the context in which the next major step in the evolution of both culture and personality will need to occur.    James Gilligan , Collegiate Professor, headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry. He has also served as Director of the Center for the Study of Violence and as a member of President Clinton's National Commission on Youth Violence. His books include Violence: Our Deadly Epidemic and Its Causes , Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic , and Preventing Violence: An Agenda for the Coming Century . He has been a consultant to the Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention at the World Health Organization, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and numerous other organizations.    Women's Writing in Renaissance Italy (V50.0145; call # 75330) Instructor: Virginia Cox Tuesday, 3:30 - 6:00 p.m.    The 15th, 16th, and early 17th centuries in Italy saw an extraordinary flowering of women's writing, whose extent has only very recently begun to be fully recognized by critics. Some 200 published women writers have been recorded for the 16th century alone, active in genres as diverse as pastoral drama, chivalric romance, and philosophical dialogue, as well as letters, love poetry, and religious verse. This seminar studies the tradition of women's writing in Italy in this period within its social and cultural context. It embraces both celebrated figures such as Vittoria Colonna, Gaspara Stampa, and Veronica Franco, and lesser known or more recently rediscovered writers, some not yet translated into English or available in modern editions. Besides the chance to study a series of compelling and challenging literary texts, the course offers the opportunity to engage with broader historical issues, notably the questions of what contextual factors enabled the emergence of this strong and precocious tradition of women's writing, and what factors led to its eclipse in the 17th century. Attention is also given to women's activity in other creative fields in this same period, notably the visual arts and music. The seminar is open to students without a reading knowledge of Italian, as translations will be supplied for all texts studied.    Virginia Cox, Professor of Italian, came to NYU in 2003 after teaching at the University of Edinburgh, University College London, and the University of Cambridge. Her chief research interests are early modern Italian literary and intellectual history, history of rhetoric, and early modern women's writing. She is the author of The Renaissance Dialogue: Literary Dialogue in Its Social and Political Contexts, Castiglione to Galileo (1993) and of Women's Writing in Italy, 1400 - 1650 (forthcoming 2008), as well as coeditor, with John Ward, of The Rhetoric of Cicero in Its Medieval and Early Modern Commentary Tradition (2006). She has also edited and translated two early modern texts by Italian women: Moderata Fonte's dialogue The Worth of Women (1997) and Maddalena Campiglia's drama Flori (2004, coedited with Lisa Sampson).       Before Democracy: The Politics of Plurality in Ancient Iraq (V28.0146; call # 75549) Instructor: Daniel Fleming Tuesday, 12:30 - 3:00 p.m.    This seminar will explore the alternative political tradition of group decision-making in ancient Iraq and its neighborhood. Democracy was born in Athens, and it came to the modern world through Europe and its American offspring. The Middle East is considered instead the home of empire and autocracy. Saddam Hussein cast himself as the heir of Babylon's rulers. This view has roots in ancient Greece itself, where Athenian democracy was set against Persian imperial power. In fact, the ancient Middle East was home to various forms of collective governance, from elders to assemblies, sometimes on a large scale. The ancestors of Greek democracy shared common ground with these practices from regions just to the east. Based on evidence ranging from 4,000-year-old letters to Homer's epic poetry, we will examine the early politics of plurality in both Mesopotamia and early Greece. By reconsidering the past, we can also rethink the prospects for democracy in modern Iraq and beyond, where traditional political life is often understood only as a barrier to changes encouraged by the United States.    Daniel Fleming is Professor of Assyriology and Hebrew Bible in the Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies. His latest book, Democracy's Ancient Ancestors: Mari and Early Collective Governance (2004), addresses the issues raised in this seminar, and he has also worked recently with Kurt Raaflaub to evaluate the relationship between Greek and Mesopotamian traditions before the democracy of Athens. In general, he specializes in the society and religion of ancient Syria and Israel, as these regions stood at the intersection of contacts across the Middle East, before Greece and Rome.    The 14th Century \u2014 When Europe Was Transformed (V28.0147; call # 75331) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Wednesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    The century covered in this course saw disasters of many kinds, some all too familiar to us in the 20th century. It was a time of the Black Death and the decimation of the population on an enormous scale; a time of recession that changed the pattern of prosperity that had existed in the preceding two centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman Church were faced with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious authority; a time of wars and of rebellions. Yet, in the same era, there was a march forward \u2014 toward new ideas, new political forms, vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense consequence for all of Europe . . . and for our own culture. Through the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian painters who transformed the nature and conception of literature and art and who informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century that many historians have understood as the most creative and the most terrible of all the centuries before the 20th.    Jill N. Claster is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages. She has served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU. She is currently working on a book about the Crusades.    The Making of Iconic Images (V28.0148; call # 75391) Instructor: Deborah Willis Wednesday, 6:20 - 8:50 p.m.    This interdisciplinary seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers, artists, historians, and critical thinkers in addressing the notion of iconic images. Iconic images are pictures that become rooted in our personal memory, pictures that are stored away for future reference through our experiences with them. How do icons emerge from the billions of images that surround us? What makes an image iconic? How are icons viewed cross-culturally and over time? Why do some help end wars, and why are other, very similar images ignored? To what extent can an image-maker aim at creating an icon, or is there no way of approaching the goal? How is it done in advertising, where a Nike swoosh can be made into an icon? Why do we have such extraordinarily powerful responses toward the images and pictures we see in everyday life? Why do we behave as if pictures were alive, possessing the power to influence us, to demand things from us, to persuade us, seduce us, or even lead us astray? In examining the salient features of the iconic image, the class will take comparative approaches to the diverse types of imagery.    Deborah Willis is University Professor and Professor of Photography and Imaging in the Tisch School of the Arts.

Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (V28.0149; call # 75550) Instructor: Jing Wang Thursday, 4:55 - 7:25 p.m.    The Dream of the Red Chamber is a classic work produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as \"the chaptered novel,\" it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. Originally titled The Story of the Stone , the novel tells the story of a sentient stone thrown into the everyday world in its human reincarnation. With reference to the Goddess Nuwa repairing the sky, the novel raises a series of questions concerning the relationship between heaven, earth, human beings, and things; the origin of what it is to be human; its spiritual nature; the relationship between emotion and talent; and the development, suppression, and waste of talent. At the center of all this is the true meaning of human emotion and affection ( qing ) , and their relationship to the moral order and social-cultural convention ( li ). What constitutes the \"story\" is thus a narrative account of the stone's worldly experiences, tragic fate, and reflections on a heartless world. Its intricate structure, coupled with its dazzling array of characters, makes this one of the most complex and colorful novels of all time. All readings in the seminar are in English.    Jing Wang is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990's (2002). In 2000, she was the featured columnist/translator on foreign literature for the literary magazine Shanghai Literature . Her teaching and research interests include women writers in China and the West, literary translation, modern Chinese social thought, and comparative studies of cities and urban culture. In addition to literary translations, she also publishes personal essays.    Soundscapes of Contemporary War (V28.0150; call # 75392) Instructor: Suzanne G. Cusick Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m. - 12:15 p.m.      What are the sounds of contemporary war? How have military planners, strategists, and commanders used sound (including music) to expedite battle? How have ordinary soldiers used sound (including music)? How have both kinds of military use interacted with civilian aural culture? This seminar will explore these questions with reference to major wars of the \"American century\" \u2014 World Wars I and II, the \"Cold War,\" the Vietnam conflict \u2014 so as to understand better the acoustical practices of U.S. forces in the current \"global war on terror\" (especially the widespread use of \"loud music\" in detention camps). The course work will include readings, films, listening, discussion, individual research projects, and contribution toward a class website.    Suzanne G. Cusick, Associate Professorof Music , joined the NYU faculty in 2003 after ten years at the University of Virginia, where she was awarded the Alumni Board of Trustees Teaching Prize (for junior faculty) in 1995. She has published widely on music in relation to gender, sexuality, and embodiment; on the musical culture of early 17th-century Italy; and, most recently, on the use of music as a medium of torture in the \"global war on terror.\" Her monograph on the work of the singer, teacher, and composer Francesca Caccini (1587 - c1646) at the Medici court will be published by the University of Chicago Press in 2008. In 2006 - 07, she was a Fellow at the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History at Harvard University, participating in the yearlong workshop \"Cultural Reverberations of Modern War\"; her research during that workshop forms the basis for this seminar.    Hispanic Cities: New York (V28.0151; call # 75471) Instructor: Lourdes Davila Monday, 11:00 a.m. - 1:30 p.m.    What exactly is a city? What makes a city \"Hispanic\"? How does it become visible? What frontiers exist within the city's borders? How does a cosmopolitan city integrate the \"Hispanic Other\" into its fabric? On what terms? How does the presence of the Hispanic population permanently change the face of the city? This course traces the Hispanic cultural presence in New York from the end of the 19th century to the present, including responses by artists and writers to the terrorist attack of 9/11. Divided into modules, the course explores representation of and exchanges with the city in authors from Jose Marti to Pedro Pietri to Ernesto Quinonez, dancers like Jose Limon, Lourdes Lopez or Paloma Herrera, music from Bomba to Hip-Hop, visual art from Diego Rivera to James de la Vega, and film, from West Side Story to Raising Victor Vargas . Students will participate in cultural activities around NYC, and will be able to talk to several artists currently working here. Criticism will include authors like Gaston Bachelard, de Certeau, and Walter Benjamin.    Lourdes Davila , a member of the faculty of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, has been actively involved in arts as a professional dancer in NYC since 1989. Her first book, The Image Arrives on a Verbal Shore , considers the use of visual language in the Argentinean author Julio Cortazar. She is currently working on a book on photography and literature in Latin America. Lourdes has worked as a translator for the Guggenheim Foundation and now has two book translation projects: Corner of the Dead (English to Spanish), a short novel by the award winner Lynn Lurie about the Shining Path in Peru, and Julio Cortazar's Silvalandia (Spanish to English). She has been a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.    Muhammad and the Quran (V28.0152; call # 75836) Instructor: Francis E. Peters Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The Quran is one of the primary texts of world history: the faith of millions of believers is rooted in it and in the conviction that the man who pronounced it in Arabia in the seventh century A.D. spoke with the voice of God. But the Quran-the Quran in the hands of Muslims and non-Muslims alike-is also a document, and its original recitation came forth from a mortal man. Both, then, are the subject of historical inquiry. Muslims made those inquiries from the beginning, but in the West it was not until the 19th century that Muhammad and the Quran became the object of serious historiographical investigation. The objective of this course is to introduce undergraduate students into both \"the Quest for the Historical Muhammad\" and the current state of research on the making of our Quran by inviting them to address the very same questions the current researchers are. The manner will be that of a seminar, in which every student, every week, will be asked to make an active (and generally written) contribution on one of the research issues.    Francis E. Peters is Professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies as well as History and Religious Studies. During his career at NYU he has taught courses ranging from Homer, Aristotle, and Plotinus through the Gospels, Muhammad, and Near Eastern urbanism to Islamic philosophy and theology. He taught a previous Advanced Honors Seminar titled \"Jesus and Muhammad.\" His numerous books include Muhammad and the Origins of Islam and The Voice, the Word, the Books: The Sacred Scriptures of the Jews, Christians, and Muslims , commissioned by the British Library. He is currently finishing a book on the Quran.    Collegiate Honors Seminar Abroad    NYU in London    European Integration and the European Union as a Political System (V28.9502) Instructor: Eiko R. Thielemann Tuesday, 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 noon    The European Union constitutes a uniquely ambitious project of international cooperation and governance beyond the state. This course explores the origins, development, institutions, major policies, policy-making, current problems, and matters of controversy of the European Community/Union. Students are also introduced to the major approaches applied to explain the complex system of EU policy-making. Among other things, we address questions such as why the Commission, Court, and Parliament have gained new powers, why market deregulation has proceeded faster than social and environmental protection, and why European elections do not work. Knowledge about the institutions and policy processes of the EU will help students to critically assess various questions that are facing Europe's citizens and leaders today: How should the single currency work? How can the EU's institutions be made more democratic? How far and how fast should the EU be enlarged? Should Europe develop into a federal (super) state?    Eiko R. Thielemann holds a Senior Lectureship in European Politics and Policy at the London School of Economics. He completed his Ph.D. at Cambridge University. His research interests are in the areas of multilevel policy-making in the European Union; comparative analysis of public policy and institutions; new institutional theories; migration; and state aid.    Departmental Honors Seminar    Open to Qualified Non-Majors    Unearthing the Lost History of Greek Priestesses: Curating an Exhibition (V43.0150, sec 002; call # 75475; V27.0150, sec 002; call # 75557) Instructor: Joan Breton Connelly Tuesday, 9:45 a.m. - 12:15 p.m. Prerequisite: V43.0001 or V43.0100 and instructor's permission    In March 2007, Joan Breton Connelly published the first comprehensive cultural history of Greek priestesses, brought to life through a pioneering examination of literary sources, inscriptions, sculpture, and vase painting. The book will soon be brought to life in a traveling exhibition of objects and images brought together from some of the world's greatest museums. This seminar gives undergraduate students the unique opportunity to participate in the early planning stages of a major art exhibition. Following weeks of lectures on a broad range of topics to be explored in the Greek Priestess Show, students will develop and present their own plans for displays within the exhibition: object lists, installation designs, didactic information, and creative educational materials that include interactive technologies, film and print media, and relevant scientific content. This course will expose students to new subject matter, challenge their creativity, and develop their practical skills in managing a project.    Joan Breton Connelly is Professor of Art History and Classics and Director of the NYU Yeronisos Island Excavations and Field School in Cyprus. Her scholarship focuses on Greek art and archaeology, mythology, and religion. She is the author of Portrait of a Priestess: Women and Ritual in Ancient Greece and Votive Sculpture of Hellenistic Cyprus . A MacArthur Fellow, she has pushed the boundaries of our understanding of the Parthenon with the publication of \"Parthenon and Parthenoi: A Mythological Interpretation of the Parthenon Frieze\" in the American Journal of Archaeology . From 2002 to 2004 she held the Lillian Vernon Chair for Teaching Excellence at NYU, having earlier won the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.

These small classes are taught by faculty from across the University and from the wider New York community. In some instances students may count the classes toward their major or minor, if the departments consider this appropriate; other classes will count simply as electives.    Collegiate Honors Seminars have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. In sum, these courses are meant to foster an environment in which learning is an exciting experience for students and faculty alike.    Sophomores and juniors have priority in registering for most of the Collegiate Honors Seminars. If seats remain after the end of early registration, seniors may also enroll.    Course Descriptions    Home of the Brave: Legal Aspects of American Use of Force since World War II (V28.0103; call # 75346) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Wednesday, 8:00-10:30 a.m.    The creation of the United Nations ushered in a new era in the international legal regulation of the use of force by states. Under the UN regime, states may use force in well-circumscribed circumstances, notably in self-defense against an armed attack or pursuant to a decision of the UN Security Council, to bring about a termination of a breach of the peace or a threat to the peace of the international community. The United States, both during and after the Cold War, has not shied away from the use of its considerable force, often provoking national and international controversy. Some instances, such as the Cuban missile crisis or the Vietnam War, have had profound effects on the self-understanding of the polity. The \"War on Terrorism\" has ushered in yet a new challenge in this area. This seminar first examines the international legal framework and then surveys the principal instances of American use of force, from Korea to Iraq. At issue are both the legality of past and present American practices and the adequacy of controlling international law and institutions. Junior and senior prelaw students will have priority in registering for this seminar.       J. H. H. Weiler is University Professor and European Union Jean Monnet Chair at NYU Law School. He serves as Chairman of the NYU Global Law School Program and is also Director of the Jean Monnet Center for International and Regional Economic Law and Justice. He was previously Professor of Law at the Michigan Law School and then the Manley Hudson Professor of Law and Jean Monnet Chair at the Harvard Law School. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as a World Trade Organization Panel Member. He is a founding editor of the European Journal of International Law , of the European Law Journal , and of the World Trade Review . His recent publications include The European Court of Justice (with G. de Burca), The EU, the WTO and the NAFTA , The Constitution of Europe , and a novella, Der Fall Steinmann .    Collective Urban Violence in America (V28.0105; call # 72296) Instructor: Daniel J. Walkowitz Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar examines the urban origins, character, and changing patterns of violence in American cities. It focuses on collective violence rather than on individual acts of violence, regardless of how many victims an individual may have claimed. One part of the course considers the extent to which American culture and political institutions encourage, sanctify, or militate against aggressive behavior and create a climate for or against violence. In that context, some of our concerns must be comparative, cross-cultural, and transnational. In addition, we address broad interdisciplinary conceptual questions that anthropologists, psychologists, and sociologists, in particular, ask about human nature, gender conditioning in Western cultures, and \"deviant\" subcultures. In creating a typology for the analysis of violence in American cities over time, we distinguish between forms of violence, the direction of changes sought, and the social and material characteristics of the antagonists -- is the conflict generated, for example, by a privileged elite seeking to protect authority it feels jeopardized by aspiring newcomers, or is it rooted in efforts by the dispossessed struggling to gain some notion of a fair share?    Daniel J. Walkowitz is Professor of History and Director of College Honors. A specialist in labor and working-class history, he has written numerous articles and co-edited or authored five books, including Working with Class: Social Workers and the Politics of Middle-Class Identity and Memory and the Impact of Political Transformation in Public Space . In addition, as co-founder and co-director of NYU's Graduate Program in Public History, he has pioneered efforts to bring America's past to broad general audiences through film and video. The subjects of his documentary projects have ranged from iron and cotton worker protests in Troy, New York, to a miners' strike in Donetsk, Ukraine.    20th-Century Europe in Literature and Memory (V28.0109; call # 75345) Instructor: Tony Judt Monday, 3:30-6:15 p.m.    This seminar addresses aspects of the history of Europe in the years 1914-1989 through the medium of literature: novels, essays, memoirs. The seminar will pay close attention to the books themselves. But we shall also be concerned with the world of their authors, with their subject matter, with their contemporary setting, and with their cultural impact (then and since). Among the themes to be addressed -- in the readings, the class discussion, and, eventually, the final papers -- are the following: the impact of the First World War, at the front and at home; the consequences of post-World War I imperial collapse and the lost culture of Central Europe; Italian society under Fascism; the Spanish Civil War; the show trials and the Stalinist terror; the Holocaust in literature and memory; life in post-Stalinist Eastern Europe; the origins of the Yugoslav catastrophe; literature, memory, and memoirs as historical sources for extreme experience. For their final paper, students will select a theme or topic from the period covered by this course and then, with the instructor's assistance, identify additional works of European fiction or memoir literature for discussion and analysis.    Tony Judt is Erich Maria Remarque Professor of European Studies and Director of the Remarque Institute at NYU. A Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he has written widely on modern French and Central European history, as well as on contemporary affairs in Europe and the United States. He is a regular contributor to the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, the Times Literary Supplement, and the New Republic . He directed a long-term international collaborative research project called \"Rethinking World War II and Its Aftermath in Europe.\" His book Postwar: A History of Europe since 1945 was published in 2005.    Geology and Antiquity in the Mediterranean (V28.0114; call # 75524) Instructor: Steven Soter Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Over timescales of centuries and millennia, geological forces have worked profound changes on the landscape of the Mediterranean. Gradual processes of silting, erosion, and local sea level change, as well as infrequent but catastrophic natural disasters -- earthquakes and tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and major floods -- have all left their marks. Many ancient sites are now deeply buried, while others lie exposed to the elements. Great ancient seaports now lie stranded miles inland from the nearest shore, while thepalace of Cleopatra is submerged. The oracle of Delphi, the legendary Atlantis, and the one-eyed giants of the Odyssey have origins in geological phenomena. This course explores the impact of geological forces on the natural and human environments of the ancient Mediterranean world. Special attention is given to the site of Helike -- a Greek city destroyed and submerged in the Early Bronze Age and again in Classical times -- which the instructor has been exploring.    Steven Soter is a Scientist-in-Residence at NYU's Center for Ancient Studies and a Research Associate in the Department of Astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History. He co-directs an interdisciplinary scientific team excavating the Early Bronze Age, Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman settlements at Helike, a coastal site on the Gulf of Corinth in Greece. He was co-author with Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan of the Cosmos television series and co-author of the two Hayden Planetarium space shows.    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V28.0116; call # 75332) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court's interpretation and application of the Constitution, and the Court's new, self-defined role, have adversely affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \"Imperial Judiciary.\" Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them, and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis, the Court's participation in the debate, and the effect that nine people appointed for life (the justices) have on how we live. Topics include abortion, euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights, gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; affirmative action; college speech codes, including \"hate\" speech, verbal sexual harassment, group liable and symbolic speech; prayer in school and students' right of privacy; and racial and ethnic profiling, government's right to detain accused terrorists, and the USA PATRIOT Act. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the political spectrum.    Alan J. Pomerantz, Esq. , is a practicing lawyer and partner of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, LLP, a major international law firm. A graduate of the NYU School of Law, he also studied in Chile and received an advanced legal degree from the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands). He has lectured and taught widely, including at the NYU School of Law, the University of Amsterdam, Columbia Graduate School, the University of Concepcion (Chile), the School of Visual Arts, and Hunter College High School. He has published numerous articles and contributed to several treatises on legal topics and is recognized in the International Who's Who -- Lawyers . Mr. Pomerantz and Weil, Gotshal have participated in important and controversial matters affecting individual rights, including death penalty appeals, rights of public artistic expression, political asylum applications, voting rights, right of privacy for acts of consenting adults, equal access laws for disabled persons, and numerous free speech cases.    The Port of New York (V28.0117; call # 72304) Instructor: Bryan Waterman Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This course offers an interdisciplinary approach to the study of New York City cultures through the prism of its waterfront and harbor, a source not only of the city's economic development but also of its multicultural and polyglot character. From a \"home base\" meeting location at NYU's Broome Street residence hall, the seminar seeks to make the city itself the classroom: at least half of the seminar is conducted out of doors or in cultural institutions downtown and elsewhere, including the South Street Seaport Museum, the Museum of Chinese in the Americas, Ellis Island Immigration Museum, the New-York Historical Society, and others. Incorporating discussions from the disciplines of architectural history, archaeology, literary studies, and history, the seminar foregrounds problems of discipline and method in the study of the city's cultures and therefore seeks participation from the range of disciplines and departments that make up CAS. Topics include the founding of New Amsterdam, slavery in British Manhattan and the early American Republic, immigration's perpetual reshaping of city cultures, the emergence of popular forms such as blackface minstrelsy, the \"destruction\" of lower Manhattan in the 20th century, the decline of the port and its marketplaces, the development of the World Trade Center, and the ongoing effects of the 9/11 attacks.    Bryan Waterman , Assistant Professor of English, received his Ph.D. from Boston University in American Studies; since 2001 he has been a member of NYU's English department, where he teaches courses in early American literature and \"Writing New York\" (with Professor Cyrus Patell). He is the author of articles on late 18th-century New York City's literary and intellectual cultures, as well as Republic of Intellect: The Friendly Club of New York City and the Enlightenment Origins of American Literature (forthcoming). He is a Faculty Fellow in Residence at Broome Street and is currently at work on a book about seduction narratives in the era of the American and French Revolutions.    The Security Council and Peacekeeping Operations in the 21st Century (V28.0120; call # 72308) Instructor: Elisabeth Lindenmayer Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    This course focuses on the role of the Security Council of the United Nations as a decision-making body in the maintenance of international peace and security. It examines the evolution of the Security Council since the end of the Cold War and reviews how its decisions have deeply affected international relations. It also reviews the evolution of peacekeeping operations through a selective examination of the literature and case studies, some of which will be based on the instructor's experience. The course explores some of the major successes and setbacks of the Security Council and the many lessons learned. It focuses on the varying responses of the international community to humanitarian crises. We will ask the question \"Whose responsibility is it to protect?\" Finally, the course seeks to demonstrate the need for reforms to address the unprecedented challenges of the 21st century, including the reform of the Security Council. Students who have taken V50.0363 may not register for this course.    Elisabeth Lindenmayer has had a long career with the United Nations, where she served as the Deputy Chef de Cabinet and as the Executive Assistant to the current Secretary General, Kofi Annan. In addition, she carried substantive responsibilities relating to peacekeeping operations dealing with the crises in Iraq-Kuwait,Somalia,Rwanda, and the Great Lakes region. She has also taught at Columbia University.    Machiavelli's Wake (V28.0121; call # 72309) Instructor: William Klein Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    How influential can a writer be? Do people hear what they aren't prepared by history to hear? Can readers in one set of circumstances do anything but distort or misunderstand or ironically overturn what was written in another set of circumstances? It is one thing to ask these sorts of questions about the influence of an original literary mind on others, but perhaps another when the writer experiments not only with literary forms but with social, moral, religious, political, or military ones as well. Machiavelli was a writer whose wake caused disturbances in all of these areas -- so much so that to study it, in all of its complexity and ambiguity, is to study the emergence of modernity itself. In our readings, we will look for areas in which the early modern world seemed to be ready for Machiavelli's recovery of the ancient Greek awareness of the agony of political life. We will also look for those areas in which the readiness may not have been anticipated by Machiavelli himself (such as in moral attitudes toward the growth of capitalism). We will look for areas where people professed not to be ready, and at those where apparent readiness competed with deep unease (as may have been the case with Shakespeare). These historical explorations would be of limited interest if they did not push us to ask what our own era (of multinational corporations and unmanned war machines and feminism and pornography...) can make of Machiavelli. Have we outgrown him, or are we still engaged? If the latter, would that be a good thing?    William Klein teaches the history of political discourse in NYU's General Studies Program. In the College of Arts and Science he has also taught in both the Morse Academic Plan and the Freshman Honors Seminar Program. He writes on a range of topics, from Renaissance political thought to constitutional history and to modern crime.    The Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan (V28.0124; call # 75344) Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller Tuesday, Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    The operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were composed during a period of intense change in the world of symphonic music and opera in the 19th century. This seminar examines nine of the major works and their historical, cultural, and musical contexts. It also examines the lives of the composer and the librettist and their respective milieux -- Sullivan as one of the few English composers of the century to achieve international recognition, and Gilbert in terms of the various literary movements to which he belonged and which he parodied. In addition, it considers the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and its activities; the singers, scenic designers, choreographers, and costumers who functioned with the company; and the principal sources for the music, a majority of which are housed currently in New York City's J. Pierpont Morgan Library, along with numerous artifacts from the productions.    Rena Charnin Mueller, Clinical Associate Professor of Music, specializes in 19th-century music, in particular, the compositional aesthetic of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. Her most recent publications include an essay for the volume Liszt and His World , in conjunction with the 2006 Bard Festival, and an article on performances of Liszt and Wagner in New York between 1840 and 1890. Her work on the Liszt Lieder appears in the Cambridge Companion to the Lied (2004). She has published new editions of Les Preludes (1997), the Trois Etudes de Concert (1996), and the two Ballades (1996). With Maria Eckhardt, she is the author of the Franz Liszt \"List of Works\" for The New Grove 2000 , and they are also co-authoring the forthcoming Franz Liszt Thematic Catalogue . In 2003, she was a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.    Introduction to Cognitive Science (V28.0125; call # 75343) Instructor: Bob Rehder Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Cognitive science is the study of cognition or intelligent behavior -- of its nature, characteristics, and processes. It is a multidisciplinary approach to the study of cognition and intelligent systems that incorporates elements of psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, and computer science. It claims to provide answers to controversies such as the nature of mind, the role of the brain in cognitive processes, the possibility of artificial intelligence, and the relation of the mind/brain to culture and the outside world. Because cognitive science is intimately tied to issues in philosophy of mind and science, the course also discusses cognitive science's philosophical aspects and its historical development. The class addresses some of the traditional challenges to cognitive science (e.g., the problems of intentionality and consciousness), as well as a number of more recent challenges (e.g., connectionism, neuroscience, and situated action and culture). No prior knowledge of cognitive science is required.    Bob Rehder received a B.S. in computer science and B.A. in physics from Washington University at St. Louis, an M.S. in artificial intelligence from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He has been a member of NYU's Psychology Department since 2001. His work has been published in a number of scholarly journals, including the Journal of Experimental Psychology and the Journal of Educational Psychology.    Beauty Matters (V28.0127; call # 75342) Instructor: Deborah Willis Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    This seminar explores the problematics of beauty -- a subject that is contested in art, in the media, and in everyday culture. It looks at the ways in which our contemporary understanding of aesthetic pleasure is informed by and constructed from visual culture in museums, photography, advertising, film, and music. From the moment that photography was invented in 1839, people began to have their portraits made. These images offered a framework in which to imagine the history behind the photographic surface and to explore the notion of transformation. Class discussions will focus on how beauty has been imagined and realized. Using a series of case studies, we will consider the political image, race, class, and gender. The aim is to enable students to think critically about the notion of aesthetic pleasure and to consider the consequences of their views. The emphasis will be on reading, interpreting, and evaluating racialized, sexualized, and objectified images of men and women. We will look at the works of a broad range of photographic artists -- in fashion, narrative films, exhibitions, family images, and zine culture -- to examine viewers' responses.

Origins of World War I (V28.0128; call # 75341) Instructor: Stewart A. Stehlin Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The course explores the instability of the European state system in the pre-1914 era and the causes and responsibility for the war by examining the contributions of each of the major European states to the outbreak of war. It considers the Bismarckian system of European diplomacy and the balance of power as it existed before the war, the various diplomatic crises before 1914, the interrelation of internal events in the various countries to their foreign policy, and the various interpretations of the causes of the war. Topics include the Moroccan crises, the weaknesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Anglo-German naval and economic rivalries, the Balkan struggles for independence, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo, the personal responsibility of the individual statesmen, the ever-widening conflict, and the attempts to contain it.    Stewart A. Stehlin is Professor Emeritus of History. His areas of teaching have been the development of the modern European state system in the 19th and 20th centuries, the history of modern Germany, and European diplomatic history of the 19th and 20th centuries. His research has centered on European cultural history, diplomatic history, and German history, especially German-Vatican affairs. Among his publications are Bismarck and the Guelph Movement, 1866-1890 , a translation of Friedrich Ratzel's Sketches of Urban and Cultural Life in North America , and Weimar and the Vatican , German-Vatican Diplomatic Relations between the Wars, 1919-1933 . He is currently working on a book, Rome and the Reich: German-Vatican Relations during the Kaiserreich, 1870-1919 .    Rethinking Who We Are: Interpersonal Approaches to the Person (V28.0129; call # 75340) Instructor: Michael Westerman Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    There are unresolved tensions in the field of psychology between individual-centered models of the person and interpersonal ones. The seminar is based on the belief that in order to make progress on these unresolved issues we need to recognize that they refer to a long-standing fundamental question philosophers began wondering about centuries before the discipline of psychology came into existence -- What place do our relationships with other people have in our lives? Moreover, we need to engage in an inquiry that involves a dynamic interplay between psychological considerations and philosophical ones. Participants in the seminar learn about work in several specific areas where these tensions appear, including models of child development, approaches to psychopathology, and basic questions about psychotherapy. We also consider more \"interpersonal\" versus more individual-centered ways in which psychologists think about interpersonal interaction itself. The final topic concerns the philosophy of the social sciences. We look at recent contributions by psychologists and philosophers suggesting that we replace traditional concepts of the process of psychological research with a social view of that process. Throughout the seminar, we refer to classic philosophical texts and contributions by historians of ideas to explore critically the ways in which contemporary efforts by psychologists reflect concepts of the person from our philosophical tradition. Students who have taken V50.0247 may not register for this seminar.    Michael A. Westerman is Associate Professor of Psychology. His area is clinical psychology. He has conducted research on several topics concerning interpersonal relationships, including studies of mother-child interaction, family systems, and the patient-therapist relationship in psychotherapy. His publications also include articles on issues in philosophical psychology. He is currently involved in a program of research based on an interpersonal reconceptualization of psychological defenses he has developed that is called the theory of interpersonal defense.    Representing Animals: The Discourse of Species in Contemporary Art and Media (V28.0130; call # 75339) Instructor: Una Chaudhuri Friday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 noon    Claude Levi-Strauss said that animals feature so prominently in myth and ritual \"not because they are 'good to eat' but because they are ' good to think .'\" The history of art and literature suggests that they are also good to paint, sculpt, photograph, film, and write about. A new interdisciplinary field of study has begun to move the animal out of its niche in science and insert it into fields that have, perhaps, constituted themselves in (unconscious) opposition to it: the \"humanities.\" Animal studies explores the meaning of cultural animal practices, ranging from literary genres like fables and fairy-tales to animal acts in circuses and fairs, to social practices like pet-keeping, cock-fighting, dog shows, equestrian displays, rodeos, bullfighting, hunting, fur-wearing, and meat-eating. These and other animal practices constitute an ever-changing and vastly complicated \"discourse of species,\" which in turn informs our accounts of the human, the \"Other\" (including the racial and ethnic Other), and the world. We will study a range of contemporary representations of animals -- in fiction, poetry, film, television, fashion, and popular culture -- with a view to understanding the current state of the discourse of species. How does the imagery of mass culture shape our attitudes to animals? How do artists, activists, and ordinary people disrupt those attitudes? How are we feeling about, imagining, living with, and \"thinking\" animals today?Readings will also include works of philosophy (Nietzsche, Derrida, Deleuze and Guattari, Singer) and recent animal studies books such as Steven Baker's The Postmodern Animal , Akira Lippit's The Electric Animal , Donna Haraway's A Companion Species Manifesto , and the Animal Studies Group's Killing Animals.    Una Chaudhuri is Professor of English and Drama. She is the author of No Man's Stage: A Semiotic Study of Jean Genet's Plays and Staging Place: The Geography of Modern Drama , editor of Rachel's Brain and Other Storms: The Performance Scripts of Rachel Rosenthal , and co-editor, with Elinor Fuchs, of the recently published critical anthology Land/Scape/Theater . She is currently working on a project that explores the intersections of theater and performance with the emerging field of animal studies.    Jews and Germans: Old Memories and New Beginnings in Postwar Germany (V28.0131; call # 75337) Instructor: Marion Kaplan Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    This course explores the interactions of Jews and Germans after World War II, noting their interlocking histories and memories even after the Holocaust. Students learn about the immediate postwar turmoil, the displaced persons, Allied occupation, and \"denazification.\" They analyze how Germans -- East and West -- did or did not come to terms with the Nazi past. They read Jewish perspectives on their lives in West and East Germany, why they remained, how they experienced their citizenship, how they interacted with Germans, and how re-unification (in 1990) affected them.Readings analyze conflicting German and Jewish historical memories, including the silence about the Holocaust of the early postwar years, the student rebellion of 1968, the viewing of the American TV series Holocaust , the Historians' Debate of the 1980s and 1990s, and the building of museums and monuments about Jewish history and the Holocaust. The seminar entails advanced work in research and conceptual skills. Thus, students not only learn about the history of postwar Germany but also discuss debates surrounding this history.    Marion Kaplan is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History. She is the author of The Jewish Feminist Movement in Germany : The Campaigns of the Judischer Frauenbund, l904-l938 (1979), The Making of the Jewish Middle Class: Women, Family, and Identity in Imperial Germany (1991), and Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany (1998). The last two won the National Jewish Book Award in their respective years. She has edited books on European women's history: When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany and The Marriage Bargain: Dowries in European History . Her most recent books are Jewish Daily Life in Germany , 1618-1945 and Judische Welten: Juden in Deutschland vom 18. Jahrhundert bis in die Gegenwart (a co-edited volume).    Readings in Modern Chinese Social Thought (V28.0132; call # 75335) Prerequisite: Completion of intermediate Chinese or equivalent Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, Wednesday 4:55-6:10 p.m.    This seminar introduces students with post-intermediate knowledge of Chinese to the major texts by leading writers and intellectuals of modern China. The goal is threefold: (1) to help students interested in modern China develop linguistic competence through intensive readings in cultural and intellectual discourses; (2) to prepare those who already have advanced language skills for a more in-depth encounter with the canon in modern Chinese culture; and (3) to familiarize students with the central arguments and stylistic mannerisms of the leading figures in modern Chinese culture and society through systematic interpretative-translational practice.Readings consist of foundational texts by canonic authors over the country's tumultuous modern period. Texts are selected either in full or in abridged form, with grammatical points and content-based annotations arranged in a way that allows close reading and interpretation. Under the broad rubric of social change and its intellectual reflections, specific topics include the Chinese Enlightenment, vernacular cultural revolution, women's rights and women's liberation, socialism and mass democracy, the attraction and problems of Westernization, the economic reform and new social liberty, the autonomy or \"subjectivity\" of Chinese culture, and the national debate on university reform. Authors include such modern classical writers as Liang Qichao, Hu Shi, Lu Xun, and Mao Zedong, as well as influential contemporary writers and intellectuals like Li Zehou, Gan Yang, Liu Xiaofeng, and Wang Anyi.    Jing Wang is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990's (2002). In 2000, she was the featured columnist/translator on foreign literature for the literary magazine Shanghai Literature . Her teaching and research interests include women writers in China and the West, literary translation, modern Chinese social thought, and comparative studies of cities and urban culture. In addition to literary translations, she also publishes personal essays.    Literature and Science: Pathways and Intersections (V28.0133; call # 75738) Instructors: Daniel Malamud and Martha Rust Tuesday, 5:00-7:30 p.m.    In 1959 C. P. Snow lectured on \"the two cultures,\" arguing that the life of the mind in Western culture was suffering from an increasing rift between two opposing factions: \"literary intellectuals at one pole -- at the other scientists . . . between the two a gulf of mutual incomprehension.\" This seminar analyzes the relationship between literature and science, asking if these are indeed two cultures or if, instead, they are two distinct yet related disciplines that interact synergistically -- as if they were on opposite sides of a semi-permeable membrane. The beauty of a semi-permeable membrane resides in the sheer elegance of a design that assures a regulated, bidirectional transfer of materials, which, in turn, supports the metabolism of living things. Something similar could be said of a metaphor, which transfers the meaning of a word from one conceptual realm to another, enabling \"fluid\" reasoning and bold \"leaps\" of imagination. This course explores another vital interface: the mutually informative matrix of connections between literature and science. It focuses on a series of topics that highlight the polarity between scientists and \"literary intellectuals\" : aesthetics, sex and gender, nature and nurture, life and death, health and disease, to name a few. In examining the diverse approaches that literature and science adopt in studying these topics and in disseminating their findings, we also seek to bring into view the productive interface the two disciplines share. In turn, we will discover some of the ways that Snow's \"two cultures\" might be influenced by and learn from the other.Readings are wide ranging: from Camus' The Plague to poetry by William Carlos Williams and Sharon Olds, to works by Sigmund Freud and Susan Sontag, to articles in scientific journals such as Nature and Science .    Daniel Malamud , Professor of Basic Sciences at the NYU College of Dentistry, is a biochemist working on pathogenesis and novel diagnostics for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. Prior to joining the NYU faculty in 2005, he taught courses in Literature and Science and the Literature of AIDS at the University of Pennsylvania.    Martha Rust , Assistant Professor of English, brings a background in health sciences to her career as a medievalist and teaches courses on both medieval English literature and medicine in literature in NYU's English department. Her first book, Imaginary Worlds in Medieval Books: Exploring the Manuscript Matrix , is forthcoming spring 2007, and she is at work on a second, entitled Item: Lists and the Poetics of Reckoning in Late-Medieval England .    Past and Present in Irish Archaeology (V28.0134; call # 75523) Instructor: Pam Crabtree Tuesday, Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.    Ireland has a rich archaeological heritage that includes hunter-gatherers of the Mesolithic Period, Megalithic tombs at Knowth and Newgrange, the Hill of Tara, early Christian monasteries such as Clonmacnoise, and the Viking settlements in Dublin itself. This course will consider how the Irish past has been constructed and what role that this construction of the Irish past has played in the modern world. We will review the archaeology of Ireland from its initial settlement in the Mesolithic through the British colonization of Northern Ireland in the early Modern Era. The course will also examine the impact of rapid economic development on Ireland's archaeological resources, including the current debate surrounding the site of Tara.    Pam Crabtree , Associate Professor of Anthropology, is a zooarchaeologist whose research interests center broadly on the uses of faunal remains to study past animal husbandry patterns, hunting practices, and diet. She is also interested in the use of archaeologically recovered animal remains to study trade, social status, ethnicity, and prehistoric ritual. Her primary area of interest is later prehistoric and early medieval Europe, but she has also worked on Natufian settlement and subsistence in the Southern Levant and 18th- and 19th-century sites in eastern North America. Crabtree is currently a member of an archaeological team that is surveying the Irish royal site of Dun Ailinne in Ireland. Her work has been published in a number of edited volumes and journals, including the Journal of Field Archaeology and World Archaeology . She and her co-author Bradley Adams recently completed a forthcoming book entitled Comparative Skeletal Morphology .    The Birth of the Mind: Genes, Evolution, and Human Nature (V28.0135; call # 75522) Instructor: Gary Marcus Tuesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.    This course explores the origins of the human mind from two perspectives: the origins of our species (a question about evolution) and the development of individuals, from conception to birth to educated adult. Questions that we will address include: What is the relation between nature and nurture? Has evolution played an important role in shaping the mind? Are we merely \"drifts in the currents\" of our genes? Are human beings optimal thinkers \"noble in reason,\" or is the mind better thought of as a jury-rigged Swiss-army knife of haphazard cognitive tools? Our approach will be interdisciplinary, drawing on fields ranging from genetics and developmental biology to psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience.Readings will include articles from the primary literature and four books written for the educated lay reader -- Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct (1994) and How the Mind Works (1997), and the instructor's own The Birth of the Mind (2004) and Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind (forthcoming).    Gary Marcus is Professor of Psychology and Director of the NYU Infant Language Learning Center. He is the author of two books about the origins and nature of the mind and editor of a third. His research on developmental cognitive neuroscience has been published in over 40 articles in leading journals such as Science , Nature , Cognition , Cognitive Psychology , and the Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development. In 1996 he won the Robert L. Fantz award for new investigators in cognitive development, and in 2002-03 he was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in Social and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford.    Pharmaceutical Drugs, Ethics, and Culture (V28.0136; call # 75521) Instructors: David A. Scicchitano and Andrea McKenzie Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar is designed to introduce students to contemporary issues in the realm of pharmaceuticals, focusing on drug design, safety, and distribution. Early in the seminar, students are introduced to the basic concepts of drug research and testing, with an emphasis on the Food and Drug Administration rules for bringing a drug to the clinic and eventually to the marketplace. This leads to the complex issues related to drug distribution inside and outside the United States, the societal implications associated with new therapeutic regimens, and the economic factors and laws that come into play. The seminar also develops students' writing, critical thinking, and presentation skills, with emphasis placed on researching, evaluating, and presenting evidence. Students who have taken V23.0005 may not register for this seminar.    David A. Scicchitano is Professor of Biology and also the CAS Director of Undergraduate Science Initiatives. His research interests include the way environmental agents, particularly chemicals, interact with and damage DNA, interfering with fundamental cellular process, and triggering pathology. His work is funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health.    Andrea McKenzie is the Director of Writing in the Disciplines with the Expository Writing Program. She collaborates with professors from a wide range of disciplines to incorporate writing and public speaking as active learning strategies in subject-specific courses. She has performed curriculum design work and taught graduate and undergraduate courses in writing and public speaking at NYU, MIT, and the University of Waterloo (Canada).    American Mythology and Its Biblical Sources (V28.0137; call # 75520) Instructor: Christopher Collins Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Especially in times of crisis, Americans tend to rally around leaders who reassure them that God has blessed theirs above all other nations -- given her a mission to feed, clothe, and enlighten the less fortunate, to liberate the world from tyranny and crime, and eventually to inaugurate an era of universal peace. This seminar will examine the biblical sources of this political mythology and the historical instances of its cynical use, for example, in representing North America as a Promised Land reserved for a new Chosen People, in identifying Indians and Africans as cursed races, and in regarding American foreign policy as divinely ordained and therefore exempt from international law. The Machiavellian exploitation of American religion is important to expose, but it is, of course, an old story. While this course will tell that story, in doing so it will keep as its major focus the credulity of the many, rather than the mendacity of the few. Unlike other contemporary critiques, this text-centered historical survey of American \"truthiness\" will raise that one, crucial, but seldom asked question: why is it that so many of us believe the lies we are told?    Christopher Collins is Professor of English and author of a number of books on the psychology and rhetoric of literature, including Reading the Written Image: Verbal Play, Interpretation, and the Roots of Iconophobia ; The Poetics of the Mind's Eye: Literature and the Psychology of Imagination ; and Authority Figures: Metaphors of Mastery from the Iliad to the Apocalypse . His latest book, Homeland Mythology: Biblical Narratives in American Culture, will be published in 2007.    Socrates and His Critics (V28.0138; call # 75739) Instructor: Vincent Renzi Tuesday, Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    Despite writing nothing himself, Socrates is, perhaps, the most influential philosopher in the Western tradition. With him, philosophy first moves from natural history to an explicit concern for human affairs. So great is this change that we continue to term those earlier thinkers \"pre-Socratic philosophers.\" So too, his name is given to a distinctive form of philosophical literature, the Socratic dialogue, and to an approach to philosophical inquiry and instruction, the Socratic method. In antiquity, his thought inspired Plato, Xenophon, the Stoics, the Skeptics, and the Cynics, beyond them to influence in Rome and Judea . . . and four centuries before Jesus, he already suffered martyrdom for his idiosyncratic political, philosophical, and religious views. In modernity, he both fascinates and repels Kierkegaard and Nietzsche; already in his own time, he endured criticisms of his way of life, notably from the comedian Aristophanes. Given the evidence, we can look only to the history of the reception of his thought to recover any sense of the \"historical Socrates.\" We must likewise ask whether he does not exert a greater influence as a result of his reputation than for his actual intellectual contributions. In short, had Socrates not existed, wouldn't the tradition essentially have had to create him, in its move from its origins to ethics and political philosophy? Even given that he did actually live, is what we have of him really just such a necessary fiction?    Vincent Renzi is Associate Director of the Morse Academic Plan for the Foundations of Contemporary Culture, where he regularly offers Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the 19th Century, in both regular and writing-intensive versions. He taught previously at Columbia University. In addition to his specialization in ancient Greek philosophy, he maintains interests in 19th- and 20th-century Continental philosophy, ancient studies, history of philosophy, and aesthetics.    Theater of War: Ancient Warfare in Ancient Drama (V28.0139; call # 75758) Instructor: Peter Meineck Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This seminar will examine ancient attitudes to war and its effects on society in ancient Greece as conveyed primarily in drama but also in art and literature. Why do we fight? Why is war still the most pervasive political force on the planet? What are the origins of attitudes to warfare in Western culture? The class will study ancient texts in translation and discuss vase painting, architecture, and sculpture to understand the cultural forces that created the Greek way of war and how military innovations and organization had a profound influence on the development of political and social institutions. We will read selections from Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Aris\u00adtophanes, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Plato, and Demosthenes. We will also examine pre-classical military structures, such as those in the ancient Near East, and look at the impact of Greek warfare on the Hellenistic period, on Rome, and on some of the military philosophies that prevail today.    Peter Meineck is Artistic Director of the Aquila Theatre Company, which has performed the Iliad at Lincoln Center and regularly produces classical plays in New York and on national tours. He is also Clinical Assistant Professor both in Classics and in Drama at NYU and Artist in Residence at NYU's Center for Ancient Studies. He has published several translations of Greek plays.    Writing in the Information Age (V28.0140; call # 75861) Instructor: Natalie Jeremijenko Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. ; lab, Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    Take a moment to ask yourself if there is any product you use, live with, or can see about which you could say how, by whom, or where it was made. Given that the manufacturing sector is the most poisonous of all sectors of all global human activities, is our collective ignorance defensible in an information society? The opportunity for change that new information technologies present could conceivably be an opportunity to promote innovation, sustainable manufacturing, transparent labor conditions, and environmental accountability. Likewise, it could promote a closed information context of trade secrets, nondisclosures, IP portfolios, labeling strategies, and closed doors. In this course we will lift the veil between production and consumption, each student taking on a case study to ask how and if open information context can promote innovation, and what structure of accountability will best facilitate this. Writing a visual essay for a wiki-based visual encyclopedia [howstuffismade.org], students will themselves learn standards of evidence and accountability involved in the production of information for the information commons, exploring their own responsibility and capacity for developing and proposing some of these changes.    Natalie Jeremijenko is a Global Distinguished Professor at NYU. An artist/experimenter and information engineer, she is one of the founders of the field of tangible media (also known as physical computing). Her work centers on structures of participation in the information age and the political and social possibilities (and limitations) of information technologies -- mostly through large-scale public experiments. In this vein, her work spans a range of media from statistical indices (such as the Despondency Index, which linked the Dow Jones to the suicide rate at San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge) to biological substrates (such as the installations of cloned trees in pairs in various urban micro-climates) to robotics (such as the development of feral robotic dog packs to investigate environmental hazards). Her graduate work at Stanford and the University of Queensland was in the fields of design engineering and information science. Previous faculty positions have included appointments in Yale University's Department of Mechanical Engineering, in the Department of Visual Art at the University of California at San Diego, and as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at Michigan State University.    Collegiate Honors Seminars Abroad    NYU in London    Builders of Britain (V28.9501; call # 75529) Instructor: Timothy Brittain-Catlin Monday,2:00-5:00 p.m.    This seminar presents the physical landscape of modern Britain, and particularly of London, through its buildings and through the working lives of the people who influenced it: the engineers, the builders, the visionaries. Students learn the basic tools of architectural and urban criticism by studying key structures, events, and personalities, and have the opportunity to demonstrate those tools through a series of different types of written and research assignments. By taking a number of central figures and presenting them and their biographies, students can not only build up historical knowledge of the major monuments of the city but also develop a useful contextual knowledge of the personalities and the period concerned. The course thus uses the architectural, urban, and engineering history of the capital as a way of introducing students to the cultural landscape of the country. Some of the characters featured in the course are architects; others are engineers, planners, or politicians. By presenting their life's work not only in the form of the built evidence but also in a biographical way, the course seeks to create a link between the many different sources of information and history, including literature and other artistic processes.    Timothy Brittain-Catlin is Intermediate General Studies Tutor at the Architectural Association in London, an architect, and a regular contributor to the Architectural Review. After working for ten years in urban design, he completed his doctorate at Cambridge University on AWN Pugin's houses. He is writing a book about English parsonages.    European Integration and the European Union as a Political System (V28.9502; call # 75709) Instructor: Eiko R. Thielemann Tuesday,9:00 a.m.-12:00noon    The European Union constitutes a uniquely ambitious project of international cooperation and governance beyond the state. This course explores the origins, development, institutions, major policies, policy-making, current problems, and matters of controversy of the European Community/Union. Students are also introduced to the major approaches applied to explain the complex system of EU policy-making. Among other things, we address questions such as why the Commission, Court, and Parliament have gained new powers, why market deregulation has proceeded faster than social and environmental protection, and why European elections do not work. Knowledge about the institutions and policy processes of the EU will help students to critically assess various questions that are facing Europe's citizens and leaders today: How should the single currency work? How can the EU's institutions be made more democratic? How far and how fast should the EU be enlarged? Should Europe develop into a federal (super) state?    Eiko R. Thielemann holds a Lectureship in European Politics and Policy at the London School of Economics. He completed the Ph.D. at Cambridge University. His research interests are in the areas of multilevel policy-making in the European Union; comparative analysis of public policy and institutions; new institutional theories; migrations; and state aid.

One way the College has done so is through its Seminar program, which gives students the opportunity to participate in small, intellectually stimulating classes on important topics taught by distinguished professors drawn not only from the College's faculty but also from NYU's professional schools and from among New York's professional, cultural, and governmental leaders.    In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic principles behind the very successful Freshman Honors Seminars, offered since 1992, to upper-level courses. These small classes are taught by faculty from across the University and from the wider New York community. In some instances students may count the classes toward their major or minor, if the departments consider this appropriate; other classes will count simply as electives.    Advanced Honors Seminars have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. In sum, these courses are meant to foster an environment in which learning is an exciting experience for students and faculty alike.    Sophomores and juniors have priority in registering for most of the Advanced Honors Seminars. If seats remain after the end of early registration, seniors may also enroll.    Course Descriptions    Home of the Brave: Legal Aspects of American Use of Force since World War II (V28.0103; call # 72742) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Friday, 8:00 - 10:30 a.m.    The creation of the United Nations ushered in a new era in the international legal regulation of the use of force by states. Under the UN regime, states may use force in well-circumscribed circumstances, notably in self-defense against an armed attack or pursuant to a decision of the UN Security Council, to bring about a termination of a breach of the peace or a threat to the peace of the international community. The United States, both during and after the Cold War, has not shied away from the use of its considerable force, often provoking national and international controversy. Some instances, such as the Cuban missile crisis or the Vietnam War, have had profound effects on the self-understanding of the polity. The \"War on Terrorism\" has ushered in yet a new challenge in this area. This seminar first examines the international legal framework and then surveys the principal instances of American use of force, from Korea to Iraq. At issue are both the legality of past and present American practices and the adequacy of controlling international law and institutions. The seminar is taught at the Law School to law school standards \u2014 rigorous but academically and intellectually rewarding. Junior and senior prelaw students will have priority in registering for this seminar.       J. H. H. Weiler is University Professor and European Union Jean Monnet Chair at NYU Law School. He serves as Director of the Jean Monnet Center for International and Regional Economic Law and Justice. He was previously Professor of Law at the Michigan Law School and then the Manley Hudson Professor of Law and Jean Monnet Chair at the Harvard Law School. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as a World Trade Organization Panel Member. He is a founding editor of the European Journal of International Law , of the European Law Journal , and of the World Trade Review .

Political Cinema and Representation of the Other (V28.0107; call # 75393) Instructor: Shimon Dotan Friday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00noon    Representation of the Other is a variation of the search for self-identity. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its political cinema exhibit a clear pattern in which the parties attribute to the Other qualities and traits that reflect their own distress and aspirations. But how does the concept of representation connect meaning to a sequence of successive images? Which of the following accounts (in a variation on Stuart Hall) will apply to a cinematic work? The reflective \u2014 does film reflect a meaning, which already exists in the real world? The intentional \u2014 does film express only what the filmmaker intends to express? The constructionist \u2014 is meaning constructed in and through the process of filmmaking? Each class consists of a screening followed by a discussion concentrating on representation in the context of the political conflict, variations in use of film language to achieve a subjective portrayal and modalities of representation and self-critique. Screenings include films such as The Battle of Algiers , by Bruno Pontecorvo; Divine Intervention , by Elia Suleiman; Fog of War , by Earl Morris; Final Cup , by Eran Riklis; and The Smile of the Lamb , by Shimon Dotan.    Shimon Dotan , a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with ten feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive ; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. Dotan has taught filmmaking at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal.    Cinema and Society in Europe since 1945 (V28.0112; call # 75329) Instructor: Tony Judt Tuesday, 3:30 - 6:00 p.m., and Thursday, 3:30 - 4:45 p.m.    This seminar addresses aspects of the history of European history since World War II through postwar European cinema. The seminar will pay attention to the films themselves, as art and as entertainment; but we shall also and above all be concerned with their subject matter, their contemporary setting, and their impact (at the time and since). Participants will meet twice weekly: once to see that week's film, once for discussion. In addition to watching the films, students will be required to read assigned works of history dealing with the period. Among the themes to be addressed \u2014 in the films, the readings, the class discussion, and, eventually, the final papers \u2014 are the following: war and civil war as represented and remembered in the postwar decades; the Cold War; decolonization; the European \"economic miracle\" and its attendant social impact; the \"sixties\"; different generations of migration, both into Europe and within and between countries; national identities and the attached stereotypes; the Yugoslav Wars; remembering (and forgetting) Communism; and the Holocaust in postwar European consciousness. A final paper will require students to choose one theme and then, with instructor's assistance, identify a body of related films to see and discuss.    Tony Judt is Erich Maria Remarque Professor of European Studies and Director of the Remarque Institute at NYU. A Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he has written widely on modern French and Central European history, as well as on contemporary affairs in Europe and the United States.

The History of Disbelief (V28.0113; call # 75328) Instructor: Mitchell Stephens Wednesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    This seminar will take up an extended history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of religion). It will begin in Greece and then move on to a brief discussion of anthropological perspectives on belief, before returning to Greece, the Hebrews and Rome, to India and Baghdad, and then back to Europe during the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the Romantic period. Time will be spent in England and America in the 19th century, when disbelief was being tied to radical politics, before moving on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence of God will be considered. However, the main purpose of this course will be to force students to confront and grapple with some of the most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief. Authors whose works will be read may include Cicero, Hume, Holbach, Paine, Shelley, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Woolf, and Freud, among others.    Mitchell Stephens is Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication. He is the author of, among other books, the rise of the image the fall of the word and A History of News .

Pomerantz Wednesday, 4:55 - 7:25 p.m.    The U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court's interpretation and application of the Constitution have adversely affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \"Imperial Judiciary.\" Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them, and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis, the Court's participation in the debate, and the effect that nine people appointed for life (the justices) have on how we live. Topics include abortion, euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights, gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; affirmative action; college speech codes, including \"hate\" speech and symbolic speech; and racial and ethnic profiling. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the political spectrum, and are expected to apply critical thinking to the topics.    Alan J. Pomerantz , Esq., is a practicing lawyer and partner of Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe, a major international law firm. A graduate of the NYU School of Law, he also studied in Chile and received an advanced legal degree from the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands).

The Security Council and Peacekeeping Operations in the 21st Century (V28.0120; call # 72748) Instructor: Elisabeth Lindenmayer Friday, 11:00 a.m. - 1:30 p.m.    This course focuses on the role of the Security Council of the United Nations as a decision-making body in the maintenance of international peace and security. It examines the evolution of the Security Council since the end of the Cold War and reviews how its decisions have deeply affected international relations. It also reviews the evolution of peacekeeping operations through a selective examination of the literature and case studies, some of which will be based on the instructor's experience. The course explores some of the major successes and setbacks of the Security Council and the many lessons learned. It focuses on the varying responses of the international community to humanitarian crises. We will ask the question \"Whose responsibility is it to protect?\" Finally, the course seeks to demonstrate the need for reforms to address the unprecedented challenges of the 21st century, including the reform of the Security Council. Students who have taken V50.0363 may not register for this course.    Elisabeth Lindenmayer has had a long career with the United Nations, where she served as the Deputy Chef de Cabinet and as the Executive Assistant to the current Secretary General, Kofi Annan. In addition, she held substantive responsibilities relating to peacekeeping operations dealing with the crises in Iraq-Kuwait, Somalia, Rwanda, and the Great Lakes region.

Machiavelli's Wake (V28.0121; call # 72749) Instructor: William Klein Wednesday, 12:30 - 3:00 p.m.    Machiavelli's high literary talent, keen historical insight, and deep experience in politics congealed into a body of work \u2014 and one work in particular \u2014 that has become a difficult-to-dismiss touchstone of reflections on politics in the widest sense. His relentless study of the role of ruthlessness in public life has implications for fields as wide apart as Conflict Strategy and Ethics, while his hard-nosed study of republican institutions had great influence in the shaping of republican revolutions. After studying Machiavelli's main works, we will move on to an analysis of his first early modern disciples and detractors, and then on to modern works in, for example, ethics (Nagel), sociobiology (de Waal), and economic theory (Frank).    William Klein teaches social foundations in NYU's General Studies Program. In the College of Arts and Science he has also taught in both the Morse Academic Plan and the Freshman Honors Seminar Program. Before coming to NYU, he was at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he taught the history of Western social thought. He writes on a range of topics, from Renaissance political thought to constitutional history and (under a pen name) modern crime.    The Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan (V28.0124; call # 72750) Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller Tuesday, Thursday, 2:00 - 3:15 p.m.    The operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were composed during a period of intense change in the world of symphonic music and opera in the 19th century. This seminar examines nine of their major works and their historical, cultural, and musical contexts. It also examines the lives of the composer and the librettist and their respective milieux \u2014 Sullivan as one of the few English composers of the century to achieve international recognition, and Gilbert in terms of the various literary movements to which he belonged and which he parodied. In addition, it considers the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and its activities; the singers, scenic designers, choreographers, and costumers who functioned with the company; and the principal sources for the music, a majority of which are housed currently in New York City's J. Pierpont Morgan Library, along with numerous artifacts from the productions.    Rena Charnin Mueller , Clinical Associate Professor of Music, specializes in 19th-century music, in particular, the compositional aesthetic of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner.

Stehlin Tuesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    The course explores the instability of the European state system in the pre-1914 era and the causes and responsibility for the war by examining the contributions of each of the major European states to the outbreak of war. It considers the Bismarckian system of European diplomacy and the balance of power as it existed before the war, the various diplomatic crises before 1914, the interrelation of internal events in the various countries to their foreign policy, and the various interpretations of the causes of the war. Topics include the Moroccan crises, the weaknesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Anglo-German naval and economic rivalries, the Balkan struggles for independence, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo, the personal responsibility of the individual statesmen, the ever-widening conflict, and the attempts to contain it.    Stewart A. Stehlin is Professor Emeritus of History. His areas of teaching have been the development of the modern European state system in the 19th and 20th centuries, the history of modern Germany, and European diplomatic history of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Among his publications are Bismarck and the Guelph Movement, 1866 - 1890 , a translation of Friedrich Ratzel's Sketches of Urban and Cultural Life in North America , and Weimar and the Vatican, German-Vatican Diplomatic Relations between the Wars, 1919 - 1933 . He is currently working on a book, Rome and the Reich: German-Vatican Relations during the Kaiserreich, 1870 - 1919 .    The Being of Character: Making Modern Subjects (V28.0141; call # 75327) Instructor: Elaine Freedgood Thursday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    This seminar examines how concepts of gender, sexuality, and race; mind and soul; true and false selves \u2014 all of these apparently \"natural\" categories and concepts \u2014 have been constructed, arranged, and rearranged in the past two hundred years. We will read, discuss, and write about film, cultural criticism, travel literature, fiction, psychoanalytic theory, and theories of gender performativity and racial passing in order to consider what it means to be, to seem to be, to try to be, to want to be, a given kind of self or character. The course will be based on rigorous analysis of textual material (including two films). Each student will prepare a formal oral presentation and lead 15 minutes of class discussion based on it. Final projects will emerge from early short papers that focus on research \u2014 in primary texts, in theoretical texts, in historical works, in unlikely locations and archives \u2014 and on how to use them effectively to write original, scholarly criticism.    Elaine Freedgood is an associate professor of English at NYU, where she teaches Victorian literature and critical theory. Before coming to NYU, she taught at the University of Pennsylvania. She is the author of two books: Victorian Writing about Risk: Imagining a Safe England in a Dangerous World (2000) and The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel (2006).

Abortion: Examining the Issues (V28.0142; call # 75332) Instructor: Evelyn Birge Vitz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00 - 3:15 p.m.    This multidisciplinary course takes as its purpose a careful and thought-provoking examination of many issues surrounding abortion today. In a seminar setting, we will read about and discuss legal, medical, historical, psychological, political, religious, ethical, and gender questions in a balanced manner, considering both \u2014 indeed, sometimes several \u2014 sides of the issues involved. We will also look at the representation of and attitudes toward abortion in contemporary literature and popular culture. This seminar will provide a forum for civil, informed, and open discussion of this difficult issue.    Evelyn (Timmie) Birge Vitz is Professor of French, and Affiliated Professor of Comparative Literature, Religious Studies, and Medieval and Renaissance Studies. She has published widely on both narrative and performance, as well as on many other aspects of medieval literature and culture.

She has been researching and writing about abortion for several years, and has held workshops of a dramatic script about abortion, entitled \"Voices,\" in New York and Washington, D.C.    My Space: Writing Modern Selves, from the Diary to the Internet (V28.0143; call # 75326) Instructor: Thomas Augst Monday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    Why do people write diaries, and how should we read them? What kind of evidence do journals or blogs offer about the historical and social contexts from which they emerge? What can they tell us about the physical and virtual spaces in which people come to recognize themselves as individuals, and about cultural meanings and forms of individuality in general? This course explores the meaning and practice of diary-writing as it has evolved with technologies of manuscript, print, and digital computing. It has two major objectives. First, we will seek to situate contemporary internet sites of self-presentation such as Facebook, My Space, You Tube, and blogs in historical and literary perspective; we will consider how the diary has been shaped by religious traditions of self-examination, changing concepts of time, and the expansion of literacy, and define its relation to other literary genres such as the chronicle, autobiography, the novel, and the essay. Second, we will seek to develop a set of concepts to guide us in the interpretation and practice of self-representation across various media. Reading both celebrated and obscure examples of the diary, and conducting group research on contemporary digital culture, students will develop cross-cultural perspectives on literary practices of self-creation and the experiences of isolation, sincerity, narcissism, theatricality, privacy, and networking that inform them.    Thomas Augst is Associate Professor of English. He earned his Ph.D. from Harvard University and also taught there and at the University of Minnesota. He is the author of The Clerk's Tale: Young Men and Moral Life in 19th Century America , which explores how young businessmen used their diaries as tools for self-creation. He has also coedited two books on the history of libraries: Institutions of Reading: The Social Life of Librarians in the United States and Libraries as Agencies of Culture . He is currently writing a book about temperance, mass culture, and ethics in modern liberalism.    \"Varieties of Religious Experience\" Revisited (V28.0144; call # 75390) Instructor: James Gilligan Tuesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    This seminar will utilize but also update William James's pioneering approach to interpreting and understanding religion in psychological rather than theological terms. We will examine how the term \"religion\" is more confusing than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different stages of cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the phenomenon of \"political religions\" (nationalism, totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject modernity (the modern scientific mentality), in order to fill the vacuum that Sartre called \"the God-shaped hole in the soul of modern man\" that resulted when the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost their credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the political religions as resulting from psychological regression, and contrast them with the current moment in the evolution of religious consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of religious expression, understanding and experience that are consistent with the modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it. The seminar will conclude by examining whether this is the context in which the next major step in the evolution of both culture and personality will need to occur.    James Gilligan , Collegiate Professor, headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry. He has also served as Director of the Center for the Study of Violence and as a member of President Clinton's National Commission on Youth Violence.

He has been a consultant to the Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention at the World Health Organization, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and numerous other organizations.    Women's Writing in Renaissance Italy (V50.0145; call # 75330) Instructor: Virginia Cox Tuesday, 3:30 - 6:00 p.m.    The 15th, 16th, and early 17th centuries in Italy saw an extraordinary flowering of women's writing, whose extent has only very recently begun to be fully recognized by critics. Some 200 published women writers have been recorded for the 16th century alone, active in genres as diverse as pastoral drama, chivalric romance, and philosophical dialogue, as well as letters, love poetry, and religious verse. This seminar studies the tradition of women's writing in Italy in this period within its social and cultural context. It embraces both celebrated figures such as Vittoria Colonna, Gaspara Stampa, and Veronica Franco, and lesser known or more recently rediscovered writers, some not yet translated into English or available in modern editions. Besides the chance to study a series of compelling and challenging literary texts, the course offers the opportunity to engage with broader historical issues, notably the questions of what contextual factors enabled the emergence of this strong and precocious tradition of women's writing, and what factors led to its eclipse in the 17th century. Attention is also given to women's activity in other creative fields in this same period, notably the visual arts and music. The seminar is open to students without a reading knowledge of Italian, as translations will be supplied for all texts studied.    Virginia Cox, Professor of Italian, came to NYU in 2003 after teaching at the University of Edinburgh, University College London, and the University of Cambridge. Her chief research interests are early modern Italian literary and intellectual history, history of rhetoric, and early modern women's writing. She is the author of The Renaissance Dialogue: Literary Dialogue in Its Social and Political Contexts, Castiglione to Galileo (1993) and of Women's Writing in Italy, 1400 - 1650 (forthcoming 2008), as well as coeditor, with John Ward, of The Rhetoric of Cicero in Its Medieval and Early Modern Commentary Tradition (2006). She has also edited and translated two early modern texts by Italian women: Moderata Fonte's dialogue The Worth of Women (1997) and Maddalena Campiglia's drama Flori (2004, coedited with Lisa Sampson).       Before Democracy: The Politics of Plurality in Ancient Iraq (V28.0146; call # 75549) Instructor: Daniel Fleming Tuesday, 12:30 - 3:00 p.m.    This seminar will explore the alternative political tradition of group decision-making in ancient Iraq and its neighborhood. Democracy was born in Athens, and it came to the modern world through Europe and its American offspring. The Middle East is considered instead the home of empire and autocracy. Saddam Hussein cast himself as the heir of Babylon's rulers. This view has roots in ancient Greece itself, where Athenian democracy was set against Persian imperial power. In fact, the ancient Middle East was home to various forms of collective governance, from elders to assemblies, sometimes on a large scale. The ancestors of Greek democracy shared common ground with these practices from regions just to the east. Based on evidence ranging from 4,000-year-old letters to Homer's epic poetry, we will examine the early politics of plurality in both Mesopotamia and early Greece. By reconsidering the past, we can also rethink the prospects for democracy in modern Iraq and beyond, where traditional political life is often understood only as a barrier to changes encouraged by the United States.    Daniel Fleming is Professor of Assyriology and Hebrew Bible in the Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies. His latest book, Democracy's Ancient Ancestors: Mari and Early Collective Governance (2004), addresses the issues raised in this seminar, and he has also worked recently with Kurt Raaflaub to evaluate the relationship between Greek and Mesopotamian traditions before the democracy of Athens. In general, he specializes in the society and religion of ancient Syria and Israel, as these regions stood at the intersection of contacts across the Middle East, before Greece and Rome.    The 14th Century \u2014 When Europe Was Transformed (V28.0147; call # 75331) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Wednesday, 2:00 - 4:30 p.m.    The century covered in this course saw disasters of many kinds, some all too familiar to us in the 20th century. It was a time of the Black Death and the decimation of the population on an enormous scale; a time of recession that changed the pattern of prosperity that had existed in the preceding two centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman Church were faced with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious authority; a time of wars and of rebellions. Yet, in the same era, there was a march forward \u2014 toward new ideas, new political forms, vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense consequence for all of Europe . . . and for our own culture. Through the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian painters who transformed the nature and conception of literature and art and who informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century that many historians have understood as the most creative and the most terrible of all the centuries before the 20th.    Jill N. Claster is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages. She has served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU. She is currently working on a book about the Crusades.    The Making of Iconic Images (V28.0148; call # 75391) Instructor: Deborah Willis Wednesday, 6:20 - 8:50 p.m.    This interdisciplinary seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers, artists, historians, and critical thinkers in addressing the notion of iconic images. Iconic images are pictures that become rooted in our personal memory, pictures that are stored away for future reference through our experiences with them. How do icons emerge from the billions of images that surround us? What makes an image iconic? How are icons viewed cross-culturally and over time? Why do some help end wars, and why are other, very similar images ignored? To what extent can an image-maker aim at creating an icon, or is there no way of approaching the goal? How is it done in advertising, where a Nike swoosh can be made into an icon? Why do we have such extraordinarily powerful responses toward the images and pictures we see in everyday life? Why do we behave as if pictures were alive, possessing the power to influence us, to demand things from us, to persuade us, seduce us, or even lead us astray? In examining the salient features of the iconic image, the class will take comparative approaches to the diverse types of imagery.    Deborah Willis is University Professor and Professor of Photography and Imaging in the Tisch School of the Arts. Her many awards include a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, an Alfonse Fletcher Jr. Fellowship, a MacArthur Fellowship, an Anonymous Was a Woman Foundation Award, and an International Center of Photography Infinity Award for Writing on Photography.

Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (V28.0149; call # 75550) Instructor: Jing Wang Thursday, 4:55 - 7:25 p.m.    The Dream of the Red Chamber is a classic work produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as \"the chaptered novel,\" it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. Originally titled The Story of the Stone , the novel tells the story of a sentient stone thrown into the everyday world in its human reincarnation. With reference to the Goddess Nuwa repairing the sky, the novel raises a series of questions concerning the relationship between heaven, earth, human beings, and things; the origin of what it is to be human; its spiritual nature; the relationship between emotion and talent; and the development, suppression, and waste of talent. At the center of all this is the true meaning of human emotion and affection ( qing ) , and their relationship to the moral order and social-cultural convention ( li ). What constitutes the \"story\" is thus a narrative account of the stone's worldly experiences, tragic fate, and reflections on a heartless world. Its intricate structure, coupled with its dazzling array of characters, makes this one of the most complex and colorful novels of all time. All readings in the seminar are in English.    Jing Wang is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990's (2002).

In addition to literary translations, she also publishes personal essays.    Soundscapes of Contemporary War (V28.0150; call # 75392) Instructor: Suzanne G. Cusick Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m. - 12:15 p.m.      What are the sounds of contemporary war? How have military planners, strategists, and commanders used sound (including music) to expedite battle? How have ordinary soldiers used sound (including music)? How have both kinds of military use interacted with civilian aural culture? This seminar will explore these questions with reference to major wars of the \"American century\" \u2014 World Wars I and II, the \"Cold War,\" the Vietnam conflict \u2014 so as to understand better the acoustical practices of U.S. forces in the current \"global war on terror\" (especially the widespread use of \"loud music\" in detention camps). The course work will include readings, films, listening, discussion, individual research projects, and contribution toward a class website.    Suzanne G. Cusick, Associate Professorof Music , joined the NYU faculty in 2003 after ten years at the University of Virginia, where she was awarded the Alumni Board of Trustees Teaching Prize (for junior faculty) in 1995. She has published widely on music in relation to gender, sexuality, and embodiment; on the musical culture of early 17th-century Italy; and, most recently, on the use of music as a medium of torture in the \"global war on terror.\" Her monograph on the work of the singer, teacher, and composer Francesca Caccini (1587 - c1646) at the Medici court will be published by the University of Chicago Press in 2008. In 2006 - 07, she was a Fellow at the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History at Harvard University, participating in the yearlong workshop \"Cultural Reverberations of Modern War\"; her research during that workshop forms the basis for this seminar.    Hispanic Cities: New York (V28.0151; call # 75471) Instructor: Lourdes Davila Monday, 11:00 a.m. - 1:30 p.m.    What exactly is a city? What makes a city \"Hispanic\"? How does it become visible? What frontiers exist within the city's borders? How does a cosmopolitan city integrate the \"Hispanic Other\" into its fabric? On what terms? How does the presence of the Hispanic population permanently change the face of the city? This course traces the Hispanic cultural presence in New York from the end of the 19th century to the present, including responses by artists and writers to the terrorist attack of 9/11. Divided into modules, the course explores representation of and exchanges with the city in authors from Jose Marti to Pedro Pietri to Ernesto Quinonez, dancers like Jose Limon, Lourdes Lopez or Paloma Herrera, music from Bomba to Hip-Hop, visual art from Diego Rivera to James de la Vega, and film, from West Side Story to Raising Victor Vargas . Students will participate in cultural activities around NYC, and will be able to talk to several artists currently working here. Criticism will include authors like Gaston Bachelard, de Certeau, and Walter Benjamin.    Lourdes Davila , a member of the faculty of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, has been actively involved in arts as a professional dancer in NYC since 1989. Her first book, The Image Arrives on a Verbal Shore , considers the use of visual language in the Argentinean author Julio Cortazar. She is currently working on a book on photography and literature in Latin America. Lourdes has worked as a translator for the Guggenheim Foundation and now has two book translation projects: Corner of the Dead (English to Spanish), a short novel by the award winner Lynn Lurie about the Shining Path in Peru, and Julio Cortazar's Silvalandia (Spanish to English). She has been a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.    Muhammad and the Quran (V28.0152; call # 75836) Instructor: Francis E. Peters Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The Quran is one of the primary texts of world history: the faith of millions of believers is rooted in it and in the conviction that the man who pronounced it in Arabia in the seventh century A.D. spoke with the voice of God. But the Quran-the Quran in the hands of Muslims and non-Muslims alike-is also a document, and its original recitation came forth from a mortal man. Both, then, are the subject of historical inquiry. Muslims made those inquiries from the beginning, but in the West it was not until the 19th century that Muhammad and the Quran became the object of serious historiographical investigation. The objective of this course is to introduce undergraduate students into both \"the Quest for the Historical Muhammad\" and the current state of research on the making of our Quran by inviting them to address the very same questions the current researchers are. The manner will be that of a seminar, in which every student, every week, will be asked to make an active (and generally written) contribution on one of the research issues.    Francis E. Peters is Professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies as well as History and Religious Studies. During his career at NYU he has taught courses ranging from Homer, Aristotle, and Plotinus through the Gospels, Muhammad, and Near Eastern urbanism to Islamic philosophy and theology. He taught a previous Advanced Honors Seminar titled \"Jesus and Muhammad.\" His numerous books include Muhammad and the Origins of Islam and The Voice, the Word, the Books: The Sacred Scriptures of the Jews, Christians, and Muslims , commissioned by the British Library. He is currently finishing a book on the Quran.    Collegiate Honors Seminar Abroad    NYU in London    European Integration and the European Union as a Political System (V28.9502) Instructor: Eiko R. Thielemann Tuesday, 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 noon    The European Union constitutes a uniquely ambitious project of international cooperation and governance beyond the state. This course explores the origins, development, institutions, major policies, policy-making, current problems, and matters of controversy of the European Community/Union. Students are also introduced to the major approaches applied to explain the complex system of EU policy-making. Among other things, we address questions such as why the Commission, Court, and Parliament have gained new powers, why market deregulation has proceeded faster than social and environmental protection, and why European elections do not work. Knowledge about the institutions and policy processes of the EU will help students to critically assess various questions that are facing Europe's citizens and leaders today: How should the single currency work? How can the EU's institutions be made more democratic? How far and how fast should the EU be enlarged? Should Europe develop into a federal (super) state?    Eiko R. Thielemann holds a Senior Lectureship in European Politics and Policy at the London School of Economics. He completed his Ph.D. at Cambridge University. His research interests are in the areas of multilevel policy-making in the European Union; comparative analysis of public policy and institutions; new institutional theories; migration; and state aid.    Departmental Honors Seminar    Open to Qualified Non-Majors    Unearthing the Lost History of Greek Priestesses: Curating an Exhibition (V43.0150, sec 002; call # 75475; V27.0150, sec 002; call # 75557) Instructor: Joan Breton Connelly Tuesday, 9:45 a.m. - 12:15 p.m. Prerequisite: V43.0001 or V43.0100 and instructor's permission    In March 2007, Joan Breton Connelly published the first comprehensive cultural history of Greek priestesses, brought to life through a pioneering examination of literary sources, inscriptions, sculpture, and vase painting. The book will soon be brought to life in a traveling exhibition of objects and images brought together from some of the world's greatest museums. This seminar gives undergraduate students the unique opportunity to participate in the early planning stages of a major art exhibition. Following weeks of lectures on a broad range of topics to be explored in the Greek Priestess Show, students will develop and present their own plans for displays within the exhibition: object lists, installation designs, didactic information, and creative educational materials that include interactive technologies, film and print media, and relevant scientific content. This course will expose students to new subject matter, challenge their creativity, and develop their practical skills in managing a project.    Joan Breton Connelly is Professor of Art History and Classics and Director of the NYU Yeronisos Island Excavations and Field School in Cyprus. Her scholarship focuses on Greek art and archaeology, mythology, and religion. She is the author of Portrait of a Priestess: Women and Ritual in Ancient Greece and Votive Sculpture of Hellenistic Cyprus . A MacArthur Fellow, she has pushed the boundaries of our understanding of the Parthenon with the publication of \"Parthenon and Parthenoi: A Mythological Interpretation of the Parthenon Frieze\" in the American Journal of Archaeology . From 2002 to 2004 she held the Lillian Vernon Chair for Teaching Excellence at NYU, having earlier won the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching.

The aim was to offer freshmen, in their very   first semester, the opportunity to be in a small, intellectually   stimulating class taught by an expert professor. From the start, the   program proved to be highly popular with students and instructors alike.   The number of seminars has grown from a mere seven in the fall of 1992   to more than eighty in recent years (now offered in both fall and spring). The instructors have been   drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s   professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural,   and governmental leaders. With the launching of the College Cohort   Program in fall 2012, every CAS freshman is required to take one of these seminars. Since 2005, the College has extended the principles behind these first-year seminars to the Advanced Honors Seminars program for sophomores, juniors, and (space permitting) seniors. The FRESHMAN SEMINARS    have as their goals to put new students into contact with leading   thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them   intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and   written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own   research. To that end, they stress demanding readings and writing   assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such   as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary   sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of   texts, or confrontations with works or art. In addition to participating   actively in class discussions, students are expected to give oral   presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always,   have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the   benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may be on   individual or group projects.  Fall 2014  Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature FRSEM-UA 210 Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \"postmodern\" literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\" and the \"undecidability\" of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Virginia Woolf, Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory. FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German. Winner of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, the University's Distinguished Teaching Medal, and NYU Alumni Association Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master's Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka. He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.  The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America FRSEM-UA 218 Instructor: John E. Sexton  syllabus Tuesday, 6:45-8:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of church and state; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a twenty-first-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at that level. JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts, and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the US Supreme Court, and has testified frequently before the US Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.  First Amendment Freedom of Expression FRSEM-UA 235 Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon   syllabus Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.), General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). Prerequisites: A score of 4 or 5 in either AP U.S. History OR in AP U.S. Government and Politics (or equivalent international exam); both recommended. Conflicts over freedom of speech and the press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech and the press, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital social interests. The starting point of this course, which involves both history and law, is the robust debate that occurred in the early Republic over prosecutions for seditious libel (the crime of criticizing the government or public officials). We examine how the Supreme Court has interpreted freedom of expression by looking at a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is Associate Professor in NYU's Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. His book Ellery's Protest: How One Young Man Defied Tradition &amp; Sparked the Battle over School Prayer tells the story of the controversial Supreme Court decision in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in public schools violated the First Amendment. He is currently working on An American Invention: The Founding Generation and the Struggle for Freedom of Speech , to be published by Macmillan. Solomon is a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a JD at Georgetown University Law Center.  School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies FRSEM-UA 255 Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. The 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students prepare reports on different aspects of the era and work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics are self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader. ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is Associate Curator and Social Work Librarian in the Bobst Library, and has also taught in the English Department. First as a student and then as a faculty member, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University's Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.  Disease in History: Epidemics and Pandemics from Antiquity to the Present FRSEM-UA 265 Instructor: Richard W. Hull   syllabus Wednesday 2:00-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This seminar focuses on the historical dimensions of several major epidemics that profoundly affected human societies in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Students identify each epidemic and explore its causes, origins, means of transmission, efforts at containment, and impacts on societies, particularly on their cultural development. They examine representations of the epidemic in the arts, media, and literature of the period, as well as assess the effects of each disease on demographics, religions, economies, and ways of life. To what extent did an epidemic, or plague, accelerate or slow fundamental changes in human relationships within societies and between them, and the ways people viewed themselves and their universe? RICHARD HULL is Professor of History. A specialist in African and European history, he is the author of numerous books, including African Cities and Towns ; Modern Africa ; and Munyakare: African Civilizations , as well as coauthor of the two-volume World Civilizations . He has received both the Great Teacher Award and three Golden Dozen Awards for Teaching Excellence at the College.  Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos? FRSEM-UA 306 Instructor: Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda  syllabus Monday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This seminar focuses on Latin America's longstanding problems and possible solutions to them. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic governance following independence from colonial rule, and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the slowdown of economic growth in the last 20 years and prospects for a new economic takeoff; the phenomenon of widespread violence, and growing respect for human rights; and how the traditional weakness of civil society is being overcome. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present. JORGE D. CASTA\u00d1EDA is Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth. A principal strategist in the election campaign of President Vicente Fox in 2000, he served as Mexico's Foreign Minister from late 2000 until early 2003. He is the author of, among many other books, Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left after the Cold War ; Compa\u00f1ero: The Life and Death of Che Guevara ; Perpetuating Power ; Ex-Mex: From Migrants to Immigrants ; and Leftovers: Tales of the Latin American Left (with Marco Morales). He has also written articles for many newspapers and magazines in Mexico, the United States, and other countries.  The Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan FRSEM-UA 333 Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller   syllabus Thursday, 9:45 a.m.-12:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon The operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were composed during a period of intense change in the world of symphonic music and opera in the 19th century. This seminar examines the major works and their historical, cultural, and musical contexts, with particular attention to The Mikado , which will soon celebrate the 130th anniversary of its premiere in 1885, and which became, arguably, one of the most contentious compositions to reach the stage. It also examines the lives of the composer and the librettist and their respective milieu. In addition, we study the staging of light opera through a close look at the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and its singers, scenic designers, choreographers, and costumers, drawing on the collections of the Morgan Library in New York, which houses the principal sources for the music and numerous artifacts from the productions. RENA CHARNIN MUELLER teaches historical musicology in the Music Department. She was the editor of the Journal of the American Liszt Society from 2001 to 2011 and won the Lizst Medal in 2011. Her research interests include Lizst, Wagner, operetta, and the Broadway musical, in particular its adaptation of elite musical forms. With M\u00e1ria Eckhardt, she is preparing a complete thematic catalogue of Liszt's music; their previous collaboration was on the Liszt \"List of Works\" for The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians 2001 . She is also editing The Gondoliers for the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Complete Edition.  Literary Theory and Its Applications FRSEM-UA 355 Instructor: John Maynard   syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Students in this seminar read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the twentieth century to the present, and learn to evaluate different approaches. They complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis is placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities. JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English at NYU. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature. He has published books on a variety of subjects in Victorian literature and is editor of Victorian Literature and Culture . His most recent book is on readers and reading. From 1983 to 1989, he served as chair of the Department of English. He likes New York City, New York theater, and bicycling.  From Mind to Brain and Back Again FRSEM-UA 357 Instructor: Joseph LeDoux Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. One of the great debates in history is the nature of consciousness: to what extent we are \"hard-wired\" as opposed to shaped by experience? Several hundred years ago, this fundamental question would have been addressed by philosophers. In the late 19th century, the birth of psychology gave us ways of studying the mind scientifically rather than simply speculating about it. Modern neuroscience gives us a new approach, one in which we use discoveries about the brain to understand who we are and why we are that way. What have we learned? And does this approach enhance (or diminish) our sense of who we are? In this course we look at issues both historically and in terms of modern discoveries, using the topic of emotions, and their relation to the brain, as a window on the broader problem of mind and brain. JOSEPH LEDOUX, University Professor and Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science, is on the faculty of the Center for Neural Science and of the Department of Psychology at NYU. He received his PhD in psychology from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1977. Before coming to NYU in 1989, he was a postdoctoral fellow and then Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurology at Cornell University Medical College. In addition to articles in scholarly journals, he is author of The Emotional Brain: The Mysterious Underpinnings of Emotional Life and Synaptic Self: How Our Brains Become Who We Are . He is the recipient of the 2005 Fyssen International Prize in Cognitive Science. He is also a member of a rock band, The Amygdaloids, an all-NYU band that plays original music about mind and brain. They have two CDs: Heavy Mental and Theory of My Mind .  The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome 1490-1610: Two Michelangelos - Buonarroti and Merisi da Caravaggio FRSEM-UA 366 Instructor: Guy Walton   syllabus Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30-10:45 a.m.) and with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.) Early and recent biographies and films about the lives of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Caravaggio provide the starting point for this course, which sets their art in the larger context of, first, papal patronage (the courts of Sixtus IV, Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII, Paul III, Sixtus V, and Paul V), and second, the culture of Renaissance and Counter Reformation Rome. Students develop a major research paper on the masterpieces of painting and sculpture the \"two Michelangelos\" produced. GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Art History at the College of Arts and Science. His degrees are from Wesleyan University and NYU's Institute of Fine Arts (MA, PhD). His research and publications have centered on the courts of Europe of the early modern period, including those of the popes in Rome, and on the artists and architects who worked for many rulers. His published works include scholarly articles, reviews, and exhibition catalogs. He is the author of Louis XIV's Versailles .  The Writer in New York FRSEM-UA 367 Instructor: Vincent Passaro Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. This seminar presents New York as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer's crucial powers of observation. We examine how a number of writers have negotiated-and how the city has powerfully influenced-the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings'from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings-we try to understand the New York writer's particular forms of misery and joy. VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content . His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ , Esquire , Harper's Magazine , The Nation , the New York Times Magazine , and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller's Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.  Welcome to College: The Novel FRSEM-UA 371 Instructor: Carol Sternhell  syllabus Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). Starting college can be exhilarating-and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment-or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people-or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise to Tom Wolfe's I Am Charlotte Simmons . We discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical and cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it. CAROL STERNHELL is Associate Professor of Journalism and a Director of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute's Studio 20 graduate program. She created the department's study-away programs in London, Prague, and Accra and was also a founder of the Women's Studies major (now Gender and Sexuality Studies). She has written about extensively about feminism, motherhood, and literature for a variety of publications. Before coming to NYU, she worked as an editor at Newsday , a general assignment reporter for the New York Post , and a freelance magazine writer. She received the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2005.  The Doctor's Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right FRSEM-UA 379 Instructor: Michael E. Makover  syllabus Tuesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that just because an action or conclusion was correct, did not mean that it was right. Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue, affecting patients' options and care. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \"alternative medicine\" a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly. Approximately 50 pages of reading, and 750 words of writing, per week. MICHAEL E. MAKOVER is Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at the NYU School of Medicine and Attending Physician at the NYU Medical Center. He is also the Chief Medical Officer for a major union. An internist and rheumatologist, he is the author of Mismanaged Care , as well as articles on healthcare quality, ethics, and economics, and currently writing another book entitled 120 Years Young . He was an aide to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and a spokesman for the American Cancer Society and the New York Heart Association.  Suffering and Comfort: Explorations in Narrative Medicine and Other Sources FRSEM-UA 393 Instructor: Michele Shedlin  syllabus Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This seminar explores the nature of suffering and comfort, coping and resilience, in a context where scientific advances have created heretofore unimaginable possibilities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us. How do people cope with the complexities that illness and the need for care bring into our lives? Readings in narrative medicine and other sources, including film, newspaper and magazine articles, novels, poetry and religious texts, guide our discussions about the different ways individuals and cultures view these important dimensions of the human experience. A goal of the course is to familiarize students with the conceptual frameworks that nurses, physicians, social workers, and clergy use as they assist patients. . MICHELE SHEDLIN, Professor at the NYU College of Nursing, is a medical anthropologist with extensive experience in reproductive health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS research in Africa, Latin America and the US. She has designed and implemented behavioral studies at the community, university and national levels, to inform and evaluate prevention and care, and is currently involved in NIH-funded research on HIV risk for Colombian refugees in Ecuador, medication adherence among US-Mexico border populations, and acculturation and HIV risk for sexual minority populations and post-Katrina Latino migrant workers in New Orleans.  America's Role in International Affairs since World War II FRSEM-UA 405 Instructor: James B. Sitrick   syllabus Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This seminar explores America's role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving current foreign policy challenges into the conversation. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan's classic book American Diplomacy, 1900-1950 . Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the CIA; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; US involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; US involvement in the Middle East (particularly with respect to Israel, Iran, and Iraq); the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration. JAMES B. SITRICK serves as Of Counsel to the international law firm of Baker &amp; McKenzie, which has offices in seventy cities in forty countries. He previously served as chairman and CEO of Coudert Brothers, the oldest international law firm in the United States.

FRSEM-UA 413 Instructor: Jeff Goodwin Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. There was a time not so long ago when a critical engagement with the writings of Karl Marx was considered an obligatory intellectual and political rite of passage. No serious intellectual or political activist could not read Marx\u2014whether one ultimately accepted or rejected Marx\u2019s ideas, in whole or in part. Is this still true? Are Marx\u2019s ideas, or some of them, still relevant? Which of his ideas remain important or valuable for people who wish to understand\u2014and perhaps to change\u2014the contemporary world? Which of Marx\u2019s ideas are problematic or pass\u00e9? To address these questions, this seminar critically examines some of Marx\u2019s most important writings, including The Communist Manifesto , The German Ideology , The Civil War in France , and\u2014above all\u2014 Capital , Marx\u2019s magnum opus. In assessing the contemporary relevance of Marx\u2019s ideas, we also read several efforts by Marx\u2019s followers to understand a range of important phenomena, including the nature of the state, current US politics, and the ongoing economic crisis. JEFF GOODWIN is Professor of Sociology. He has written extensively about social movements, revolutions, and terrorism. His books include The Social Movements Reader ; Contention in Context ; Passionate Politics ; and No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945\u20131991 .

Branding: People, Places, Things FRSEM-UA 422 Instructor: Richard L. Lewis Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Brands help us avoid making the same decisions over and over by building bridges of trust; it's reassuring that a visit to McDonald's is pretty much the same all around the world. Brands provide information, advice, smiles, and community, using a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us. Even brand owners are sometimes uncertain as to how their brand has cemented a relationship with an audience. This course analyzes what makes brands tick: how they're created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We also examine the dark side of brands' magnetism. Finally, we examine our budding, personal brands, or reputations, which is how our family, friends, enemies, teachers and bosses evaluate us. RICHARD L. LEWIS is an independent marketing consultant who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime Managing Director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, and has written two bestselling books about advertising. He has also taught at Yale College.  Trials of the Century FRSEM-UA 434 Instructor: Jack Ford  syllabus Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d' What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials, which often act as a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are revealed. This course offers in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century\u201d in the US, approaching each case from a specific angle, from celebrity (the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the trial of O.J. Simpson) to race (the trials of the Scottsboro Boys), politics (the Chicago Seven), and religion (the Scopes Monkey Trial). JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and nationally recognized trial attorney. Currently a CBS News Legal Analyst, he has had a distinguished career on network and cable television. As a litigator, he successfully handled a number of high-profile cases, such as the Northeast\u2019s first death-penalty trial; one of the nation\u2019s first corporate homicide cases; and the Wall Street insider-trading scandal of the late 1980s. He has also written articles for respected legal publications. The recipient of five honorary degrees in recognition of his professional accomplishments and his extensive public service, he has taught at, in addition to NYU, Yale College and Fordham Law School.  Frederick Douglass and the Transformative Life FRSEM-UA 435 Instructor: Philip Kunhardt  syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) Few figures in American history are as compelling or inspiring as the former-slave-turned-abolitionist-editor Frederick Douglass, whose eloquence and moral passion resonate still. A complex and at times conflicted figure, his life intersected with some of the most interesting and charged characters of his age, including Abraham Lincoln, Susan B. Anthony, William Lloyd Garrison, Harriet Tubman, John Brown, and many others. This seminar takes a deep and sustained look at the life and work of this American prophet. Students read a wide selection of his writings-now considered some of the most important and original of the 19th century-in addition to biographies and historical treatments, which open up vistas on the central issues of race and human freedom. We explore important questions in the light of Douglass's thinking: Is there a legitimate use of violence in the pursuit of noble ends? Does there exist, as Douglass believed, a force of progress in history? How do self-awareness, moral insight, and public eloquence undergird the effectiveness of a reformer? PHILIP KUNHARDT is Distinguished Scholar in Residence in the Humanities, and teaches history and biography in the College of Arts and Science. He focuses on the lives of transformative figures and has co-authored five books, including Looking for Lincoln , The American President , and P.T. Barnum: America's Greatest Showman .

History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S. FRSEM-UA 437 Instructor: Jack Salzman   syllabus Monday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.) This course explores the relationship between history and memory in the United States from the mid-20th century to the present. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Aug\u00e9 argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? Among the events, controversies, and We consider such events and issues as the response to the Holocaust; internment camps for Japanese Americans; racial segregation; the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima; anticommunism; the Civil Rights Movement; the destruction of the World Trade Center, and genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. We address the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory. JACK SALZMAN served as the Director of the Center for American Culture Studies at Columbia University and editor of Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies . He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History . Much of his work has been devoted to the relationship between African Americans and American Jews, including Struggles in the Promised Land (with Cornel West) and Bridges and Boundaries , the catalog for an exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York. He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of memoirs by Holocaust survivors. He is writing a book on the impact of the Holocaust on Jews and social justice in the US. Professor Salzman has received the Distinguished Teaching Award and two Fulbrights.  The Image of Business in American Literature FRSEM-UA 440 Instructor: Saul Rosenberg Monday, 4:55-7:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.). What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? This course asks how some of the most engaging American writers and filmmakers have treated the central ideas of business from the nation's founding to the present. How did the idea of \"doing well by doing good\" fare as the Republic grew? We examine classic mid-19th century writers' thoughts about \"getting and spending\" and reactions to the moral collapse inherent in the \"business\" of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later 19th century of the \"robber barons,\" the rise of the corporation, and the enormous influx of immigrants. For the 20th century, we look at films Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead . The course finishes with reflections on the recent financial crisis. SAUL ROSENBERG earned a PhD in American Literature from Columbia and degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge. In addition to teaching at NYU, he has taught American literature at Columbia University and the 92nd Street Y, and served as associate editor of Commentary magazine. He is a consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company, the leading management consulting firm, where he manages publishing and knowledge management programs. He writes regularly on books for the Wall Street Journal .  Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature FRSEM-UA 449 Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld   syllabus Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the Cold War\u2013era superspy. We examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how the great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Philip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history. EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian, as well as an attorney specializing in corporate restructuring. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America.

This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action in cities in the US and around world, particularly those related to improving the urban environment. We study best practices, evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful policies and programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today. ERIC GIOIA is an attorney with extensive experience in business, law, and government. He joined J.P. Morgan in January 2010 after serving for eight years on the New York City Council. Prior to serving on City Council, he practiced law at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy LLP, and served in the White House under President Bill Clinton. Professor Gioia holds a BA from New York University and a JD from Georgetown University Law Center.  Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber FRSEM-UA 461 Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, 3:30-6:10 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Cao Xueqin's mid-18th century literary epic The Dream of the Red Chamber is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China. With a tragic love story between two aristocratic teenagers at its dramatic center, it covers a vast terrain of culture and social life-the question of what is eternal and what is ephemeral; the nature of \"qing,\" as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; individual talent and its fragility; and the decadence of the elite, as well as growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. The novel's manifold structure and intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes it one of the most complex and colorful of all time. Note: Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. No knowledge of Chinese culture, language, or history is required or assumed. Native Chinese speakers who wish to read and enjoy this masterpiece in the original language are advised to choose a different Freshman Seminar and take Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (EAST-UA 228) as an elective course in the future. Consult the CAS Bulletin for prerequisites. JING WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese.

Political Cinema and Representation of the \"Other\" FRSEM-UA 463 Instructor: Shimon Dotan Friday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). In contemporary war, \"the other\" is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world's most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \"the other\" is constructed politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them. SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have received the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ).

New Media, Activism, and Social Change FRSEM-UA 465 Instructor: Arely Zimmerman Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. This class explores the uses of networked communication to mobilize civic, political, and social movement participation. Students explore the opportunities and limits of digital activism in transforming social inequalities, fostering social connectivity, and deepening democratic citizenship. We problematize how race, class, gender, generation, and other categories of difference shape digital media literacy and access, and how marginalized communities overcome barriers to online digital participation. While we focus primarily on immigrant rights and other social justice movements in the U.S., we also use comparative cases from across the globe to compare and contrast how new media is reshaping the way people engage in politics, form and express political and civic identities, organize across borders, and act collectively. ARELY ZIMMERMAN holds a PhD in Political Science from the University of California (Los Angeles), with specializations in political theory and race and ethnic politics. Her work examines social movements and immigrant rights activism through the lens of democratic theory. Her current book project, Contesting Citizenship: Central Americans and the Politics of Belonging Across Borders , outlines a framework of citizenship in contexts of transnational exclusion through a case study of US Central American communities and their struggles for legalization. She is concurrently working on new research in the areas of youth, second generation Latino/a civic engagement, and new media.  What is College For? FRSEM-UA 474 Instructor: Trace Jordan  syllabus Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open-minded person? To gain specialized knowledge? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career? To make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents' plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and social goals of higher education and studies issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience in coming years. It also prompts students to be more reflective and purposeful about their own academic choices at NYU. TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Professor and Associate Director of the College Core Curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement.

Gender, Sexuality and the Law FRSEM-UA 480 Instructor: Shelley Fischel Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? This course explores gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in spheres of work, politics, and social life. We address such matters as marriage and divorce law, the Civil Rights Act and Title IX, and the unique, perhaps troubling ways that criminal law treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, and sexuality orientation. We also address the intersection of these matters with issues of gender identity and sexual orientation. This course offers a history of US sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial and legislative developments. SHELLEY D. FISCHEL served as Executive Vice President of Home Box Office, Inc., responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, as well as labor law matters, until her retirement in December 2009. She oversaw all sexual discrimination claims in the company. She received her JD from Columbia University and her LLM from NYU.  Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice FRSEM-UA 484 Instructor: Ulrich Baer Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. The seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship-the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Topics include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of New York City as an international city that has turned its diversity into strength. The seminar brings in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and asks students to consider how their own actions-ranging from activism to business leadership-may have an impact on those outside their immediate world. ULRICH BAER, Vice Provost of Arts, Humanities and Multicultural Affairs and Professor of Comparative Literature and German, was awarded the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1998 and 2004.

Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism FRSEM-UA 488 Instructor: William Ambler Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. This course studies the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the 17th century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in ways that gave visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. We set the portraits in the context of debates that preoccupied the European courts of the time: the Reformation; the dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. We also consider the position of artists at a royal court and preexisting traditions of royal imagery. WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth-century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there, as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.  The Cultural Nature of Language FRSEM-UA 496 Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin Wednesday, 2:00-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. From accents, pronouns, swearing, and spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a social practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don't (e.g., feral children), we examine speech and silence across a range of societies. We look at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \"English Only\"), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such as who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and authority. BAMBI SCHIEFFELIN is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Anthropology. A linguistic anthropologist, she is the author of The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children and co-editor of, among other books, The Acquisition of Literacy: Ethnographic Perspectives ; Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory ; and Consequences of Contact . She has also published articles in the preeminent journals of her field. She is completing a book on the impact of Christianity on the language and social life of Bosavi people of Papua New Guinea over the past twenty-five years, and continues research on linguistic creativity and change as evidenced in computer-mediated communication such as IM. Professor Schieffelin received the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2010.  How We See FRSEM-UA 497 Instructor: Marisa Carrasco  syllabus Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Do we see the world the way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is? This course looks at what we know about vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing, and provides important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field? MARISA CARRASCO is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, as well as a former Chairperson of the Department of Psychology. Born and raised in Mexico City, she received her licentiate in psychology from the National University of Mexico and her PhD in psychology (cognition and perception) from Princeton University. She conducts research in cognitive neuroscience, exploring the relation between the psychological and neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and attention. Her papers have been published in the leading scientific journals in the field, and she has won numerous prestigious awards and fellowships throughout her career, such as an American Association of University Women Fellowship, a National Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation, a Cattell Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.  The New Worlds of Work and Care FRSEM-UA 500 Instructor: Kathleen Gerson   syllabus Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The early 21st century represents a period of immense social change in both the public world of work and the private world of family care. New technologies have blurred the boundary between home and work. New opportunities and pressures have sent more women into the workplace. The \u201cnew economy\u201d has created jobs with more short-term flexibility, but less long-term security. And new options in intimate relationships have created more diverse and voluntary, but less predictable, family bonds. These intertwined shifts are reshaping the daily lives and life pathways of American women and men. This seminar addresses several questions: What does an overview of changes in work, family, and gender patterns tell us about where we are now and where we are going? What are the major dilemmas created by these changes, and how are people coping with these conflicts? What are the implications for the future? And what can we do to enhance the opportunities and limit the insecurities of these new social arrangements? KATHLEEN GERSON, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Sociology, is a recognized authority on the connections among gender, work, and family life in postindustrial societies. She has held visiting positions at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, the Russell Sage Foundation in New York City, and the Center for the Study of Status Passages in the Life Course at Bremen University, Germany and has won numerous prestigious prizes for her scholarly work.

Jacobs); No Man\u2019s Land: Men\u2019s Changing Commitments to Family and Work ; and Hard Choices: How Women Decide About Work, Career, and Motherhood .  Frontiers of Biology FRSEM-UA 502 Instructor: Edo Kussell  syllabus Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Prerequisites: Both AP Biology 4 or 5 (or equivalent international credential) and at least one additional AP science (or mathematics) score of 4 or 5 (or equivalent international credential). This seminar focuses on the latest discoveries in biology and the technological innovations that enable them. Through a combination of readings, lectures, and discussions, the seminar leapfrogs classical textbook biology and mere memorization to present science at the forefront of biological research. Topics that may be covered (always in great depth and detail) include metagenomics, synthetic biology, quantitative immunology, microbial ecology, and biology at the single-molecule level. Emphasis is placed on understanding how the scientific research process works in today's world. Students contribute on a weekly basis to an on-line science blog: http://www.frontiersofbiology.org . This demanding course is geared towards highly motivated individuals, with a superlative high school background in science and a deep passion for scientific inquiry, but is open to students in all majors. EDO KUSSELL is Associate Professor of Biology and Physics, and a faculty member in the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology at NYU.

In Search of Lost Time FRSEM-UA 503 Instructor: Marcelle Clements   syllabus Thursday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. We read Marcel Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. At more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is one of modern literature\u2019s most challenging and pleasurable reads, still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, and psychological acuity with a portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity. Though Proust (1871\u20131922) is often cited as France\u2019s greatest novelist, many readers never move past the first fifty pages of his novel, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. However, as its architecture cannot be appreciated until it has been read once in its entirety, we move at a brisk pace through all six volumes; when we read the final volume, we can begin to understand the extraordinarily intimate relationship Proust has created with his reader. In-class creative writing exercises are designed to help with the reading and to expand an expressive, personal response. Reading assignments average 350 pages per week. MARCELLE CLEMENTS is Collegiate Professor and Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations , a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman , and two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer . Her prizewinning articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications.  American Wars, Past and Present: Vietnam, Iraq (I and II), Afghanistan FRSEM-UA 504 Instructor: Marilyn B. Young   syllabus Friday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This course considers the last two major wars of the 20th century and the first two wars of the 21st. It begins with the history and memory of the Vietnam War. We then move on to examine Gulf War I (Operation Desert Storm), which was shaped by how the administration of George H.W. Bush understood the Vietnam War. The subsequent war in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) can be understood in part in terms of what some policymakers believed to be the unfinished business of Gulf War I, yet it, too, was fought in the shadow of Vietnam analogies. Finally, in terms of tactics and goals, the war in Afghanistan, launched in response to 9/11, has been shaped by all three of the preceding wars. We examine these wars through primary documents and secondary sources as well as the documentary and fiction film in which they have been represented. The overarching concern of the seminar is the ongoing haunting of American politics\u2014military and civilian\u2014by a war fought over three decades ago. There are two connected questions: Can history teach? What does it teach? MARILYN B. YOUNG, Collegiate Professor and Professor of History, is a former Chair of the History Department. Her teaching and her writing focus on U.S. foreign policy. Her books include The Vietnam Wars, 1945-1990 and The Rhetoric of Empire: American China Policy, 1895-1901 . She has also edited several collections of essays on the wars in Iraq and, most recently, Bombing Civilians: A 20th-Century History . She was Director of the Project on the Cold War as a Global Conflict at NYU's International Center for Advanced Study from 2001 to 2004 and served as President of the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations in 2011. She has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and of an American Council of Learned Societies Fellowship, and has won the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence twice. She is currently Co-Director of the Tamiment Center on the Cold War.  Helen of Troy and Her Ghosts FRSEM-UA 505 Instructor: Liana Theodoratou Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. In Homer's Iliad , Helen, reflecting on her destiny, proclaims that her function is not primarily to be a woman, but to be first and foremost a story: \"On us the gods have set an evil destiny,\" she explains, \"that we should be a singer's theme / for generations to come\" (Il.6.357-58). Taking its point of departure from the Helen of ancient Greece-the daughter of Zeus and Leda-this course traces the various Helens whose stories have been told throughout the history of Western literature-from the Helen of Homer to that of Sappho, Aeschylus, Euripides, Pierre de Ronsard, Christopher Marlowe, J.G.W. Goethe, Jean Giraudoux, W.B.Yeats, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Yannis Ritsos, and beyond. Tracing this history will permit us to think about the survival of the past in the present, about the role and place of representation in the establishment of identity in general, and about the way in which the present is haunted by the phantoms of the past. LIANA THEODORATOU is Clinical Professor and Director of the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies and Director of the NYU in Athens Program. She is a recipient of the College's Outstanding Teaching Award and of its Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. She has written widely on ancient and modern Greek poetry and has translated several works by, among others, Foucault, Althusser, and Derrida into Modern Greek. She is currently completing a book on the politics of mourning in contemporary Greek poetry, entitled Mourning Becomes Greece .  Game Theory and the Humanities FRSEM-UA 506 Instructor: Steven J. Brams   syllabus Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Game theory is a mathematical theory of strategy that has been applied to the analysis of conflict and cooperation in such fields as economics, political science, and biology. In this seminar, we discuss more unusual applications-to history, literature, philosophy, the Bible, theology, and law. We discuss Abraham's decision to offer his son Isaac for sacrifice; the choices made by accused witches and their persecutors in medieval witch trials; Lady Macbeth's incitement of her husband to murder King Duncan in Shakespeare's play; several strategic games played by presidents and their antagonists in domestic crises (e.g., the Civil War) and international crises (e.g., the Cuban missile crisis), and coping mechanisms used by characters in catch-22 games (including those in Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22). Prerequisite: No mathematical background beyond high school mathematics is assumed, but a willingness to learn and apply sophisticated reasoning to analyze the interactions of players in games is essential . STEVEN J. BRAMS is Professor of Politics at NYU. He is the author of several books-most recently, Mathematics and Democracy and Game Theory and the Humanities -that apply game theory and social choice theory to voting and elections, bargaining and fairness, international relations, and the Bible, theology and literature. He holds two patents for fair-division algorithms and is Chairman of the Advisory Board of Fair Outcomes, Inc., and a former president of the Peace Science Society and of the Public Choice Society. He is an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow and was a Guggenheim Fellow and Visiting Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation.  Writing the Self and New York FRSEM-UA 520 Instructor: David J. Dent Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Students begin the semester by dusting off their college admissions essay. In our first exercise, we push beyond the boundary of the personal essay to expand it into a piece of narrative nonfiction. For the rest of the semester, students explore New York through a series of writing assignments on urban life designed to sharpen their skills in social and cultural analysis and writing. Students read classic pieces of literary nonfiction, personal essays and fiction about life in New York. DAVID J. DENT is Associate Professor of Journalism and Social and Cultural Analysis at NYU. His book In Search of Black America was a New York Times Notable Book of 2000. He has written for the New York Times , Playboy , GQ , Salon , and the Washington Post among others, and blogs at www.bushobamaamerica.com (which he founded). He is author of the forthcoming The American Extreme , to be published by St. Martin\u2019s Press, and The Best Essay of Your Life: The College Admissions Essay , to be published by Random House. He and his wife Valerie are co-founders and directors of www.writeforthefuture.com, which uses the tools of journalism to help middle and high school students become better writers.  Race and Culture in Brazil FRSEM-UA 536 Instructor: Dylon Robbins Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m). Brazil is often invoked in conversations about race and culture, held up as an example for its presumably more egalitarian race relations, considered the embodiment of an exceptional fusion of African, Indigenous, and European elements and a model for understanding heterogeneity and difference. And yet it is also a nation frequently cited for its incidence of violence and extreme economic inequality. This seminar explores some of the unique contradictions shaping Brazilian reality. We trace the history of race relations in the ongoing transformation of Brazilian culture, looking at key social, political, and economic factors such as slavery and the plantation economy, popular music, Carnival, populism, racial democracy, affirmative action, and urban and rural violence. How do race and culture coincide and diverge in Brazil? And what may we gather about these convergences and divergences from textual, musical, and cinematic examples? DYLON ROBBINS is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. He teaches courses on Brazil and the Caribbean, with particular emphasis on the cultural and theoretical production of these regions and their place in the African Diaspora. With support from a Fulbright-Hays Fellowship, he undertook research in Brazil at the Cinemateca Brasileira and the Instituto de Estudos Brasileiros and, in Cuba, at the ICAIC, the Biblioteca Nacional, and the Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas. Professor Robbins is currently completing his book manuscript on popular music and political subjectivity in Brazil.  Pirates, Privateers and Other Maritime Renegades of the Caribbean FRSEM-UA 538 Instructor: Edgardo Morales Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30-10:30 a.m. Today,   the Jolly Roger\u2014the pirate flag\u2014is displayed on toys and makes for   compelling cinema. In real life, however, flying that flag was a   criminal act punishable with the death penalty. This course is about the   pirates, privateers and runaways of the early modern Caribbean, who   fought, stole, lied and killed in order to make a living and either to   collaborate with or oppose bosses and empires. We use the history of   maritime renegades as an opportunity to develop historical research and   writing skills, and to help us think critically about topics that might   otherwise escape scholarly inquiry, for while outsiders often described   them as mere villains, privateers like Francis Drake, pirates like Anne   Bonny, or runaway slaves like Tom King lived at the very center of the   important political questions of their age. Students read original   documents from the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries as well as   contemporary historical scholarship. EDGARDO PEREZ MORALES   teaches at NYU's Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies. He   graduated with a PhD in history from the University of Michigan and has   conducted research on privateers during the Age of Revolutions in   archives and libraries in Colombia, Cuba, France, Jamaica, Spain and the   United States.  Facing Fascism: The Spanish Civil War and U.S. Culture FRSEM-UA 539 Instructor: James D. Fernandez Monday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.) Prerequisites: 4 or 5 in AP Spanish or reported 4 or 5 in either AP U.S. History or AP World History (or international equivalent). The Great Depression. Liberal democracy in crisis. On the rise: a spectrum of ideologies ranging from anarchism to fascism, promising solutions to the afflictions of people all over the planet. July 1936: a right-wing military coup attempts to overthrow a democratically elected left-wing coalition government in Spain, and war begins. This course explores the place occupied by Spain and the Spanish Civil War in American culture from the 1930s forward; how journalists, writers, artists, and citizens reacted to the war; and how the legacy of the war has affected U.S. culture over the last 70 years. It also introduces students to research methods in history and culture, as they carry out a major archival research project based on unique sources in NYU's Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA), a vast collection of materials that chronicles the lives of the 2,800 Americans who, between 1936 and 1939, volunteered to fight fascism in Spain. JAMES D. FERN\u00c1NDEZ is Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. His research interests include the literature, history, and culture of modern Spain; autobiography; cultural relations between Spain and Latin America; and visions of Spain in the United States. He served as the Director of NYU's King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center from 1995 to 2007 and as Chairperson of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese from 2003 to 2007. He is the Vice-Chairperson of the Board of Governors of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives. He is the author of Apology to Apostrophe: Autobiography and the Rhetoric of Self-Representation in Spain and co-editor of the essay collection Facing Fascism: New York and the Spanish Civil War .  In Their Own Words: Oral History and Irish New York FRSEM-UA 540 Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30\u201310:30 a.m. This interdisciplinary course focuses on oral history as a resource for understanding the 20th-century history of the Irish in America, particularly in New York. With access to the 300-plus interviews in Glucksman Ireland House's Oral History collection, students explore the discipline of oral history as it has progressed over the last twenty years and develop their own research, writing and interviewing skills. The course demonstrates how oral history gives life to ethnic communities like those of Irish longshoremen, personalizes dramatic events like 9/11, and provides insight into Irish American literature. In addition to reading traditional texts, we work with digital maps, walk the streets of the communities we study, and screen documentaries. LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America. Her book Irish Immigrants in New York City, 1945-1995 (2001) compares the experience of the Irish who arrived in the 1950s with that of their counterparts thirty and forty years later. Professor Almeida has published chapters in The Irish World Wide (1992), Ireland in the 1950s (2004), and Making the Irish American (2006) and delivered papers on pedagogical approaches to oral history to both the Oral History Association and the International Oral History Association. Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives. Conspiracy Theories: Paranoid Fictions Before and After Freud FRSEM-UA 541 Instructor: Eliot Borenstein  syllabus Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). Conspiracy theories are intricate attempts to impose rational order on increasingly chaotic systems, all through the vehicle of narrative. They are explanatory myths but, unlike many creation stories, they deal with demiurges rather than full-fledged gods, seeking to show how dark forces have ruined a preexisting world, rather than inventing a world whole-cloth. In this course, we read narratives that both exemplify and explore the modernist and postmodernist paranoid mindset. Our readings consist primarily of novels and short stories, but also include works of literary and psychological theory, as well as case studies in the rise and fall of particular conspiracy theories. ELIOT BORENSTEIN, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Russian and Slavic Studies, has served as Chairperson of the Department of Russian &amp; Slavic Studies and as Director of the College Core Curriculum. Before coming to NYU in 1995, he directed the Fulbright Program in the Russian Federation and taught at the University of Virginia. His first book, Men without Women: Masculinity and Revolution in Russian Fiction, 1917-1919 , won the AATSEEL award for best work in literary scholarship in 2000. In 2007, he published Overkill: Sex and Violence in Contemporary Russian Popular Culture , which received the AWSS award for best book in Slavic Gender Studies in 2008. Recently, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to finish the companion volume, Catastrophe of the Week: Apocalyptic Entertainment in Post-Soviet Russia . He is a two-time recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.  Anthropology and Literature of the Other FRSEM-UA 542 Instructor: Thomas Beidelman Monday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. This course considers the central problem in social anthropology and history: the translation of the beliefs and practices of societies different from our own in place or time (or both) into words we can understand. How can we comprehend the world of the ancient Greeks through a translation of Homer? How can we be sure that we grasp what the King James Bible \u201creally\u201d means, when we are five centuries removed from its translation (in seventeenth-century monarchical England) from the even more remote Hebrew and Greek? We begin and end the course with translations in an African context: an anthropologist\u2019s account of her effort to translate Hamlet to the Ghanaians she was studying, and two interconnected novels by Chinua Achebe that raise profound questions of identity, meaning, and displacement. T. O. BEIDELMAN is Professor of Anthropology at NYU. He is the author of many books and articles on the anthropology and history of Africa, social theory, religion, symbolism and colonialism. His most recent books are The Culture of Colonialism (2012) and The Cool Knife (1997). He is presently working on a book on how Homer may be used to teach introductory anthropology. He is the recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence and the Herskovits Prize for the best American book on Africa published in the social sciences. He has a D. Phil. from Trinity College, Oxford University.  The Wild Child FRSEM-UA 543 Instructor: Patricia Crain   syllabus Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Childhood as Western culture has imagined it since the 18th century is full of paradoxes: sequestered, protected, and schooled, yet free, creative, and imaginative. As this child of modernity was being invented, another child came into being: the so-called \u201cwild\u201d or \u201cferal\u201d child, without parents or language, emerging on the margins of society, an object of fear and fascination, of scientific investigation and artistic imaginings. This seminar explores notable 19th-century feral child cases\u2014Victor of Aveyron and Kaspar Hauser\u2014and the contemporary documents that introduced them. We try to understand the cultural significance of the wild child and consider why this figure has drawn the attention of novelists, playwrights, and filmmakers, across historical and national borders. What does the wild child allow art to explore and reflect upon? What does the wild child have to say about constructions of modern childhood and of gender, race, and sexuality? PATRICIA CRAIN is Associate Professor of English. She is the award-winning author of The Story of A: The Alphabetization of America from The New England Primer to The Scarlet Letter , as well as of articles on the history of childhood and the history of literacy in America. Her current project is a study of the child reader in the 19thcentury US. She has also taught at Princeton University and at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities  Harems and Court Cultures FRSEM-UA 544 Instructor: Leslie Peirce  syllabus Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Everyone knows the stereotype of harems, but this course studies them as an important historical phenomenon widespread in time and space. Although sometimes merely sexual objects or vehicles for biological reproduction, women living in harems and royal courts typically enjoyed a society of their own that was often highly developed culturally. They might, moreover, wield considerable power\u2014political, economic and artistic. While this course focuses principally on females, it is almost as much about males; for example, their own gendered spaces and cultures and their relationships with harem and court women. Studying harems informs us about social formations, expressions of political power, shifting conceptions of gender, and the ways in which women's separation and seclusion from males has been used in history to distinguish elites from ordinary people. The course focuses principally on the Near East, but includes extensive comparison with European and East Asian court and harem cultures. LESLIE PEIRCE, Silver Professor and Professor of History and Middle Eastern Studies, is an authority on the history and culture of the Ottoman Empire. She is the author of the prize-winning books Morality Tales: Law and Gender in the Ottoman Court of Aintab (2003) and The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire (1993) and many scholarly articles. The focus of her current research is captivity and enslavement in the early-modern Eurasian region; she is writing a biography of a Russian slave who became concubine, then queen, of the sultan Suleyman the Magnificent.  Media and Communication in the Middle Ages FRSEM-UA 545 Instructor: Brigitte M. Bedos-Rezak   syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Medieval tools of communication and methods of transportation circulated news, rumors, propaganda, and revolutionary ideas; permitted contact with the supernatural; equipped governments with bureaucratic powers of local subjugation and global interaction; enabled people to travel far away from their homes on pilgrimages, diplomatic missions, entertainment tours (jongleurs, troubadours), commercial ventures, explorations, and conquests. With a focus on Western Europe, we consider modes and means of communication: languages, speech and writing, gestures, fashions, rituals, images, artifacts, and maps. Assessing the breadth of medieval mobility will elucidate a pre-modern world-system that extended across Eurasia, including the Mongol Empire, the Middle East, and China. BRIGITTE M. BEDOS-REZAK is Professor of History at NYU. Trained in France at the Sorbonne and at the \u00c9cole nationale des Chartes (Paris), her teaching and research interests cover medieval Europe, in particular its urban life and secular elites. She is particularly interested in the ways that increasingly material communicative practices shaped concepts of identity. Select publications include Les sceaux de villes (1980); When Ego was Imago: Signs of Identity in the Middle Ages (2010); \"Semiotic Anthropology: The Twelfth-Century Experiment,\" in European Transformations 950-1200 (2011); and \"Mutually Contextual: Materials, Bodies, and Objects,\" in Cultural Histories of the Material World (2013).  Travel and Communication in the Ancient World FRSEM-UA 546 Instructor: Raffaella Cribiore   syllabus Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m This course explores traveling, communicating, and spreading news in antiquity. Unlike moderns, the ancients did not travel for leisure, and the notion of travel as \u201croutine\u201d would have been foreign to them; their journeys had mythic and epic significance and took place under precarious conditions. Likewise, whereas today we are able to communicate with each other in multiple convenient ways, sending letters and messages in the Greek and Roman worlds was cumbersome and time-intensive. Nonetheless, people did get in touch with each other and exchange news. Indeed, one of the goals of the course is to question what might be called a \u201cprogressive model\u201d of understanding communication(s) that automatically assumes the superiority of modern technology. RAFFAELLA CRIBIORE is Professor of Classics and an expert on education in antiquity. Her publications include Writing, Teachers and Students in Greco-Roman Egypt ; Gymnastics of the Mind: Greek Education in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt , which won the Goodwin Prize in 2003; and Women\u2019s Letters from Ancient Egypt, 300BC-AD 800 (with Roger Bagnall). Her most recent book, The School of Libanius in Late Antique Antioch , is the study of an elite school of rhetoric in Syria. Great Science, Fabulous Science, and Voodoo Science FRSEM-UA 547 Instructor: Allen Mincer   syllabus Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Science is often portrayed as following a very clearly-defined set of procedures: start with a hypothesis, do an experiment and, based on the results, reject the hypothesis or adopt it as a working assumption. The actual process, however, is rarely so straightforward. In addition, the stories as usually told or recorded may differ from what really happened. For most of the semester, we study some famous, some lesser known, and some infamous experiments, mainly in the physical sciences, selected to illustrate intellectual tours de force, sloppiness, error, self-deception, and fraud, and the sometimes murky boundaries between them. Along the way, issues such as the discarding of \u201cfaulty data,\u201d theoretical bias, and probabilistic tools for hypothesis acceptance and rejection are discussed. In the latter part of the semester, we discuss how scientific ideas are evaluated by the media, in the courtroom, and in government. To take this course, students should have had high school chemistry, physics, and calculus. ALLEN MINCER, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Physics, specializes in experimental particle physics and particle astrophysics. He is currently a member of the ATLAS collaboration, which is studying the nature of the elementary building blocks of matter at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. His research at NYU has a long, continuous history of generous support by grants from the National Science Foundation. He is co-author of approximately 400 scientific publications, including the discovery of the top quark with the D-Zero collaboration and the discovery of a particle consistent with the Standard Model Higgs Boson with the ATLAS Collaboration. In addition to teaching in the Physics Department, he has taught in the Steinhardt School\u2019s Department of Teaching and Learning, been involved in research in physics education, and has twice been awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. The Problem of Beauty FRSEM-UA 550 Instructor: G. Gabrielle Starr  syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. What is beauty for? It is common in many circumstances to think of beauty as \"merely\" beautiful-something nice to have, but an unnecessary add-on to what really matters. This hasn't always been the case. Beauty has played an important part in philosophy, ethics and theology, and now it is playing an increasingly interesting role in biology, neuroscience, social policy and design. But what is beauty, anyway? And why should we care? This course explores the role of beauty across a variety of disciplines and across \"long time\" (not just the period from the ancient world to the present, but even the long time of evolution). G. GABRIELLE STARR is Professor of English and Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU's Center for Neural Science, she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience . In addition, Dean Starr has just published a book entitled Feeling Beauty: Aesthetic Experience in the Brain and Across the Arts .  Renewal and Expansion in 12th-Century Europe FRSEM-UA 558 Instructor: Jill N. Claster   syllabus Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. The 12th century in Europe was a period of astonishing change and creativity, as peace gradually replaced several centuries of invasions and chaos. The result was the growth of towns and trade; the expansion of literacy and the rise of universities; the rise in the position of women; the growth and expansion of technology; and an amazing amount of travel and adventure, of which the Crusades are only a part. These and more are part of our inheritance from this age. However, there was also an underside to the century, and we study that as well: the rise of anti-Semitism; the persecution of heretics; the harsh treatment of lepers and the poor. We contrast the sometimes terrible realities of what one historian has called a \"persecuting society\" with its exuberant accomplishments. JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita. A medievalist, she has taught and studied the era of the Crusades extensively and is the author of the recently published book Sacred Violence: The European Crusades to the Middle East, 1096-1396 . She served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She was the recipient of a Fulbright Grant and was honored with the Distinguished Alumni Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.  Civil Rights and Civil Wrongs: The Fight for Equality in the United States FRSEM-UA 560 Instructor: K. Kevyne Baar   syllabus Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon This course looks at the intersection of the three major movements for social justice and civil rights in the United States since 1850: the movements for African Americans' rights, women's rights, and gay rights. We pay particular attention to points of convergence and points of divergence, alliances and conflicts. For example, though some abolitionists and women's rights advocates found common cause in the 1850s, many abolitionists would feel their work was done with passage of the Fifteenth Amendment (which enfranchised formerly enslaved African American men). More recently, feminism in the 1970s had to contend with charges that it excluded women of color, lesbians, and working-class women. We set the dialogue on civil rights, including tensions over exclusions based on gender and sexuality, race, and class, in a world context and take a measure of where it stands today. KEVYNE BAAR is returning to NYU from a year spent teaching at Hacettepe University in Ankara, Turkey, on a Fulbright Award. A self-described non-traditional scholar, she entered academic life after a long career in theatre and union organizing, and spent ten years as an archivist at NYU's Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives, to which she attributes the important role that archives play in her courses. She is the recipient of the College's Outstanding Teaching Award for her course \"Women, the Entertainment Industry and the Blacklist Era.\"  Music and State Power 1948-1994: South Africa, Czechoslovakia, and the U.S. FRSEM-UA 561 Instructor: Michael Beckerman Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) This course looks at the relationship between music, ethnic and racial difference, and state power under the communist regime in Czechoslovakia and the apartheid regime in South Africa between 1948 and 1994. We set the stage by exploring each country's unique historical context, then address such topics as State control of musical activity; the role of jazz and popular music in the struggle for equality and democracy; the symbolic power of national anthems in creating a national self-image; and finally, the role of sound in the revolutions that brought an end to communism in Czechoslovakia and apartheid in South Africa. We also look at the US in the same period. While there was no clear revolution in the US-either of a repressive or a liberating kind-we can ask questions about similar forces at work here. The culminating event of the course is an online video conference featuring presentations by class members and an international group of scholars. MICHAEL BECKERMAN is Collegiate Professor and Carroll and Milton Petrie Professor of Music at NYU and Distinguished Professor of History at Lancaster University. His wide range of scholarly expertise includes film scoring, the music of the Roma (Gypsies), Mozart, Brahms, exiled composers, and Czech music history. He is the author of, among other publications, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and His World and Jan\u00e1\u010dek and His World . A pianist and composer, he has written the ballet Asolando Suite ; incidental music to The Tempest ; the Dark Woods Variations ; and the Hiawatha Melodrama . He has performed at Lincoln Center and the Bard Music Festival, among other venues, and lectures both nationally and internationally. Professor Beckerman is a recipient of the George M. Estabrook Alumni Award from Hofstra University and the College's Golden Dozen Award.  Modern Poetry: Craft and Revolution FRSEM-UA 564 Instructor: Matthew Rohrer  syllabus Monday 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This course thrusts students headlong into the dark cobwebby interiors of the modern poem. We look at several revolutions in thinking about what poems are, beginning in England in 1798, coming to Walt Whitman's and Emily Dickinson's America in the 1850s, stopping in Harlem in the 1920s, and ending up online. We look at how modern poems are actually put together, considering such elemental concerns as image, voice, and structure. And we also write our own poems, sometimes with these examples as our models. Students leave this course with a deeper understanding of the lineage of the modern poem and what makes the modern poem go, as well as, thanks to the generous and critical attentions of the workshop, the same understanding of their own work. MATTHEW ROHRER is a Clinical Associate Professor in the Creative Writing Program, where he teaches undergraduates and graduate students. He is the author of seven books of poetry, was a founder of Fence Magazine and Fence Books, and has participated in residencies and performances at the Museum of Modern Art (NYC) and the Henry Museum (Seattle). His poems have been widely anthologized, and he has appeared on NPR's All Things Considered and The Next Big Thing .  Interpreting the City FRSEM-UA 565 Instructor: David Serlin Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This course uses New York City as both a field site and laboratory in order to give students theoretical and methodological tools for interpreting urban culture. For the millions of people who live, work, and visit, the city may at times appear to be a vast impersonal metropolis, but one nonetheless made meaningful by the infinite number of interactions that take place in and through its streets, buildings, spaces, and objects. So how might we come to understand urban culture not as something fixed but as a process? Readings in history, anthropology, museum studies, and critical theory (such as sensory studies), inform students' exploration of the physical and cognitive impacts of the built environment in relation to the economic, ethnic, gendered, sexual, and subjective dimensions of urban experience. Students make site visits, analyzing objects through written and visual documentation, and execute multimedia presentations, such as a virtual museum exhibit. DAVID SERLIN is Associate Professor of Communication at the University of California, San Diego, where he teaches courses in historical methodology, museum studies, visual and material culture, and architecture as a medium of communication. He is the author or editor of numerous books and articles, including Replaceable You: Engineering the Body in Postwar America , and serves on the editorial collective for the Radical History Review . During 2014-15 he will be a Visiting Research Professor in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis at NYU. Digging for Dragon Bones: Unearthing Ancient China FRSEM-UA 567 Instructor: Roderick Campbell   syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Despite being less than a century old, the practice of archaeology of China has challenged, verified or rewritten traditional Chinese history since its inception. Today, with decades of double-digit economic growth driving countless archaeological salvage projects, the rate of discovery is surpassing the ability of archaeologists to make sense of the changing picture of the Chinese past. In this course we explore the prehistory and early history of the land that would become China in light of the most recent discoveries, such as the lost Bronze Age civilization of Sanxingdui and the first emperor's terracotta army. Through archaeological reports, historical texts, images and film, we attempt to come to grips with the vast and varied landscape that gave birth to one of the world's great civilizations. RODERICK CAMPBELL is Assistant Professor of East Asian Archaeology and History at NYU's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World. His research interests are archaeological political theory, sacrifice, and Shang civilization. Professor Campbell is co-director of a bone working assemblage at Anyang and is broadening his research into a multi-sited investigation of the Shang economy. He has recently published an edited volume entitled Violence and Civilization: Studies of Social Violence in History and Prehistory , and his book Archaeology of the Chinese Bronze Age: From Erlitou to Anyang is forthcoming with Cotsen Institute Press. Current writing projects include articles on cattle traction, the introduction to wheeled vehicles to China, the nature of animals in Shang art and a synthetic book-length multi-disciplinary history of the Shang polity. Gotham Schools: Urban Education Policy and the Pursuit of Equity FRSEM-UA 568 Instructor: Jennifer Jennings   syllabus Thursday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.). Never before has there been a stronger policy effort to reform America\u2019s urban schools. This course explores urban education reforms by using New York City as a case study. Through considering policy changes around school accountability and standardized testing, teacher evaluation, school choice, and prekindergarten access in New York City, we think systematically about their effects on schools, teachers, and students. In doing so, we grapple with many of the challenges that researchers face in conducting sociological and educational research. Whether your future lies in classrooms, a non-profit organization, the statehouse, the courthouse, or elsewhere, this course supplies you with a sociological toolkit to become a thoughtful and rigorous consumer of social science research. JENNIFER JENNINGS is Assistant Professor of Sociology at New York University. Before attending graduate school, she taught high school English and Social Studies in urban schools in New Jersey. Jennings\u2019s research focuses on understanding the impact of a range of education policies, such as the No Child Left Behind Act, teacher evaluation reform, and school choice, on educators\u2019 behavior and on racial, socioeconomic, and gender stratification in educational outcomes. She is currently working on a book manuscript entitled Why Schools Matter: The Impact of Schools on Children\u2019s Life Chances .  The Other City: New York in Poetry FRSEM-UA 569 Instructor: Tom\u00e1s Urayo\u00e1n Noel   syllabus Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Beyond the touristy New York, there is another city, an immigrant, working-class, bohemian, peripheral, and sometimes even quiet city. This seminar explores this other New York as captured by generations of poets, from Walt Whitman to Garc\u00eda Lorca to Patti Smith and the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. We combine close reading and formal analysis of poetry with visits to specific neighborhoods, sites, and archives (including digital archives). Along the way, we examine the mechanics of writing critically about poetry; explore alternative research tools, such as the field note, the microblog, oral history, and digital humanities project; and use our surroundings as a laboratory to experiment with different kinds of literary observation and analysis. Supplemental readings drawn from history, anthropology, journalism, and literary and cultural studies guide us in our explorations. TOM\u00c1S URAYO\u00c1N NOEL is an Assistant Professor in the Department of English and the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. Before coming to NYU, he taught at SUNY Albany and was a 2011-2012 Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College. He is the author of In Visible Movement: Nuyorican Poetry from the Sixties to Slam , and of various books of poetry in English and Spanish, as well as a contributing editor of Mandorla: New Writing from the Americas .

Also a performance poet, Noel has been featured in New York City venues such as the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church, as well as nationally and internationally.  Literature and Machines FRSEM-UA 572 Instructor: Nicola Cipani   syllabus Wednesday, 2:15-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m. Machine   metaphors play an important role in modern literature, conveying   beliefs, anxieties, shifts, and reflections on key topics, including the   nature of consciousness and creativity; the dynamics of desire and   gratification; gender roles; the organization of society; the meaning of   \"nature\"; and the function of technology. This course explores   different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around   the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the   centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal;   and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines).   Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural   contexts, primarily from the late 19th and 20th century (e.g., Belle   \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of   attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities   to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of   dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion. NICOLA   CIPANI is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Department of Italian   Studies and has been working at NYU for ten years. His interests include   reception of antiquity in medieval and early modern culture,   Renaissance philosophy, the intersection of verbal/ visual forms (such   as the art of memory, emblem books, and representations of dreams), and   20th-century experimental literature. At the Italian Department he has   served in the capacity of Director of Language Programs (since 2005),   Director of Summer Programs (2011-12), and Director of Undergraduate   Studies (2011, 2013).  From Guant\u00e1namo to GITMO: Camps, the U.S., and Comparative Colonialisms in the 20th Century FRSEM-UA 573 Instructor: Monica Kim   syllabus Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) The   concentration camp has become a symbol of 20th century conflicts. In   this seminar, we examine shifts in the global imperial landscape through   a close study of people's experiences of building, living in, and   surviving camps. Rather than approaching the \"camp\" as an exception to   the everyday, we ask: How did the concentration camp develop? When did   societies perceive the need for one? How has decolonization changed (or   not changed) the practices of making a camp? How can the workings of a   particular camp shed light on the contemporaneous political landscape?   And what role does the \"camp\" play in different societies historical   memories? Emphasizing historical connections between the camps we use as   case studies, which may include German camps in 1880s Namibia and   British camps in 1950s Kenya, we begin with the reconcentrado policy of   Spanish colonialism in Cuba in 1880s and end with reflections on the   implications of Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba for US imperialism. Readings   include both historical scholarship and an array of primary sources   (memoirs, oral history interviews, military documents, legal cases and   film). MONICA KIM is Assistant Professor in the Department of   History. Her research and teaching focus on three key issues concerning   the United States vis-\u00e0-vis the world: the relationships between   liberalism and racial formations; global militarism and sovereignty; and   transnational social movements and international law. Her current book   project, Humanity Interrogated , examines mid-20th-century crises around   warfare through a history of military interrogation rooms during the   Korean War. She has been a Fellow at the Penn Humanities Forum at the   University of Pennsylvania and also the University of Chicago.  Spring 2015  The Making of an Iconic Image FRSEM-UA 392 Instructor: Deborah Willis  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30-10:30 a.m. Iconic   images are pictures that become rooted in our personal memory and are   stored away for future reference through our experiences with them.   Often, the power of an iconic image is such that it extends beyond its   original purpose and takes on another form socially and historically.   This seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by   photographers, artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in   addressing the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and   film. Combining historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches to   identity politics and visual culture, it addresses how images are   constructed. Class discussions highlight the trends and transformations   that have characterized the evolution of the iconic image. We use a   series of case studies to explore the construction of beauty and style,   gendered images, race, and pop culture. We also consider issues of   representation, display, and reception, particularly in relation to the   wider social context in which art, music, and culture are experienced in   private and public spaces. In addition to classes held on campus, field   trips are taken to archives, museums and galleries. Each week students   discuss a photograph of their own choice. DEBORAH WILLIS is   University Professor and Chairperson of the Department of Photography   &amp; Imaging at the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU and has an   affiliated appointment with Africana Studies in the Faculty of Arts and   Science. She has pursued a dual professional career as an art   photographer and as one of the nation's leading historians of African   American photography and curator of African American culture. She was a   2005 Guggenheim Fellow and Fletcher Fellow, and a 2000 MacArthur Fellow,   as well as the 1996 recipient of the Anonymous Was a Woman Foundation   Award. Professor Willis has just received the Honored Educator Award at   the Society for Photographic Education. Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber FRSEM-UA 461 Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, 3:30-6:10 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Cao Xueqin's mid-18th century literary epic The Dream of the Red Chamber    is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of   imperial China. With a tragic love story between two aristocratic   teenagers at its dramatic center, it covers a vast terrain of culture   and social life-the question of what is eternal and what is ephemeral;   the nature of \"qing,\" as the heart of being that both animates and   destroys life; individual talent and its fragility; and the decadence of   the elite, as well as growing, if hidden, social and class tensions.   The novel's manifold structure and intricate plot development, coupled   with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes it one of the   most complex and colorful of all time. Note: Both reading and   discussions are conducted in English. No knowledge of Chinese culture,   language, or history is required or assumed. Native Chinese speakers who   wish to read and enjoy this masterpiece in the original language are   advised to choose a different Freshman Seminar and take Reading The   Dream of the Red Chamber (EAST-UA 228) as an elective course in the   future. Consult the CAS Bulletin for prerequisites. JING   WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science   and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she   was Lecturer in Chinese.

In addition to literary   translations, she also publishes personal essays.  Political Cinema and Representation of the \"Other\" FRSEM-UA 463 Instructor: Shimon Dotan Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note:   conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45   p.m.)  In contemporary war, \"the other\" is viewed not only   as an enemy to be fought but often, as one to be eliminated. How do   filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly   representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we   will primarily focus on films from one of the world's most   conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East. We will also explore films from   Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film   screenings, we will investigate how \"the other\" is constructed   politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for   anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary   politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical   questions associated with them. SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the   New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning   filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have   received the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ).

He has taught   filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at   Concordia University in Montreal and is a member of the Directors and   Writers Guilds of America (DGA, WGA). Synesthesia: Intersections of the Visual and Literary Arts FRSEM-UA 490 Instructor: Amy Bonnaffons Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) This course will ask students to engage in both creative and academic writing as they explore the intersections of the visual and literary arts. How have notable writers been influenced and inspired by visual art? How have artists and writers attempted to \u201ctranslate\u201d one art form into the other? What do the literary and visual creative processes have in common, and what can each teach us about the other? We examine these questions through academic study and creative practice. Students visit NYC museums and galleries (the Guggenheim, MoMA, Brooklyn Museum, etc); read work by Kurt Vonnegut, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O\u2019Hara, Anne Sexton, and more; and write poetry, fiction, and essays inspired by visual art. In fall 2013 the class blogged some of its creative writing exercises at http://nyusynesthesia.tumblr.com AMY BONNAFFONS is a language lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. Her writing has appeared in the Wall Street Journal , the New York Daily News , Kenyon Review , Anderbo , and elsewhere, and has won awards from Yale University and Open City Magazine .

Guggenheim Museum titled \u201cResponding to Art Through Creative Writing.\u201d She is a past recipient of NYU\u2019s Graduate Teaching Award for her Introduction to Fiction and Poetry class. She holds a B.A. from Yale and an M.F.A. in Fiction Writing from NYU. Women in Social Movements in Latin America FRSEM-UA 493 Instructor: Pamela Calla  syllabus Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The overarching theme of this seminar is women\u2019s political agency, in terms of emancipatory thought and action, in social movements throughout Latin America. While we locate this agency in specific national contexts, we also look at the rising transnationalism of the movements under scrutiny. More concretely, we focus on indigenous and other popular sectors, as well as the middle class, concentrating on the ways in which women brought new meanings and vitality to diverse forms of struggle. One of our central considerations is the historical relationship between social movements and the state, and the gendered logics that enter into negotiations between the two. We seek to weave together women\u2019s individual and collective thought and action, based on their own notion of what constitutes political and democratic gain, and the struggle for economic, cultural, racial, and gender justice. PAMELA CALLA, an anthropologist, is a Visiting Associate Professor at the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU and Director of the Observatory on Racism of the Universidad de la Cordillera in La Paz, Bolivia. She co-coordinates the \u201cNetwork of Observatories on Racism in the Americas,\u201d a joint initiative of Universidad de la Cordillera and the Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies, University of Texas. Her research focuses on race, gender, ethnicity, and state formation in Bolivia. She coedited Antropolog\u00eda del Estado: Dominaci\u00f3n y pr\u00e1cticas contestatarias en America Latina and Observando el racismo: Racismo y regionalismo en el proceso constituyente boliviano (to which she also contributed), and was an associate researcher of the United Nations Development Project\u2019s \u201cThe State of the State in Bolivia.\u201d  Nuclear Energy FRSEM-UA 512 Instructor: Antoine Cerfon  syllabus Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Nuclear   power currently provides 13% of the world's electricity and is expected   to play an important role in the diversified energy mix that countries   are developing to meet the world's growing energy needs. As a   carbon-free, continuous energy source, it is an attractive solution for   base-load electricity production, and a desirable complement to   intermittent sources such as solar and wind. However, it also faces   serious technological, economical and societal challenges that question   its development. In this seminar, we follow a multidisciplinary approach   to explore the different dimensions of the debate about nuclear power.   We look at the basic nuclear physics in the core of power plants, the   different power plant concepts and their engineering solutions, the   nuclear fuel cycle, the issues of waste, safety and proliferation,   nuclear power economics, and the place of nuclear energy in the global   energy landscape. ANTOINE CERFON is Assistant Professor of   Mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. He   obtained his PhD in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at   MIT, and stayed there for two more years as a post-doctoral researcher   before joining NYU in 2012. His main area of study is in plasma physics   for particle accelerators and nuclear fusion applications.  Encountering Martin Luther King, Jr. FRSEM-UA 519 Instructor: Philip Kunhardt  syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) This   course seeks to remember the human being at the center of the civil   rights movement, which took up the unfinished legacy of the Civil War   and Reconstruction to demand social and racial justice. Students explore   Martin Luther King Jr's thought, oratory, character, and public actions   in a way that makes him unforgettable to them. We consider his   tenaciously held philosophy of nonviolent social change, and his growth   from a southern Baptist minister to a civil rights activist to a   visionary leader of global human rights and peace. In what ways can new   information about his inner conflicts and personal flaws change our   appreciation of his moral stature? And how do we understand him in the   context of his times, amidst fellow activists, adversaries, elected   leaders, and critics during one of the most volatile, freedom-advancing   periods of American history? We consider the lessons of King and his   times for our own vastly changed but still violence-prone and   violence-haunted world. PHILIP KUNHARDT is Distinguished Scholar in Residence in the Humanities,   and teaches history and biography in the College of Arts and Science.   He focuses on the lives of transformative figures and has co-authored   five books, including Looking for Lincoln , The American President , and P.T. Barnum: America's Greatest Showman .   He was also writer and co-producer of more than a dozen documentary   films for PBS, ABC, HBO, Discovery, and others, including the ten-part   PBS series The American President , and the sixteen-part Freedom: A History of US . Before coming to NYU he was a Bard Center Fellow at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. Into the Urban Wild: Nature Writing and the City FRSEM-UA 522 Instructor: Tara K. Parmiter  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). Essayist Loren Eiseley asserts that \"even in New York City there are patches of wilderness,\" encouraging his readers to rethink the way they define and limit their use of this loaded word. In this course we examine both the idea and the manifestation of these wildernesses, questioning the assumptions and the rhetoric we use when talking about the existence, construction, representation, cultivation, or manipulation of nature in our urban environment. We immerse ourselves in classics of American nature writing and then venture into the city, using our texts as lenses for reading such spaces as Central Park, the High Line, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and the American Natural History Museum. Readings include selections by Henry David Thoreau, John Burroughs, Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, Loren Eiseley, Annie Dillard, Terry Tempest Williams, bell hooks, Wendell Berry, and William Cronon, among others. Students compose both critical analyses of the texts and their own nature writing based on their exploration of and research into their own \"patch\" of New York wilderness. TARA K. PARMITER is a Senior Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program and a Mentor in the Undergraduate Writing Tutors Program. Her research interests include literature and the environment, turn-of-the-twentieth century women's literature, children's literature, travel narratives, and popular culture. She has published on topics ranging from the imagined landscapes in L. M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables novels to summer vacationing in Kate Chopin's The Awakening to journey narratives in the Muppet movies. She received her BA from Cornell and her PhD in English and American Literature from NYU.  Cultures of Science and Belief FRSEM-UA 527 Instructor: Noelle J. Mol\u00e9   syllabus Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. We regularly take for granted that scientific knowledge is objective. At the same time, we also know that scientific knowledge is constantly in flux, and that what we \"knew\" to be true yesterday is not true today. This seminar positions science along a spectrum of worldviews-explanatory models that provide causal reasons and underlying logics for events and actions-that includes magic, occultism, witchcraft, science, spirituality, and religion. Within particular historical and cultural contexts, a hurricane might be explained as the result of a witch's curse, a moving cold front, or an angry god. This course questions our deeply held assumptions regarding the neutrality of science and the so-called backwardness of folk belief; as we learn, the threshold between the categories of \"knowledge\" and \"belief\" is actually more blurred than we might initially expect. We explore the social, economic, and political implications of these hierarchies of knowledge, and examine how they shape how we experience our own bodies, our own feelings, and even our own minds. NOELLE J. MOL\u00c9 is a cultural anthropologist and author of Labor Disorders in Neoliberal Italy: Mobbing, Well-being and the Workplace . She is currently investigating the rise of scientific skepticism and supernatural beliefs in Italy as twin responses to a millennial crisis in knowledge production. She is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program.  Sensual Shifts: From Looking to Listening in Modernist Literature FRSEM-UA 529 Instructor: Angela Frattarola  syllabus Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. From Greek philosophy to the Enlightenment, vision was the privileged sense. Traditionally associated with knowledge and rationality, vision encourages a subject to keep a distanced, analytical perspective of an object. But does this always have to be the case? Can the other senses allow new ways of conceiving of and experiencing the relationship between the self and the world? This seminar begins by examining the dominance of vision in modernity and turns to audition as a way of thinking about alternative perceptions of the self and the world. We accomplish this by closely reading modernist novels that suggest a growing skepticism toward vision and heightened attention to sound and listening. In order to think about why modernists brought sound to the forefront of their art, we attempt to gain a sense of the modernist soundscape and the new auditory technologies of the time. Readings for the course consist of essays from sound studies as well as novels by Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson, Jean Rhys, and James Joyce. ANGELA FRATTAROLA is a Senior Lecturer and Writing Tutor Mentor in NYU's Expository Writing Program. Her essays on modernist literature have appeared in such journals as Modern Drama , Genre , Mosaic , Studies in the Novel , Journal of Modern Literature , and Woolf Studies Annual . She has nearly completed a manuscript entitled Auditory Narrative in the Modernist Novel: Early Twentieth-Century Soundscapes and Audio-Technologies , a study that examines how modernist literature was shaped by developing auditory technologies and changes in auditory perception at the turn of the century.  A History of Disbelief FRSEM-UA 548 Instructor: Mitchell Stephens   syllabus Thursday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) This seminar takes up an extended history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of religion). It begins with references to anthropology, the Hebrews and India, before discussing the skeptics and the development of disbelief in Greece and Rome. The course then follows the uneven progress of this idea and its consequences in continental Europe during the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the Romantic period, and in 19th-century England and America, where disbelief was allied with radical politics. Finally, we move on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence of God are considered. However, the main purpose of this course is to force students to confront and grapple with some of the most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief. MITCHELL STEPHENS is Professor of Journalism. His book Imagine There's No Heaven: How Atheism Helped Create the Modern World was recently published by Palgrave. He is also the author of, among other books, the rise of the image the fall of the word and A History of News . His articles on media issues, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and other subjects appeared in the New York Times , Washington Post , Los Angeles Times , and other publications. His current book project is on the future of journalism. Russia: The Rule of Law in Question FRSEM-UA 549 Instructor: Jane Burbank  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30-10:30 a.m. The   popular image of Russia has been shaped by Western and Russian   commentators who bemoan corruption, criminality, and lawlessness as   endemic to Russian life; in this view, the phrase \"Russian law\" would be   an oxymoron. However, in the Russian Federation, law is very much at   work: the legal profession is attracting many students, and the case   loads of Russian courts have grown yearly since the early 1990s. Even in   February 2014, when the Russian military began their invasion of   Crimea, the Russian president asked for the authority to use force. How   can we explain this adherence to legal procedures by Russia's leaders   and citizens, in the context of harsh critiques of Russia's supposed   lawlessness? In this seminar, we explore the history of law in Russia,   how law is used in Russia today; and theories of \"rule of law.\" Our   materials include studies by historians and legal scholars, Russian   literature in translation, media coverage of legal issues, and laws   themselves. Students write short commentaries on their readings, one   book review, and a research paper on one legal case or issue of their   choosing. JANE BURBANK is Collegiate Professor and Professor of   History and Russian and Slavic Studies. After an early focus on Russian   intellectuals' interpretations of the Revolution of 1917, the topic of   her monograph Intelligentsia and Revolution: Russian Views of   Bolshevism, 1917-1922 , she turned to Russian law and to how ordinary   people used it. Her book Russian Peasants Go to Court: Legal Culture in   the Countryside, 1905-1917 reveals that rural people, contrary to   received opinion, were avid litigators. For a glimpse at this study, see   her NYU website: http://www.nyu.edu/projects/burbank/. She is the   co-editor of Russian Empire: Space, People, Power, 1730-1930 , a   collective and international study of Russian empire. Her most recent   book, written with Frederick Cooper, is Empires in World History: Power   and the Politics of Difference . Hybrid Forms: Experiments in the Contemporary Novel FRSEM-UA 551 Instructor: Gabriel Heller  syllabus Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This   course examines an emerging movement in contemporary literature that is   preoccupied with blurring the boundaries between fiction and   non-fiction. We read primarily texts published in the last few years,   originally in English as well as in translation, which, despite their   status as fiction, break into the territory of the memoir and the essay,   blending imagination, autobiography, and essayistic reflection in   challenging and innovative ways. These novels, diverse in both form and   content, share what the writer David Shields has called a \"reality   hunger\"; they seek to confront experience and consciousness more   directly than the conventional forms of the novel allow. As we   investigate this new mode of writing, we inquire deeply into the   relationship between truth and fiction. What kinds of truth do novels   make available to us? How does the novel have to change in order to   encompass our changing ideas of reality? What strategies do contemporary   writers use to get as close as possible to the real grain of   experience?

Globalization and the Modern Novel in English FRSEM-UA 552 Instructor: Jeannie Im   syllabus Thursday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) Over the last century, some of the most significant literature in English has been produced in former British colonies. This course uses key novels in English to explore crucial facets of contemporary globalization. Our novels provide a virtual literary map, moving from the Latin America of Joseph Conrad's Nostromo to the post-independence Nigeria of Ben Okri's and Wole Soyinka's stories; post-apartheid South Africa of Nadine Gordimer's The Pickup ; and South Asia of Amitav Ghosh's The Glass Palace . Our readings are informed by scholarship on issues such as migration and population displacement; urbanization and environmentalism; economic development and political transition; and cosmopolitanism and citizenship. While literature provides the foundation for the course, students are encouraged to develop final research papers relating to their academic interests, such as economics, political science, international relations, or environmental studies. JEANNIE IM is a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. Her research interests include British modernism, postcolonial fiction, globalization, and critical theory. Her work has appeared in Modern Fiction Studies , and she has given numerous conference papers on Virginia Woolf, Samuel Beckett, and Mulk Raj Anand, among others.

Sexuality and Style in Queer Literature FRSEM-UA 553 Instructor: Abigail Joseph Tues, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. We explore the development of gay and lesbian literary styles from around 1890 to 2010\u2014a century of major social and aesthetic shifts. From the secrecy and persecution of Oscar Wilde\u2019s fin-de-si\u00e8cle moment to the protest and celebration of our own more recent one, how have novelists and poets represented identities and desires which fall outside of the norm? What kinds of feelings and relationships, encompassing but moving beyond sex itself, circulate through queer narratives? What modes of aesthetic response and expression characterize what we might call \u201cqueer style\u201d? We will be especially interested not only in how these writers represent the pleasures and struggles of their contemporary social and psychological worlds, but also in how they imagine a set of richly textured relations to historical worlds, both recent and distant. Our authors will likely include Oscar Wilde, Henry James, Virginia Woolf, Christopher Isherwood, James Baldwin, Frank O\u2019Hara, John Rechy, Jeanette Winterson, David Wojnarowicz, and Alison Bechdel. We will supplement our literary texts with forays into the major ideas of queer theory.  ABIGAIL JOSEPH is a Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. She holds a Ph.D. in English from Columbia University and is at work on a book about the relationship between gay male identity and material culture in nineteenth-century England. Her writing on fashion history appears in Public Books , Victorian Studies , and the edited collection Crossings in Text and Textile .  Artificial Intelligence in Film FRSEM-UA 554 Instructor: Megan Shea   syllabus Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00   a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00   a.m.-12:15 p.m.). With IBM's development of Watson, the supercomputer that can beat most people at Jeopardy , we grow ever closer to living in a world where the deep learning capabilities of actual artificial intelligence match those that have been imagined by filmmakers for the past 100 years. This seminar delves into that filmic world wherein androids, cyborgs, and omniscient computers contribute to humankind's charged relationship with the mysterious other. With such movies as Metropolis , Blade Runner , and 2001: A Space Odyssey to document various understandings of this relationship, we also read historical and theoretical literature that explores the passion and violence surrounds these creatures. Students engage not only with the topic of artificial intelligence in film but also with the world of cinema by writing reviews, a short screenplay, and a final research paper. MEGAN SHEA is a Language Lecturer in NYU's Expository Writing Program. She received her PhD in Theater Arts from Cornell University, where she studied women's performance in ancient Greece and the contemporary West. While teaching at Cornell, she received the Gertrude Spencer Student Portfolio Award, and she has received several Excellence in Teaching awards while at NYU. Professor Shea has published articles in The Journal for Dramatic Theory and Criticism and TheatreForum . She recently premiered her translation of Euripides's Cyclops at Dixon Place.  The Self in/as Space FRSEM-UA 555 Instructor: Leeore Schnairsohn Tuesday 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This course examines the relational and spatial underpinnings of our sense of our \"self.\" In order to know ourselves and to act, we must imagine ourselves in space, physical and non-physical, constantly revising the line between \"inside\" and \"outside.\" This course takes us to the limits of our ability to conceive space, looking at literature, film, philosophy, and music that explore the manifold ways we invent, act in and upon, and make use of space to become, know and judge ourselves. Our wide-ranging texts situate us in the cosmos, both medieval and modern (Dante's Divine Comedy and Tarkovsky's Solaris ), the built environment (for example, the elegant Paris of Benjamin's Arcades Project ), and the depths of the unconscious (in the work of Freud and Lacan). LEEORE SCHNAIRSOHN holds a PhD in Comparative Literature from Princeton and is currently a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. His translations of the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam have appeared in Portals and Inventory ; he has also published review articles in the Slavic and East European Journal and in the Canadian-American Slavic Studies . He is at work on a vampire novel and on a non-vampire novel.  Spent Powers: The Culture of Credit and Subjectivities of Indebtedness FRSEM-UA 556 Instructor: Gerard O'Donoghue   syllabus Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. This class asks students to think about the specific ways in which personhood in the United States is defined by one's relationship to capital. How is an individual's political and economic power shaped by access to credit? How does indebtedness alter our sense of selfhood and obligation? We pose these complex questions against the backdrop of the central contradiction in in in American history: that a state whose political and economic foundation integrated chattel slavery also-in contract law-espoused the principle that citizens ought not have the power to contract themselves into peonage, or self-enslavement. We try to understand how credit and debt have been shaped by the legacy of slavery and how they intersect with race and class. As indebtedness becomes the norm, how are the basic assumptions of American democracy challenged? A core of literary texts is supplemented by readings from philosophy and social science. GERARD O'DONOGHUE is a Language Lecturer in NYU'S Expository Writing Program. His interests lie in the fields of 20th- and 21st-century American literature and Irish modernism. He earned his MS and PhD at the University of Oxford for his dissertation The Orphan's Kaddish , and has published in Notes and Queries and Philip Roth Studies . Prior to his current appointment he was a Lecturer in English Literature in the Claremont Consortium and an AHRC Kluge Fellow at the Library of Congress.  Legal Fictions: Storytelling &amp; the Law FRSEM-UA 557 Instructor: Lorraine Doran   syllabus Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. We tell ourselves stories about the law every day - in literature and film, journalistic accounts and internet debates. In this course, we consider the judgments and values beneath those stories, and what relationship they bear to the way stories are told and evaluated by lawyers and judges. We think about how fictional versions of legal ideals transcend the boundaries of the law itself, as well as how the law has evolved in its understanding of our rights and responsibilities. The narratives we examine involve, among other things, civil rights, criminal justice, and civil disobedience. Though these are issues we can (and should) become passionate about, we go beyond the opposing positions, and try to discern what our legal narratives tell us about ourselves and the times we live in. In other words: what do the ways in which we translate legal principles in literature and film, and debate them in the public sphere, tell us about the human condition? With the authors of these texts, we work toward our own definitions of what is just. LORRAINE DORAN is a Senior Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. She holds a JD from NYU School of Law and an MFA in poetry from the NYU Creative Writing Program. As a Visiting Professor of Law at Seton Hall University, she taught a seminar on civil litigation, and supervised students in the Seton Hall Center for Social Justice.

The Rise of the Visual FRSEM-UA 559 Instructor: Trevor Laurence Jockims  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Though   Chinese artists were using the camera obscura\u2014or pinhole camera\u2014as   early as 400 BCE, photography did not emerge until the second half of   the 19th century. This course traces out the peculiar, fascinating,   delayed emergence of photography, and the subsequent explosion of film   and digital media, in an attempt to illuminate what, exactly, the desire   to capture images is, why it emerged when it did, and what it means to   our culture now \u2014 more replete in images than any moment previous. In   order to grasp the meanings of our visual culture, we explore the   literary culture that has challenged, championed, and in many cases   moved forward and made sense of visuality, reading widely in   literature\u2014from Homeric poetry to graphic novels\u2014theory, and philosophy.   TREVOR LAURENCE JOCKIMS teaches in the Expository Writing   Program, where he has won departmental teaching awards every semester.   His scholarly work centers on 20th-century American poetry and its   relationship to visual arts and culture. He has published articles and   book chapters on ekphrastic poetry, photography, the documentary film   essay, pastoral lyric, and representations of war in Eastern European   cinema. His essays and film reviews have appeared in many prominent   publications, including The Times Literary Supplement and the New York   Times ; his fiction has appeared in Descant , Mr. Beller's Neighborhood ,    The Journal of Experimental Fiction , and elsewhere. He received his PhD   in Comparative Literature from The Graduate Center of The City   University of New York. Writers, Notes, and Notebooks FRSEM-UA 562 Instructor: Elaine Freedgood  syllabus Tuesday 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. How   do novelists and poets prepare to write? What is in notes and notebooks   that is not in novels and poems? We begin the term with the   idiosyncratic Preparation of the Novel, by the literary and cultural   critic Roland Barthes, who never wrote a novel, but prepared notes and   notation toward one. We then turn to the novels, poems and notebooks of   other writers, including but not limited to George Eliot, Lorraine   Hansberry, W.H. Auden, and John Ashberry. For some, we have the   opportunity to use collections in archives throughout New York (NYU's   Fales Library, the New York Public Library at 42nd Street, and the   Schomburg Library in Harlem). Students keep two notebooks to present to   the seminar weekly: one in which they annotate a passage of text (with   writing, drawing, collage and other media), and another in which they   record notes and notations toward poems and novels that they may or may   not write. They also write two papers and do one collaborative   presentation. This is a demanding seminar, for students interested in   archival research, very serious reading, and scholarly and creative   writing. ELAINE FREEDGOOD is Professor of English. She is the   author of Victorian Writing about Risk: Imagining a Safe England in a   Dangerous World and The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the   Victorian Novel , and the editor of Factory Production in Victorian   Britain .

Colonizing Creatures: Humans and Other Animals, Past and Present FRSEM-UA 563 Instructor: Zeb Tortorici   syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note:   conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.),   General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) and with   Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.). This   course examines the fraught relations between humans and other animals   in the past and in the present, both locally and globally. Our readings   focus on the ways in which the \"human\" and the \"animal\" have been   defined over time and place, with significant ramifications for all   involved. Topics include medieval and early modern monstrosities;   religious rites; the commodification of animal parts; bestiality and   other violent intimacies; animal domestication and breeding; zoos and   circuses; animal experimentation; debates surrounding \"animal rights\";   museums and taxidermy; pests, rodents, and insects; the rise of animal   protection and anti-cruelty laws; and animal studies as an academic   discipline. In our attempt to engage \"real\" animals\u2014living, sentient   beings\u2014and their archived remnants, we take excursions to the Bronx Zoo,   the American Museum of Natural History, and (if possible) a New   York-based taxidermy studio. ZEB TORTORICI is Assistant   Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and   Literatures at NYU. He received his PhD in History from UCLA. He has   published articles in Ethnohistory , Journal of the History of Sexuality ,   History Compass , e-misf\u00e9rica , and GLQ and chapters in Death and Dying   in Colonial Spanish America , The Human Tradition in Colonial Latin   America , Queer Youth Cultures , and Queer Sex Work .

He is currently completing a book   manuscript on the \"sins against nature\" ( pecados contra natura ) of   sodomy, bestiality, and autoeroticism in New Spain, from 1530 to 1821.  Sonic Art: Sound, Everyday Life, and Aesthetics FRSEM-UA 570 Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman  syllabus Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) Is   our culture increasingly becoming sound- and hearing-oriented and less   attuned to the visual? How would we assess this? And if the answer is   \"yes,\" what are some implications for the creation and appreciation of   music? At the turn of the 20th century, the Italian Futurists responded   to industrialization by valorizing the sounds of factories, machines,   and even war. Can we see a similar relationship in the response of   contemporary composers to internet culture? How are our artificial   musical worlds forging a continuum with sonic aestheticizations of our   everyday environment? Are the domains of musical and sonic aesthetics   intertwined or not; and what are some useful current working   definitions, for sonic art, of the term \"aesthetics\" in the first place?   ELIZABETH HOFFMAN is Professor of Music. She is an   internationally recognized composer of acoustic and computer music, both   fixed media and live processing, and has also published on issues of   representation; narrative; and space and timbre as sonic signifiers in   the Computer Music Journal , Organized Sound , and Perspectives of New   Music . She is a recipient of the Golden Dozen Teaching Award.  Globalism and the International Art Film FRSEM-UA 571 Instructor: Doug Dibbern  syllabus Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required recitation: Monday, 6:00-9:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) This   class studies the contemporary international art film in relation to   debates about nationalism and globalization. These films, screened   mostly at festivals and at small cinemas, tend to be slow and difficult,   telling ugly, painful, and mysterious stories in an unconventional   style as an intentional rejoinder to Hollywood. We spend a lot of our   time analyzing the works of directors such as Bela Tarr, Michal Haneke,   Asghar Farhadi, and Jia Zhang-ke. We also study the history, structure,   and economics of the international film festival circuit, including the   strategies that nations and supranational bodies have embraced to   compete with the major film industries of the world; cultural policy in   the European Union; theories of nationalism and globalization; ideas of   cultural imperialism; and, of course, issues of aesthetics, especially   as they concern the development of a global style. Along the way, we   touch on contemporary politics in a few select countries, with an   emphasis on France, Romania, Iran, and China (including the mainland,   Hong Kong, and Taiwan). Students are required to attend one mandatory   film screening every week in addition to the 2 1/2-hour class. DOUG   DIBBERN earned his PhD in the Cinema Studies Department at NYU and   currently teaches in the Expository Writing Program. He writes film   criticism for The Daily Notebook and has recently published more   academic essays on the directors Fritz Lang and Howard Hawks. His first   book, Hollywood Riots: Violent Crowds and Progressive Politics in   American Film , examines leftist filmmakers working on the fringes of the   Hollywood film industry during the peak years of the Red Scare.  Monotheism and Empire: From Constantine the Great to Genghis Khan FRSEM-UA 574 Instructor: Robert Hoyland  Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m. Though   Jesus said that \"My kingdom is not of this world,\" from the reign of   Constantine the Great (306-37) onwards, Christian emperors portrayed   themselves as protectors and promoters of a very earthly Christian   realm. This had profound consequences: once emperors shared the same   faith as their subjects, it was inevitable that they would seek to shape   and control it, thus setting the stage for a struggle between religion   and politics that has lasted into our own time. We cover the period   between Constantine's reign and that of the Mongol emperor Genghis Khan   and his successors in the thirteenth century, who faced the difficult   decision of whether to give up their ancestral cult and adopt an alien   monotheist creed so as to become rulers in Constantine's mold. In   between these turning points, Muslim rulers (caliphs) and European   monarchs tried and eventually failed in their attempt to control   religion in their realms. We explore the links between monotheism and   empire in varied religious traditions: Christian, Muslim, Jewish, and   Zoroastrian. ROBERT HOYLAND is Professor of Late Antique and   Early Islamic Middle Eastern History at the Institute for the Study of   the Ancient World at NYU. Prior to coming to ISAW, he was Professor of   Islamic History at the University of Oxford, where he earned his DPhil   in 1994. His books include Seeing Islam as Others Saw It: A Survey and   Analysis of the Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian Writings on Islam ;   Arabia and the Arabs from the Bronze Age to the Coming of Islam ; and    Theophilus of Edessa's Chronicle and the Circulation of Historical   Knowledge in Late Antiquity and Early Islam . He is involved in the   Oxford excavation of Androna/al-Andarin in Syria. He was both a   Fulbright and Erasmus Scholar, at Princeton and Groningen, respectively.    The Art of Magic FRSEM-UA 575 Instructor: Christopher Stahl   syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) Jean   Eugene Robert-Houdin, the universally recognized father of modern stage   magic, once famously remarked that \"a magician is an actor playing the   part of a magician,\" suggesting that there is some sort of unique   cultural role that the magician might have to play. The topic of this   seminar is magic\u2014not as an anthropological or supernatural phenomenon,   but as an artistic stage practice with its own aesthetic history and   values. How do certain tricks and illusions stage the cultural and   philosophical issues of the day? Beginning with texts like Reginald   Scott's The Discoverie of Witchcraft (used by Shakespeare as a source   for many plays), students explore critical theories about wonder and   enchantment as well as read sources that range from books of magic   tricks to the memoirs of noted stage conjurors. We also examine stage   magic's relation to other art forms, including theatre, photography,   cinema, sculpture, and video and performance art. CHRISTOPHER   STAHL is a Senior Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at   New York University, where he was recently recognized for a decade of   teaching service. He has been a longtime Faculty Affiliate with NYU's   Residential College, currently leading a student community interested in   exploring the link between the history of urban development in NYC and   social/cultural issues. He has published several essays on vaudeville   magic, and his work on turn-of-the-century Chinese conjuring was   published in the critical anthology Performing Magic on the Western   Stage . His writing has also appeared in The Village Voice , Theatre   Journal , and Women &amp; Performance , and in the anthology Bend Don't   Shatter: Poets on the Beginning of Desire . The Literature of Capitalism FRSEM-UA 576 Instructor: Thomas Easton  syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30-1:45 p.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.) This course explores how some of the most enduring themes in literature, such as greed, ambition, failure, innovation, prosperity, and opportunity, are reflected in literature about capitalism. Readings are likely to include works by eighteenth-century English essayist Samuel Johnson; children\u2019s book author Horatio Alger and novelist Mark Twain; and contemporary Chinese memoirist Aisling Juanjuan Shen. The nature of property rights, subtle distinctions between success and crime, and the relative value of diligence and luck are other themes we consider. Our discussions about characters and stories are informed by work in economics, ranging from Adam Smith\u2019s writings on productivity and ethics to Thomas Piketty\u2019s writings on income inequality. Weekly essays assigned. THOMAS EASTON is American finance editor at the Economist, where he previously worked as New York and Hong Kong bureau chief.
