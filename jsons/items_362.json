The Center does this by promoting collaboration among those FAS departments and programs which focus, in whole or in part, on antiquity and its reception in the modern world. These include Ancient Near Eastern and Egyptian Studies , Anthropology , Art History , Classics , Comparative Literature , English , Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies , Philosophy , Religious Studies , the Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies , and the Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies .
