What\u2019s possible? Is free will physically possible? Is time travel metaphysically possible?     In virtue of what do objects and persons retain their identity throughout time, if they do? (Spoiler: They do.)     Can we prove that God exists? Can we prove that it doesn\u2019t?     How much money should you give to charity, and why??

To a remarkable extent, these two centuries of philosophical thought are distinctively responsible for many of the questions, methods, and theoretical approaches that still quite recognizably dominate philosophy today. This course will examine the most important contributions of seven influential and systematic modern philosophers of this period--Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant--to the fields of epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of science, philosophy of religion, and ethics.      Sign up for one of the following sections:        Daniel Fogal: Friday 8:00-9:15 and 9:30-10:45   Joe Harper: Friday 12:30-1:45 and 2:00-3:15        PHIL-UA 39   Recent Continental Philosophy   T/TH 2-3:15   John Richardson      Prerequisite: one Introductory course    Examines selected works by some of the major figures in German and French philosophy in the second half of the 20th century. Beginning with later Heidegger, the course will go on to treat Gadamer, Habermas, Lacan, Foucault, Derrida, and Deleuze.      Sign up for one of the following sections:        Chris Prodoehl: Thursday 3:30-4:45 and Friday 12:30-1:45   Emilio Mora: Friday 11:00-12:15 and 2:00-3:15        PHIL-UA 101   Topics in History of Philosophy   W 2-4:30   Anthony Kronman      Prerequisite: PHIL-UA 20 or PHIL-UA 21           In an autobiographical essay written two years after the publication of Beyond Good and Evil , Nietzsche describes the latter book as \u201cin every essential a critique of modernity.\u201d How, in Nietzsche\u2019s view, does the modern age differ from those that preceded it? What is his \u201ccritique\u201d of it? In this seminar, we will explore these questions, paying special attention to the ideas of art, nobility, power, truth and morality, as these figure in the remarkable series of books that Nietzsche wrote in the last three years before his mind was closed by madness. Some attention will also be paid to Nietzsche\u2019s unpublished notebooks from this period, and to the question of whether, despite his ferocious attack on what he calls the \u201cprejudices\u201d of \u201cmetaphysicians,\u201d Nietzsche was not himself, in the end, a metaphysician too.         Group II: Ethics, Value, and Society        PHIL-UA 40   Ethics   T/Th 9:30&ndash;10:45   David Velleman      Prerequisite: one Introductory course    This course covers three great works of moral philosophy: Aristotle&rsquo;s Nicomachean Ethics, Kant&rsquo;s Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, and Mill's Utlitarianism. It concludes with a contemporary work that applies moral philosophy to 20th-century history : Hannah Arendt&rsquo;s Eichmann in Jerusalem. Course requirements are: attendance at lectures and a recitation, five short papers and a final exam.      Sign up for one of the following sections:        Melis Erdur: Thursday 12:30-1:45pm and 2:00-3:15pm   Bogdan Rabanca: Friday 11-12:15 and 12:30-1:45        PHIL-UA 41   The Nature of Values   T/TH 2-3:15   Sharon Street      Prerequisite: one Introductory course    The course\u2019s central question will be the nature of value and where to \u201cplace\u201d it with respect to our scientific conception of the world. On the one hand, we regard ourselves as capable of recognizing, and being guided in our thought and action by, evaluative truths\u2014truths concerning how there is most reason to live, what there is most reason to believe, what ways of life are good, valuable, morally required, and so on. On the other hand, we regard ourselves as part of the world of cause and effect\u2014as beings whose evaluative states of mind are part of the natural order and subject to scientific study and explanation. It is not obvious how to fit these two understandings of ourselves together, nor even whether they are jointly tenable in the end. Are there objective truths about what is good and bad, moral and immoral? Is it possible to understand evaluative truths such as \u201chappiness is good\u201d on the model of scientific truths such as \u201cwater is H2O\u201d? Or is the subject matter of evaluative discourse very different from that of scientific discourse? Do evaluative claims amount to nothing more than sophisticated ways of saying \u201cboo\u201d and \u201chooray\u201d about the things we happen to like and dislike? The course will survey some of the most prominent contemporary thinking on these questions. Readings will include works by Moore, Ayer, Mackie, Railton, Sturgeon, Nagel, Blackburn, Gibbard, Korsgaard, and others.      Sign up for one of the following sections:        Jared Warren: Friday 12:30-1:45 and 2:00-3:15        PHIL-UA 50   Medical Ethics   M/W 2-3:15   Colin O\u2019Neil      This course will examine ethical issues arising out of medicine and bioethics. We will begin by surveying normative theories such as consequentialism and deontology. We will then explore topics such as informed consent, the right to refuse treatment, paternalism in public health, euthanasia, advance directives, conscientious objection in medicine, animal experimentation, abortion, rights to health care, allocation of scarce medical resources, human subjects research, and drug patents. By the end of the course, students will have learned how to analyze and evaluate philosophical arguments in bioethics.     PHIL-UA 102   Topics in Ethics and Political Philosophy   T/TH 4:55-6:10   Peter Unger      Prerequisite: PHIL-UA 40, PHIL-UA 41, or PHIL-UA 45    Even as compared to what he or she can do, almost all well-to-do people do little, or nothing, over the course of their lifetime, to prevent the early deaths and great suffering of people in the poorest parts of the world. Is it wrong for a well-to-do person to behave like this - perhaps about as horribly wrong as committing negligent homicide, as with fatal drunken driving? The course will center on this question, though it will also involve us in many other moral questions. In about equal measure, this will be a course in both normative ethics and in applied ethics. (By contrast, little will be said about metaethics and, most likely, not much about political philosophy, either.)          Group III: Metaphysics, Epistemology, Mind, Language, and Logic      PHIL-UA 70-001   Logic   MW 11-12:15   Daniela Dover        PHIL-UA 70-002   Logic   M/W 12:30-1:45   Grace Helton        PHIL-UA 70-003   Logic   T/TH 11-12:15   Michael Schweiger        Introduces the techniques, results, and philosophical import of 20th century formal logic. Principal concepts include those of sentence, set, interpretation, validity, consistency, consequence, tautology, derivation, and completeness. This course satisfies the logic requirement for NYU Philosophy majors.      PHIL-UA 73   Set Theory   T/TH 12:30-1:45   Kit Fine      Prerequisite: PHIL-UA 70    The course will cover the basics of set theory. The required text is \u2018Introduction to Set Theory\u2019 by Jech and Hrbacek (3rd edition), Chapman and Hall (available from NYU bookstore). We will more or less go though the chapters of the book in order. Among the topics to be covered are: the axioms of set theory; Boolean operations on sets; set-theoretic representation of   relations, functions and orderings; the natural numbers; theory of transfinite cardinal and ordinal numbers; the axiom of choice and its equivalents; and the foundations of analysis. If time permits we may also consider some more advanced topics, such as large cardinals or the independence results.    The emphasis will be on the technical material, although there will also be some philosophical discussion. Students will be required to do exercises each week. Roughly half of these assignments will be handed in and graded. Each week there will be a review section run by the TA, Olla Solomyak. There will be a mid-term exam and a final exam. The two exams will count for 20% and 30% of the final grade, respectively, the assignment for 50%.       The course will start from scratch; no background in mathematics or logic is strictly required. However, a background in logic will be helpful; and a certain degree of technical sophistication will be essential.    Sign up for one of the following sections:        Olla Solomyak: Thursday 4:55-6:10 and Friday 11-12:15        PHIL-UA 76   Epistemology   M/W 3:30-4:45   Tim Maudlin      Prerequisite: one Introductory course    This class will focus on skepticism and responses to skeptical arguments through the history of philosophy. We will discuss general skeptical arguments and particular difficulties about our knowledge of the external world and our use of induction. From the ancient period, will we read parts of Sextus Empiricus\u2019 Outlines of Pyrrhonism and Plato\u2019s Meno. From the early modern period we will read Descartes\u2019 Meditations and parts of Hume\u2019s A Treatise on Human Nature. From the 20th century we will read Moore\u2019s \u201cProof of an External World\u201d, Wittgenstein\u2019s On Certainty and parts of Goodman\u2019s Fact, Fiction and Forecast.    Sign up for one of the following sections:        Jeremy Dolan: Thursday 11-12:15 and 12:30-1:45          PHIL-UA 80   Philosophy of Mind   MW 4:55-6:10   Thomas Nagel      Prerequisite: one Introductory course    The course will concentrate on the recent history of debate over the mind-body problem in the analytic literature. The problem is this: How are mental phenomena such as feeling, perception, thought, and desire related to the physical world, especially to brains and behavior? Can mental phenomena be identified with physical phenomena, or analyzed in physical terms, or does their existence imply that there is more to reality than can be accounted for by the physical sciences?    Sign up for one of the following sections:        Mark Vandevelde: Monday 12:30-1:45 and 2-3:15   Yu Go: Friday 12:30-1:45 and 2-3:15          PHIL-UA 85   Philosophy of Language   M/W 11-12:15   Crispin Wright       Prerequisite: one Introductory course    This course will concentrate on a small number of central questions in recent and contemporary philosophy of language. Some familiarity with elementary formal logic may be helpful. Topics to be covered include skepticism about meaning, with special reference to writings of Quine and Kripke; the nature of knowledge of a language, with special reference to the work of Davidson and Dummett; and the competing paradigms of singular reference deriving from Frege and from Kripke. Grades will be awarded on the basis of two mid-term papers, and a take-home final exam.    Sign up for one of the following sections:        Max Barkhausen: Thursday 9:30-10:45 and 11:00-12:15      PHIL-UA 90   Philosophy of Science   M/W 9:30-10:45   Michael Strevens      Prerequisite: one Introductory course    What is science? How does it work? When it works, what kind of knowledge does it provide? Is there a scientific method? What is a scientific theory? How do experiments provide evidence for theories? What is the nature of scientific explanation? How does the social organization of science contribute, if at all, to its success?      PHIL-UA 104   Topics in Mind and Language   M/W 12:30-1:45   James Stazicker      Prerequisite: PHIL-UA 70 and PHIL-UA 80, PHIL-UA 81, or PHIL-UA 85    We will pursue some questions in the philosophy of perception. First we will ask in what sense, if any, perceptual experience is immediate awareness of the world. We will assess the traditional Argument from Illusion, and various responses to it. Then we will ask what distinguishes the different sensory modalities from one another, and explore some structural differences between experiences of space in vision, touch and hearing. We will assess a related question which William Molyneux famously asked Locke: Would a man born blind, who has learned to discriminate a cube from a sphere by touch, and then becomes able to see, be able to discriminate them by sight? Finally we will ask in what way, if any, perceptual experience is a distinctive source of knowledge. Here we will engage with empirical evidence that perception is cognitively penetrated \u2013 that what we perceive depends on what we believe.

What are sonnets trying to do? Who is speaking, and to whom? How does the form of the sonnet\u2014its rhyme scheme, metre, and the set of rhetorical expectations it engenders\u2014enable rather than constrict forms of passionate expression and persuasion. Why should we still be interested in this strange form today? What invites us to imagine ourselves as the speaker or recipient of the sonnets powerful speech acts? Why does it continue to speak to us, not only about love, desire, and the force of argument, but also of language itself? This course will examine the language of the sonnets of Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser and William Shakespeare from the perspective of a variety of philosophers and theorists who have had a significant impact on literary criticism, including Plato, Locke, Saussure, Benveniste, Bakhtin, Wittgenstein, Austin, Derrida and Lacan. It aims to reveal the continuing power of the sonnet in the twenty-first century, and its abiding influence in our discourses of desire, love and personal identity.

What\u2019s possible? Is free will physically possible? Is time travel metaphysically possible?     In virtue of what do objects and persons retain their identity throughout time, if they do?

To a remarkable extent, these two centuries of philosophical thought are distinctively responsible for many of the questions, methods, and theoretical approaches that still quite recognizably dominate philosophy today. This course will examine the most important contributions of seven influential and systematic modern philosophers of this period--Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant--to the fields of epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of science, philosophy of religion, and ethics.

What is his \u201ccritique\u201d of it? In this seminar, we will explore these questions, paying special attention to the ideas of art, nobility, power, truth and morality, as these figure in the remarkable series of books that Nietzsche wrote in the last three years before his mind was closed by madness. Some attention will also be paid to Nietzsche\u2019s unpublished notebooks from this period, and to the question of whether, despite his ferocious attack on what he calls the \u201cprejudices\u201d of \u201cmetaphysicians,\u201d Nietzsche was not himself, in the end, a metaphysician too.         Group II: Ethics, Value, and Society        PHIL-UA 40   Ethics   T/Th 9:30&ndash;10:45   David Velleman      Prerequisite: one Introductory course    This course covers three great works of moral philosophy: Aristotle&rsquo;s Nicomachean Ethics, Kant&rsquo;s Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, and Mill's Utlitarianism. It concludes with a contemporary work that applies moral philosophy to 20th-century history : Hannah Arendt&rsquo;s Eichmann in Jerusalem.

On the one hand, we regard ourselves as capable of recognizing, and being guided in our thought and action by, evaluative truths\u2014truths concerning how there is most reason to live, what there is most reason to believe, what ways of life are good, valuable, morally required, and so on. On the other hand, we regard ourselves as part of the world of cause and effect\u2014as beings whose evaluative states of mind are part of the natural order and subject to scientific study and explanation. It is not obvious how to fit these two understandings of ourselves together, nor even whether they are jointly tenable in the end. Are there objective truths about what is good and bad, moral and immoral? Is it possible to understand evaluative truths such as \u201chappiness is good\u201d on the model of scientific truths such as \u201cwater is H2O\u201d? Or is the subject matter of evaluative discourse very different from that of scientific discourse? Do evaluative claims amount to nothing more than sophisticated ways of saying \u201cboo\u201d and \u201chooray\u201d about the things we happen to like and dislike? The course will survey some of the most prominent contemporary thinking on these questions. Readings will include works by Moore, Ayer, Mackie, Railton, Sturgeon, Nagel, Blackburn, Gibbard, Korsgaard, and others.      Sign up for one of the following sections:        Jared Warren: Friday 12:30-1:45 and 2:00-3:15        PHIL-UA 50   Medical Ethics   M/W 2-3:15   Colin O\u2019Neil      This course will examine ethical issues arising out of medicine and bioethics. We will begin by surveying normative theories such as consequentialism and deontology. We will then explore topics such as informed consent, the right to refuse treatment, paternalism in public health, euthanasia, advance directives, conscientious objection in medicine, animal experimentation, abortion, rights to health care, allocation of scarce medical resources, human subjects research, and drug patents. By the end of the course, students will have learned how to analyze and evaluate philosophical arguments in bioethics.     PHIL-UA 102   Topics in Ethics and Political Philosophy   T/TH 4:55-6:10   Peter Unger      Prerequisite: PHIL-UA 40, PHIL-UA 41, or PHIL-UA 45    Even as compared to what he or she can do, almost all well-to-do people do little, or nothing, over the course of their lifetime, to prevent the early deaths and great suffering of people in the poorest parts of the world. Is it wrong for a well-to-do person to behave like this - perhaps about as horribly wrong as committing negligent homicide, as with fatal drunken driving? The course will center on this question, though it will also involve us in many other moral questions. In about equal measure, this will be a course in both normative ethics and in applied ethics. (By contrast, little will be said about metaethics and, most likely, not much about political philosophy, either.)          Group III: Metaphysics, Epistemology, Mind, Language, and Logic      PHIL-UA 70-001   Logic   MW 11-12:15   Daniela Dover        PHIL-UA 70-002   Logic   M/W 12:30-1:45   Grace Helton        PHIL-UA 70-003   Logic   T/TH 11-12:15   Michael Schweiger        Introduces the techniques, results, and philosophical import of 20th century formal logic. Principal concepts include those of sentence, set, interpretation, validity, consistency, consequence, tautology, derivation, and completeness. This course satisfies the logic requirement for NYU Philosophy majors.      PHIL-UA 73   Set Theory   T/TH 12:30-1:45   Kit Fine      Prerequisite: PHIL-UA 70    The course will cover the basics of set theory. The required text is \u2018Introduction to Set Theory\u2019 by Jech and Hrbacek (3rd edition), Chapman and Hall (available from NYU bookstore). We will more or less go though the chapters of the book in order. Among the topics to be covered are: the axioms of set theory; Boolean operations on sets; set-theoretic representation of   relations, functions and orderings; the natural numbers; theory of transfinite cardinal and ordinal numbers; the axiom of choice and its equivalents; and the foundations of analysis. If time permits we may also consider some more advanced topics, such as large cardinals or the independence results.    The emphasis will be on the technical material, although there will also be some philosophical discussion. Students will be required to do exercises each week. Roughly half of these assignments will be handed in and graded. Each week there will be a review section run by the TA, Olla Solomyak. There will be a mid-term exam and a final exam. The two exams will count for 20% and 30% of the final grade, respectively, the assignment for 50%.       The course will start from scratch; no background in mathematics or logic is strictly required. However, a background in logic will be helpful; and a certain degree of technical sophistication will be essential.    Sign up for one of the following sections:        Olla Solomyak: Thursday 4:55-6:10 and Friday 11-12:15        PHIL-UA 76   Epistemology   M/W 3:30-4:45   Tim Maudlin      Prerequisite: one Introductory course    This class will focus on skepticism and responses to skeptical arguments through the history of philosophy. We will discuss general skeptical arguments and particular difficulties about our knowledge of the external world and our use of induction. From the ancient period, will we read parts of Sextus Empiricus\u2019 Outlines of Pyrrhonism and Plato\u2019s Meno. From the early modern period we will read Descartes\u2019 Meditations and parts of Hume\u2019s A Treatise on Human Nature. From the 20th century we will read Moore\u2019s \u201cProof of an External World\u201d, Wittgenstein\u2019s On Certainty and parts of Goodman\u2019s Fact, Fiction and Forecast.    Sign up for one of the following sections:        Jeremy Dolan: Thursday 11-12:15 and 12:30-1:45          PHIL-UA 80   Philosophy of Mind   MW 4:55-6:10   Thomas Nagel      Prerequisite: one Introductory course    The course will concentrate on the recent history of debate over the mind-body problem in the analytic literature. The problem is this: How are mental phenomena such as feeling, perception, thought, and desire related to the physical world, especially to brains and behavior? Can mental phenomena be identified with physical phenomena, or analyzed in physical terms, or does their existence imply that there is more to reality than can be accounted for by the physical sciences?    Sign up for one of the following sections:        Mark Vandevelde: Monday 12:30-1:45 and 2-3:15   Yu Go: Friday 12:30-1:45 and 2-3:15          PHIL-UA 85   Philosophy of Language   M/W 11-12:15   Crispin Wright       Prerequisite: one Introductory course    This course will concentrate on a small number of central questions in recent and contemporary philosophy of language. Some familiarity with elementary formal logic may be helpful. Topics to be covered include skepticism about meaning, with special reference to writings of Quine and Kripke; the nature of knowledge of a language, with special reference to the work of Davidson and Dummett; and the competing paradigms of singular reference deriving from Frege and from Kripke. Grades will be awarded on the basis of two mid-term papers, and a take-home final exam.    Sign up for one of the following sections:        Max Barkhausen: Thursday 9:30-10:45 and 11:00-12:15      PHIL-UA 90   Philosophy of Science   M/W 9:30-10:45   Michael Strevens      Prerequisite: one Introductory course    What is science? How does it work? When it works, what kind of knowledge does it provide? Is there a scientific method? What is a scientific theory? How do experiments provide evidence for theories? What is the nature of scientific explanation? How does the social organization of science contribute, if at all, to its success?      PHIL-UA 104   Topics in Mind and Language   M/W 12:30-1:45   James Stazicker      Prerequisite: PHIL-UA 70 and PHIL-UA 80, PHIL-UA 81, or PHIL-UA 85    We will pursue some questions in the philosophy of perception. First we will ask in what sense, if any, perceptual experience is immediate awareness of the world. We will assess the traditional Argument from Illusion, and various responses to it. Then we will ask what distinguishes the different sensory modalities from one another, and explore some structural differences between experiences of space in vision, touch and hearing. We will assess a related question which William Molyneux famously asked Locke: Would a man born blind, who has learned to discriminate a cube from a sphere by touch, and then becomes able to see, be able to discriminate them by sight? Finally we will ask in what way, if any, perceptual experience is a distinctive source of knowledge. Here we will engage with empirical evidence that perception is cognitively penetrated \u2013 that what we perceive depends on what we believe.
