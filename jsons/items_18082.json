The course will explore marketing techniques that apply across the entertainment companies, including licensing, sponsorships and promotion. Case studies and project work will be included.          Course Objectives     To provide students with a framework through case studies, lectures and readings of the critical marketing problems and opportunities for some of the most important companies within key sectors of the entertainment industry.

Length -      It is recommended that you follow a basic proposal or report format or a style book to present your work in a polished and professional manner.      Please take time to organize your work so that it is clear and concise. Your opening statement should be an introduction which states what your objective is and what you&#39;re going to discuss. The main body should present your findings in a logical and straight-forward way. Summarize your findings or recommendations at the end in a conclusion . Break up your work into subheadings .      Make sure that your work is proofread and edited . You should ask a friend, colleague, or co-worker to help you with this. Your final draft should be free of errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar; having someone else proofread is the most effective way to do this.      Some of you may want to use your work as a tool to help you in your career planning.
