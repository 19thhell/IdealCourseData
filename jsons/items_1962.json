The participants will explain why they formed a Panther Party, what was their inspiration, what were they rebelling against, what were they up against in their respective countries, and how did they hear about and create a bound of solidarity with the US Black Panthers. The idea is to provide students, scholars and the general audience with an opportunity to be exposed to an international oral history, archives, and memories that are not widely known and associated with the history of the Black Panthers in America. Additionally, the roundtable will also explore the links between the struggle for justice then and now.
