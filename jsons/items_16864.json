Pre-req: CHIN-SHU 302                                                                    Intro to Business Chinese - CHIN-SHU 411 - 4 points                               This course is designed for those who have studied Mandarin to the intermedia high or advanced level (or equivalent). The main goal of the course is to continuously enhance students\u2019 Chinese proficiency while, at the same time, preparing them for working more comfortably and confidently in a Chinese business environment. In recent years, along with the rapid growth of Chinese economy, issues on Chinese business and economy became a hot topic. Following this trend, the course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding of the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course will cover the first five chapters of the textbook which is developed surrounding five real-life business cases. These five companies are all multinational that have successfully operated in China by adapting their strategies to the special needs of the Chinese market. By reading, discussing, and performing communicative tasks related to those cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d, thus acquiring a better understanding of China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. The case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business within China.\u201d    In order to enhance students\u2019 understanding of the business cases, clips of the selected television interviews and talk shows will be used to accomplish the following four goals: First, the content of the textbook and the background information offered by the supplementary media materials complement each other. Second, key terms and expressions in the textbook will be repeated in the learning process to help students reinforce the knowledge. Third, in terms of cross-usage between colloquial and written language, students will have the opportunity to supplement their reading of written texts with the experience of watching television shows on the same or similar topics, which may help them understand the distinctions between the two language styles and accurately utilize both language registers to express their own ideas in different settings. Fourth, the authentic visual materials can help close the gap between pedagogy and the real world, most effectively enabling students to become familiar with all varieties of Chinese accents, \u2013 including those of Hong Kong, Taiwan and even foreigners speaking Chinese \u2013 thereby strengthening students\u2019 abilities of practical application in the real world. In order to expand and update students\u2019 knowledge on various business-related issues, in addition to the business case 2 analysis, supplementary listening, reading, writing exercises will also be provided in class. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues; discussion of Chinese business laws, translation of business terms and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China or Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) expand business vocabulary and strengthen the communication skills in real business settings; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about China and the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of authentic Chinese media materials; (4) improve reading, writing and translation skills of business terminologies and documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes. Class will be conducted in Chinese. Prerequisite: Consent of Instructor and Advanced Chinese language.                                                                      Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from the Real World - CHIN-SHU 429 or BUSF-SHU 188                               The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201dIn addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.  Class will be conducted in Chinese. Permission of Instructor required.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

Business and Finance                                                  Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from the Real World - CHIN-SHU 429 or BUSF-SHU 188                               The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201dIn addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.  Class will be conducted in Chinese. Permission of Instructor required.

Managerial Skills - MGMT-SHU 21 - 3 points                               Many companies bestow a management title on key talent and expect appropriate behavior to follow. That is not the most effective way to develop future business leaders. Your expertise will take you just so far. Increasing self-awareness and being open to feedback are important first steps in leading today's business for tomorrow's results. DEVELOPING MANAGEMENT SKILLS is a course that focuses primarily on the practical aspects of managing. This course is highly interactive and, while based on solid research, it stresses a hands-on approach to improving your management skills. The focus is on developing:   Your Personal Skills: self-awareness; managing stress; solving problems &amp; creativity  What behaviors help or get in your way as you strive for personal/professional success?  How do your values influence your decisions and problem-solving approaches?  How do your learning styles help or hinder how you handle ethical dilemmas?, etc.)  Your Interpersonal Skills: coaching; counseling; supportive communication; gaining power &amp; influence; motivating self &amp; others; managing conflict  Your Group Skills: empowering &amp; delegating; building teams, leading change, running meetings.  Each session will give you an opportunity to \u201cassess\u201d, \u201canalyze\u201d, \u201cpractice\u201d, \u201clearn\u201d, \u201cteach\u201d, and \u201capply\u201d the above skills to your own work or life situation so that you can turn good ideas into effective practice. You will not only learn about management skills but you will begin to apply those skills in class, at work, at home, etc., to help you become a more effective business leader. This is not the course for you, if you prefer classes where you can sit passively by and be an &quot;academic tourist&quot;.  In the self-assessment step you assess your own skills in the topic under discussion. Usually, these will be at the beginning of each chapter. Class lectures and discussions will involve such topics as: self-awareness, creative problem-solving, communication, stress management, gaining power, motivating others, managing conflict, empowering others, giving and receiving feedback, delegating, and team building, etc...not necessarily in that order. You will analyze, write about, practice and apply these topics through case studies, group exercises, and being responsible to teach some topics to the class.   NOTE: We will NOT be reading each chapter in class. The text is YOUR resource to use as we go along as a starting point. Use it. We will seldom refer to it during class. It can serve as the basis for class discussion and reflection. However, it is not to be considered the only resource available to you. This is your opportunity to explore these topics through outside sources, including but not limited to professional and popular journals/books/organizations, Human Resources professionals, web sites, etc. Your chance to network beyond your comfort zone!  You will be required to keep a journal/log from day one. A self-awareness journal allows you to keep track of the issues that help or get in the way of your career/management goals and the action-steps you take to achieve them. This will be especially important for your final project. You will be required to hand in a one-page summary of highlights about \u00be of the way through the course.  A secondary goal is to provide you an opportunity to develop your skills in critical thinking, oral and written communication, and your ability to influence others through rational and creative approaches. Therefore, at the end of this course you will be able to:  Demonstrate your understanding and competence with respect to fundamental managerial skills: Self-awareness, stress management, creative problem solving, supportive communication, gaining power and influence, motivating others, managing conflict, building effective teams, etc.  Analyze, develop, practice, and demonstrate your ability to use these fundamental personal, interpersonal and team building skills through self-assessments, textbook learning, cases, experiential exercises, written application exercises and a final paper.

Prerequisite: CSCI-101                                Cultural Foundations                                                  Masters of Asian Cinema - CCCF-SHU 129 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the basic concepts and methods in film studies by focusing on a select number of eminent auteurs in Asian cinemas. Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.                              Economics                                                    Principles of Macroeconomics - ECON-SHU 1 - 4 points                               Focuses on the economy as a whole (the &quot;macroeconomy&quot;). Begins with the meaning and measurement of important macroeconomic data (on unemployment, inflation, and production), then turns to the behavior of the overall economy. Topics include long-run economic growth and the standard of living; the causes and consequences of economic booms and recessions; the banking system and the Federal Reserve; the stock and bond markets; and the role of government policy.                                                                      Principles of Microeconomics - ECON-SHU 2 - 4 points                               Focuses on individual economic decision-makers\u2014households, business firms, and government agencies\u2014and how they are linked together. The emphasis is on decision making by households and firms and how these decisions shape our economic life. Explores the different environments in which businesses sell their products, hire workers, and raise funds to expand their operations; the economic effects of trade between nations; and the effects of various government policies, such as minimum-wage legislation, rent controls, antitrust laws, and more.                                                                    Intermediate Microeconomics - ECON-SHU 10 - 4 points                               Rigorous examination of consumer choice, profit-maximizing behavior on the part of firms, and equilibrium in product markets. Topics include choice under uncertainty, strategic interactions between firms in noncompetitive environments, intertemporal decision making, and investment in public goods. Prerequisites: Principles of Microeconomics or Microeconomics for Business or for students who entered NYU-SH pre Fall 2015 Microeconomics and either Calculus or Mathematics for Economics.                              Global China Studies                                                  The Concept of China - GCHN-SHU 110 - 4 points                               From the Warring States period to the present, what have Chinese and others understood to be the meaning of \u201cChina,\u201d and what have been the broad implications of this understanding? This course is divided into four chronological periods: Antiquity\u2014from the period of the \u2018central kingdoms\u2019 to the formation of the early empire; Middle Period\u2014China Among Equals; Early Modern: 1350-1910\u2014China, Global Trade, and Imperialism; Modern: 1910-present\u2014China Redux                                History                                                  China Encounters the World - HIST-SHU 312 - 4 points                               This is a lecture course on China\u2019s encounters with the world in the late 19th and 20th centuries. The course analyzes the age-old Chinese \u201cCentral Kingdom\u201d self-image and how the image was overturned during modern times in face of Western and Japanese challenges; it explores the Chinese \u201cvictim mentality\u201d and its impact on China\u2019s modern international experience; it examines China\u2019s foreign policy issues in the context of its political, economic, social and cultural developments in broader terms; it also pays special attention to the role of \u201chuman agencies\u201d in the shaping of historical processes.                                                                    The New Cold War History - HIST-SHU 325 - 4 points                               This is a reading and research seminar with an emphasis on the \u201cnew \u201cCold War history\u2014a scholarly phenomenon emerging in the 1990s, along with the end of the global Cold War and the new opportunities to conduct multiarchival and mutli-source research for scholars of international history. Students in this class will be exposed to various new interpretations, new methods of research, and new ways of thinking associated with the new Cold War history studies. Readings in this class will be focused on the scholarship that has appeared since the early and mid-1990s. Students are required to write several books reviews and a comprehensive review essay, as well as to present and critique the comprehensive review essay in class. The ultimate purpose of the course is to help students take the Cold War as a useful reference to pursue a better understanding of the challenges facing the human race in the 21st century.                                                                    The Global Space Age - HIST-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Over the course of the twentieth century the infinite void that surrounds planet Earth has stimulated the human imagination as never before. For several decades, anticipation of human spaceflight was intimately bound with futuristic visions of technoscientific progress, while space exploration became key to societal self-images. This course charts the rise and fall of the Age of Space from a global perspective. Individual sessions will be devoted to the \u2018rocket fad\u2019 of the Weimar Republic, Nazi \u2018wonder weapons\u2019, the so-called Sputnik shock and the American moon landings, as well as providing an introduction to the historical origins of techno-nationalism, from the Cold War to today\u2019s Space Race in Asia.                                                                    Moments of Europe - HIST-SHU 232 - 4 points                               This course will provide a broad introduction to the history of Europe since the French Revolution. Organized around eight exemplary \u2018moments of Europe\u2019 spanning two centuries, it will familiarize students with some of the principal themes and methods involved in the writing of Modern European History. Structured chronologically, individual sessions will be devoted to the revolutions of the early nineteenth century, processes of nationbuilding, fin-de-si\u00e8cle culture, the causes, experiences and effects of the First and Second World Wars, the transeuropean protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s, in addition to the crucial question of whether a distinctive European identity has developed over time. Materials used include political treatises, fiction, images and film.                                                                    Histories & Politics of Noise - HIST-SHU 303 - 4 points                               In this seminar, students will consider the idea that \u201cnoise\u201d has a history, and that its history dates long before the industrial revolution\u2019s ratcheting up of noise levels due to heavy machinery and the reproduction and amplification of sound through electronic technologies. Some noises pierce our ears and disrupt both our hearing and our thinking. In contrast, background noises may be loud, persistent, and even harmful to our ears, but they suffuse our everyday lives so fully that we can ignore them. Despite our daily subjective encounters with noise, can noise have a political meaning as well, one that transcends our individual experiences with din and discord, cacophony and clamor? This course explores noise\u2019s relationship to history and politics. By spending the semester reading, talking, and writing about noise, we will seek to comprehend it rather than contain it.                                                                    European Religion from the Reformation to Enlightenment - HIST-SHU 341 - 4 points                               European Christendom exploded in the sixteenth century, creating a fragmented and fractious religious landscape that still marks Europe (and Christianity worldwide) to this day. In this undergraduate lecture course, students will examine the significant changes European Christendom experienced between the Protestant and Catholic Reformations through the Enlightenment, and will explore the impact of new religious dogmas, beliefs, practices, and institutions upon the broader order of European politics, society, and culture. The readings, which consist of both primary and secondary sources, will demonstrate that the religious changes in this period shaped not only the thinking of theologians and clergymen, but also affected the everyday lives of people throughout Europe. Furthermore, the course will examine how various denominations of European Christianity participated in Europe\u2019s commercial, colonial, and imperial projects in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Students will thus also consider the interactions, both within and beyond Europe, between European Christianity and other world religions.                              Humanities                                                  Gender, Sexuality, and Culture - HUMN-SHU 240 - 4 points                               This course invites students to think about some of the most carefully controlled but also fervently sought-after questions since the time of Plato: what is the difference between gender and sex? What is the relationship between our gendered bodies, behaviors, and identities? How does sex, something we do, translate to the discourse of sexuality, something we talk about? What is the measurement of normality? If art indeed imitates and even changes life, in what ways do images of gender performance in literary and visual culture also reproduce and perhaps reshape our own experiences as gendered and sexed beings in a society? What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.                                                                    Shanghai Stories - HUMN-SHU 266 - 4 points                               This course provides an introduction to the history and culture of Shanghai through the eyes of fiction writers. We will read short stories (in English translation) by Chinese, British, American, Japanese, French, Polish, and South African writers who lived in the city between 1910 and 2010. Their stories will take us on an imaginary city tour through time and space: from businessmen, politicians, and prostitutes gathering in the nightclubs of the old Bund, to Jewish refugees struggling to find a home in the poor shikumen neighborhoods of Hongkou, to teachers and students fighting political battles at the university campuses during the Cultural Revolution, and young urban youth pursuing cosmopolitan lifestyles in the global city of today. The course also includes trips to various places featured in the stories and guest lectures by some of Shanghai\u2019s most famous writers today.                                Interactive Media Arts                                                  Interactive Performance - INTM-SHU 171 - 4 points                               Digital content has become an important aspect of performance and the performing arts. This course will cover the challenges and possibilities of creating and incorporating interactive media in live and unpredictable environments such as the stage, a concert hall, or an outdoor venue. Programming performative interfaces and creating physical computing props will be the primary vehicles for the class. Prior programming or performing experience is not required. Communications Lab is a prerequisite but can be waived with proven experience in digital image processing. The performance discipline, being an inherently collaborative arena, places heavy emphasis on teamwork. An open mind to work with other artists, technologists and creative leaders is a must. Students are expected to present a live staged performance during the semester.  Prerequisite: Communications Lab.                                                                      Media and Participation - INTM-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Making words and images public used to be difficult, complex, and expensive. Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. New, cheap forms of communication have opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several effects in the media landscape today.  This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere.  This course will provide a brief history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation for sharing words, images, audio and video. We will look at the dynamics of both English-language services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and, in translation, Chinese-language services such as Sina Weibo, Weixin and QQ.  The class will consist of class discussion around readings and lectures, in-class presentations and analysis of new uses of media that you observe (or participate in) outside class. There will be two written analyses of the media landscape, one at mid-term and one final paper.                                                                      Developing Web - INTM-SHU 231 - 4 points                               The Web now permeates most aspects of modern existence, and as a result, web development has become an indispensable skill complementary to many diverse disciplines. Students in this course will gain fluency in essential web languages and development approaches through a series of creative yet practical exercises aimed at touching on many important aspects of today\u2019s multi-faceted World Wide Web \u2013 by building responsive websites, engaging games, and rich internet applications for the desktop, mobile devices, and Arduino microcontroller. Design principles will be explored through corresponding HTML and CSS structures, and will be based on a consideration for typography, images, audio and video. Dynamic data and interaction will be investigated through client-side scripting techniques using JavaScript, including the popular jQuery library. User generated content and the importance of content management will be reflected on through server-side scripting techniques utilizing the PHP based WordPress platform. Data storage and retrieval will be made possible through the application of MySQL databases and the HTML5 Local Storage specification. And universal data exchange formats, JSON and XML, will be part of an ongoing experimentation with third party APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) such as Flickr, Freebase, Google Maps, Twitter, Xively &amp; YouTube.                                                                      Solar Solutions: The Sun - INTM-SHU 240 - 4 points                               Solar power is on track to be a major contributor to renewable energy systems of the future. Small scale photovoltaic cells can provide energy directly at point of use without the expense of an electricity grid and with the added benefit that the energy is free and non-polluting. This class examines how photovoltaic cells can be incorporated into interactive art, internet enabled devices and anything in between. We will look at the science behind various photovoltaic panels, calculate power requirements, and build our understanding about panel assembly and use. Among other things, students will experiment with solar circuits, BEAM robotics (Biology, Electronics, Aesthetics and Mechanics) and how to use photovoltaic cells with micro-controllers. Throughout the semester students will design a series of conceptual paper prototypes and physical prototypes as solutions to artistic and design challenges given throughout the course.  Prerequisite: Interaction Lab                                                                      Street Food & Urban Farming - INTM-SHU 250 - 4 points                               This course introduces and makes use of digital tools (audio, video and mapping technologies) to research and record an immersive engagement with the city. It also includes a lab-based workshop in interactive media that is designed around a relevant theme. This semester the course focuses on street food &amp; urban farming.   The preservation, adaptation and disappearance of street food raise many issues that are central to contemporary Shanghai: globalization, creativity and cultural heritage, urbanization, the informal economy, and the environment. This course examines these topics by focusing on the following questions: How is Shanghai working to both integrate and exclude its migrant population? What room is there for itinerant vendors and the informal markets of the streets in the 21st century metropolis? What role does creativity play in the attempts to preserve the city\u2019s culinary heritage? How does street food contribute to the city\u2019s attempts to provide safe, affordable and nutritious food for its ever-growing population?   Adding an extra dimension to our analysis of food in the city, the course will include an intensive workshop on urban farming led by experts in the field. This will involve; an introduction to the challenges and opportunities of urban farming in China; a tour to a local urban garden, and a hands-on component aimed at building a hydroponic window farm in the IMA lab.                                                                    Expressing Data - INTM-SHU 270 - 2 points                               Human beings are producing, consuming and sharing data at any given moment. However, what kinds of data are meaningful to us? How do we capture and collect that data? What are the best ways to present it? What stories do we want to tell with data? This course will explore these questions and more. Students will learn basic techniques for data collection and filtering. Student projects can be digitial, physical, visual, musical, or (with approval) take any form imagined.  Prerequisite: Interaction Lab.                                                                      Interaction Lab - INTM-SHU 101 - 4 points                               What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.                                                                      Communications Lab - INTM-SHU 120 - 4 points                               Communications Lab: An introductory course designed to provide students with the digital toolkit. The forms and uses of new communications technologies, including digital imaging, sound, video, animation, and basic web development, are explored in a laboratory context of hands-on experimentation, readings, and discussion. Principles of interpersonal communications, media theory, and human factors are introduced. Weekly assignments, team and independent projects, and project reports are required.                                Literature                                                  World Drama: Class Conception - LIT-SHU 150 - 4 points                               This course attempts to infuse global content and employ global perspectives in studying the classics from great theatrical traditions of the world. To examine the classics from ancient Greece through Renaissance Europe to Restoration England along with those from classical China, India and Japan is to transform how they are understood; also transformed is one\u2019s understanding of drama when studying Sophocles, Kalidassa, Shakespeare, Tang Xianzu, Chikamatsu and Moli\u00e8re in the same sequence. The objective is to deepen our understanding of the diverse aesthetic principles and cultural values that continue to impact today's theatre and drama around the world.  This course is an upper level elective for NYU Shanghai Humanities majors and NYU New York English majors.                                                                      Hispanic Cities in Translation - LIT-SHU 224 - 4 points                               This course introduces twentieth century narratives of urban life from Spain and Latin America. Through artistic and cultural depictions, the urban hubs of Barcelona, Madrid, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Havana and New York can be read as archaeological sites of history and memory. We will read and discuss the novels, short stories and poetry of diverse authors including Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Jorge Luis Borges, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Alejo Carpentier and Octavio Paz, working with translations of their work in English. Using images, newspaper accounts, filmic and documentary representations, students will analyze and distinguish specific national, regional and linguistic contexts, while grappling with larger thematic notions of intellectual, literary, and artistic migration across national borders.

Great Ideas in Mathematics - MATH-SHU 10 - 4 points                               This one semester course serves as an introduction to great ideas in mathematics. During the course we will examine a variety of topics chosen from the following broad categories. 1) A survey of pure mathematics: What do mathematicians do and what questions inspire them? 2) Great works: What are some of the historically big ideas in the field? Who were the mathematicians that came up with them? 3) Mathematics as a reflection of the world we live in: How does our understanding of the natural world affect mathematics (and vice versa!). 4) Computations, proof, and mathematical reasoning: Quantitative skills are crucial for dealing with the sheer amount of information available in modern society. 5) Mathematics as a liberal art: Historically, some of the greatest mathematicians have also been poets, artists, and philosophers. How is mathematics a natural result of humanity's interest in the nature of truth, beauty, and understanding? Why is math a liberal art?

Prerequisite: None.                                                                    Philosophy of Science - PHIL-SHU 90 - 4 points                               This is a survey course in general philosophy of science. Our topics include: Is scientific knowledge different from other forms of knowledge? Should the history of science be seen as an ever-increasing advance of knowledge? Given that most scientific theories have turned out to be false, are we justified in believing that our current theories are true? What are scientific explanations, and what makes an explanation better than another? Do the laws of nature govern the world or simply encapsulate some interesting patterns in the world? What is the relationship between more and less fundamental scientific theories? We will examine these questions through readings drawn from both the history and philosophy of science. Prerequisites: None.                              Social Foundations                                                  Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Contemporary Chinese Political Thought - CCSF-SHU 123 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to perspectives on contemporary Chinese political and social thought as presented in academic publications, media reports, social commentary and postings on the Chinese Internet. It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                Social Science                                                  Methods of Social Research - SOCS-SHU 141 - 4 points                               This is an introduction to research methods in the social sciences. It is intended to provide a foundation for an understanding of the major approaches in the social sciences to the collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data, and the specification and testing of theories. Special attention will be given to new methods developed to study online contents, the Internet and social media (e.g., online flow, audiences, virality and impact).  The course covers the logic of scientific inquiry and various research techniques such as experimentation, scientific sampling, survey research, field methods, archival data, and quantitative analysis that are commonly used by researchers in economics, education, political science, psychology, and sociology. The most basic goal of the class is to provide students with sufficient understanding of the basic elements of research design to be critical readers of research publications in the social sciences. In particular, they should be able to understand how the researchers arrived at their conclusions, assess whether the design of the study is adequate to support them, and possibly identify shortcomings in the design that would affect the conclusions. After completing this course students should have an overall sense of the range of methodologies for data collection and analysis available to the social science researcher, and the elements of study design required to ensure the results will actually be informative. This is not a statistics or quantitative methods class, and there will be no systematic instruction in the use of statistical software, or other quantitative analysis of data. Students seeking training in social statistics should take a course in social statistics.

Creative Writing                                                  Introduction to Creative Writing - WRIT-SHU 159 - 4 points                               This introductory course is designed for students who love to read and write creatively and who are interested in developing skills in both of these areas. We will focus mostly on fiction, with a smaller emphasis given to poetry and creative nonfiction, and we will spend the semester using these modes of creative writing to engage imaginatively and thoughtfully with the world. We will work hard in these efforts. Learning to interpret and analyze what we read is invaluable in developing our own skills as writers; assigned readings (mostly from contemporary authors) will stimulate discussions and provide models for what creative writing is and can be. Students will be expected to share their own projects in a writing workshop setting.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

Pre-req: CHIN-SHU 302                                                                    Intro to Business Chinese - CHIN-SHU 411 - 4 points                               This course is designed for those who have studied Mandarin to the intermedia high or advanced level (or equivalent). The main goal of the course is to continuously enhance students\u2019 Chinese proficiency while, at the same time, preparing them for working more comfortably and confidently in a Chinese business environment. In recent years, along with the rapid growth of Chinese economy, issues on Chinese business and economy became a hot topic. Following this trend, the course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding of the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course will cover the first five chapters of the textbook which is developed surrounding five real-life business cases. These five companies are all multinational that have successfully operated in China by adapting their strategies to the special needs of the Chinese market. By reading, discussing, and performing communicative tasks related to those cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d, thus acquiring a better understanding of China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. The case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business within China.\u201d    In order to enhance students\u2019 understanding of the business cases, clips of the selected television interviews and talk shows will be used to accomplish the following four goals: First, the content of the textbook and the background information offered by the supplementary media materials complement each other. Second, key terms and expressions in the textbook will be repeated in the learning process to help students reinforce the knowledge. Third, in terms of cross-usage between colloquial and written language, students will have the opportunity to supplement their reading of written texts with the experience of watching television shows on the same or similar topics, which may help them understand the distinctions between the two language styles and accurately utilize both language registers to express their own ideas in different settings. Fourth, the authentic visual materials can help close the gap between pedagogy and the real world, most effectively enabling students to become familiar with all varieties of Chinese accents, \u2013 including those of Hong Kong, Taiwan and even foreigners speaking Chinese \u2013 thereby strengthening students\u2019 abilities of practical application in the real world. In order to expand and update students\u2019 knowledge on various business-related issues, in addition to the business case 2 analysis, supplementary listening, reading, writing exercises will also be provided in class. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues; discussion of Chinese business laws, translation of business terms and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China or Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) expand business vocabulary and strengthen the communication skills in real business settings; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about China and the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of authentic Chinese media materials; (4) improve reading, writing and translation skills of business terminologies and documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.

Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from the Real World - CHIN-SHU 429 or BUSF-SHU 188                               The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201dIn addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.

Business and Finance                                                  Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from the Real World - CHIN-SHU 429 or BUSF-SHU 188                               The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201dIn addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.  Class will be conducted in Chinese. Permission of Instructor required.

Managerial Skills - MGMT-SHU 21 - 3 points                               Many companies bestow a management title on key talent and expect appropriate behavior to follow. That is not the most effective way to develop future business leaders. Your expertise will take you just so far. Increasing self-awareness and being open to feedback are important first steps in leading today's business for tomorrow's results. DEVELOPING MANAGEMENT SKILLS is a course that focuses primarily on the practical aspects of managing. This course is highly interactive and, while based on solid research, it stresses a hands-on approach to improving your management skills. The focus is on developing:   Your Personal Skills: self-awareness; managing stress; solving problems &amp; creativity  What behaviors help or get in your way as you strive for personal/professional success?  How do your values influence your decisions and problem-solving approaches?  How do your learning styles help or hinder how you handle ethical dilemmas?, etc.)  Your Interpersonal Skills: coaching; counseling; supportive communication; gaining power &amp; influence; motivating self &amp; others; managing conflict  Your Group Skills: empowering &amp; delegating; building teams, leading change, running meetings.  Each session will give you an opportunity to \u201cassess\u201d, \u201canalyze\u201d, \u201cpractice\u201d, \u201clearn\u201d, \u201cteach\u201d, and \u201capply\u201d the above skills to your own work or life situation so that you can turn good ideas into effective practice. You will not only learn about management skills but you will begin to apply those skills in class, at work, at home, etc., to help you become a more effective business leader. This is not the course for you, if you prefer classes where you can sit passively by and be an &quot;academic tourist&quot;.  In the self-assessment step you assess your own skills in the topic under discussion. Usually, these will be at the beginning of each chapter. Class lectures and discussions will involve such topics as: self-awareness, creative problem-solving, communication, stress management, gaining power, motivating others, managing conflict, empowering others, giving and receiving feedback, delegating, and team building, etc...not necessarily in that order. You will analyze, write about, practice and apply these topics through case studies, group exercises, and being responsible to teach some topics to the class.   NOTE: We will NOT be reading each chapter in class. The text is YOUR resource to use as we go along as a starting point. Use it. We will seldom refer to it during class. It can serve as the basis for class discussion and reflection. However, it is not to be considered the only resource available to you. This is your opportunity to explore these topics through outside sources, including but not limited to professional and popular journals/books/organizations, Human Resources professionals, web sites, etc. Your chance to network beyond your comfort zone!  You will be required to keep a journal/log from day one. A self-awareness journal allows you to keep track of the issues that help or get in the way of your career/management goals and the action-steps you take to achieve them. This will be especially important for your final project. You will be required to hand in a one-page summary of highlights about \u00be of the way through the course.  A secondary goal is to provide you an opportunity to develop your skills in critical thinking, oral and written communication, and your ability to influence others through rational and creative approaches. Therefore, at the end of this course you will be able to:  Demonstrate your understanding and competence with respect to fundamental managerial skills: Self-awareness, stress management, creative problem solving, supportive communication, gaining power and influence, motivating others, managing conflict, building effective teams, etc.  Analyze, develop, practice, and demonstrate your ability to use these fundamental personal, interpersonal and team building skills through self-assessments, textbook learning, cases, experiential exercises, written application exercises and a final paper.

You will learn to use some important analytic methods (e.g. forecasting, data mining, optimization, Monte Carlo simulation), to recognize their assumptions and limitations, and to employ them in decision making. The course is entirely hands-on. The emphasis will be on model formulation and interpretation of results, not on mathematical theory. The emphasis is on models that are widely used in diverse industries and functional areas, including finance, marketing, and operations.

In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.

For several decades, anticipation of human spaceflight was intimately bound with futuristic visions of technoscientific progress, while space exploration became key to societal self-images. This course charts the rise and fall of the Age of Space from a global perspective. Individual sessions will be devoted to the \u2018rocket fad\u2019 of the Weimar Republic, Nazi \u2018wonder weapons\u2019, the so-called Sputnik shock and the American moon landings, as well as providing an introduction to the historical origins of techno-nationalism, from the Cold War to today\u2019s Space Race in Asia.                                                                    Moments of Europe - HIST-SHU 232 - 4 points                               This course will provide a broad introduction to the history of Europe since the French Revolution. Organized around eight exemplary \u2018moments of Europe\u2019 spanning two centuries, it will familiarize students with some of the principal themes and methods involved in the writing of Modern European History. Structured chronologically, individual sessions will be devoted to the revolutions of the early nineteenth century, processes of nationbuilding, fin-de-si\u00e8cle culture, the causes, experiences and effects of the First and Second World Wars, the transeuropean protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s, in addition to the crucial question of whether a distinctive European identity has developed over time. Materials used include political treatises, fiction, images and film.                                                                    Histories & Politics of Noise - HIST-SHU 303 - 4 points                               In this seminar, students will consider the idea that \u201cnoise\u201d has a history, and that its history dates long before the industrial revolution\u2019s ratcheting up of noise levels due to heavy machinery and the reproduction and amplification of sound through electronic technologies. Some noises pierce our ears and disrupt both our hearing and our thinking. In contrast, background noises may be loud, persistent, and even harmful to our ears, but they suffuse our everyday lives so fully that we can ignore them. Despite our daily subjective encounters with noise, can noise have a political meaning as well, one that transcends our individual experiences with din and discord, cacophony and clamor? This course explores noise\u2019s relationship to history and politics. By spending the semester reading, talking, and writing about noise, we will seek to comprehend it rather than contain it.                                                                    European Religion from the Reformation to Enlightenment - HIST-SHU 341 - 4 points                               European Christendom exploded in the sixteenth century, creating a fragmented and fractious religious landscape that still marks Europe (and Christianity worldwide) to this day. In this undergraduate lecture course, students will examine the significant changes European Christendom experienced between the Protestant and Catholic Reformations through the Enlightenment, and will explore the impact of new religious dogmas, beliefs, practices, and institutions upon the broader order of European politics, society, and culture. The readings, which consist of both primary and secondary sources, will demonstrate that the religious changes in this period shaped not only the thinking of theologians and clergymen, but also affected the everyday lives of people throughout Europe. Furthermore, the course will examine how various denominations of European Christianity participated in Europe\u2019s commercial, colonial, and imperial projects in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Students will thus also consider the interactions, both within and beyond Europe, between European Christianity and other world religions.                              Humanities                                                  Gender, Sexuality, and Culture - HUMN-SHU 240 - 4 points                               This course invites students to think about some of the most carefully controlled but also fervently sought-after questions since the time of Plato: what is the difference between gender and sex? What is the relationship between our gendered bodies, behaviors, and identities? How does sex, something we do, translate to the discourse of sexuality, something we talk about? What is the measurement of normality? If art indeed imitates and even changes life, in what ways do images of gender performance in literary and visual culture also reproduce and perhaps reshape our own experiences as gendered and sexed beings in a society? What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.                                                                    Shanghai Stories - HUMN-SHU 266 - 4 points                               This course provides an introduction to the history and culture of Shanghai through the eyes of fiction writers. We will read short stories (in English translation) by Chinese, British, American, Japanese, French, Polish, and South African writers who lived in the city between 1910 and 2010. Their stories will take us on an imaginary city tour through time and space: from businessmen, politicians, and prostitutes gathering in the nightclubs of the old Bund, to Jewish refugees struggling to find a home in the poor shikumen neighborhoods of Hongkou, to teachers and students fighting political battles at the university campuses during the Cultural Revolution, and young urban youth pursuing cosmopolitan lifestyles in the global city of today. The course also includes trips to various places featured in the stories and guest lectures by some of Shanghai\u2019s most famous writers today.                                Interactive Media Arts                                                  Interactive Performance - INTM-SHU 171 - 4 points                               Digital content has become an important aspect of performance and the performing arts. This course will cover the challenges and possibilities of creating and incorporating interactive media in live and unpredictable environments such as the stage, a concert hall, or an outdoor venue. Programming performative interfaces and creating physical computing props will be the primary vehicles for the class. Prior programming or performing experience is not required. Communications Lab is a prerequisite but can be waived with proven experience in digital image processing. The performance discipline, being an inherently collaborative arena, places heavy emphasis on teamwork. An open mind to work with other artists, technologists and creative leaders is a must. Students are expected to present a live staged performance during the semester.  Prerequisite: Communications Lab.                                                                      Media and Participation - INTM-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Making words and images public used to be difficult, complex, and expensive. Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. New, cheap forms of communication have opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several effects in the media landscape today.  This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere.  This course will provide a brief history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation for sharing words, images, audio and video. We will look at the dynamics of both English-language services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and, in translation, Chinese-language services such as Sina Weibo, Weixin and QQ.  The class will consist of class discussion around readings and lectures, in-class presentations and analysis of new uses of media that you observe (or participate in) outside class. There will be two written analyses of the media landscape, one at mid-term and one final paper.                                                                      Developing Web - INTM-SHU 231 - 4 points                               The Web now permeates most aspects of modern existence, and as a result, web development has become an indispensable skill complementary to many diverse disciplines. Students in this course will gain fluency in essential web languages and development approaches through a series of creative yet practical exercises aimed at touching on many important aspects of today\u2019s multi-faceted World Wide Web \u2013 by building responsive websites, engaging games, and rich internet applications for the desktop, mobile devices, and Arduino microcontroller. Design principles will be explored through corresponding HTML and CSS structures, and will be based on a consideration for typography, images, audio and video. Dynamic data and interaction will be investigated through client-side scripting techniques using JavaScript, including the popular jQuery library. User generated content and the importance of content management will be reflected on through server-side scripting techniques utilizing the PHP based WordPress platform. Data storage and retrieval will be made possible through the application of MySQL databases and the HTML5 Local Storage specification. And universal data exchange formats, JSON and XML, will be part of an ongoing experimentation with third party APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) such as Flickr, Freebase, Google Maps, Twitter, Xively &amp; YouTube.                                                                      Solar Solutions: The Sun - INTM-SHU 240 - 4 points                               Solar power is on track to be a major contributor to renewable energy systems of the future. Small scale photovoltaic cells can provide energy directly at point of use without the expense of an electricity grid and with the added benefit that the energy is free and non-polluting. This class examines how photovoltaic cells can be incorporated into interactive art, internet enabled devices and anything in between. We will look at the science behind various photovoltaic panels, calculate power requirements, and build our understanding about panel assembly and use. Among other things, students will experiment with solar circuits, BEAM robotics (Biology, Electronics, Aesthetics and Mechanics) and how to use photovoltaic cells with micro-controllers. Throughout the semester students will design a series of conceptual paper prototypes and physical prototypes as solutions to artistic and design challenges given throughout the course.  Prerequisite: Interaction Lab                                                                      Street Food & Urban Farming - INTM-SHU 250 - 4 points                               This course introduces and makes use of digital tools (audio, video and mapping technologies) to research and record an immersive engagement with the city. It also includes a lab-based workshop in interactive media that is designed around a relevant theme. This semester the course focuses on street food &amp; urban farming.   The preservation, adaptation and disappearance of street food raise many issues that are central to contemporary Shanghai: globalization, creativity and cultural heritage, urbanization, the informal economy, and the environment. This course examines these topics by focusing on the following questions: How is Shanghai working to both integrate and exclude its migrant population? What room is there for itinerant vendors and the informal markets of the streets in the 21st century metropolis? What role does creativity play in the attempts to preserve the city\u2019s culinary heritage? How does street food contribute to the city\u2019s attempts to provide safe, affordable and nutritious food for its ever-growing population?   Adding an extra dimension to our analysis of food in the city, the course will include an intensive workshop on urban farming led by experts in the field. This will involve; an introduction to the challenges and opportunities of urban farming in China; a tour to a local urban garden, and a hands-on component aimed at building a hydroponic window farm in the IMA lab.                                                                    Expressing Data - INTM-SHU 270 - 2 points                               Human beings are producing, consuming and sharing data at any given moment. However, what kinds of data are meaningful to us? How do we capture and collect that data? What are the best ways to present it? What stories do we want to tell with data? This course will explore these questions and more. Students will learn basic techniques for data collection and filtering. Student projects can be digitial, physical, visual, musical, or (with approval) take any form imagined.  Prerequisite: Interaction Lab.                                                                      Interaction Lab - INTM-SHU 101 - 4 points                               What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.                                                                      Communications Lab - INTM-SHU 120 - 4 points                               Communications Lab: An introductory course designed to provide students with the digital toolkit. The forms and uses of new communications technologies, including digital imaging, sound, video, animation, and basic web development, are explored in a laboratory context of hands-on experimentation, readings, and discussion. Principles of interpersonal communications, media theory, and human factors are introduced. Weekly assignments, team and independent projects, and project reports are required.                                Literature                                                  World Drama: Class Conception - LIT-SHU 150 - 4 points                               This course attempts to infuse global content and employ global perspectives in studying the classics from great theatrical traditions of the world. To examine the classics from ancient Greece through Renaissance Europe to Restoration England along with those from classical China, India and Japan is to transform how they are understood; also transformed is one\u2019s understanding of drama when studying Sophocles, Kalidassa, Shakespeare, Tang Xianzu, Chikamatsu and Moli\u00e8re in the same sequence. The objective is to deepen our understanding of the diverse aesthetic principles and cultural values that continue to impact today's theatre and drama around the world.  This course is an upper level elective for NYU Shanghai Humanities majors and NYU New York English majors.                                                                      Hispanic Cities in Translation - LIT-SHU 224 - 4 points                               This course introduces twentieth century narratives of urban life from Spain and Latin America. Through artistic and cultural depictions, the urban hubs of Barcelona, Madrid, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Havana and New York can be read as archaeological sites of history and memory. We will read and discuss the novels, short stories and poetry of diverse authors including Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Jorge Luis Borges, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Alejo Carpentier and Octavio Paz, working with translations of their work in English. Using images, newspaper accounts, filmic and documentary representations, students will analyze and distinguish specific national, regional and linguistic contexts, while grappling with larger thematic notions of intellectual, literary, and artistic migration across national borders.

Philosophy of Science - PHIL-SHU 90 - 4 points                               This is a survey course in general philosophy of science. Our topics include: Is scientific knowledge different from other forms of knowledge? Should the history of science be seen as an ever-increasing advance of knowledge? Given that most scientific theories have turned out to be false, are we justified in believing that our current theories are true? What are scientific explanations, and what makes an explanation better than another? Do the laws of nature govern the world or simply encapsulate some interesting patterns in the world? What is the relationship between more and less fundamental scientific theories? We will examine these questions through readings drawn from both the history and philosophy of science. Prerequisites: None.                              Social Foundations                                                  Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Contemporary Chinese Political Thought - CCSF-SHU 123 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to perspectives on contemporary Chinese political and social thought as presented in academic publications, media reports, social commentary and postings on the Chinese Internet. It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                Social Science                                                  Methods of Social Research - SOCS-SHU 141 - 4 points                               This is an introduction to research methods in the social sciences. It is intended to provide a foundation for an understanding of the major approaches in the social sciences to the collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data, and the specification and testing of theories. Special attention will be given to new methods developed to study online contents, the Internet and social media (e.g., online flow, audiences, virality and impact).  The course covers the logic of scientific inquiry and various research techniques such as experimentation, scientific sampling, survey research, field methods, archival data, and quantitative analysis that are commonly used by researchers in economics, education, political science, psychology, and sociology. The most basic goal of the class is to provide students with sufficient understanding of the basic elements of research design to be critical readers of research publications in the social sciences. In particular, they should be able to understand how the researchers arrived at their conclusions, assess whether the design of the study is adequate to support them, and possibly identify shortcomings in the design that would affect the conclusions. After completing this course students should have an overall sense of the range of methodologies for data collection and analysis available to the social science researcher, and the elements of study design required to ensure the results will actually be informative. This is not a statistics or quantitative methods class, and there will be no systematic instruction in the use of statistical software, or other quantitative analysis of data. Students seeking training in social statistics should take a course in social statistics.

Creative Writing                                                  Introduction to Creative Writing - WRIT-SHU 159 - 4 points                               This introductory course is designed for students who love to read and write creatively and who are interested in developing skills in both of these areas. We will focus mostly on fiction, with a smaller emphasis given to poetry and creative nonfiction, and we will spend the semester using these modes of creative writing to engage imaginatively and thoughtfully with the world. We will work hard in these efforts. Learning to interpret and analyze what we read is invaluable in developing our own skills as writers; assigned readings (mostly from contemporary authors) will stimulate discussions and provide models for what creative writing is and can be. Students will be expected to share their own projects in a writing workshop setting.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

Pre-req: CHIN-SHU 302                                                                    Intro to Business Chinese - CHIN-SHU 411 - 4 points                               This course is designed for those who have studied Mandarin to the intermedia high or advanced level (or equivalent). The main goal of the course is to continuously enhance students\u2019 Chinese proficiency while, at the same time, preparing them for working more comfortably and confidently in a Chinese business environment. In recent years, along with the rapid growth of Chinese economy, issues on Chinese business and economy became a hot topic. Following this trend, the course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding of the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course will cover the first five chapters of the textbook which is developed surrounding five real-life business cases. These five companies are all multinational that have successfully operated in China by adapting their strategies to the special needs of the Chinese market. By reading, discussing, and performing communicative tasks related to those cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d, thus acquiring a better understanding of China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. The case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business within China.\u201d    In order to enhance students\u2019 understanding of the business cases, clips of the selected television interviews and talk shows will be used to accomplish the following four goals: First, the content of the textbook and the background information offered by the supplementary media materials complement each other. Second, key terms and expressions in the textbook will be repeated in the learning process to help students reinforce the knowledge. Third, in terms of cross-usage between colloquial and written language, students will have the opportunity to supplement their reading of written texts with the experience of watching television shows on the same or similar topics, which may help them understand the distinctions between the two language styles and accurately utilize both language registers to express their own ideas in different settings. Fourth, the authentic visual materials can help close the gap between pedagogy and the real world, most effectively enabling students to become familiar with all varieties of Chinese accents, \u2013 including those of Hong Kong, Taiwan and even foreigners speaking Chinese \u2013 thereby strengthening students\u2019 abilities of practical application in the real world. In order to expand and update students\u2019 knowledge on various business-related issues, in addition to the business case 2 analysis, supplementary listening, reading, writing exercises will also be provided in class. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues; discussion of Chinese business laws, translation of business terms and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China or Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) expand business vocabulary and strengthen the communication skills in real business settings; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about China and the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of authentic Chinese media materials; (4) improve reading, writing and translation skills of business terminologies and documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.

An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201dIn addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills.

The underlying premise is that the city is a critical site of globalization. Rather than view globalization as an external force acting on Shanghai, this course aims instead to show how globalization is inherent in the city and that an investigation of the distinctive features of Shanghai -- from the abandoned factories now revived as creative clusters, to the lilong architecture, luxury malls and street peddlers -- sheds light on both the past and future of globalization.   Sample Syllabus                              Additional courses Offered by NYU Shanghai's Portal Campus     Additional courses from departments at NYU Shanghai's portal campus will have limited enrollment space for study away students.

Business and Finance                                                  Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from the Real World - CHIN-SHU 429 or BUSF-SHU 188                               The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201dIn addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.  Class will be conducted in Chinese. Permission of Instructor required.                                                                      Investing in Finance in China - BUSF-SHU 206 - 4 points                               Course description coming soon.                                                                    Managerial Skills - MGMT-SHU 21 - 3 points                               Many companies bestow a management title on key talent and expect appropriate behavior to follow. That is not the most effective way to develop future business leaders. Your expertise will take you just so far. Increasing self-awareness and being open to feedback are important first steps in leading today's business for tomorrow's results. DEVELOPING MANAGEMENT SKILLS is a course that focuses primarily on the practical aspects of managing. This course is highly interactive and, while based on solid research, it stresses a hands-on approach to improving your management skills. The focus is on developing:   Your Personal Skills: self-awareness; managing stress; solving problems &amp; creativity  What behaviors help or get in your way as you strive for personal/professional success?  How do your values influence your decisions and problem-solving approaches?  How do your learning styles help or hinder how you handle ethical dilemmas?, etc.)  Your Interpersonal Skills: coaching; counseling; supportive communication; gaining power &amp; influence; motivating self &amp; others; managing conflict  Your Group Skills: empowering &amp; delegating; building teams, leading change, running meetings.  Each session will give you an opportunity to \u201cassess\u201d, \u201canalyze\u201d, \u201cpractice\u201d, \u201clearn\u201d, \u201cteach\u201d, and \u201capply\u201d the above skills to your own work or life situation so that you can turn good ideas into effective practice. You will not only learn about management skills but you will begin to apply those skills in class, at work, at home, etc., to help you become a more effective business leader. This is not the course for you, if you prefer classes where you can sit passively by and be an &quot;academic tourist&quot;.  In the self-assessment step you assess your own skills in the topic under discussion. Usually, these will be at the beginning of each chapter. Class lectures and discussions will involve such topics as: self-awareness, creative problem-solving, communication, stress management, gaining power, motivating others, managing conflict, empowering others, giving and receiving feedback, delegating, and team building, etc...not necessarily in that order. You will analyze, write about, practice and apply these topics through case studies, group exercises, and being responsible to teach some topics to the class.   NOTE: We will NOT be reading each chapter in class. The text is YOUR resource to use as we go along as a starting point. Use it. We will seldom refer to it during class. It can serve as the basis for class discussion and reflection. However, it is not to be considered the only resource available to you. This is your opportunity to explore these topics through outside sources, including but not limited to professional and popular journals/books/organizations, Human Resources professionals, web sites, etc. Your chance to network beyond your comfort zone!  You will be required to keep a journal/log from day one. A self-awareness journal allows you to keep track of the issues that help or get in the way of your career/management goals and the action-steps you take to achieve them. This will be especially important for your final project. You will be required to hand in a one-page summary of highlights about \u00be of the way through the course.  A secondary goal is to provide you an opportunity to develop your skills in critical thinking, oral and written communication, and your ability to influence others through rational and creative approaches. Therefore, at the end of this course you will be able to:  Demonstrate your understanding and competence with respect to fundamental managerial skills: Self-awareness, stress management, creative problem solving, supportive communication, gaining power and influence, motivating others, managing conflict, building effective teams, etc.  Analyze, develop, practice, and demonstrate your ability to use these fundamental personal, interpersonal and team building skills through self-assessments, textbook learning, cases, experiential exercises, written application exercises and a final paper.                                                                      Business Analytics \u2013 BUSF-SHU 210 \u2013 4 points                               This course introduces the basic principles and techniques of applied mathematical modeling for managerial decision making. You will learn to use some important analytic methods (e.g. forecasting, data mining, optimization, Monte Carlo simulation), to recognize their assumptions and limitations, and to employ them in decision making. The course is entirely hands-on. The emphasis will be on model formulation and interpretation of results, not on mathematical theory. The emphasis is on models that are widely used in diverse industries and functional areas, including finance, marketing, and operations.

Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.                              Economics                                                    Principles of Macroeconomics - ECON-SHU 1 - 4 points                               Focuses on the economy as a whole (the &quot;macroeconomy&quot;). Begins with the meaning and measurement of important macroeconomic data (on unemployment, inflation, and production), then turns to the behavior of the overall economy. Topics include long-run economic growth and the standard of living; the causes and consequences of economic booms and recessions; the banking system and the Federal Reserve; the stock and bond markets; and the role of government policy.                                                                      Principles of Microeconomics - ECON-SHU 2 - 4 points                               Focuses on individual economic decision-makers\u2014households, business firms, and government agencies\u2014and how they are linked together. The emphasis is on decision making by households and firms and how these decisions shape our economic life. Explores the different environments in which businesses sell their products, hire workers, and raise funds to expand their operations; the economic effects of trade between nations; and the effects of various government policies, such as minimum-wage legislation, rent controls, antitrust laws, and more.

This course is divided into four chronological periods: Antiquity\u2014from the period of the \u2018central kingdoms\u2019 to the formation of the early empire; Middle Period\u2014China Among Equals; Early Modern: 1350-1910\u2014China, Global Trade, and Imperialism; Modern: 1910-present\u2014China Redux                                History                                                  China Encounters the World - HIST-SHU 312 - 4 points                               This is a lecture course on China\u2019s encounters with the world in the late 19th and 20th centuries. The course analyzes the age-old Chinese \u201cCentral Kingdom\u201d self-image and how the image was overturned during modern times in face of Western and Japanese challenges; it explores the Chinese \u201cvictim mentality\u201d and its impact on China\u2019s modern international experience; it examines China\u2019s foreign policy issues in the context of its political, economic, social and cultural developments in broader terms; it also pays special attention to the role of \u201chuman agencies\u201d in the shaping of historical processes.                                                                    The New Cold War History - HIST-SHU 325 - 4 points                               This is a reading and research seminar with an emphasis on the \u201cnew \u201cCold War history\u2014a scholarly phenomenon emerging in the 1990s, along with the end of the global Cold War and the new opportunities to conduct multiarchival and mutli-source research for scholars of international history. Students in this class will be exposed to various new interpretations, new methods of research, and new ways of thinking associated with the new Cold War history studies. Readings in this class will be focused on the scholarship that has appeared since the early and mid-1990s. Students are required to write several books reviews and a comprehensive review essay, as well as to present and critique the comprehensive review essay in class. The ultimate purpose of the course is to help students take the Cold War as a useful reference to pursue a better understanding of the challenges facing the human race in the 21st century.                                                                    The Global Space Age - HIST-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Over the course of the twentieth century the infinite void that surrounds planet Earth has stimulated the human imagination as never before. For several decades, anticipation of human spaceflight was intimately bound with futuristic visions of technoscientific progress, while space exploration became key to societal self-images. This course charts the rise and fall of the Age of Space from a global perspective. Individual sessions will be devoted to the \u2018rocket fad\u2019 of the Weimar Republic, Nazi \u2018wonder weapons\u2019, the so-called Sputnik shock and the American moon landings, as well as providing an introduction to the historical origins of techno-nationalism, from the Cold War to today\u2019s Space Race in Asia.                                                                    Moments of Europe - HIST-SHU 232 - 4 points                               This course will provide a broad introduction to the history of Europe since the French Revolution. Organized around eight exemplary \u2018moments of Europe\u2019 spanning two centuries, it will familiarize students with some of the principal themes and methods involved in the writing of Modern European History. Structured chronologically, individual sessions will be devoted to the revolutions of the early nineteenth century, processes of nationbuilding, fin-de-si\u00e8cle culture, the causes, experiences and effects of the First and Second World Wars, the transeuropean protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s, in addition to the crucial question of whether a distinctive European identity has developed over time. Materials used include political treatises, fiction, images and film.                                                                    Histories & Politics of Noise - HIST-SHU 303 - 4 points                               In this seminar, students will consider the idea that \u201cnoise\u201d has a history, and that its history dates long before the industrial revolution\u2019s ratcheting up of noise levels due to heavy machinery and the reproduction and amplification of sound through electronic technologies. Some noises pierce our ears and disrupt both our hearing and our thinking. In contrast, background noises may be loud, persistent, and even harmful to our ears, but they suffuse our everyday lives so fully that we can ignore them. Despite our daily subjective encounters with noise, can noise have a political meaning as well, one that transcends our individual experiences with din and discord, cacophony and clamor? This course explores noise\u2019s relationship to history and politics. By spending the semester reading, talking, and writing about noise, we will seek to comprehend it rather than contain it.                                                                    European Religion from the Reformation to Enlightenment - HIST-SHU 341 - 4 points                               European Christendom exploded in the sixteenth century, creating a fragmented and fractious religious landscape that still marks Europe (and Christianity worldwide) to this day. In this undergraduate lecture course, students will examine the significant changes European Christendom experienced between the Protestant and Catholic Reformations through the Enlightenment, and will explore the impact of new religious dogmas, beliefs, practices, and institutions upon the broader order of European politics, society, and culture. The readings, which consist of both primary and secondary sources, will demonstrate that the religious changes in this period shaped not only the thinking of theologians and clergymen, but also affected the everyday lives of people throughout Europe. Furthermore, the course will examine how various denominations of European Christianity participated in Europe\u2019s commercial, colonial, and imperial projects in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Students will thus also consider the interactions, both within and beyond Europe, between European Christianity and other world religions.                              Humanities                                                  Gender, Sexuality, and Culture - HUMN-SHU 240 - 4 points                               This course invites students to think about some of the most carefully controlled but also fervently sought-after questions since the time of Plato: what is the difference between gender and sex? What is the relationship between our gendered bodies, behaviors, and identities? How does sex, something we do, translate to the discourse of sexuality, something we talk about? What is the measurement of normality? If art indeed imitates and even changes life, in what ways do images of gender performance in literary and visual culture also reproduce and perhaps reshape our own experiences as gendered and sexed beings in a society? What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.                                                                    Shanghai Stories - HUMN-SHU 266 - 4 points                               This course provides an introduction to the history and culture of Shanghai through the eyes of fiction writers. We will read short stories (in English translation) by Chinese, British, American, Japanese, French, Polish, and South African writers who lived in the city between 1910 and 2010. Their stories will take us on an imaginary city tour through time and space: from businessmen, politicians, and prostitutes gathering in the nightclubs of the old Bund, to Jewish refugees struggling to find a home in the poor shikumen neighborhoods of Hongkou, to teachers and students fighting political battles at the university campuses during the Cultural Revolution, and young urban youth pursuing cosmopolitan lifestyles in the global city of today. The course also includes trips to various places featured in the stories and guest lectures by some of Shanghai\u2019s most famous writers today.                                Interactive Media Arts                                                  Interactive Performance - INTM-SHU 171 - 4 points                               Digital content has become an important aspect of performance and the performing arts. This course will cover the challenges and possibilities of creating and incorporating interactive media in live and unpredictable environments such as the stage, a concert hall, or an outdoor venue. Programming performative interfaces and creating physical computing props will be the primary vehicles for the class. Prior programming or performing experience is not required. Communications Lab is a prerequisite but can be waived with proven experience in digital image processing. The performance discipline, being an inherently collaborative arena, places heavy emphasis on teamwork. An open mind to work with other artists, technologists and creative leaders is a must. Students are expected to present a live staged performance during the semester.  Prerequisite: Communications Lab.                                                                      Media and Participation - INTM-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Making words and images public used to be difficult, complex, and expensive. Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. New, cheap forms of communication have opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several effects in the media landscape today.  This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere.  This course will provide a brief history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation for sharing words, images, audio and video. We will look at the dynamics of both English-language services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and, in translation, Chinese-language services such as Sina Weibo, Weixin and QQ.  The class will consist of class discussion around readings and lectures, in-class presentations and analysis of new uses of media that you observe (or participate in) outside class. There will be two written analyses of the media landscape, one at mid-term and one final paper.                                                                      Developing Web - INTM-SHU 231 - 4 points                               The Web now permeates most aspects of modern existence, and as a result, web development has become an indispensable skill complementary to many diverse disciplines. Students in this course will gain fluency in essential web languages and development approaches through a series of creative yet practical exercises aimed at touching on many important aspects of today\u2019s multi-faceted World Wide Web \u2013 by building responsive websites, engaging games, and rich internet applications for the desktop, mobile devices, and Arduino microcontroller. Design principles will be explored through corresponding HTML and CSS structures, and will be based on a consideration for typography, images, audio and video. Dynamic data and interaction will be investigated through client-side scripting techniques using JavaScript, including the popular jQuery library. User generated content and the importance of content management will be reflected on through server-side scripting techniques utilizing the PHP based WordPress platform. Data storage and retrieval will be made possible through the application of MySQL databases and the HTML5 Local Storage specification. And universal data exchange formats, JSON and XML, will be part of an ongoing experimentation with third party APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) such as Flickr, Freebase, Google Maps, Twitter, Xively &amp; YouTube.                                                                      Solar Solutions: The Sun - INTM-SHU 240 - 4 points                               Solar power is on track to be a major contributor to renewable energy systems of the future. Small scale photovoltaic cells can provide energy directly at point of use without the expense of an electricity grid and with the added benefit that the energy is free and non-polluting. This class examines how photovoltaic cells can be incorporated into interactive art, internet enabled devices and anything in between. We will look at the science behind various photovoltaic panels, calculate power requirements, and build our understanding about panel assembly and use. Among other things, students will experiment with solar circuits, BEAM robotics (Biology, Electronics, Aesthetics and Mechanics) and how to use photovoltaic cells with micro-controllers. Throughout the semester students will design a series of conceptual paper prototypes and physical prototypes as solutions to artistic and design challenges given throughout the course.  Prerequisite: Interaction Lab                                                                      Street Food & Urban Farming - INTM-SHU 250 - 4 points                               This course introduces and makes use of digital tools (audio, video and mapping technologies) to research and record an immersive engagement with the city. It also includes a lab-based workshop in interactive media that is designed around a relevant theme. This semester the course focuses on street food &amp; urban farming.   The preservation, adaptation and disappearance of street food raise many issues that are central to contemporary Shanghai: globalization, creativity and cultural heritage, urbanization, the informal economy, and the environment. This course examines these topics by focusing on the following questions: How is Shanghai working to both integrate and exclude its migrant population? What room is there for itinerant vendors and the informal markets of the streets in the 21st century metropolis? What role does creativity play in the attempts to preserve the city\u2019s culinary heritage? How does street food contribute to the city\u2019s attempts to provide safe, affordable and nutritious food for its ever-growing population?   Adding an extra dimension to our analysis of food in the city, the course will include an intensive workshop on urban farming led by experts in the field. This will involve; an introduction to the challenges and opportunities of urban farming in China; a tour to a local urban garden, and a hands-on component aimed at building a hydroponic window farm in the IMA lab.                                                                    Expressing Data - INTM-SHU 270 - 2 points                               Human beings are producing, consuming and sharing data at any given moment. However, what kinds of data are meaningful to us? How do we capture and collect that data? What are the best ways to present it? What stories do we want to tell with data? This course will explore these questions and more. Students will learn basic techniques for data collection and filtering. Student projects can be digitial, physical, visual, musical, or (with approval) take any form imagined.  Prerequisite: Interaction Lab.                                                                      Interaction Lab - INTM-SHU 101 - 4 points                               What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.                                                                      Communications Lab - INTM-SHU 120 - 4 points                               Communications Lab: An introductory course designed to provide students with the digital toolkit. The forms and uses of new communications technologies, including digital imaging, sound, video, animation, and basic web development, are explored in a laboratory context of hands-on experimentation, readings, and discussion. Principles of interpersonal communications, media theory, and human factors are introduced. Weekly assignments, team and independent projects, and project reports are required.                                Literature                                                  World Drama: Class Conception - LIT-SHU 150 - 4 points                               This course attempts to infuse global content and employ global perspectives in studying the classics from great theatrical traditions of the world. To examine the classics from ancient Greece through Renaissance Europe to Restoration England along with those from classical China, India and Japan is to transform how they are understood; also transformed is one\u2019s understanding of drama when studying Sophocles, Kalidassa, Shakespeare, Tang Xianzu, Chikamatsu and Moli\u00e8re in the same sequence. The objective is to deepen our understanding of the diverse aesthetic principles and cultural values that continue to impact today's theatre and drama around the world.  This course is an upper level elective for NYU Shanghai Humanities majors and NYU New York English majors.                                                                      Hispanic Cities in Translation - LIT-SHU 224 - 4 points                               This course introduces twentieth century narratives of urban life from Spain and Latin America. Through artistic and cultural depictions, the urban hubs of Barcelona, Madrid, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Havana and New York can be read as archaeological sites of history and memory. We will read and discuss the novels, short stories and poetry of diverse authors including Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Jorge Luis Borges, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Alejo Carpentier and Octavio Paz, working with translations of their work in English. Using images, newspaper accounts, filmic and documentary representations, students will analyze and distinguish specific national, regional and linguistic contexts, while grappling with larger thematic notions of intellectual, literary, and artistic migration across national borders.

Philosophy of Science - PHIL-SHU 90 - 4 points                               This is a survey course in general philosophy of science. Our topics include: Is scientific knowledge different from other forms of knowledge? Should the history of science be seen as an ever-increasing advance of knowledge? Given that most scientific theories have turned out to be false, are we justified in believing that our current theories are true? What are scientific explanations, and what makes an explanation better than another? Do the laws of nature govern the world or simply encapsulate some interesting patterns in the world? What is the relationship between more and less fundamental scientific theories? We will examine these questions through readings drawn from both the history and philosophy of science. Prerequisites: None.                              Social Foundations                                                  Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Contemporary Chinese Political Thought - CCSF-SHU 123 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to perspectives on contemporary Chinese political and social thought as presented in academic publications, media reports, social commentary and postings on the Chinese Internet. It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                Social Science                                                  Methods of Social Research - SOCS-SHU 141 - 4 points                               This is an introduction to research methods in the social sciences. It is intended to provide a foundation for an understanding of the major approaches in the social sciences to the collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data, and the specification and testing of theories. Special attention will be given to new methods developed to study online contents, the Internet and social media (e.g., online flow, audiences, virality and impact).  The course covers the logic of scientific inquiry and various research techniques such as experimentation, scientific sampling, survey research, field methods, archival data, and quantitative analysis that are commonly used by researchers in economics, education, political science, psychology, and sociology. The most basic goal of the class is to provide students with sufficient understanding of the basic elements of research design to be critical readers of research publications in the social sciences. In particular, they should be able to understand how the researchers arrived at their conclusions, assess whether the design of the study is adequate to support them, and possibly identify shortcomings in the design that would affect the conclusions. After completing this course students should have an overall sense of the range of methodologies for data collection and analysis available to the social science researcher, and the elements of study design required to ensure the results will actually be informative. This is not a statistics or quantitative methods class, and there will be no systematic instruction in the use of statistical software, or other quantitative analysis of data. Students seeking training in social statistics should take a course in social statistics.

We will focus mostly on fiction, with a smaller emphasis given to poetry and creative nonfiction, and we will spend the semester using these modes of creative writing to engage imaginatively and thoughtfully with the world. We will work hard in these efforts. Learning to interpret and analyze what we read is invaluable in developing our own skills as writers; assigned readings (mostly from contemporary authors) will stimulate discussions and provide models for what creative writing is and can be. Students will be expected to share their own projects in a writing workshop setting.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

In the process, we hope to learn about China, but also to reflect\u2014in the light of 9/11 and Iraq-- more deeply on our own understanding of how American governance works\u2014and how it is seen by the world.
