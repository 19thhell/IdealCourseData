Research findings provide faculty with insight about gaps in student learning that can inform ongoing efforts to improve programs and learning opportunities.   At NYU, student learning outcomes assessment is an ongoing process of educational program improvement. Assessment fosters sustainable and evidence-based evaluation of student learning across courses, programs, units, and the institution as a whole.   Academic assessment is collaborative and guided by the institution's mission for excellence in teaching and learning. It also drives enhancements to existent academic and co-curricular programs by answering the research question: Have students learned what they should upon completion of the program?   All NYU schools participate in student learning assessment and have designated liaisons to collaborate with faculty and NYU's Office of Academic Assessment . In addition, the University-wide Academic Assessment Council , comprised of faculty and administrators, meets regularly to discuss teaching and learning issues, and to share best practices. These efforts aim to create and maintain a culture where evidence is used to shape pedagogy and learning.

Reporting directly to NYU's academic leadership, the OAA collaborates with the Office of Academic Program Review and the Office of Institutional Research and Program Evaluation to provide decision-making bodies with key insights from aggregated course, program, and institution-level student learning assessment results.   The Director consults with faculty, staff, and administrators to aid in their design, implementation, analysis, and use of assessment plans. To foster further growth of the student learning assessment program at NYU, the OAA sponsors numerous capacity building efforts on an annual basis, such as co-chairing an Assessment Council with the Vice Provost for Research and Faculty Affairs , organizing internal assessment training workshops for department heads, sponsoring participation in external workshops and conferences for faculty, providing competitive internal seed grants for new assessment initiatives, and offering one-on-one assessment consultation and feedback for new faculty, programs, and staff.       The primary functions of the OAA include:        Consult with departments and faculty to provide necessary training and support in the design, implementation, analysis, and use of student learning assessment plans.   Research, analyze, and document program, unit, and institutional efforts to expand student learning assessment at NYU.   Develop and maintain clear and simple policies to manage evidence of student learning assessment across the NYU academic community.   Provide meaningful capacity building opportunities for programs and faculty, such as grant opportunities for innovative assessment initiatives, internal workshops, and support for program representatives to participate in external assessment trainings and conferences.   Disseminate insights from recent developments and debates in human learning and assessment scholarship to campus assessment liaisons. Regularly examine how research based best practices may help inform the NYU assessment program.

Research findings provide faculty with insight about gaps in student learning that can inform ongoing efforts to improve programs and learning opportunities.   At NYU, student learning outcomes assessment is an ongoing process of educational program improvement. Assessment fosters sustainable and evidence-based evaluation of student learning across courses, programs, units, and the institution as a whole.   Academic assessment is collaborative and guided by the institution's mission for excellence in teaching and learning. It also drives enhancements to existent academic and co-curricular programs by answering the research question: Have students learned what they should upon completion of the program?   All NYU schools participate in student learning assessment and have designated liaisons to collaborate with faculty and NYU's Office of Academic Assessment . In addition, the University-wide Academic Assessment Council , comprised of faculty and administrators, meets regularly to discuss teaching and learning issues, and to share best practices. These efforts aim to create and maintain a culture where evidence is used to shape pedagogy and learning.

Research findings provide faculty with insight about gaps in student learning that can inform ongoing efforts to improve programs and learning opportunities.   At NYU, student learning outcomes assessment is an ongoing process of educational program improvement. Assessment fosters sustainable and evidence-based evaluation of student learning across courses, programs, units, and the institution as a whole.   Academic assessment is collaborative and guided by the institution's mission for excellence in teaching and learning. It also drives enhancements to existent academic and co-curricular programs by answering the research question: Have students learned what they should upon completion of the program?   All NYU schools participate in student learning assessment and have designated liaisons to collaborate with faculty and NYU's Office of Academic Assessment . In addition, the University-wide Academic Assessment Council , comprised of faculty and administrators, meets regularly to discuss teaching and learning issues, and to share best practices. These efforts aim to create and maintain a culture where evidence is used to shape pedagogy and learning.

Research findings provide faculty with insight about gaps in student learning that can inform ongoing efforts to improve programs and learning opportunities.   At NYU, student learning outcomes assessment is an ongoing process of educational program improvement. Assessment fosters sustainable and evidence-based evaluation of student learning across courses, programs, units, and the institution as a whole.   Academic assessment is collaborative and guided by the institution's mission for excellence in teaching and learning. It also drives enhancements to existent academic and co-curricular programs by answering the research question: Have students learned what they should upon completion of the program?   All NYU schools participate in student learning assessment and have designated liaisons to collaborate with faculty and NYU's Office of Academic Assessment . In addition, the University-wide Academic Assessment Council , comprised of faculty and administrators, meets regularly to discuss teaching and learning issues, and to share best practices. These efforts aim to create and maintain a culture where evidence is used to shape pedagogy and learning.
