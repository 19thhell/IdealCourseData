NYU has specialized Explorations communities in both the FYRE (First Year Residential Experience) and upper-class halls.   The theme in each community is explored through programs and activities which are planned by the Resident Assistant (RA), a Faculty Affiliate, and the residents on the floor.   Institutions across the country are recognizing the importance of creating and maintaining collaborative learning communities that cross traditional campus boundaries between the formal classroom and the residential setting. Research repeatedly supports that the degree to which a student persists and succeeds in a university setting is directly related to the establishment of a community and culture of learning across the campus.   NYU students indicate the Explorations program helps them connect with the University and each other quickly and meaningfully. As compared to other on campus students, Explorations participants reported that they were more likely to:     Have higher satisfaction with the programming offered in the residence halls   Have an easier time integrating to college   Connect quickly with faculty and staff on campus     Have an easier time meeting other students   Be satisfied with the room assignments process   Feel that living on campus enhanced their academic performance            How do I apply for an Explorations community?     Returning and Incoming students may access the Explorations application through the NYU Housing (re) application (available through NYUHome: Housing Forms).   After submitting information, there are a few additional questions you will be asked regarding your interest in particular Explorations themes.

Cool Science // Weinstein   Science provides a way to understand ourselves and the world in which we live.

There are a plethora of opportunities that only NYC can offer to a budding fashionista/fashionisto who is interested in this industry. The wide array of New York's fashion activities -- from museum and gallery exhibitions, to designer discussions, to vintage shopping -- can create a stable foundation of knowledge that will be forever helpful regardless of one's final destination. Fashion is a cumulative organism, constantly referencing its past history, as well as its cultural history (ranging from music, to cinema, to political climate), and adapting to its present time. The Fashion In New York City explorations floor will seek out opportunities to learn, explore, and experience the wonderful world of Fashion that exists and has existed in the city. We will discuss various moments in time that have had a major impact in fashion and how the industry has changed from it.

The genomes of many organisms have been sequenced, allowing us to decipher information encoded in their DNA in an unprecedented way.

We will participate in service projects throughout New York City's five boroughs as well as host documentary screenings and discussions about various service related topics. If interested, residents on this floor will have the opportunity to suggest and program their own service projects. Although Serve the City will be focused on building a tight-knit floor community, we will also occasionally reach out to other hall residents by inviting them to serve with us. During the fall semester, community members will discuss participating in either a domestic or international service trip over spring break.   Spirituality in NYC // Gramercy Green     Break out of your comfort zone. Engage with people of different faiths and backgrounds. Working with Faculty Affiliates Rabbi Yehuda Sarna and Imam Khalid Latif, you will meet leaders on the cutting edge of the spiritual landscape of NYC, visit global institutions such as the United Nations, and get trained in cross-faith bridge-building competencies. Open to everyone \u2013 you do not have to be an active member of any religion to be a part of this Explorations community.   Take-Offs and Landings // Gramercy Green     As NYU moves closer toward becoming a global network of campuses, we need to provide opportunities for students to connect with other students who are about to go abroad and those for those students who have recently returned. This floor would be a place for students to connect with the global network in both social and educational ways. Students will be able to participate in programming that is directly related to both study abroad sites and the very act of travel and studying abroad. For example, members might attend a performance of Argentine Tango Off-Broadway followed by a meal of empanadas prepared by a student who has recently returned from Buenos Aires. The after-performance discussion might take place while enjoying the empanadas and hearing a lecture/ slide show from a returning student. Other activities might include connecting with the travel bookshop Idlewild Books or bringing in travel experts to discuss things like staying connected while abroad or how to set up a Flickr account to store and organize all of your photos. I would be interested in bringing in experts from the health center to talk about specific issues related to health and safety while studying abroad.

NYU has specialized Explorations communities in both the FYRE (First Year Residential Experience) and upper-class halls.   The theme in each community is explored through programs and activities which are planned by the Resident Assistant (RA), a Faculty Affiliate, and the residents on the floor.   Institutions across the country are recognizing the importance of creating and maintaining collaborative learning communities that cross traditional campus boundaries between the formal classroom and the residential setting. Research repeatedly supports that the degree to which a student persists and succeeds in a university setting is directly related to the establishment of a community and culture of learning across the campus.   NYU students indicate the Explorations program helps them connect with the University and each other quickly and meaningfully. As compared to other on campus students, Explorations participants reported that they were more likely to:     Have higher satisfaction with the programming offered in the residence halls   Have an easier time integrating to college   Connect quickly with faculty and staff on campus     Have an easier time meeting other students   Be satisfied with the room assignments process   Feel that living on campus enhanced their academic performance            How do I apply for an Explorations community?     Returning and Incoming students may access the Explorations application through the NYU Housing (re) application (available through NYUHome: Housing Forms).   After submitting information, there are a few additional questions you will be asked regarding your interest in particular Explorations themes.

Big Apple, Big Screen // Brittany Hall     With filmmakers like Cassavetes and NYU alumni Martin Scorsese and Spike Lee working its streets, New York City has developed a rich history in cinema, and it remains a capital of the big screen. Big Apple, Big Screen will feature visits to neighborhood cinemas all over Manhattan, from the Magic Johnson on 125th to the Screening Room in Tribeca, in the two-fold effort to keep current with cinema and current with New York City. Discussions about cinema in general films in particular will take place over dinners or double espressos. In addition, students will get the unique opportunity to plan and curate a \u201cFilmathon\u201d for the NYU community during the Spring semester.   Contemporary Currents // Rubin Hall   Calling all first-year students who care about changing the status quo!

Essentially, what this floor is about can be summed up in two words: education and intervention. In other words, educate yourself, and then get involved!     Cool Science // Weinstein   Science provides a way to understand ourselves and the world in which we live. It allows us to peer at the most distance galaxies, and to study molecular changes within our cells. It provides powerful tools to cure disease and harvest new sources of energy. Yet it also raises ethical questions about the appropriate use of the new knowledge we gain. This Explorations floor is offered for all students who are interested in science. We welcome science majors, pre-medical students, and anyone who is curious about life and the cosmos. We will visit important scientific institutions in New York, including the American Museum of Natural History and the New York Academy of Sciences.

By exploring the cultures of the city through its manifold artistic expressions (e.g., film, theater, museum exhibits and the culinary arts), residents will simultaneously deepen their knowledge of its various communities and learn to think about urban experience as a socially and culturally embedded phenomenon. Whether viewing a classic film about racial tensions in a multi-ethnic neighborhood in Brooklyn or learning about the history of immigrant communities through food and the culinary arts, residents will be encouraged to think about cities as sites of local and global exchange and possibility.

Fashion in New York City // Rubin Hall   The excitement of New York City is palpable, and one thing that thrives in this fast pace environment is the fashion world. There are a plethora of opportunities that only NYC can offer to a budding fashionista/fashionisto who is interested in this industry. The wide array of New York's fashion activities -- from museum and gallery exhibitions, to designer discussions, to vintage shopping -- can create a stable foundation of knowledge that will be forever helpful regardless of one's final destination. Fashion is a cumulative organism, constantly referencing its past history, as well as its cultural history (ranging from music, to cinema, to political climate), and adapting to its present time. The Fashion In New York City explorations floor will seek out opportunities to learn, explore, and experience the wonderful world of Fashion that exists and has existed in the city. We will discuss various moments in time that have had a major impact in fashion and how the industry has changed from it.

New York City is a hub of activity for this subculture, and we will take advantage of it by attending midnight screenings and premiers, hosting TV marathons and book clubs, maybe attending a day of Comic Con and exploring the city for its own hidden geek hubs.

Previous events have included Sarah Silverman, Kathy Griffin, Demetri Martin, Avenue Q, Matilda on Broadway, a fully improvised musical, and a live taping of The Daily Show. Students are not required to be funny; they just need to love to laugh.     The Meaning of Food // Brittany Hall   Based on the PBS Documentary Series of the same name, The Meaning of Food is an exploration of culture through food. What we consume, how we acquire it, who prepares it, who\u2019s at the table, and who eats first is a form of communication that is rich with meaning. This explorations floor will introduce students to diverse cultures utilizing food and restaurants throughout New York City. Food will be explored through three lenses: food and life; food and family; and food and culture. Beyond merely nourishing the body, what we eat and with whom we eat can inspire and strengthen the bonds between individuals, communities and even countries. Residents will be able to discover attitudes, practices and rituals surrounding food. In addition to exploring restaurants in NYC, residents will watch documentary films, read common literature and participate in community service opportunities that will allow residents to give to those who lack their own food resources.

In addition to pursuing the more practical aspects of healthy living, our community will approach the subject of health as an intellectual field of research as well, interrogating some of its broader historical, political, and cultural implications, by hosting a series of lectures, screening documentary films as well as other activities. We may also explore developing a relationship between a local farmer and our residence hall community through a program called &quot;community supported agriculture,&quot; which brings local, seasonal, and organic produce into our community.

NYC in the 60s // Greenwich Hall   The 1960's was a groundbreaking era for many subcultures and movements in America. As the largest city in the country, New York acted as a center for change during this time. The city was host to such people and events as Andy Warhol, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, The Stonewall Inn Riots, demonstrations against the Vietnam War, the Great Blackout, and the founding of the Mets baseball team. The influences of the '60s still affect the city today, and traces of this decade can be found especially around NYU. Join this community for the opportunity to explore and learn more about this influential time in our dynamic city.     NYC Spotlight // Palladium Hall   Do you find yourself captivated by the stunning performances only found in the big apple? Join this floor to unravel the rich culture of New York's entertainment scene. From local music festivals to Broadway theatre spectacles, join us in delving into the city's artistic cornucopia. Come enjoy a broad range of music, film, and theatre; three of the main aspects that make NYC thrive. These are some of the main reasons that people come to the city - both to enjoy them and produce them. Take advantage of what the heart of the city has to offer. Perhaps you will see a concert at Lincoln Center, talk with an esteemed film director, or catch a Broadway show on the weekend. The possibilities are endless!   The Rainbow Roster: An LGBTQ and Ally Community // Lafayette Hall     The Rainbow Roster is designed for residents committed to community service and cultural development within the LGBTQ and Ally community. All are welcome, so long as they share a passion for the civil rights of all individuals, particularly historically under-represented populations. As a member of the Rainbow Roster, residents will learn about the rich lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer history that is unique to New York City. We will go on cultural outings around the boroughs, including Gay Men's Chorus concerts, musicals and plays, and film events. We will also go out into the community and work on service projects with organizations such as The Trevor Project, the Ali Forney Center, and the LGBT Community Center. The Rainbow Roster is a safe, accepting, and exciting community where residents can become more self-aware, community-conscious, and open-minded.   Science and Technology in the 21st Century // Palladium Hall   We are all witnessing tremendous advancements in the sciences--advancements that create societal benefits, conflicts, and contradictions. The genomes of many organisms have been sequenced, allowing us to decipher information encoded in their DNA in an unprecedented way. Will this lead to better medical treatments, or will it provide the means to create and organize new forms of bioterrorist weaponry? The World Wide Web has linked the continents, escalating communication and globalization. Will this catalyze societal homogenization in a desirable or undesirable way? Here at the onset of this centenary, the Science and Technology in the 21st Century community will explore current scientific and technological explorations, emphasizing the future prospects for change that discoveries in these areas will elicit. You will approach science and technologies not only from the vantage points of biology, chemistry, physics, math and computer, but also study their interface with law, business, economics, and the arts. And, New York City will be your laboratory!   Senior House // West 13th Street   The 13th Street Residence Hall has been selected as the location for Senior House, a smaller hall designed to provide more opportunity to know your neighbors and build better relationships. At the Senior House, you will experience hallmarks such as trips to the surrounding boroughs, personalized career services from the Wasserman Center, resources for thesis work such as an onsite copy machine, unique links to the Senior Class Council, and the Senior Year themed programming. We expect that students will not only build community within the Senior House, but also be able to have a capstone experience to make the Senior Year their best year yet at NYU!   Serve the City // Coral Tower   Serve the City is a community designed for upperclassmen who are passionate about community service and interested in humanitarian issues. We will participate in service projects throughout New York City's five boroughs as well as host documentary screenings and discussions about various service related topics. If interested, residents on this floor will have the opportunity to suggest and program their own service projects. Although Serve the City will be focused on building a tight-knit floor community, we will also occasionally reach out to other hall residents by inviting them to serve with us. During the fall semester, community members will discuss participating in either a domestic or international service trip over spring break.   Spirituality in NYC // Gramercy Green     Break out of your comfort zone. Engage with people of different faiths and backgrounds. Working with Faculty Affiliates Rabbi Yehuda Sarna and Imam Khalid Latif, you will meet leaders on the cutting edge of the spiritual landscape of NYC, visit global institutions such as the United Nations, and get trained in cross-faith bridge-building competencies. Open to everyone \u2013 you do not have to be an active member of any religion to be a part of this Explorations community.   Take-Offs and Landings // Gramercy Green     As NYU moves closer toward becoming a global network of campuses, we need to provide opportunities for students to connect with other students who are about to go abroad and those for those students who have recently returned. This floor would be a place for students to connect with the global network in both social and educational ways. Students will be able to participate in programming that is directly related to both study abroad sites and the very act of travel and studying abroad. For example, members might attend a performance of Argentine Tango Off-Broadway followed by a meal of empanadas prepared by a student who has recently returned from Buenos Aires. The after-performance discussion might take place while enjoying the empanadas and hearing a lecture/ slide show from a returning student. Other activities might include connecting with the travel bookshop Idlewild Books or bringing in travel experts to discuss things like staying connected while abroad or how to set up a Flickr account to store and organize all of your photos. I would be interested in bringing in experts from the health center to talk about specific issues related to health and safety while studying abroad.   Transfer Floor // Lafayette Hall     Join the inaugural year for the Transfer Explorations Community at NYU. This community will be comprised of transfer students in their first, second, and third years at NYU, offering opportunities to learn from each others' experiences and explore new facets of NYC together. Academic-related offerings will include optional seminars from campus partners, the opportunity for extra academic advising, and dedicated faculty leadership. The Transfer Explorations Community is the ideal location to base your second or third year in the NYU community.

Notice:    In an effort to adopt a more environmentally responsible application process, the Graduate School of Arts and Science is only accepting applications through their online system. Paper applications have been discontinued. Draper strongly encourages applicants to submit all application materials--including transcripts and letters of recommendation--via the online application system. Doing so helps minimize processing delays and also allows you to track the receipt of your application materials more effectively.

Where can I learn more about financial aid?    Helpful Resources       Bursar's office    Financial Aid office    Graduate Enrollment Services    GSAS' Application Resource Center    Office of International Students and Scholars                  General FAQ    Why should I apply to the Draper Program?    There are several possible reasons. Many students use the Draper Program as a transition between undergraduate and doctoral studies. While completing the requirements for the Draper master\u2019s degree, students clarify and refine questions that will be at the heart of their PhD research. Some students want to pursue a doctorate in a field that has little connection to their undergraduate work; in the Draper Program, they can begin to acquire fluency in conversations relevant to their new interests. If their doctoral intentions build on their undergraduate focus, they use Draper to establish a graduate-level scholarly record that increases the likelihood of a successful PhD application.    Other Draper students use the Program to choose among several possible PhD concentrations. If you want to earn a PhD but aren't sure which discipline best suits your research interests, the Draper Program lets you consider different disciplinary possibilities. Many of our students arrive at Draper intent on a particular discipline only to realize that they are more excited by another field of study.    Draper also suits those whose undergraduate focus does not resemble their current interests. A biology major, for instance, now wants to study urban anthropology. Or a musician or a visual artist or an accounting major and now wants to immerse in Derridian literary analyses or the philosophy of science.    Finally, Draper is a good place for you if you have no desire to pursue a doctorate but want to participate in the intellectual excitement and academic challenge of graduate school.       What do students do once they finish the Draper degree?    Because Draper student interest is so eclectic, there is not a typical alumnus profile. Many students make a successful transition into PhD programs, usually with full funding, in a diverse array of disciplines.    Many other alumni use their master's degrees to help them find jobs, to further careers they are already building, or to change careers completely. Our students work closely with NYU\u2019s Office of Career Services , where counselors guide students in writing effective resumes and cover letters, offer the chance to brush up on interview skills, and provide thousands of employment opportunities.    Draper students have found work in not-for-profit organizations, in banking and finance, in advertising and public relations, in government, in education, in arts organizations and museums and galleries, and at various media outlets, among many examples.       As a Draper student, where else within the University may I take classes?    You may take classes in most other departments within the Graduate School of Arts and Science. Comparative Literature, Anthropology, English, History, Sociology, Hebrew and Judaic Studies, Journalism, Latin American and Caribbean Studies, and Politics, among others, regularly list courses with the Draper Program. There are also many courses not listed within Draper that our students are welcome to take. Occasionally there are limitations on course choice within GSAS. Some classes are designated exclusively for upper-level PhD students. Some classes have limits on enrollment and give first priority to the host department's students. Science, mathematics, and economics courses require that you demonstrate adequate prerequisite training.       Who teaches in the Draper Program?    All Draper faculty hold a PhD or equivalent terminal degree; none of our courses are taught by graduate students.       When may I start my studies?    Students are admitted to the Program in the fall and spring. The deadline for fall admission is July 1; for spring admission, December 1. Admissions meetings take place frequently so if a candidate submits an application well ahead of the deadlines, notification is made in advance.       How many students are in the Draper Program?    At the start of the Fall 2009 semester, there were 112 students in the Draper Program.          How long does it take to complete the Draper master's degree?    Students may study full-time or part-time. Part-time study means one or two courses per semester; full-time study is three courses. Students often choose to take courses during the summer as well, in one or both of two summer sessions. The standard pace for full-time students is about 15 months -- two semesters plus the summer for course work and then one more semester for writing the thesis. The average time to degree is about two years, but the Graduate School allows up to five years from the first semester of enrollment.       May students take classes in more than one area of inquiry?    Certainly. Our six areas provide the intellectual organization for the Program but in no way restrict course choices or course access. Most Draper students take courses in several areas; some take courses in all six.       How much does the Draper master's degree cost? The Graduate School offers Draper students a scholarship that reduces tuition by 30 percent. It will be applied to coursework that meets the program's requirements and is taken within the first six semesters of enrollment, including summers. Please note that this financial aid award is for tuition points only; it does not include registration fees or health insurance. The Draper degree requires 32 points of coursework; most courses are four points each. Based on the rates for the 201-2015 academic year, the approximate cost of tuition and fees for the entire degree, for a student attending Draper full-time with the 30-percent scholarship would be $39,185. The total cost without the scholarship would be $54,103. Total tuition and fees will vary for students who take less than a full-time course load and with the University\u2019s anticipated annual increase in tuition and fees. Draper's tuition is determined by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and is based on the number of points a student takes each semester. The Draper tuition rate for 2014-2015 academic year can be found on the Bursar's website, here . Rates for the 2014-2015 academic year have not yet been determined.   Is there financial aid? Are there teaching or research assistantships? Draper-specific aid is offered in the form of the tuition scholarship described in the above answer. Teaching and research assistantships are not available through the Program. Students who obtain awards from recognized funding sources outside of NYU (e.g., foundations, private institutions, government agencies) can apply for additional awards toward tuition through the Graduate School's Tuition Incentive Program (TIP). Details about TIP eligibility criteria can be found here . Applicants should also consult this page for more information about financial aid and a list of other resources for finding additional funding.        How many students apply to the Draper Program and how many are admitted?    Last year we received 412 applications. Slightly fewer than 40 percent of them were accepted, making Draper one the most competitive master\u2019s programs in the country. A successful applicant writes well and clearly, has an undergraduate transcript that demonstrates ability and intelligence, and can articulate a goal (or goals) for graduate study.          Admission FAQ    Application    Since the John W. Draper Interdisciplinary Master's Program in Humanities and Social Thought is part of NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science, all applicants must apply to the program via GSAS' general online application .    What are the basic requirements of the Draper application?    All students applying to the Draper Program must submit the following materials with their general GSAS application:       Official Academic transcripts from the applicant's undergraduate institution, as well as any other colleges at which he/she completed coursework.    GRE (and TOEFL , if applicable) test scores. General test scores for the GRE (rather than subject test scores) are sufficient.    Three letters of recommendation    A resume or Curriculum Vitae    A Draper-specific statement of purpose    Please note: In addition to the materials above, all applicants to Draper must submit an application fee .    The above information can also be found on GSAS' downloadable \"Application Requirements and Deadlines\".pdf at the NYU GSAS Application Resource Center . ( Please note : On this .pdf, the Draper Program is alphabetized under \"Humanities and Social Thought.\")       What is the minimum GRE score required for admittance into the program? How heavily does the admissions committee weigh GRE scores?    Draper does not keep records on the range of our students' GRE scores, nor do we have a minimum score for acceptance to the program. Our admissions committee looks at applications as a whole, primarily considering an applicant's statement of purpose , as well as letters of recommendation and previous academic work. A strong GRE score is more likely to help an application that may have weaknesses, than a weak GRE score is likely to hurt an otherwise strong application.    If you are still concerned about your GRE scores, you can include a brief statement in the application to put the score into some context for the admissions committee. There is a special section in the application which allows applicants to include any pertinent information that they were not able to provide elsewhere.       Who is required to take the TOEFL? Is there a recommended score for admission?    Students whose native language is not English or who did not receive an undergraduate or advanced degree from an English-language institution must demonstrate proficiency on the TOEFL. We recommend a minimum score of 650 on the paper test, 280 on the computer version, or 114 on the Internet version.    International applicants can refer here for more information on the TOEFL and other FAQs.       What should be in my statement of purpose?    Write about why you think an interdisciplinary program will help you meet your academic goals. What are you longer-term scholarly plans? If you could imagine a master's thesis topic, what might that be? (Don't worry, if you're admitted you can change your mind many times between the start of your degree and its completion.) It may help if you refer to our current course listings to get an idea of our offerings.       Should I include a writing sample?    Draper does not require a writing sample, and as such, if you submit one as part of your application, we cannot guarantee that all members of the admissions committee will read it. You are welcome to include supplementary materials that you think will be helpful to your application, but we encourage applicants to consider Draper's statement of purpose to be the primary--and most important--written element of the application. The committee will look to this statement for evidence of your writing ability and a well-defined research project that fits well in our program's interdisciplinary structure.       Whom should I ask for recommendation letters? What sort of recommendation letters are most effective/useful?    Academic recommendations from professors or advisors with whom an applicant has studied are most useful to the admissions committee and are preferred. If you are unable to obtain three letters from professors or academic advisors, try to get as many as you can. (We suggest that when approaching faculty about recommendations, you provide as much information as possible about yourself\u2014a recent transcript, CV, and/or copies of academic papers are very useful, as well as information about your plans for future study.)    If you are unable to provide letters from three academic references, professional references from people who can discuss your abilities as a researcher or writer are acceptable. Character references from friends, family, or religious advisors are less useful to our admissions committee.    For more information about submitting letters of recommendation, please see GSAS' \"Letters of Recommendation FAQs\" .pdf, under \"Frequently Asked Questions,\" here .       I've submitted my application--when will I receive my admissions decision?    Our admissions committee does its best to return admissions decisions to applicants within a month of receiving their completed applications from Graduate Enrollment Services (GES). It does take time for applications to be processed through GES, so this time frame may vary slightly. If you are facing a specific deadline and would like us to expedite your application's review, please email us at draper.program@nyu.edu after you have submitted your application and our admissions committee will do its best to honor your request.       How are admissions decisions made?    The Draper Admissions Committee is made up of Draper faculty as well as the director and the associate director of the Program. We look for an undergraduate record that demonstrates strong academic training, letters of recommendation that speak to the candidate's specific strengths as a student and potential as a scholar, and a statement of purpose that elaborates an intellectual goal attainable through interdisciplinary study. Admissions meetings take place approximately every two to three weeks starting in late April and continuing through mid-July. Applicants are notified of admissions decisions as soon as possible after the meeting in which their material is considered.       I've been accepted to Draper; May I defer my admission? What is the deferral process?    GSAS Policy allows all admitted students to defer their enrollment for up to one academic year. In order to defer, please email draper.program[at]nyu.edu stating your wish to defer and the semester in which you wish to begin. Draper will forward your request, with our approval, to Graduate Enrollment Services. GES will then generate an email to you with instructions on officially logging your deferral as well as sending in your $250 tuition deposit, required to hold your space.    It will then be your responsibility to keep track of registration dates and deadlines for the semester you begin. We generally suggest that students keep track of these by signing up for Draper's listserv and checking announcements on our 'News and Events' page .    Please note : GES only permits students to defer for one academic year. Requests to extend a deferral will not be approved. If you are unable to enroll in the semester that you deferred to, you will need to submit a new application.       Visiting NYU and Draper    May I sit in on a class session?    Attending a class session as a prospective student can be arranged at the discretion of our faculty. If you are interested in sitting in on a class, please review our current semester's schedule (located on our Academic Program page); if there are any Draper courses that you are particuarly interested in, please email us at draper.program@nyu.edu and we will see if you might be able to attend a session. Draper will not be able to arrange for students to sit in on crosslisted courses.       I'm unfamiliar with the NYU campus. Are tours available?    The Office of Graduate Life offers tours for prospective and newly admitted graduate students each Friday. For more information, please see their Web site .    The Student Resource Center's \" Graduate Life \" website also has information on other resources that might be useful to you during your visit.       May I meet with someone at Draper?    If you are interested in scheduling a meeting to discuss your potential course of study, the program, or the application process in more detail, please contact Draper directly at draper.program@nyu.edu .    Please Note : These informal meetings are intended to address prospective students' questions and concerns. They are not application interviews. Draper does not formally interview applicants, nor will meetings with the program administrator have any bearing on a prospective student's application.       Where can I learn more about financial aid?    NYU's Financial Aid Office has counselors who will meet with prospective students to discuss potential aid and financing options. Please see the Financial Aid Web site for more information. International students may find useful financial aid information on the Office of International Students and Scholars Web site .

NYU has specialized Explorations communities in both the FYRE (First Year Residential Experience) and upper-class halls.   The theme in each community is explored through programs and activities which are planned by the Resident Assistant (RA), a Faculty Affiliate, and the residents on the floor.   Institutions across the country are recognizing the importance of creating and maintaining collaborative learning communities that cross traditional campus boundaries between the formal classroom and the residential setting. Research repeatedly supports that the degree to which a student persists and succeeds in a university setting is directly related to the establishment of a community and culture of learning across the campus.   NYU students indicate the Explorations program helps them connect with the University and each other quickly and meaningfully. As compared to other on campus students, Explorations participants reported that they were more likely to:     Have higher satisfaction with the programming offered in the residence halls   Have an easier time integrating to college   Connect quickly with faculty and staff on campus     Have an easier time meeting other students   Be satisfied with the room assignments process   Feel that living on campus enhanced their academic performance            How do I apply for an Explorations community?     Returning and Incoming students may access the Explorations application through the NYU Housing (re) application (available through NYUHome: Housing Forms).   After submitting information, there are a few additional questions you will be asked regarding your interest in particular Explorations themes.

Science and Technology in the 21st Century // Palladium Hall   We are all witnessing tremendous advancements in the sciences--advancements that create societal benefits, conflicts, and contradictions. The genomes of many organisms have been sequenced, allowing us to decipher information encoded in their DNA in an unprecedented way. Will this lead to better medical treatments, or will it provide the means to create and organize new forms of bioterrorist weaponry? The World Wide Web has linked the continents, escalating communication and globalization. Will this catalyze societal homogenization in a desirable or undesirable way? Here at the onset of this centenary, the Science and Technology in the 21st Century community will explore current scientific and technological explorations, emphasizing the future prospects for change that discoveries in these areas will elicit.

Take-Offs and Landings // Gramercy Green     As NYU moves closer toward becoming a global network of campuses, we need to provide opportunities for students to connect with other students who are about to go abroad and those for those students who have recently returned. This floor would be a place for students to connect with the global network in both social and educational ways. Students will be able to participate in programming that is directly related to both study abroad sites and the very act of travel and studying abroad. For example, members might attend a performance of Argentine Tango Off-Broadway followed by a meal of empanadas prepared by a student who has recently returned from Buenos Aires. The after-performance discussion might take place while enjoying the empanadas and hearing a lecture/ slide show from a returning student. Other activities might include connecting with the travel bookshop Idlewild Books or bringing in travel experts to discuss things like staying connected while abroad or how to set up a Flickr account to store and organize all of your photos. I would be interested in bringing in experts from the health center to talk about specific issues related to health and safety while studying abroad.

Helpful Resources       Bursar's office    Financial Aid office    Graduate Enrollment Services    GSAS' Application Resource Center    Office of International Students and Scholars                  General FAQ    Why should I apply to the Draper Program?    There are several possible reasons. Many students use the Draper Program as a transition between undergraduate and doctoral studies. While completing the requirements for the Draper master\u2019s degree, students clarify and refine questions that will be at the heart of their PhD research. Some students want to pursue a doctorate in a field that has little connection to their undergraduate work; in the Draper Program, they can begin to acquire fluency in conversations relevant to their new interests. If their doctoral intentions build on their undergraduate focus, they use Draper to establish a graduate-level scholarly record that increases the likelihood of a successful PhD application.    Other Draper students use the Program to choose among several possible PhD concentrations. If you want to earn a PhD but aren't sure which discipline best suits your research interests, the Draper Program lets you consider different disciplinary possibilities. Many of our students arrive at Draper intent on a particular discipline only to realize that they are more excited by another field of study.    Draper also suits those whose undergraduate focus does not resemble their current interests. A biology major, for instance, now wants to study urban anthropology. Or a musician or a visual artist or an accounting major and now wants to immerse in Derridian literary analyses or the philosophy of science.    Finally, Draper is a good place for you if you have no desire to pursue a doctorate but want to participate in the intellectual excitement and academic challenge of graduate school.       What do students do once they finish the Draper degree?    Because Draper student interest is so eclectic, there is not a typical alumnus profile. Many students make a successful transition into PhD programs, usually with full funding, in a diverse array of disciplines.    Many other alumni use their master's degrees to help them find jobs, to further careers they are already building, or to change careers completely. Our students work closely with NYU\u2019s Office of Career Services , where counselors guide students in writing effective resumes and cover letters, offer the chance to brush up on interview skills, and provide thousands of employment opportunities.    Draper students have found work in not-for-profit organizations, in banking and finance, in advertising and public relations, in government, in education, in arts organizations and museums and galleries, and at various media outlets, among many examples.       As a Draper student, where else within the University may I take classes?    You may take classes in most other departments within the Graduate School of Arts and Science. Comparative Literature, Anthropology, English, History, Sociology, Hebrew and Judaic Studies, Journalism, Latin American and Caribbean Studies, and Politics, among others, regularly list courses with the Draper Program. There are also many courses not listed within Draper that our students are welcome to take. Occasionally there are limitations on course choice within GSAS. Some classes are designated exclusively for upper-level PhD students. Some classes have limits on enrollment and give first priority to the host department's students. Science, mathematics, and economics courses require that you demonstrate adequate prerequisite training.       Who teaches in the Draper Program?    All Draper faculty hold a PhD or equivalent terminal degree; none of our courses are taught by graduate students.       When may I start my studies?    Students are admitted to the Program in the fall and spring. The deadline for fall admission is July 1; for spring admission, December 1. Admissions meetings take place frequently so if a candidate submits an application well ahead of the deadlines, notification is made in advance.       How many students are in the Draper Program?    At the start of the Fall 2009 semester, there were 112 students in the Draper Program.          How long does it take to complete the Draper master's degree?    Students may study full-time or part-time. Part-time study means one or two courses per semester; full-time study is three courses. Students often choose to take courses during the summer as well, in one or both of two summer sessions. The standard pace for full-time students is about 15 months -- two semesters plus the summer for course work and then one more semester for writing the thesis. The average time to degree is about two years, but the Graduate School allows up to five years from the first semester of enrollment.       May students take classes in more than one area of inquiry?    Certainly. Our six areas provide the intellectual organization for the Program but in no way restrict course choices or course access. Most Draper students take courses in several areas; some take courses in all six.       How much does the Draper master's degree cost? The Graduate School offers Draper students a scholarship that reduces tuition by 30 percent. It will be applied to coursework that meets the program's requirements and is taken within the first six semesters of enrollment, including summers. Please note that this financial aid award is for tuition points only; it does not include registration fees or health insurance. The Draper degree requires 32 points of coursework; most courses are four points each. Based on the rates for the 201-2015 academic year, the approximate cost of tuition and fees for the entire degree, for a student attending Draper full-time with the 30-percent scholarship would be $39,185. The total cost without the scholarship would be $54,103. Total tuition and fees will vary for students who take less than a full-time course load and with the University\u2019s anticipated annual increase in tuition and fees. Draper's tuition is determined by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and is based on the number of points a student takes each semester. The Draper tuition rate for 2014-2015 academic year can be found on the Bursar's website, here . Rates for the 2014-2015 academic year have not yet been determined.   Is there financial aid? Are there teaching or research assistantships? Draper-specific aid is offered in the form of the tuition scholarship described in the above answer. Teaching and research assistantships are not available through the Program. Students who obtain awards from recognized funding sources outside of NYU (e.g., foundations, private institutions, government agencies) can apply for additional awards toward tuition through the Graduate School's Tuition Incentive Program (TIP). Details about TIP eligibility criteria can be found here . Applicants should also consult this page for more information about financial aid and a list of other resources for finding additional funding.        How many students apply to the Draper Program and how many are admitted?    Last year we received 412 applications. Slightly fewer than 40 percent of them were accepted, making Draper one the most competitive master\u2019s programs in the country. A successful applicant writes well and clearly, has an undergraduate transcript that demonstrates ability and intelligence, and can articulate a goal (or goals) for graduate study.          Admission FAQ    Application    Since the John W. Draper Interdisciplinary Master's Program in Humanities and Social Thought is part of NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science, all applicants must apply to the program via GSAS' general online application .    What are the basic requirements of the Draper application?    All students applying to the Draper Program must submit the following materials with their general GSAS application:       Official Academic transcripts from the applicant's undergraduate institution, as well as any other colleges at which he/she completed coursework.    GRE (and TOEFL , if applicable) test scores. General test scores for the GRE (rather than subject test scores) are sufficient.    Three letters of recommendation    A resume or Curriculum Vitae    A Draper-specific statement of purpose    Please note: In addition to the materials above, all applicants to Draper must submit an application fee .    The above information can also be found on GSAS' downloadable \"Application Requirements and Deadlines\".pdf at the NYU GSAS Application Resource Center . ( Please note : On this .pdf, the Draper Program is alphabetized under \"Humanities and Social Thought.\")       What is the minimum GRE score required for admittance into the program? How heavily does the admissions committee weigh GRE scores?    Draper does not keep records on the range of our students' GRE scores, nor do we have a minimum score for acceptance to the program. Our admissions committee looks at applications as a whole, primarily considering an applicant's statement of purpose , as well as letters of recommendation and previous academic work. A strong GRE score is more likely to help an application that may have weaknesses, than a weak GRE score is likely to hurt an otherwise strong application.    If you are still concerned about your GRE scores, you can include a brief statement in the application to put the score into some context for the admissions committee. There is a special section in the application which allows applicants to include any pertinent information that they were not able to provide elsewhere.       Who is required to take the TOEFL? Is there a recommended score for admission?    Students whose native language is not English or who did not receive an undergraduate or advanced degree from an English-language institution must demonstrate proficiency on the TOEFL. We recommend a minimum score of 650 on the paper test, 280 on the computer version, or 114 on the Internet version.    International applicants can refer here for more information on the TOEFL and other FAQs.       What should be in my statement of purpose?    Write about why you think an interdisciplinary program will help you meet your academic goals. What are you longer-term scholarly plans? If you could imagine a master's thesis topic, what might that be? (Don't worry, if you're admitted you can change your mind many times between the start of your degree and its completion.) It may help if you refer to our current course listings to get an idea of our offerings.       Should I include a writing sample?    Draper does not require a writing sample, and as such, if you submit one as part of your application, we cannot guarantee that all members of the admissions committee will read it. You are welcome to include supplementary materials that you think will be helpful to your application, but we encourage applicants to consider Draper's statement of purpose to be the primary--and most important--written element of the application. The committee will look to this statement for evidence of your writing ability and a well-defined research project that fits well in our program's interdisciplinary structure.       Whom should I ask for recommendation letters? What sort of recommendation letters are most effective/useful?    Academic recommendations from professors or advisors with whom an applicant has studied are most useful to the admissions committee and are preferred. If you are unable to obtain three letters from professors or academic advisors, try to get as many as you can. (We suggest that when approaching faculty about recommendations, you provide as much information as possible about yourself\u2014a recent transcript, CV, and/or copies of academic papers are very useful, as well as information about your plans for future study.)    If you are unable to provide letters from three academic references, professional references from people who can discuss your abilities as a researcher or writer are acceptable. Character references from friends, family, or religious advisors are less useful to our admissions committee.    For more information about submitting letters of recommendation, please see GSAS' \"Letters of Recommendation FAQs\" .pdf, under \"Frequently Asked Questions,\" here .       I've submitted my application--when will I receive my admissions decision?    Our admissions committee does its best to return admissions decisions to applicants within a month of receiving their completed applications from Graduate Enrollment Services (GES). It does take time for applications to be processed through GES, so this time frame may vary slightly. If you are facing a specific deadline and would like us to expedite your application's review, please email us at draper.program@nyu.edu after you have submitted your application and our admissions committee will do its best to honor your request.       How are admissions decisions made?    The Draper Admissions Committee is made up of Draper faculty as well as the director and the associate director of the Program. We look for an undergraduate record that demonstrates strong academic training, letters of recommendation that speak to the candidate's specific strengths as a student and potential as a scholar, and a statement of purpose that elaborates an intellectual goal attainable through interdisciplinary study. Admissions meetings take place approximately every two to three weeks starting in late April and continuing through mid-July. Applicants are notified of admissions decisions as soon as possible after the meeting in which their material is considered.       I've been accepted to Draper; May I defer my admission? What is the deferral process?    GSAS Policy allows all admitted students to defer their enrollment for up to one academic year. In order to defer, please email draper.program[at]nyu.edu stating your wish to defer and the semester in which you wish to begin. Draper will forward your request, with our approval, to Graduate Enrollment Services. GES will then generate an email to you with instructions on officially logging your deferral as well as sending in your $250 tuition deposit, required to hold your space.    It will then be your responsibility to keep track of registration dates and deadlines for the semester you begin. We generally suggest that students keep track of these by signing up for Draper's listserv and checking announcements on our 'News and Events' page .    Please note : GES only permits students to defer for one academic year. Requests to extend a deferral will not be approved. If you are unable to enroll in the semester that you deferred to, you will need to submit a new application.       Visiting NYU and Draper    May I sit in on a class session?    Attending a class session as a prospective student can be arranged at the discretion of our faculty. If you are interested in sitting in on a class, please review our current semester's schedule (located on our Academic Program page); if there are any Draper courses that you are particuarly interested in, please email us at draper.program@nyu.edu and we will see if you might be able to attend a session. Draper will not be able to arrange for students to sit in on crosslisted courses.       I'm unfamiliar with the NYU campus. Are tours available?    The Office of Graduate Life offers tours for prospective and newly admitted graduate students each Friday. For more information, please see their Web site .    The Student Resource Center's \" Graduate Life \" website also has information on other resources that might be useful to you during your visit.       May I meet with someone at Draper?    If you are interested in scheduling a meeting to discuss your potential course of study, the program, or the application process in more detail, please contact Draper directly at draper.program@nyu.edu .    Please Note : These informal meetings are intended to address prospective students' questions and concerns. They are not application interviews. Draper does not formally interview applicants, nor will meetings with the program administrator have any bearing on a prospective student's application.       Where can I learn more about financial aid?    NYU's Financial Aid Office has counselors who will meet with prospective students to discuss potential aid and financing options. Please see the Financial Aid Web site for more information. International students may find useful financial aid information on the Office of International Students and Scholars Web site .

Draper Program offers a broad interdisciplinary curriculum founded on the belief that many issues in the humanities and social sciences are most fruitfully explored through cross-disciplinary approaches. Accommodating methods and subject matter from varied modes of inquiry, the Program combines curricular flexibility with scholarly rigor. Founded in 1976 as a member of the Association of Graduate Liberal Studies Programs and restructured in 1995, the Draper Program is one of the largest and best-known interdisciplinary graduate programs in the country.
