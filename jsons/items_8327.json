San Diego   Bio &amp; Publications                          About the Course   The relationship of the brain to behavior, beginning with the basic elements that make up the nervous system and how electrical and chemical signals in the brain work to effect behavior. Using this foundation, we examine how the brain learns and how it creates new behaviors, together with the brian mechanisms that are involved in sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the experience of emotions, perception and cognition, memory and the brain's plasticity. Other key topics include whether certain behavioral disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be accounted for by changes in the function of the brain, and how drugs can alter behavior and brain function.

Students will analyze scientific research papers and discuss the dissemination of results to the general public. Students will be assigned a scientific article in the field of neuroscience to present to the class. Students will critique both scientific journal articles and corresponding popular press articles, discussing the strengths and weakness of each article. Topics of discussion will include: How are the innovations in the field of neuroscience communicated to the public? What details are edited and filtered out when communicating neuroscience to the public? What is the right balance for communicating research and should limitations be included? What findings are typically highlighted in popular media and why? Students will also discuss the impact of neuroscience research on shaping government policy. and contemporary publications in the field.            Development and Dysfunction of the Nervous System  NEURL-UA 305  Prerequisites: NEURL-UA 100 (Intro to Neuro) and NEURL-UA 210 (Cell & Molec NB), or permission of the instructor  Instructor: Sanes  Semester: Spring  4 points     This course will explore how the nervous system develops in normal animals, and how genetic and epigenetic factors can disrupt these processes. Lectures on normal developmental mechanisms will be interleaved with those on disorders to provide a solid foundation for our discussions of abnormal events during maturation. The lectures on normal development cover a broad range of topics including differentiation, axon outgrowth, synapse formation, specificity of connections, and plasticity. The lectures on dysfunction include autism, dyslexia, mental retardation, specific language impairment, hearing loss, blindness, ADHD, demyelinating or neurodegenerative disorders, and axon regeneration. The major goals of the course will be to understand the extent to which current theories can explain the etiology of each disorder, and to learn how basic research can best facilitate advances in our knowledge and, ultimately, lead to treatments or cures.

Introduction-a few basics  The objective of a neurological exam is threefold.     To identify an abnormality in the nervous system.    To differentiated peripheral from central nervous system lesions.     To establish internal consistency, i.e. does the patient cooperate fully? and are the findings in a specific patient only a variant of normality?         Preparing the Patient and yourself for the exam                The neurological exam The neurological exam can be divided into seven areas. The outline below should be memorized. Having immediate recall of this outline allows the examiner to quickly proceed through the exam without omitting any sections. The exam should be performed in an organized, step-wise manner.            Please choose a lesson by clicking on it.     I General Appearance, including posture, motor activity, vital signs and perhaps meningeal signs if indicated.    II Mini Mental Status Exam, including speech observation.    III Cranial Nerves, I through XII.    IV Motor System, including muscle atrophy, tone and power.    V Sensory System, including vibration, position, pin prick, temperature, light touch and higher sensory functions.    VI Reflexes, including deep tendon reflexes, clonus, Hoffman's response and plantar reflex.    VII Coordination, gait and Rhomberg's Test    Examining the comatose patient     Throughout these lessons you will see blue text (like this for example).

San Diego   Bio &amp; Publications                          About the Course   The relationship of the brain to behavior, beginning with the basic elements that make up the nervous system and how electrical and chemical signals in the brain work to effect behavior. Using this foundation, we examine how the brain learns and how it creates new behaviors, together with the brian mechanisms that are involved in sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the experience of emotions, perception and cognition, memory and the brain's plasticity. Other key topics include whether certain behavioral disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be accounted for by changes in the function of the brain, and how drugs can alter behavior and brain function.

Students will analyze scientific research papers and discuss the dissemination of results to the general public. Students will be assigned a scientific article in the field of neuroscience to present to the class. Students will critique both scientific journal articles and corresponding popular press articles, discussing the strengths and weakness of each article. Topics of discussion will include: How are the innovations in the field of neuroscience communicated to the public? What details are edited and filtered out when communicating neuroscience to the public? What is the right balance for communicating research and should limitations be included? What findings are typically highlighted in popular media and why? Students will also discuss the impact of neuroscience research on shaping government policy. and contemporary publications in the field.            Development and Dysfunction of the Nervous System  NEURL-UA 305  Prerequisites: NEURL-UA 100 (Intro to Neuro) and NEURL-UA 210 (Cell & Molec NB), or permission of the instructor  Instructor: Sanes  Semester: Spring  4 points     This course will explore how the nervous system develops in normal animals, and how genetic and epigenetic factors can disrupt these processes. Lectures on normal developmental mechanisms will be interleaved with those on disorders to provide a solid foundation for our discussions of abnormal events during maturation. The lectures on normal development cover a broad range of topics including differentiation, axon outgrowth, synapse formation, specificity of connections, and plasticity. The lectures on dysfunction include autism, dyslexia, mental retardation, specific language impairment, hearing loss, blindness, ADHD, demyelinating or neurodegenerative disorders, and axon regeneration. The major goals of the course will be to understand the extent to which current theories can explain the etiology of each disorder, and to learn how basic research can best facilitate advances in our knowledge and, ultimately, lead to treatments or cures.
