Helioseismic data have also allowed us to study properties of stellar matter. NASA's Kepler mission has allowed us to undertake seismic studies of other stars. While the field is not yet fully developed and we are still learning the best way to analyze the data, asteroseismic studies of stars has already produced exciting results. In this talk I shall review what asteroseismology is, how we interpret asteroseismic data, and then talk about some of the exciting results obtained with data from Kepler.

I will present recent results from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), the largest cosmological redshift survey to date. I will focus on measurements of the growth of structure, both at large scales where cosmic structure is close to linear, and at small scales where clustering is fully non-linear. For the former, interpreting the data is straightforward but sample variance limits constraining power. For the latter, modeling non-linear clustering requires more care, but measurement errors are minimized. Using data at all scales unlocks the true potential of redshift surveys to constrain the origin of the cosmic acceleration.

Time permitting I will also present an explicit discrete model of this, which I recently proposed with Pastawski, Preskill, and Yoshida.

The plasma membrane is known to be laterally heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity is believed to have a functional role, modulating cellular repsonses by spatiotemporal control of signaling proteins. Cholesterol is the most abundant component (by mole percent) in the membrane, and is known to control membrane heterogeneity in model systems. I will present a new view of the nanoscale structure and dynamics of cholesterol rich, lipid bilayer liquid phases, obtained through a combination of NMR, neutron scattering, and molecular simulation on special purpose hardware. The transport of lipids is observed to be strongly subdiffusive on biologically relevant timescales. A possible functional role for subdiffusive transport of membrane components will be proposed, within the context of arguments put forth by Berg and Purcell nearly 40 years ago.

While some of the questions regarding the beginning and end of the universe are well known and publicized, what it is not commonly recognized that asking fundamental questions at or above the atomic level have lead to major scientific revolutions. I will describe in this talk how condensed matter physics at sizes approaching atomic dimensions (\u201cnanostructures\u201d) is revolutionizing basic concepts in physics, chemistry and biology. When the size of a material approaches that of an atom its properties change radically. I will describe several exciting and new directions in the field of oxides, spintronics, and organic materials. The new physics evolving from this research may lead to novel applications which cannot be predicted at present, but which surely will revolutionize electronics, medicine, and engineering. This colloquium, accessible to non-experts, will be dedicated to highlighting the recent scientific advances in the field and possible new directions.

When two dissimilar materials are in close physical proximity the properties of each one may be radically modified or occasionally a completely new material emerges. In a series of recent studies, we have investigated the magnetic properties of different hybrids of ferromagnets (Ni, Co and Fe) and oxides which undergo metal-insulator and structural phase transitions. Both the static as well as dynamical properties of the ferromagnets are drastically affected. Static properties such as the coercivity, anisotropy and magnetization [1-3] and dynamical properties such as the microwave response are clearly modified by the proximity effect and give raise to interesting perhaps useful properties.

Optical properties of semiconductor microcavities are governed by bosonic quasi-particles named cavity polaritons, which are light-matter mixed states. Cavity polaritons propagate like photons, but interact strongly with their environment via their matter component. Patterning of semiconductor microcavities on a micron scale allows confining polaritons in photonic circuits or in lattices.      After a general introduction on cavity polaritons, I will illustrate the diversity of physical problems that can be addressed in this non-linear photonic system using patterned microstructures.I will show that taking advantage of the giant non-linearities induced by polariton interaction it is possible to realize photonic circuits in which coherent polaritons are propagated and optically manipulated.     The second part of the talk will be dedicated to the physics of polaritons in lattices. I will show that we can implement complex Hamiltonians and thus develop a new platform for quantum emulation. For instance, we have demonstrated a fractal energy spectrum for polaritons by engineering a quasi-periodic lattice. It becomes possible to explore the physics of non-linear wavepackets in such complex environment. Polaritons are also very promising for the investigation of graphene physics using honeycomb lattices. For instance, Dirac cones are directly imaged in the polariton far field emission. Finally we recently fabricated lattices holding non dispersive bands. In such flat bands, kinetic energy frustration dramatically modifies the spontaneous spatial coherence of polariton condensates.

High-energy emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts: advancing our knowledge on GRBs and relativistic shocks through modeling of afterglow radiation             The physical origin of the temporally extended (~10^2 sec) high-energy emission (0.1-100 GeV) detected from Gamma-Ray Bursts by the Fermi/LAT instrument has not yet been completely understood. I present the evidences in favour of the external shock scenario, where the LAT emission is interpreted as radiation from electrons accelerated at the relativistic shock developed in interactions with the external medium. I show that the modelling of LAT lightcurves not only reveals specific features consistent with the proposed interpretation, but also has predictive power on parameters entering the shock physics and the physics of the prompt emission mechanism. Extension of this study to include X-ray and optical afterglow data reveals that broadband modelling within the external shock scenario is always successful for the sample of GRBs with LAT temporally extended emission (10 events), and leads to two possibilities: either the X-ray emitting electrons (unlike the GeV emitting electrons) are in slow cooling regime or ii) the X-ray flux is strongly suppressed by Compton cooling, whereas, due to Klein-Nishina, the suppression is negligible at GeV energies. In both cases the LAT flux is a more robust proxy for the blastwave energy than the X-ray flux. On average, both cases require weak magnetic fields and relatively large blastwave energies. These large energies left in the blastwave reduce the efficiency requirements on the still uncertain mechanism responsible for prompt emission. Finally, I present preliminary results on the consistency of the external shock interpretation with the detection rate of high-energy emission from GRBs.

CCPP Lounge        High Energy Physics Seminars    ( hep )                         Alejandro Oca       ICIMAF Havana, Cuba         Is a generalized NJL model the effective action of massless QCD?             A local and gauge invariant alternative version of QCD for massive fermions introduced in previous works, is considered here to just propose a model which includes Nambu- Jona-Lasinio (NJL) terms in the action. The Lagrangian includes new vertices which at first sight, look as breaking power counting renormalizability. However, these terms also modify the quark propagators, to become more convergent at large momenta, thus, indicating that the theory is renormalizable. Therefore, it follows the surprising conclusion that the added NJL four fermions terms does not break renormalizability. The approach, can also be interpreted as a slightly generalized renormalization procedure for massless QCD, which seems able to incorporate the mass generating properties for the quarks of the NJL model, in a renormalizable way.

It is noted that physical systems being  appropriately described by the TB model can exhibit the main strongly correlated  electron system (SCES) properties, when they are solved in the HF approximation, by  also allowing crystal symmetry breaking effects and non-collinear spin orientations of  the HF orbitals. In particular, it is argued how a simple 2D square lattice system of  Coulomb interacting electrons can exhibit insulator gaps and pseudogap states, and  quantum phase transitions as illustrated by the mentioned former works. These results  allow to understand the nature of the observed quantum phase transition laying  \u201cbeneath\u201d the superconducting Dome. It corresponds to coalescence under hole doping  increase, of an insulator ground state (with a highly degenerated spin order) with an  excited pseudogap state, showing a lattice order symmetry breaking. The evolution of  the band structure and Fermi surface with doping is determined. It shows a drastic  change at a critical hole density xc = 0.2, which are in close coincidence with the  experimental observations. Above this critical density the system becomes a  paramagnetic metal. A discussion will be also presented indicating the possibility of  attaining room temperature superconductivity, by means of a surface coating with water  molecules, of cleaved planes of graphite, being orthogonal to its c-axis. The possibility  that 2D arrays of quantum dots can give rise to the same effect is also proposed to  consideration. The analysis also furnishes theoretical insights to solve the Mott-Slater  debate, at least for the La2CuO4 and TMO band structures.

Processes that used to be hard are now trivial; processes that used to be impossible are now necessary. Drawing on examples from computational astrophysics and cosmology, I will describe how the commodity market for data-related services has changed the needs of the scientific community, and how this can be leveraged in the future to develop advanced, useful, and forward-thinking technologies to transform the way researchers interact with data.

Helioseismic data have also allowed us to study properties of stellar matter. NASA's Kepler mission has allowed us to undertake seismic studies of other stars. While the field is not yet fully developed and we are still learning the best way to analyze the data, asteroseismic studies of stars has already produced exciting results. In this talk I shall review what asteroseismology is, how we interpret asteroseismic data, and then talk about some of the exciting results obtained with data from Kepler.

I will present recent results from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), the largest cosmological redshift survey to date. I will focus on measurements of the growth of structure, both at large scales where cosmic structure is close to linear, and at small scales where clustering is fully non-linear. For the former, interpreting the data is straightforward but sample variance limits constraining power. For the latter, modeling non-linear clustering requires more care, but measurement errors are minimized. Using data at all scales unlocks the true potential of redshift surveys to constrain the origin of the cosmic acceleration.

Time permitting I will also present an explicit discrete model of this, which I recently proposed with Pastawski, Preskill, and Yoshida.

The plasma membrane is known to be laterally heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity is believed to have a functional role, modulating cellular repsonses by spatiotemporal control of signaling proteins. Cholesterol is the most abundant component (by mole percent) in the membrane, and is known to control membrane heterogeneity in model systems. I will present a new view of the nanoscale structure and dynamics of cholesterol rich, lipid bilayer liquid phases, obtained through a combination of NMR, neutron scattering, and molecular simulation on special purpose hardware. The transport of lipids is observed to be strongly subdiffusive on biologically relevant timescales. A possible functional role for subdiffusive transport of membrane components will be proposed, within the context of arguments put forth by Berg and Purcell nearly 40 years ago.

While some of the questions regarding the beginning and end of the universe are well known and publicized, what it is not commonly recognized that asking fundamental questions at or above the atomic level have lead to major scientific revolutions. I will describe in this talk how condensed matter physics at sizes approaching atomic dimensions (\u201cnanostructures\u201d) is revolutionizing basic concepts in physics, chemistry and biology. When the size of a material approaches that of an atom its properties change radically. I will describe several exciting and new directions in the field of oxides, spintronics, and organic materials. The new physics evolving from this research may lead to novel applications which cannot be predicted at present, but which surely will revolutionize electronics, medicine, and engineering. This colloquium, accessible to non-experts, will be dedicated to highlighting the recent scientific advances in the field and possible new directions.

When two dissimilar materials are in close physical proximity the properties of each one may be radically modified or occasionally a completely new material emerges. In a series of recent studies, we have investigated the magnetic properties of different hybrids of ferromagnets (Ni, Co and Fe) and oxides which undergo metal-insulator and structural phase transitions. Both the static as well as dynamical properties of the ferromagnets are drastically affected. Static properties such as the coercivity, anisotropy and magnetization [1-3] and dynamical properties such as the microwave response are clearly modified by the proximity effect and give raise to interesting perhaps useful properties.

Optical properties of semiconductor microcavities are governed by bosonic quasi-particles named cavity polaritons, which are light-matter mixed states. Cavity polaritons propagate like photons, but interact strongly with their environment via their matter component. Patterning of semiconductor microcavities on a micron scale allows confining polaritons in photonic circuits or in lattices.      After a general introduction on cavity polaritons, I will illustrate the diversity of physical problems that can be addressed in this non-linear photonic system using patterned microstructures.I will show that taking advantage of the giant non-linearities induced by polariton interaction it is possible to realize photonic circuits in which coherent polaritons are propagated and optically manipulated.     The second part of the talk will be dedicated to the physics of polaritons in lattices. I will show that we can implement complex Hamiltonians and thus develop a new platform for quantum emulation. For instance, we have demonstrated a fractal energy spectrum for polaritons by engineering a quasi-periodic lattice. It becomes possible to explore the physics of non-linear wavepackets in such complex environment. Polaritons are also very promising for the investigation of graphene physics using honeycomb lattices. For instance, Dirac cones are directly imaged in the polariton far field emission. Finally we recently fabricated lattices holding non dispersive bands. In such flat bands, kinetic energy frustration dramatically modifies the spontaneous spatial coherence of polariton condensates.

High-energy emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts: advancing our knowledge on GRBs and relativistic shocks through modeling of afterglow radiation             The physical origin of the temporally extended (~10^2 sec) high-energy emission (0.1-100 GeV) detected from Gamma-Ray Bursts by the Fermi/LAT instrument has not yet been completely understood. I present the evidences in favour of the external shock scenario, where the LAT emission is interpreted as radiation from electrons accelerated at the relativistic shock developed in interactions with the external medium. I show that the modelling of LAT lightcurves not only reveals specific features consistent with the proposed interpretation, but also has predictive power on parameters entering the shock physics and the physics of the prompt emission mechanism. Extension of this study to include X-ray and optical afterglow data reveals that broadband modelling within the external shock scenario is always successful for the sample of GRBs with LAT temporally extended emission (10 events), and leads to two possibilities: either the X-ray emitting electrons (unlike the GeV emitting electrons) are in slow cooling regime or ii) the X-ray flux is strongly suppressed by Compton cooling, whereas, due to Klein-Nishina, the suppression is negligible at GeV energies. In both cases the LAT flux is a more robust proxy for the blastwave energy than the X-ray flux. On average, both cases require weak magnetic fields and relatively large blastwave energies. These large energies left in the blastwave reduce the efficiency requirements on the still uncertain mechanism responsible for prompt emission. Finally, I present preliminary results on the consistency of the external shock interpretation with the detection rate of high-energy emission from GRBs.

CCPP Lounge        High Energy Physics Seminars    ( hep )                         Alejandro Oca       ICIMAF Havana, Cuba         Is a generalized NJL model the effective action of massless QCD?             A local and gauge invariant alternative version of QCD for massive fermions introduced in previous works, is considered here to just propose a model which includes Nambu- Jona-Lasinio (NJL) terms in the action. The Lagrangian includes new vertices which at first sight, look as breaking power counting renormalizability. However, these terms also modify the quark propagators, to become more convergent at large momenta, thus, indicating that the theory is renormalizable. Therefore, it follows the surprising conclusion that the added NJL four fermions terms does not break renormalizability. The approach, can also be interpreted as a slightly generalized renormalization procedure for massless QCD, which seems able to incorporate the mass generating properties for the quarks of the NJL model, in a renormalizable way.

It is noted that physical systems being  appropriately described by the TB model can exhibit the main strongly correlated  electron system (SCES) properties, when they are solved in the HF approximation, by  also allowing crystal symmetry breaking effects and non-collinear spin orientations of  the HF orbitals. In particular, it is argued how a simple 2D square lattice system of  Coulomb interacting electrons can exhibit insulator gaps and pseudogap states, and  quantum phase transitions as illustrated by the mentioned former works. These results  allow to understand the nature of the observed quantum phase transition laying  \u201cbeneath\u201d the superconducting Dome. It corresponds to coalescence under hole doping  increase, of an insulator ground state (with a highly degenerated spin order) with an  excited pseudogap state, showing a lattice order symmetry breaking. The evolution of  the band structure and Fermi surface with doping is determined. It shows a drastic  change at a critical hole density xc = 0.2, which are in close coincidence with the  experimental observations. Above this critical density the system becomes a  paramagnetic metal. A discussion will be also presented indicating the possibility of  attaining room temperature superconductivity, by means of a surface coating with water  molecules, of cleaved planes of graphite, being orthogonal to its c-axis. The possibility  that 2D arrays of quantum dots can give rise to the same effect is also proposed to  consideration. The analysis also furnishes theoretical insights to solve the Mott-Slater  debate, at least for the La2CuO4 and TMO band structures.

Processes that used to be hard are now trivial; processes that used to be impossible are now necessary. Drawing on examples from computational astrophysics and cosmology, I will describe how the commodity market for data-related services has changed the needs of the scientific community, and how this can be leveraged in the future to develop advanced, useful, and forward-thinking technologies to transform the way researchers interact with data.

It is concerned with understanding the world on all scales of length, time, and energy. The methods of physics are diverse, but they share a common objective to develop and refine fundamental models that quantitatively explain observations and the results of experiments. The discoveries of physics, exemplified by the laws of physics, rank among the most important achievements of human inquiry, and have had an enormous impact on human culture and civilization. Members of the department carry out research in the fields of astrophysics, biophysics, cosmology, elementary particle physics, gravitation, hard and soft condensed matter physics, and statistical physics. Experimental work is carried out in state-of-the art laboratories in the department and at national and international facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and astronomical telescopes in space. The majority of NYU physics graduates go to graduate school in physics, and the rest pursue careers in medicine, finance, engineering and law. 27 percent of majors are women; 5% black, 16% Asian, and 8% Latino.      The NYU SPS chapter organizes a mentoring program that pairs first-year students with upper division Physics Majors, organizes lunches for students, and sponsors weekly sessions where faculty are invited to discuss their research. There are many opportunities for faculty-student interaction. These include the weekly colloquium and weekly events such as the CCPP (Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics) Brown Bag, in which faculty present talks on their research.       The educational programs of the Department are aimed at providing a range of courses to meet the needs of different student groups. For undergraduate physics majors, there is a rigorous core program, exposure to current frontiers, and opportunities for research. For science majors outside physics there are technical courses that emphasize the fundamental physical laws that underpin other sciences; and for non-science majors there are non-technical courses that introduce some of the most important concepts of physics and their impact on the contemporary world.      Faculty       Professors Emeriti:    Bederson, Borowitz, Brown, Glassgold, Hoffert, Levy, Lowenstein, Richardson, Robinson, Rosenberg, Sculli, Yarmus      Silver Professors; Professors of Physics:    Chaikin, Dvali, Pine      Collegiate Professors; Professors of Physics:    Farrar, Mincer      Professors:    Budick, Gabadadze, Grier, Grosberg, Hohenberg, Kent, Nemethy, Percus, Porrati, Schucking, Sokal, Stein, Stroke, Zhang, Zwanziger      Associate Professors:   Blanton, Gruzinov, Hogg, Kleban, MacFadyen, Mitra, Scoccimarro, Sleator, Weiner      Assistant Professors:    Brujic, Cranmer, Dubovsky, Gershow, Haas, Modjaz, Wyart      Clinical Associate Professor:    Adler            Program       DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES       Majors: The Major programs are designed to meet a number of goals: They provide good preparation for graduate school; indeed many of the Majors go on to some of the world's best graduate programs. They develop a range of technical skills, most of which relate to the challenging intellectual problems of building quantitative theoretical models and making precise measurements of physically interesting phenomena. The Major programs are also designed to satisfy curiosity about the fundamental laws that govern every aspect of the world from the interactions of subatomic particles to the origin and behavior of the entire Universe.      The Major programs are simultaneously very deep and very broad. Course work includes both theoretical subjects and experimental activity in laboratories. The programs are designed to give students flexibility in Years 3 and 4 to pursue interdisciplinary activities, spend time abroad, or go into greater depth in a subject or into original research.      The Department is a collegial place where the faculty and the students get to know one another well; there are regular formal and informal seminars; there is a thriving Society of Physics Students; and students and faculty often collaborate on original research problems. Many of the Majors participate in original research and co-author scientific publications. For all of these reasons, and in addition to the rigor of the courses, the Majors are extremely well prepared for a wide range of activities\u2014not just in scientific research, but also in professional and engineering pursuits\u2014or any area where abstract thinking and quantitative modeling of real systems is necessary and rewarded.      Non-majors: For non-science majors, there are non-technical courses that introduce some of the concepts and events that are most important to understanding physics and its impact on the contemporary world. For science majors outside of physics, there are technical courses that bring breadth or ideas about fundamental laws that underpin the other sciences. The Department provides courses designed to meet the pre-professional goals of pre-health students and students in engineering disciplines.      Minors: There are Minor programs in Physics and Astrophysics for students who are interested in obtaining significant experience in the ideas of physics without committing to the Major or without obtaining a comprehensive mathematical background.

Helioseismic data have also allowed us to study properties of stellar matter. NASA's Kepler mission has allowed us to undertake seismic studies of other stars. While the field is not yet fully developed and we are still learning the best way to analyze the data, asteroseismic studies of stars has already produced exciting results. In this talk I shall review what asteroseismology is, how we interpret asteroseismic data, and then talk about some of the exciting results obtained with data from Kepler.

I will present recent results from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), the largest cosmological redshift survey to date. I will focus on measurements of the growth of structure, both at large scales where cosmic structure is close to linear, and at small scales where clustering is fully non-linear. For the former, interpreting the data is straightforward but sample variance limits constraining power. For the latter, modeling non-linear clustering requires more care, but measurement errors are minimized. Using data at all scales unlocks the true potential of redshift surveys to constrain the origin of the cosmic acceleration.

Time permitting I will also present an explicit discrete model of this, which I recently proposed with Pastawski, Preskill, and Yoshida.

The plasma membrane is known to be laterally heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity is believed to have a functional role, modulating cellular repsonses by spatiotemporal control of signaling proteins. Cholesterol is the most abundant component (by mole percent) in the membrane, and is known to control membrane heterogeneity in model systems. I will present a new view of the nanoscale structure and dynamics of cholesterol rich, lipid bilayer liquid phases, obtained through a combination of NMR, neutron scattering, and molecular simulation on special purpose hardware. The transport of lipids is observed to be strongly subdiffusive on biologically relevant timescales. A possible functional role for subdiffusive transport of membrane components will be proposed, within the context of arguments put forth by Berg and Purcell nearly 40 years ago.

While some of the questions regarding the beginning and end of the universe are well known and publicized, what it is not commonly recognized that asking fundamental questions at or above the atomic level have lead to major scientific revolutions. I will describe in this talk how condensed matter physics at sizes approaching atomic dimensions (\u201cnanostructures\u201d) is revolutionizing basic concepts in physics, chemistry and biology. When the size of a material approaches that of an atom its properties change radically. I will describe several exciting and new directions in the field of oxides, spintronics, and organic materials. The new physics evolving from this research may lead to novel applications which cannot be predicted at present, but which surely will revolutionize electronics, medicine, and engineering. This colloquium, accessible to non-experts, will be dedicated to highlighting the recent scientific advances in the field and possible new directions.

When two dissimilar materials are in close physical proximity the properties of each one may be radically modified or occasionally a completely new material emerges. In a series of recent studies, we have investigated the magnetic properties of different hybrids of ferromagnets (Ni, Co and Fe) and oxides which undergo metal-insulator and structural phase transitions. Both the static as well as dynamical properties of the ferromagnets are drastically affected. Static properties such as the coercivity, anisotropy and magnetization [1-3] and dynamical properties such as the microwave response are clearly modified by the proximity effect and give raise to interesting perhaps useful properties.

Optical properties of semiconductor microcavities are governed by bosonic quasi-particles named cavity polaritons, which are light-matter mixed states. Cavity polaritons propagate like photons, but interact strongly with their environment via their matter component. Patterning of semiconductor microcavities on a micron scale allows confining polaritons in photonic circuits or in lattices.      After a general introduction on cavity polaritons, I will illustrate the diversity of physical problems that can be addressed in this non-linear photonic system using patterned microstructures.I will show that taking advantage of the giant non-linearities induced by polariton interaction it is possible to realize photonic circuits in which coherent polaritons are propagated and optically manipulated.     The second part of the talk will be dedicated to the physics of polaritons in lattices. I will show that we can implement complex Hamiltonians and thus develop a new platform for quantum emulation. For instance, we have demonstrated a fractal energy spectrum for polaritons by engineering a quasi-periodic lattice. It becomes possible to explore the physics of non-linear wavepackets in such complex environment. Polaritons are also very promising for the investigation of graphene physics using honeycomb lattices. For instance, Dirac cones are directly imaged in the polariton far field emission. Finally we recently fabricated lattices holding non dispersive bands. In such flat bands, kinetic energy frustration dramatically modifies the spontaneous spatial coherence of polariton condensates.

High-energy emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts: advancing our knowledge on GRBs and relativistic shocks through modeling of afterglow radiation             The physical origin of the temporally extended (~10^2 sec) high-energy emission (0.1-100 GeV) detected from Gamma-Ray Bursts by the Fermi/LAT instrument has not yet been completely understood. I present the evidences in favour of the external shock scenario, where the LAT emission is interpreted as radiation from electrons accelerated at the relativistic shock developed in interactions with the external medium. I show that the modelling of LAT lightcurves not only reveals specific features consistent with the proposed interpretation, but also has predictive power on parameters entering the shock physics and the physics of the prompt emission mechanism. Extension of this study to include X-ray and optical afterglow data reveals that broadband modelling within the external shock scenario is always successful for the sample of GRBs with LAT temporally extended emission (10 events), and leads to two possibilities: either the X-ray emitting electrons (unlike the GeV emitting electrons) are in slow cooling regime or ii) the X-ray flux is strongly suppressed by Compton cooling, whereas, due to Klein-Nishina, the suppression is negligible at GeV energies. In both cases the LAT flux is a more robust proxy for the blastwave energy than the X-ray flux. On average, both cases require weak magnetic fields and relatively large blastwave energies. These large energies left in the blastwave reduce the efficiency requirements on the still uncertain mechanism responsible for prompt emission. Finally, I present preliminary results on the consistency of the external shock interpretation with the detection rate of high-energy emission from GRBs.

A local and gauge invariant alternative version of QCD for massive fermions introduced in previous works, is considered here to just propose a model which includes Nambu- Jona-Lasinio (NJL) terms in the action. The Lagrangian includes new vertices which at first sight, look as breaking power counting renormalizability. However, these terms also modify the quark propagators, to become more convergent at large momenta, thus, indicating that the theory is renormalizable. Therefore, it follows the surprising conclusion that the added NJL four fermions terms does not break renormalizability. The approach, can also be interpreted as a slightly generalized renormalization procedure for massless QCD, which seems able to incorporate the mass generating properties for the quarks of the NJL model, in a renormalizable way.

It is noted that physical systems being  appropriately described by the TB model can exhibit the main strongly correlated  electron system (SCES) properties, when they are solved in the HF approximation, by  also allowing crystal symmetry breaking effects and non-collinear spin orientations of  the HF orbitals. In particular, it is argued how a simple 2D square lattice system of  Coulomb interacting electrons can exhibit insulator gaps and pseudogap states, and  quantum phase transitions as illustrated by the mentioned former works. These results  allow to understand the nature of the observed quantum phase transition laying  \u201cbeneath\u201d the superconducting Dome. It corresponds to coalescence under hole doping  increase, of an insulator ground state (with a highly degenerated spin order) with an  excited pseudogap state, showing a lattice order symmetry breaking. The evolution of  the band structure and Fermi surface with doping is determined. It shows a drastic  change at a critical hole density xc = 0.2, which are in close coincidence with the  experimental observations. Above this critical density the system becomes a  paramagnetic metal. A discussion will be also presented indicating the possibility of  attaining room temperature superconductivity, by means of a surface coating with water  molecules, of cleaved planes of graphite, being orthogonal to its c-axis. The possibility  that 2D arrays of quantum dots can give rise to the same effect is also proposed to  consideration. The analysis also furnishes theoretical insights to solve the Mott-Slater  debate, at least for the La2CuO4 and TMO band structures.

Processes that used to be hard are now trivial; processes that used to be impossible are now necessary. Drawing on examples from computational astrophysics and cosmology, I will describe how the commodity market for data-related services has changed the needs of the scientific community, and how this can be leveraged in the future to develop advanced, useful, and forward-thinking technologies to transform the way researchers interact with data.

It is concerned with understanding the world on all scales of length, time, and energy. The methods of physics are diverse, but they share a common objective to develop and refine fundamental models that quantitatively explain observations and the results of experiments. The discoveries of physics, exemplified by the laws of physics, rank among the most important achievements of human inquiry, and have had an enormous impact on human culture and civilization. Members of the department carry out research in the fields of astrophysics, biophysics, cosmology, elementary particle physics, gravitation, hard and soft condensed matter physics, and statistical physics. Experimental work is carried out in state-of-the art laboratories in the department and at national and international facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and astronomical telescopes in space. The majority of NYU physics graduates go to graduate school in physics, and the rest pursue careers in medicine, finance, engineering and law. 27 percent of majors are women; 5% black, 16% Asian, and 8% Latino.      The NYU SPS chapter organizes a mentoring program that pairs first-year students with upper division Physics Majors, organizes lunches for students, and sponsors weekly sessions where faculty are invited to discuss their research. There are many opportunities for faculty-student interaction. These include the weekly colloquium and weekly events such as the CCPP (Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics) Brown Bag, in which faculty present talks on their research.       The educational programs of the Department are aimed at providing a range of courses to meet the needs of different student groups. For undergraduate physics majors, there is a rigorous core program, exposure to current frontiers, and opportunities for research. For science majors outside physics there are technical courses that emphasize the fundamental physical laws that underpin other sciences; and for non-science majors there are non-technical courses that introduce some of the most important concepts of physics and their impact on the contemporary world.      Faculty       Professors Emeriti:    Bederson, Borowitz, Brown, Glassgold, Hoffert, Levy, Lowenstein, Richardson, Robinson, Rosenberg, Sculli, Yarmus      Silver Professors; Professors of Physics:    Chaikin, Dvali, Pine      Collegiate Professors; Professors of Physics:    Farrar, Mincer      Professors:    Budick, Gabadadze, Grier, Grosberg, Hohenberg, Kent, Nemethy, Percus, Porrati, Schucking, Sokal, Stein, Stroke, Zhang, Zwanziger      Associate Professors:   Blanton, Gruzinov, Hogg, Kleban, MacFadyen, Mitra, Scoccimarro, Sleator, Weiner      Assistant Professors:    Brujic, Cranmer, Dubovsky, Gershow, Haas, Modjaz, Wyart      Clinical Associate Professor:    Adler            Program       DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES       Majors: The Major programs are designed to meet a number of goals: They provide good preparation for graduate school; indeed many of the Majors go on to some of the world's best graduate programs. They develop a range of technical skills, most of which relate to the challenging intellectual problems of building quantitative theoretical models and making precise measurements of physically interesting phenomena. The Major programs are also designed to satisfy curiosity about the fundamental laws that govern every aspect of the world from the interactions of subatomic particles to the origin and behavior of the entire Universe.      The Major programs are simultaneously very deep and very broad. Course work includes both theoretical subjects and experimental activity in laboratories. The programs are designed to give students flexibility in Years 3 and 4 to pursue interdisciplinary activities, spend time abroad, or go into greater depth in a subject or into original research.      The Department is a collegial place where the faculty and the students get to know one another well; there are regular formal and informal seminars; there is a thriving Society of Physics Students; and students and faculty often collaborate on original research problems. Many of the Majors participate in original research and co-author scientific publications. For all of these reasons, and in addition to the rigor of the courses, the Majors are extremely well prepared for a wide range of activities\u2014not just in scientific research, but also in professional and engineering pursuits\u2014or any area where abstract thinking and quantitative modeling of real systems is necessary and rewarded.      Non-majors: For non-science majors, there are non-technical courses that introduce some of the concepts and events that are most important to understanding physics and its impact on the contemporary world. For science majors outside of physics, there are technical courses that bring breadth or ideas about fundamental laws that underpin the other sciences. The Department provides courses designed to meet the pre-professional goals of pre-health students and students in engineering disciplines.      Minors: There are Minor programs in Physics and Astrophysics for students who are interested in obtaining significant experience in the ideas of physics without committing to the Major or without obtaining a comprehensive mathematical background.
