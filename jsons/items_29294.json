The seminar portion of the Clinic will introduce students to a range of the different legal, political, and regulatory theories informing the legal norms, practice, and policy of international organizations. It is designed to help students understand the relevance of inter-disciplinary perspectives to the practice of law in global settings, and to learn the ways in which core cognitive lawyering skills (i.e. mastering legal research tools, developing an ability to integrate factual and legal knowledge, strengthening analytical and reasoning skills, and exercising judgment based on the understanding gained) matter in the practice of international law.   \"Thinking like a lawyer\u201d may be more demanding today than it has been in the past, given how complex law and lawyering has become, but it is particularly demanding for lawyers who want to work in an international context. Given the increasing interdependence of legal and economic regimes across countries, lawyers (including domestic lawyers) need a broad set of tools to solve increasingly complex, and sometimes novel, legal problems. There is increasing demand for lawyers with a sound understanding of the institutional, socio-political and economic contexts within which domestic and international legal issues arise and are addressed: how do markets function? How do bureaucracies behave? How do technologies shape change? How do domestic laws interact with international regimes? How do international legal and regulatory regimes and institutions interact with each other?   Course Description   Seminar   Drawing on existing scholarship and ongoing research conducted by faculty and others at NYU School of Law, the seminar will focus on themes that intersect with projects in the areas of global governance, such as inter-institutional cooperation; the role of lawyers and private actors in the creation, the evolution, and interpretation of international legal norms; the relationship between branches/offices of international organizations; the diffusion of ideas and legal norms; the North-South relationship in international law, amongst others.   Students will be encouraged to think about the implications of their clinical project for the people affected by it or by broader actions or policies that relate to the project, and to consider the perspectives of under-represented or non-represented constituencies. They will also be asked to consider the role of an international lawyer in the development of international law, to discuss the professional legal responsibility of lawyers working with international or foreign laws, and to examine the ethics of international law. To this end, the seminar might also feature the occasional participation of members of the UN community and lawyers working in the international organizations.   Fieldwork   The students will work with the clinic professors on projects with international organizations on a broad range of topics related to global governance. In the Fall 2015, the projects will likely entail advisory work for an international development bank. In prior years, students worked with a UN agency on promoting a global accountability mechanism for the post-2015 sustainable development process, advised a major development bank on the need to adapt its accountability institution/complaints mechanism to the changing international development environment, and assisted an international organization to think about ways to promote and regulate the global sharing of information related to viruses with pandemic potential. Although the fieldwork is not an internship , students will have the opportunity to engage first-hand in the work of international organizations. If the organization is geographically proximate, students will have regular visits to the IO\u2019s offices; if the location of the IO makes frequent visits not possible, students will communicate with the IO officials by phone or Skype and will visit the organization at least once.   The combination of fieldwork and seminar will enable students to see the relevance of the theory learned to practice.   Application Procedure   Students interested in applying for the clinic should submit the standard application, resume, and transcript online through CAMS. To arrange an interview, please use the CAMS system as well. The application period for LLM students is July 1-15, 2015. (Please note there is a separate application form for LLM students.)   If you have questions regarding the application procedure, please contact Angelina Fisher via email .   Student Contacts   The clinic was not offered in 2014-15.

Such organizations include the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Organization of American States, and others. Click here for a complete list of designated international organizations.          Procedure to Apply     Applying for International Organization employment authorization is a two-step process: (1) obtain an OGS recommended I-20; then (2) apply to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).   (1) In order to obtain an OGS recommended I-20, you must come to the OGS with the following documents:     Your I-20, I-94 record , and passport     A job offer letter from a recognized international organization     A letter from your academic advisor, stating the following: (a) that you are in good academic standing; (b) your anticipated completion of studies date; and (c) his or her recommendation that you accept this internship.       An OGS advisor will review your application materials. If you are eligible, the advisor will recommend you by issuing an updated I-20 with a recommendation for international organization employment. Please allow up to 10 days for processing time.     (2) Apply to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Once you have received your updated I-20, you can then apply for International Organization employment authorization. Do not prepare these materials until you have received your updated I-20. Your complete application packet includes:     a check or money order made payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in the amount of $380.     a completed Form I-765 Application for Employment Authorization     Form G-1145 , in order to receive an e-notification of application receipt from USCIS  photocopies of your I-20(s), I-94 record , passport identification page, and F-1 visa (if applicable)     two passport-style photographs     a copy of your job offer letter       Mailing Information   Once you have prepared all of the above materials, mail your application to USCIS. For those residing in New York, New Jersey or Connecticut, the address for private courier service is:   USCIS  Attn: AOS  2501 S. State Hwy, 121 Business  Suite 400  Lewisville, TX 75067   If you use an address in a different part of the U.S., please speak with an OGS advisor to find out the appropriate USCIS mailing address.   (3) Once you are authorized for work with an international organization, if you don't already have a Social Security number, you must apply for one to get paid. Learn more about how to apply for a Social Security number.                         Eligibility Criteria     You must be a full-time student at NYU in lawful F-1 status.     You must have been offered an internship position by a recognized international organization.            Processing Times   USCIS routinely takes up to 90 days to process this type of application. Approval is NOT guaranteed, and you may not begin employment unless you have received written approval from the USCIS. Written approval will come in the form of an Employment Authorization Document (EAD).          Restrictions/Notes   If approved, you will receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from the USCIS granting you permission to work off-campus. Note also the following restrictions:     You may work a maximum of 20 hours per week during the school year, full-time (over 20 hours per week) during vacation periods.     You may not start employment until you have received an EAD or before the start date indicated on the EAD. You must stop employment by the EAD expiration date or by the date you finish your studies, whichever is earlier.     You must remain a full-time student and make full-time progress toward degree completion while working for the international organization.     Time spent working for an international organization does not count against your 12 months of optional practical training.                    Need to apply for a Social Security Number?
