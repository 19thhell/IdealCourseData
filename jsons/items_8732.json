Painting and sculpture of the 19th century and the secularization of  Latin American art is then examined before a discussion of the establishment of  modernism that comes about with the formation of academies and the travels of  many artists from all parts of Latin America and the Caribbean to Europe and  the U.S. from 1900 onward. Important modern artists such as the Mexican  muralists, Frida  Kahlo, Joaqu\u00edn  Torres-Garc\u00eda, Tarsila  do Amaral, Wifredo  Lam, and  the surrealists will bring the course up to approximately 1950.

Offered every year. 4 points.    The  Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the  one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise  of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course  of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau,  celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual  expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense  emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism.  Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described  as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these  three stylistic movements, examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century  artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its  political consequences as well.          Impressionism  and After, 1860-1900    ARTH-UA  412 Prerequisite:  History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of  5 on the AP Art History exam.

Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to  symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fauvism,  and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem  with the social and cultural conditions that generated them.          Era  of the Avant-Gardes, 1900-1945    ARTH-UA  413 Prerequisite:  History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of  5 on the AP Art History exam.

The dada movement in the period during  and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy,  cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihilistic  impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. Then examines the  tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and  abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as  an extension and transformation of prewar trends.

East  Asian Art II: China, Korea, Japan from 1000 C.E. to Present    ARTH-UA  511 Identical  to EAST-UA 92. Offered periodically. 4 points.    An  introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately  1000 C.E. Emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and  culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed  the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region.  Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an  early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and  Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated  in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape  paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.

Diverse regions were linked by trade, politics, and  cultural relationships, and interaction can be charted through the changing  forms and functions of art. We consider the historical circumstances  surrounding the production of South and Southeast Asian art, as well as the  problems that art historians face when trying to interpret the surviving  evidence. We look at art in a variety of media, including, but not limited to,  architecture, urban form, sculpture, painting, and performance.

Finally turns to the colonial and postcolonial artistic  responses to South Asia's complex past(s). By looking at art in a range of  media\u2014including, but not limited to, painting, sculpture, architecture, and  photography\u2014we consider how art actively served as an expression of  political authority and cultural identity.

Special  attention is paid to the creative process and the influences on it: the role of  the patron, the logistics of site, and the artist's own thought process as  revealed through preparatory drawings and sketches. Students develop the skills  necessary to \"read\" works of art in all their rich complexity of form and  meaning.          Dutch  and Flemish Painting, 1600\u00a1V1700    ARTH-UA  311 Identical  to MEDI-UA 311.

Not  a traditional survey, this  course opens with a brief consideration of the achievements of the great  pre-Hispanic civilizations (Aztec, Maya,  Inca,  and  others) prior to contact with the Iberian world. Major emphasis is given to  colonial painting, sculpture,  and  architecture in Mexico and Central America, the  Caribbean, and  the Andes. Painting and sculpture of the 19th century and the secularization of  Latin American art is then examined before a discussion of the establishment of  modernism that comes about with the formation of academies and the travels of  many artists from all parts of Latin America and the Caribbean to Europe and  the U.S. from 1900 onward. Important modern artists such as the Mexican  muralists, Frida  Kahlo, Joaqu\u00edn  Torres-Garc\u00eda, Tarsila  do Amaral, Wifredo  Lam, and  the surrealists will bring the course up to approximately 1950.

Focusing  on the creation of modern building types such as the bank, state capitol,  museum, railroad station, and skyscraper, the course begins in the later 18th  century with the idealistic designs of Ledoux and Boull\u00e9e. After considering  the forms and meanings associated with neoclassicism, examines the Gothic  revival and subsequent 19th-century movements (e.g., high Victorian Gothic,  Second Empire, beaux-arts classicism) as efforts to find appropriate  expressions for diverse building forms. Students consider changes resulting  from the Industrial Revolution, including developments in technology, and the  reforms of art nouveau and secession architecture.

Offered every year. 4 points.    The  Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the  one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise  of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course  of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau,  celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual  expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense  emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism.  Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described  as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these  three stylistic movements, examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century  artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its  political consequences as well.          Impressionism  and After, 1860-1900    ARTH-UA  412 Prerequisite:  History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of  5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.    Beginning  by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the artistic aims of  19th-century realism, follows the development of progressive art to the brink  of cubism and pure abstraction in the first years of the 20th century.  Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to  symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fauvism,  and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem  with the social and cultural conditions that generated them.          Era  of the Avant-Gardes, 1900-1945    ARTH-UA  413 Prerequisite:  History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of  5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.    After  analyzing the invention of cubism by Picasso and Braque, we examine its international  reverberations, including Italian futurism, the later phases of German  expressionism, the de Stijl movement in the Netherlands, and suprematism and  constructivism in revolutionary Russia. The dada movement in the period during  and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy,  cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihilistic  impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. Then examines the  tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and  abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as  an extension and transformation of prewar trends.          Postmodern  to Contemporary Art, 1970-2014    ARTH-UA  414 Prerequisite:  History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of  5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.    First  concentrates on the development of contemporary art in New York, London, and  Berlin. Discussion of the decade 1975 - 1985 will be organized around the  opposition between art as social critique and art as spiritual  expression. Discussion of 1985 - 1995 will focus on the re-emergence of  narrative, and on identity and bodily experience as organizing metaphors.   Discussion of 1995-2010 will focus on comic-book imagery, amusement park  installation, and allegorical abstraction. Then analyzes the diverse art  scenes of Russia and Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa,  the Middle East, South Asia and Australia, and China from 1989 to the  present. Examines the phenomenon of multiple modernities and considers  how \"Western\" art formats have provided vehicles for responding to diverse  experiences such as the collapse of Communism, rapid industrialization, and  ethnic and religious conflict.

Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an  early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and  Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated  in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape  paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.

From the Indus Valley culture to  the present day, artistic production has played a critical role in the  transmission of religious beliefs and the development of cultural systems in  and around South Asia. Diverse regions were linked by trade, politics, and  cultural relationships, and interaction can be charted through the changing  forms and functions of art. We consider the historical circumstances  surrounding the production of South and Southeast Asian art, as well as the  problems that art historians face when trying to interpret the surviving  evidence. We look at art in a variety of media, including, but not limited to,  architecture, urban form, sculpture, painting, and performance.          South  Asian Art II: 1200 to Present    ARTH-UA  531 Offered  periodically. 4 points.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1010 - Censorship in American Culture   An upper level course on the topic of censorship in American culture, from the late 19th century to the present. The broader context for our exploration will be the public sphere, understood in two ways: as the classic, liberal ideal-a space for civil, and equitable exchange of ideas and opinions open to all citizens-and in the more contemporary reality-a highly contested space of public discussion, where the boundaries concerning who can participate, what topics are allowed, and how the exchange takes place are drawn and redrawn. The tension between ideal and real forms of public communication plays out in highly charged debates around censorship, which take place in diverse public spaces, including literature, film, theatre, art galleries, the press, the internet, sidewalks, courts, and bars. Because these debates are cultural and legal ones, and are frequently deeply divisive within American society, the goal is for the students to have an enhanced understanding of the historical contexts in which important cultural and legal struggles over censorship took place, and to bring that understanding to bear on contemporary debates about the arts, sexuality, gender, privacy, national security, media technology, and government involvement in the marketplace of ideas and images.

In addition, students will examine how media and audiences are both situated in particular multiple contexts that have a bearing on how media are generated and circulated, and how audiences experience and make meaning of media/technologies. Methodologically, students will investigate how audiences are conceptualized and researched by scholars and cultural critics.  Throughout the course, students will explore the thinking and multiple contexts that frame various conceptualizations of media/technologies and audiences, and how these different approaches inform the concerns, questions, methods, findings, and implications of audience/user research .

Students will also use media production to conduct fieldwork in the New York City area that further builds the subfields of youth media/youth development, teaching and learning, and community building. Research projects will document and investigate how youth media is supporting the development of young people's capacities for 21st century skills of digital communication, critical literacy, and civic engagement. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1018 - Kids in Media Culture   In this course, students will examine how young people of different ages and backgrounds use, value, and find meaning in different media in different kinds of contexts, and we discuss the social, cultural, and political implications of these lived experiences. In addition, we will explore how we might address the issues raised by the contemporary communication environment, and by the realities of young people's complex interactions with popular media. Books required are David Buckingham's After the Death of Childhood: Growing Up in the Age of Electronic Media and Fisherkeller's Growing up with Television: Everyday Learning Among Young Adolescents. A packet of readings will include cultural audience studies investigating different actual kids' relationships to different media in a variety of social contexts. The culminating assignment for this class requires students to write a paper addressing a 'real' audience outside of the classroom informing them about the issues of the course, and proposing how that audience might take a course of action in response.

MCC-UE 1025 - Race and Media   America&#39;s founding principles of equality and equal opportunity have long been the subject of interpretation, debate, national angst and widespread (often violent) conflict. No more is this the case than when we talk about the issue of race. While biological notions of race have lost their scientific validity, race remains a salient issue in American life as a social and political reality sustained through a wide variety of media forms. The broad purpose of this course is to better understand how notions of race have been defined and shaped in and through these mediated forms. Specific attention may be given to the ways that race is articulated in forms of mass media and popular culture. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1026 - Disability, Technology and Media   In this course, we will examine the significance of technology to the definition and experience of disability; the relationship between disability and the development of new media; the politics of representation; and current debates between the fields of disability studies and media studies.

Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1030 - Architecture as Media: Communication Through the Built Environment   This class reads architecture and the built environment through the lenses of media, communication, and culture. The course takes seriously the proposition that spaces communicate meaningfully and that learning to read spatial productions leads to better understanding how material and technological designs are in sustained conversation with the social, over time. Through analyses of a range of spaces from Gothic Cathedrals to suburban shopping malls to homes, factories, skyscrapers and digital cities students will acquire a vocabulary for relating representations and practices, symbols and structures, and for identifying the ideological and aesthetic positions that produce settings for everyday life. View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1031 - Digital Media: Theory and Practice   This course offers students a foundational understanding of the technological building blocks that make up digital media and culture, and of the ways they come together to shape myriad facets of life. Students will acquire a working knowledge of the key concepts behind coding, and survey the contours of digital media architecture, familiarizing themselves with algorithms, databases, hardware, and similar key components. These technological frameworks will be examined as the basic grammar of digital media and related to theories of identity, privacy, policy, and other pertinent themes.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1032 - Social Media Networking   This course will examine &ldquo;social media&rdquo; from a cultural perspective, with a focus on how media technologies figure in practices of everyday life and in the construction of social relationships and identities. We will work from an expansive definition of what constitutes &ldquo;social media,&rdquo; considering social network sites, smartphone apps, and online games, among other technologies. The course itself will involve communication in social media channels in addition to the traditional seminar format, thus we will be actively participating in the phenomena under study as we go.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1033 Critical Making (NEW for Spring 2015!)   Critical making is hands-on hardware practice as a form of reflection and analysis: a way of thinking through what (and how) computing and digital media mean by understanding how they work , building on the literature of media studies and the digital humanities . By turning from software to hardware, to the physicality of computation and communications infrastructure, we will take objects apart, literally and figuratively, and in the process will learn to interpret and to intervene -- using prototyping, reverse engineering, hardware hacking and circuit bending, design fiction, electronics fabrication and other approaches -- in the material layer of digital technologies.    View Sample Syllabus (DRAFT)          MCC-UE 1034 - Media, Technology and Society   An inquiry into the interplay of technology and contemporary society.

It surveys the technical development of the telephone, from its roots in telegraphy to radio and portable phones to mobile computing. We will trace the history of &ldquo;telephonic principles&rdquo; such as interaction and universality, and telephony in various social contexts: national and transnational telephone cultures; genres of text messaging; the relationship of communication technology to public, private, and virtual space; and the appropriation of the medium for the purposes of art and activism.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1037 - Music and Media   This course investigates the mediation of  music and music-like sounds in both private and public life. Commercial venues,  from restaurants to rest rooms, pipe Muzak into its spaces; radios broadcast  more music than any other content today; soundtracks imprint the texture of  signifying associations for television shows and films; we carry personal  playlists on mobile music players; and musical media and technologies for  making music are more readily available to us on our home computers than ever  before. We examine music and media from a variety of perspectives, including  its cultural, sensory, technological, ideological and metaphysical dimensions;  as well as the relation of music to mass media (radio, television, the  internet) and the film and music industries.       Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1040 - Health Media and Communication   The meanings of health and disease are shaped not only by  scientific and medical discourses, but by media, communication, and the  cultures of health. This course examines  the impact of media and health cultures on what counts as normal and  pathological, how medical environments are understood and experienced, popular  tactics for communicating and contesting biomedical information, public  understandings of biotechnology, and how media representation and popular  culture help to shape understandings of disease and health. Through the topic  of health, we will look at nationhood and population management,  subject-formation and stigma, individual and environmental risk. At the level  of language, we will question the metaphoric uses of disease and their  consequences. Readings, films (and other sources) will be drawn from a variety  of genres, including epidemiology, public health, anthropology, history,  communication studies, and medical memoir.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1065 - Media Events and Spectacle   This course examines the role played by media events and spectacle in the shaping of belief, attitudes, and actions, with particular attention paid to the concept of the masses and its changed meaning over time. The course examines concepts of mass culture, the decentralization of cultural forms, and the rise of convergence culture. It explores the history of the media event and the theories that have shaped it, and the role of spectacle in society from the Renaissance to modern society to the age of digital media. Sample Syllabus           MCC-UE 1100 - Internship   Applied fieldwork in Media, Culture, and Communication.

Internships expand student understanding of the dynamics of the ever-changing field of communication.          MCC-UE 1140 - Screening History: The Construction of American History in Hollywood Films   This course explores the ways in which popular Hollywood films construct the historical past, the ensuing battles among historians and the public over Hollywood's version of American history, and the ways that such films can be utilized as historical documents themselves. We will consider films as products of the culture industry; as visions of popularly understood history and national mythology; as evidence for how social conflicts have been depicted; and as evidence of how popular understanding and interpretations of the past have been revised from earlier eras to the present.    View sample syllabus              MCC-UE 1151 - Media History of New York   New York has played a crucial role in the history of media, and media have played a crucial role in the history of New York. New York has been represented by media since Henry Hudson wrote his reports to the Dutch.

Summer 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 Communication &amp; Persuasion - Film Classics of Propaganda Instructor: Terence Moran , Mon/Wed 5:10-8:10 PM    Topic: Communication and Persuasion: Film Classics of Propaganda   An examination of classics of film propaganda in terms of their ideologies and mythic structures and messages. We will examine three powerful ideologies of the 20 th Century via analyses of films that exemplify and promote the values and life styles of Communism in Battleship Potemkin (Soviet Union, 1925), Fascisim in Triumph des Willens (National Socialist Germany, 1934-35), and Capitalism in Sex and the City (United States, 2008). Our analyses of these films will be based upon selected readings in Jacques Ellul&rsquo;s Propaganda, The Formation of Men&rsquo;s Attitudes and Joseph Campbell&rsquo;s The Hero With a Thousand Faces with regard to propaganda and the myth of the hero. Background readings, class lectures, and models for analyzing communication and propaganda will be used to structure an environment in which our class will examine specific case studies involving films from American and foreign sources, and covering films from the silent era to the 21 st Century.    Fall 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 / Topic: The Raw Data of Intimate Life Instructor: Roger Friedland, Tuesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Social research tries to make sense of &ldquo;raw data&rdquo;, doubly so in this case as they refer to quantitative information about the sexual, romantic and religious lives of young people. This seminar seeks to teach students the basics of quantitative social research, a particular kind of sense-making that both makes and manipulates the data. This seminar will consider both the generation and testing of hypotheses using survey data on intimate life recently collected by the instructor through social network sites, the blogsphere and university course websites in the United States and Muslim-majority countries in the Near East. Students will learn to use STATA, a statistical software, in order to calculate distributions of values, cross-tabulations, and potentially regression analyses. Students will use these skills to develop and test their own hypothesis for the final paper for this seminar. Students need not have any previous statistical training. Note: This is not a course on social media; it uses social media to generate samples of media users for explanatory analysis.    MCC-UE 1200-002 / Topic: Black Lives Matter - Race, Media, and Social Movements Instructor: Nicholas Mirzoeff, Tuesdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This seminar concentrates on the use of media by and for the Black Lives Matter movement. We will historicise the movement by examining Reconstruction, Civil Rights and the Black Power movement. We will contextualize it by learning about the prison-industrial complex and the New Jim Crow. At the heart of our discussion will be media in and for the movement. We'll look at performative resistance like Hands Up, Don't Shoot; Die Ins; and Black Brunch; and the role of social media in shaping resistance. We will get to the heart of what happened in Ferguson by reading the grand jury depositions. We'll look at how #BlackLivesMatter has challenged art, cinema and museums. And we'll consider what actions to take next.    MCC-UE 1200-003 / Topic: Media Landscapes - \"The Wire\" Instructor: Arvind Rajagopal , Thursdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This course will investigate the landscapes brought into view by a specific media artifact, in this case the critically acclaimed HBO show, The Wire. The Wire&rsquo;s extraordinary success as a TV series about a &ldquo;black site&rdquo; stretched across the American heartland, namely the African American urban underclass, has been copiously studied and commented upon. It has been seen as an example of the critical and creative turn taken by a segment of the cultural industry, as a maturation of the audience and a de-massification of viewer tastes in the era of addressable mass culture. David Simon himself, among others, has also described it as a move away from postmodern irony and narrative fragmentation and towards ancient Greek myth. In this class we will explore the show as a case study in making the black underclass simultaneously spectacular and theoretically invisible.The show will provide a set of texts for students to undertake detailed textual analysis, and to deepen their readings drawing on other texts provided in the class, and on students' own readings of the world.    MCC-UE 1200-004 / Topic: Digital Media, Advocacy, and Equal Rights, in the U.S. and Abroad Instructor: Isra Ali, Mondays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    In this course we will examine different moments in which digital media plays a significant role in the advocacy for equal rights related to gender and sexuality. We will look at domestic, transnational, and international advocacy. We will consider how the political, economic, and social, impacts the way digital media is deployed, paying particular attention to forces such as militarism, nationalism, and corporate interest. We will identify who utilizes digital media to participate in the discourse, how that usage impacts and relates to offline activism, and the role digital media plays in reshaping the conversation about gender and sexuality. We will look at how people engaged in these causes use digital media to speak to one another, and to traditional media outlets that want to hear from them as a result of the presence they build on digital media. We will also examine how the notion of gender and sexual equality is articulated through social media, and think critically about the concepts of gender, sexuality, and equality, and the institutionalization of this advocacy.    MCC-UE 1200-005 / Topic: Mediating Israel/Palestine Instructor: Helga Tawil-Souri, Wednesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Israel-Palestine &ndash; whether approached as a particular place, a political problem, a conflict, or even a metaphor &ndash; is fraught with controversies, contradictions, questions, and misunderstandings. More often that not, the more one learns about Israel-Palestine, the more likely the result is of a feeling of political paralysis (&ldquo;there is simply no solution to this intractable conflict!&rdquo;). This senior seminar will attempt to reverse this by having students collectively work on one media-related problem having to do with Israel-Palestine in order to solve it, as one would do as part of an architecture studio for example. A &ldquo;problem&rdquo; will be decided on during the first sessions of the class (for example: build an equitable and shared media infrastructure; improve reporting on the conflict in mainstream media; launch a marketing campaign for a one-state solution). As with any course, students will be introduced to a range of materials; most of the time however students will be asked to bring in readings, graphics and other materials based on individual research to help the collective obtain a deeper understanding of the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; and ways to solve it. Each student will also bring his/her own expertise (e.g. historical research, photography, archival work, interviews, sketching, software coding) in order to tackle the various components of the problem we are attempting to solve. Throughout this process, students will gain an in-depth understanding of the complexities of Israel-Palestine, and end the course with a collectively-built solution.    MCC-UE 1200-006 / Topic: Time and Technology Instructor: Kate Brideau, Thursdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Many of our concerns about modern technologies have to do with time&mdash;for instance, the growing inability to sustain attention for an extended period of time, or the ways email and mobile devices seem to expand the hours of the &ldquo;work day&rdquo; indefinitely. But this is not new; technology has long had an impact on our experiences and notions of time. This course will explore that relationship, considering how technology relates both to the deep time of human history, and also to our everyday lives. Technological developments have had a significant impact on how we think about history, memory, life, death, and immortality; the rhythms by which our cities move; the speeds at which we live life, and the ways we think about labor and leisure. In this course we will engage with media archaeology, read historical and philosophical works, and analyze photography, film, recorded music, digital media, and the possibilities of biotechnology. In addition to learning about the mutability of time as it relates to technology, this course will encourage students to think critically about how technology is affecting time as they experience it today, and what relationship to time they would like to have. Should we now be turning back toward slowness as we seem to be moving ever more quickly into the future?             MCC-UE 1210 - Senior Honors in Media, Culture, and Communication   Prerequisite: senior standing and department approval to pursue honors in the major. Open only to MCC majors with senior standing.

MCC-UE 1300 - Media and Global Communication   Examines the broad range of activities associated with the globalization of media production, distribution, and reception. Issues include the relationship between local and national identities and the emergence of a 'global culture' and the impact of technological innovations on the media themselves and their use and reception in a variety of settings. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1302 - Global Television   This course introduces students to theories of global television studies, the reception of American media abroad, and several case studies of television from around the world. Students will learn about the challenges and rewards of studying global television, both of which revolve around how to study television programming and the television industry across cultures and across languages.    View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1303 - Privacy and Media Technology   Few values have been as unalterably disturbed by developments in new media as privacy. This course presents a philosophical, social, and legal inquiry into the impact of digital communications upon privacy &amp; its meanings, in order to prepare students to recognize, contextualize, and analyze privacy challenges created by new information technologies. We will explore the philosophical roots of privacy as a deeply held social value and consider how it may conflict with other values, such as freedom of speech, anonymity, efficiency, accountability, and national security. Our discussions will be situated in leading ethical and legal controversies concerning new media tools (e.g., social networks, mobile apps, digital e-readers, wearable health sensors), practices (e.g., online tracking, behavioral advertising, automated face recognition, video surveillance), platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and Google Maps), and other topics shaping today's privacy discourse.

Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1306 - Transnational Media Flows   This class examines the intersecting dynamics of media genres and geo-linguistic cultural markets in the configuration of global and regional media flows. It looks in particular at the way media genres travel and how their circulation raises issues about the cultural power of certain media narratives in specific historical, political and social conditions of consumption. We will examine the battle for national, regional, and global media markets as a struggle for the ?legitimate? cultural and political view of the world expressed through information (news), scientific discourse (documentaries), and popular culture (films, telenovelas, reality television, music) to understand the complex global flow of television programs and films.    View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1310 - Culture and Media in Urban China   What  does it mean to be &ldquo;urban&rdquo; in China and how is Chinese urbanism mediated by new  cultural formations? In this course we will examine the culture and media that  define city life in China, including Chinese state and popular media,  television and film, music, fashion, verbal art and literature (in print and  online) and visual art. We will focus on the period from the building booms of  the mid-to-late nineties to the present. Students will work in teams to make  presentations on urban culture, and use primary sources in translation and  secondary sources to write individual essays. Chinese language ability  appreciated but by no means required .    *This course will run as a Global Honors Seminar in Fall 2012 and will have an additional travel component in the January 2012 term.

Sample Syllabus           MCC-UE 1340 - Religion and Media   This course examines the ways in which conventional and non-conventional media re-create religious experience. Increasingly, religion is experienced not only in sacred spaces, and through ritual and scripture, but is also communicated through radio, TV, and the Internet, as well as in consumer culture and political campaigns. This course examines the significance of religion in modern life from historical and contemporary perspectives, paying attention to questions of religious and national difference, as well as material and symbolic practices. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1341 - Middle East Media (formerly Islam, Media and the West)   This course examines contemporary media in (primarily Arab parts of) the Middle East and the US and their relationship to the perceived rift between Islam and the West. Readings and media examples focus on the politics of culture, religion, modernity, and national identity as they shape and intersect with contemporary geopolitical events, cultural formations and media globalization. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1342 - Sounds In and Out of Africa   This course investigates cultural influence and exchange between Africa, the African diaspora, Europe, and America with a particular emphasis on sound and music. How has the sound of Africa been transcribed, recorded, stored, transported, and represented in the West? What can this tell us about global cultural flow? How do specific recording techniques articulate with global music markets? The course analyzes the transatlantic feedback between Africa, America and Europe; evaluates the politics of transcription, ethnographic description, and recording; and examines the changing role for traditional African music in a global world. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1345 - Fashion and Power   This course examines fashion as a form of communication and culture. Through cultural and media studies theory, we will examine how fashion makes meaning, and how it has been valued through history, popular culture and media institutions, focusing on the relationship between fashion, visual self-presentation, and power. The course will situate fashion both in terms of its production and consumption, addressing its role in relation to identity and body politics (gender, race, sexuality, class), art and status, nationhood and the global economy, celebrity and Hollywood culture, youth cultures and subversive practices. Note: This course is also offered abroad at NYU Paris under course code MCC-UE 9345. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1346 - Fame   Fame, notoriety, renown &ndash; the desire to be recognized and immortalized is the most enduring and perhaps the most desirable form of power. Culture, commerce, politics, and religion all proffer promises of fame &ndash; whether for fifteen minutes or fifteen centuries. This course departs from the insight that fame is a uniquely human ambition and a central force for social life. Together, we will investigate this subject by asking, what is fame?, Why do people want it?, How do they get it?, What can they do with it?, How does it affect those around them, and the generations that come after? In other words, what kind of good is fame? Drawing on texts from history, ethnography, theory, literature, philosophy, and contemporary media, this course will reflect on the ethics, erotics, pragmatics and pathologies of fame. We will compare fame to other forms of recognition (reputation, honor, etc.), and look at how fame operates in various social and historical circumstances, from small agricultural communities to enormous, hyper-mediated societies such as our own. Is fame, in our contemporary understanding, possible before photography? We&rsquo;ll consider the enduring question of fame as it is transformed by the technological conditions of reproducing reputation across space, time, and societies.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1347 - Culture of the Screen: From the Cinematic to the Handheld   Whether large, small, wide, high-definition, public, personal, shared, or handheld, screens are one of the most pervasive technologies in everyday life. From spaces of work to spaces of leisure, screens are sites for collaboration, performance, surveillance, and resistance. This course traces the cultural history of screens through a range of forms -- from the panorama to the cinema, from the radar system to the television, and from the terminal to the mobile device -- to provide a way of thinking about the development of the screen as simultaneously architectural, material, representational and computational. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1351 - War As Media   This course examines the proposition that contemporary war should be understood as media.
