All program elements are outlined below.   The program also requires that you have a 3.0 GPA or better in all graduate courses and guided studies (readings, projects, theses, dissertations). Averages are separately computed for courses and guided studies. Transfer credits from other institutions are not included in this average.   Required Program Core Courses   3.00 Credits Infrastructure Planning, Engineering and Economics CE-GY 7813 This course covers the identification, formulation, preliminary appraisal and detailed analysis of individual civil engineering projects and systems. It also covers different approaches for government agencies, public utilities, industrial firms and private entrepreneurs. Other topics include: Planning, which considers projects that satisfy single and multiple purposes and objectives, meet local and regional needs and take advantage of opportunities for development; financial and economic analyses, including sensitivity and risk analysis; mathematical models for evaluation of alternatives and optimization; and impacts of projects: environmental, social, regional economic growth, legal and institutional and public involvement.  Prerequisite: Graduate Standing 3.00 Credits Introduction to Urban Systems Engineering CE-GY 7843 This course provides a descriptive overview of key infrastructure systems and technologies that must be managed, operated and maintained. Systems treated include buildings and structures, water supply, solid and liquid waste handling and disposal, transportation, power, communications and information systems, health and hospitals, police and preprotection. The course explores the financial, political, administrative, legal and institutional settings of these systems and technologies. A portion of the course features distinguished guest lecturers who are experts in some of the systems and technologies included.  Prerequisite: Graduate Standing 3.00 Credits Concepts and Implementation of Infrastructure Management Systems CE-GY 7853 This course reviews state-of-the-art performance monitoring and system condition assessment methodologies as part of infrastructure management systems. Emphasis is on information technologies as applied to remote sensing and database development for urban systems management. Infrastructure tools, such as GIS and dedicated databases for condition assessment are represented in a laboratory environment. Invited experts participate in such areas as transportation, water distribution and utilities.  Prerequisite: Graduate Standing 3.00 Credits Environmental Impact Assessment CE-GY 7673 The course examines legal and technical requirements in preparing environmental-impact statements. Considerations include legal and technical requirements, the procedure and the interdisciplinary nature of the analysis. Topics include overall impact evaluation, categories of impacts, problem definition, quantification of impact, methods used in analysis, field evaluations, mitigations, hearing procedures and management. Practical examples and case studies are used.  Prerequisite: Graduate Standing   *    3.00 Credits Infrastructure Financing: Structuring of A Deal CE-GY 8733 This course examines what it takes to structure a deal from a credit perspective, legally and financially, for domestic and international projects. In the domestic sector, the course focuses on transportation projects, examining the peculiarities and the uniqueness of the capital market. Examples are studied and recent changes are discussed in areas such as financing transportation projects and the dramatically changing nature of financing these projects. In the international sector, the course covers innovative financing techniques. Prerequisite: Admission to the Exec 21 Program or permission of a Construction Management Program Director.   Minor Areas of Concentration   The program offers 4 areas of concentration. To complete a minor, you must take 3 required courses and 2 to 3 technical electives that are available to all program students. An adviser may approve additional electives.   You may decide not to take a specified minor area. Instead, you may opt to take 5 or 6 technical electives from the approved list in any specified area. The number of technical electives is influenced by what you choose for your capstone experience: a 3-credit case study report or a 6-credit MS thesis.

Grade Requirements   To earn a MS degree from the School of Engineering, you must maintain a B average (3.0 GPA) or better in (1) all graduate courses taken at the School of Engineering, (2) all graduate courses taken in the Department of Civil Engineering and (3) all graduate guided studies (readings, project, thesis). Poor scholastic performance (under 3.0 GPA) may lead to being placed on graduate probation. If your grades do not improve, you may be disqualified from further graduate study in the department. You may repeat a course with your adviser&rsquo;s approval. When a course is repeated, only the later grade counts toward your GPA. If a course is repeated more than once, only the first grade is dropped from the GPA computation. In the event that you are required to take undergraduate prerequisite courses as a condition of admission, a grade of B- or better is required for every prerequisite course taken, and the cumulative GPA of all required prerequisite courses must be at least 3.0.
