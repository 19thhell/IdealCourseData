[ edit ] Non-Subject Specific Definition:   Movement or attitude stressing strict and literal adherence to a set of basic principles. 1. (sometimes initial capital letter) a movement in American Protestantism that arose in the early part of the 20th century in reaction to modernism and that stresses the infallibility of the Bible not only in matters of faith and morals but also as a literal historical record, holding as essential to Christian faith belief in such doctrines as the creation of the world, the virgin birth, physical resurrection, atonement by the sacrificial death of Christ, and the Second Coming. 2. the beliefs held by those in this movement. 3. strict adherence to any set of basic ideas or principles: the fundamentalism of the extreme conservatives.   The American Heritage Dictionary defines fundamentalism as a usually religious movement or point of view characterized by a return to fundamental principles, by rigid adherence to those principles, and often by intolerance of other views and opposition to secularism.   Within Christianity, Fundamentalism has its roots in Biblicism. Biblicism has finds its roots in medieval Europe. The Twentieth Century Encyclopaedia of Religious Knowledge (1955) states that Biblicism began as: \"The practice of those medieval scholastics who depended on a strictly literal interpretation of the Bible for their line of argument. The biblicists were among the formal rationalsits who employed Aristotle's system and method in dealing with biblical thought. Their finespun theories proved sterile, but biblicism is to be found in all ages. . . The tendency toward biblicism is seen most markedly in two related lines: millenneialism and fundamentalism. . . Fundamentalists have certain basic beliefs which they defend largely on a literal interpretation if statements of Scripture\" (p. 160).     [ edit ] Brief History:   Fundamentalism is a continuing historical phenomenon, characterized by a sense of embattled alienation in the midst of the surrounding culture , even where the culture may be nominally influenced by the adherents' religion. The term can also refer specifically to the belief that one's religious texts are infallible and historically accurate, despite possible contradiction of these claims by modern scholarship.   Similarly, Fundamentalism, as the term is used today, is a fairly recent creation closely linked with the historical and cultural contexts of 1920s U.S. Protestantism (e.g. the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy in the Presbyterian Church). Since then the term has been 'exported' abroad and applied to a wide variety of religions including Buddhism, Judaism and Islam. Fundamentalism should not be confused with Revivalist movements which can be traced back much further in time and are not specific to 20th Century America.   Many groups described as fundamentalist often strongly object to this term because of the negative connotations it carries, or because it implies a similarity between themselves and other groups, which they find objectionable.     [ edit ] The fundamentalist phenomenon   Although the term fundamentalism in popular usage sometimes refers derogatorily to any fringe religious group, or to extremist ethnic movements with only nominally religious motivations, the term does have a more precise denotation. \"Fundamentalist\" describes a movement to return to what is considered the defining or founding principles of the religion. It has especially come to refer to any religious enclave that intentionally resists identification with the larger religious group in which it originally arose, on the basis that fundamental principles upon which the larger religious group is supposedly founded have become corrupt or displaced by alternative principles hostile to its identity.   This formation of a separate identity is deemed necessary on account of a perception that the religious community has surrendered its ability to define itself in religious terms. The \"fundamentals\" of the religion have been jettisoned by neglect, lost through compromise and inattention, so that the general religious community's explanation of itself appears to the separatist to be in terms that are completely alien and fundamentally hostile to the religion itself. Fundamentalist movements are therefore founded upon the same religious principles as the larger group, but the fundamentalists more self-consciously attempt to build an entire approach to the modern world based on strict fidelity to those principles, to preserve a distinctness both of doctrine and of life.   The term itself is borrowed from the title of a four volume set of books called The Fundamentals published in 1909 . The books were published by the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (B.I.O.L.A. now Biola University ), and edited by R.A. Torrey, who was a minister affiliated with the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago . Initially the project was funded by Lyman Stewart , president and cofounder of the Union Oil Company of California (currently known as UNOCAL ), and cofounder of B.I.O.L.A. The books were a republication of a series of essays that were sent by mail to every minister in the United States. They were called \"The Fundamentals\" because they appealed to all Christians to affirm specific fundamental doctrines such as The Virgin Birth and bodily Resurrection of Jesus . This series of essays came to be representative of the \" Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy \" which appeared late in the 19th century within the Protestant churches of the United States , and continued in earnest through the 1920s .   The pattern of the conflict between Fundamentalism and Modernism in Protestant Christianity has remarkable parallels in other religious communities, and in its use as a description of these corresponding aspects in otherwise diverse religious movements the term \"fundamentalist\" has become more than only a term either of self-description or of derogatory contempt. Fundamentalism is therefore a movement through which the adherents attempt to rescue religious identity from absorption into modern, Western culture, where this absorption appears to the enclave to have made irreversible progress in the wider religious community, necessitating the assertion of a separate identity based upon the fundamental or founding principles of the religion.   Fundamentalists believe their cause to have grave and even cosmic importance. They see themselves as protecting not only a distinctive doctrine, but also a vital principle, and a way of life and of salvation. Community, comprehensively centered upon a clearly defined religious way of life in all of its aspects, is the promise of fundamentalist movements, and it therefore appeals to those adherents of religion who find little that is distinctive, or authentically vital in their previous religious identity.   The fundamentalist \"wall of virtue\", which protects their identity, is erected against not only alien religions, but also against the modernized, compromised, nominal version of their own religion. In Christianity, fundamentalists can be known as \"born again\" and \"Bible-believing\" Protestants, as opposed to \"mainline\", \"liberal\", \"modernist\" Protestants, who represent \"Churchianity\". In Islam there are jama'at ( Arabic : (religious) enclaves with connotations of close fellowship ) fundamentalists self-consciously engaged in jihad ( struggle ) against the Western culture that suppresses authentic Islam ( submission ) and the God-given ( Shari'ah ) way of life. In Judaism fundamentalists are Haredi \"Torah-true\" Jews. There are fundamentalist equivalents in Hinduism and other world religions. These groups insist on a sharp boundary between themselves and the faithful adherents of other religions, and finally between a \"sacred\" view of life and the \"secular\" world and \"nominal religion\". Fundamentalists direct their critiques toward and draw most of their converts from the larger community of their religion, by attempting to convince them that they are not experiencing the authentic version of their professed religion.   Many scholars see most forms of fundamentalism as having similar traits. This is especially obvious if modernity , secularism or an atheistic perspective is adopted as the norm, against which these varieties of traditionalism or supernaturalism are compared. From such a perspective, Peter Huff wrote in the International Journal on World Peace :     \"According to Antoun, fundamentalists in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, despite their doctrinal and practical differences, are united by a common worldview which anchors all of life in the authority of the sacred and a shared ethos that expresses itself through outrage at the pace and extent of modern secularization.\" [2]       [ edit ] Objections to the use of the term   Christian fundamentalists , who generally consider the term to be positive when used to refer to themselves, often strongly object to the placement of themselves and Islamist groups into a single category. They feel that characteristics based on the new definition are wrongly projected back onto Christian fundamentalists by their critics. There is however no objection to the term fundamentalist when used to describe only Christian groups, and objections to the term Muslim fundamentalist are much less strong. The term has also been applied to Protestant Christians that are against Catholicism .   Many Muslims protest the use of the term when referring to Islamist groups, because all Muslims believe in the absolute inerrancy of the Qur'an , and western writers only use the term to refer to extremist groups. Furthermore, many Muslims strongly object to being placed in the same category as Christian fundamentalists, whom they see as being religiously incorrect. Unlike Christian fundamentalist groups, Islamist groups do not use the term fundamentalist to refer to themselves. Shiite groups which are considered fundamentalist in the western world are not considered such in the Islamic world.   The Associated Press ' AP Stylebook recommends that the term fundamentalist not be used for any group that does not apply the term to itself. This would generally mean that some Christian groups can be described as fundamentalist, but Islamist groups can not be. This recommendation is not universally followed by news writers, however.     [ edit ] Basic beliefs of religious fundamentalists   For religious fundamentalists, sacred scripture is considered the authentic, and literal word of their religion's god. Fundamentalist beliefs depend on the twin doctrines that their god articulated his will precisely to prophets, and that followers also have a reliable and perfect record of that revelation .   Since a religion's scripture is considered the word of its god, fundamentalists believe that no person is right to change it or disagree with it. Within that though, there are many differences between different fundamentalists. For example, many Christian fundamentalists believe in free will, that every person is allowed to make their own choices, but with consequence. The appeal of this point of view is its simplicity: every person can do what they like, as much as they are able, but God will bring those who disobey him without repentance (\"turning away from sin\") to justice. This is made clear by the commands of Jesus in the New Testament concerning any kind of revenge(\"Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord\" for one). The Judaist belief is similar, but they do not believe that it is wrong to take vengeance. The fundamentalist insistence on strict observation of religious laws may lead to an accusation of legalism in addition to exclusivism in the interpretation of metaphysical beliefs.     [ edit ] Christian views       Main article: Fundamentalist Christianity       Self-described Christian fundamentalists see the scripture, a combination of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament , as both infallible and historically accurate. The New Testament represents a new covenant between God and human beings, which is held to fulfill the Old Testament, in regard to God's redemptive plan. On the basis of this confidence in Scripture, many fundamentalist Christians accept the account of scripture as being literally true.   It is important to distinguish between the \"literalist\" and Fundamentalist groups within the Christian community. Literalists, as the name indicates, hold that the Bible should be taken literally in every part. English language Bibles are themselves translations and therefore not a literal word-for-word rendering of the original texts; the King James Version is notable, which while poetic, uses arcane language. Literalism can also encompass only believing one translation of the Bible, usually the KJV, is valid for use.   Many Christian Fundamentalists, on the other hand, are for the most part content to hold that the Bible should be taken literally only where there is no indication to the contrary. As William Jennings Bryan put it, in response to Clarence Darrow's questioning during the Scopes Trial (1925):     \"I believe that everything in the Bible should be accepted as it is given there; some of the Bible is given illustratively. For instance: 'Ye are the salt of the earth.' I would not insist that man was actually salt, or that he had flesh of salt, but it is used in the sense of salt as saving Ebba's people.\"     Still, the tendency toward a literal reading of the Bible is criticized by mainline Protestant scholars and others. [3] [4] [5] .   According to Lionel Caplan, a so-called expert on religious fundamentalism,     \"In the Protestant milieu of the USA, fundamentalism crystallized in response to liberals' eagerness to bring Christianity into the post-Darwinian world by questioning the scientific and historical accuracy of the scripture. Subsequently, the scourge of evolution was linked with socialism, and during the Cold War period, with communism. This unholy trinity came to be regarded as a sinister, atheistic threat to Christian America...Bruce [Chpt. 9 of Caplan 1987] suggests that to understand the success of the Moral Majority, an alliance between the conservative forces of the New Right and the fundamentalist wings on the mainly Southern Baptist Churches, we have to appreciate these fears, as well as the impact of a host of unwelcome changes - in attitudes to 'morality', family, civil and women's rights, and so on - which have, in the wake of economic transformations since the Second World War, penetrated especially the previously insular social and cultural world of the American South.\" (Caplan 1987: 6)     The term fundamentalist has historically referred specifically to members of the various Protestant denominations who subscribed to the five \"fundamentals\", rather than fundamentalists forming an independent denomination. This wider movement of Fundamentalist Christianity has since broken up into various movements which are better described in other terms. Early \"fundamentalists\" included J. Gresham Machen and B.B. Warfield , men who would not be considered \"Fundamentalists\" today.   Over time the term came to be associated with a particular segment of evangelical Protestantism , who distinguished themselves by their separatist approach toward modernity , toward aspects of the culture which they feel typify the modern world, and toward other Christians who did not similarly separate themselves. Examples of things that fundamentalists might believe important to avoid are, modern translations of the Bible, alcoholic drinks or recreational drugs, tobacco, modern popular music including Christian contemporary music, folk instruments in worship, dancing, \"mixed bathing\" (men and women swimming together), and gender-neutral or trans-gender clothing and hair-styles. Such things might seem innocuous to the outsider, but to some fundamentalists they represent the leading edge of a threat to the virtuous way of life and the purer form of belief that they seek to protect and to hold forth before the world as an example. Many fundamentalists accept only the King James Version translation of the Bible and study tools based on it, such as the Scofield Reference Bible .   Because of the prevalence of dispensational eschatology , some fundamentalists vehemently support the modern nation of Israel , believing the Jews to have significance in God's purposes parallel to the Christian churches, and a special role to play at the end of the world.   The term, fundamentalist , is difficult to apply unambiguously, especially when applied to groups outside the USA, which are typically far less dogmatic. Many self-described Fundamentalists would include Jerry Falwell in their company, but would not embrace Pat Robertson as a fundamentalist because of his espousal of charismatic teachings. Fundamentalist institutions include Pensacola Christian College , and Bob Jones University , but classically Fundamentalist schools such as Fuller Theological Seminary and Biola University no longer describe themselves as Fundamentalist, although in the broad sense described by this article they are fundamentalist (better, Evangelical ) in their perspective. (The forerunner to Biola U. - the Bible Institute of Los Angeles - was founded under the financial patronage of Lyman Stewart, with his brother Milton, underwrote the publication of a series of 12 books jointly entitled The Fundamentals between 1909 and 1920.)   In its broader sense fundamentalism has been applied to some Catholic as well as Protestant groups within Christianity. Arguably fundamentalist features within some Catholic monastic or religious orders, past or present, have not yet been sufficiently discussed. Members of the Catholic group, Opus Dei, insist that they lack fundamentalist and other traits usually ascribed to cults or sects. They add that if their perspective can be called fundamentalist, then so can many other groups among Catholic and Protestant Christians(In example, the Catholic Church does not believe in the total sinfulness of homosexuality, a belief which would be a far stretch for most Protestant churches). Their critics would readily agree and expand the issue: fundamentalism exists more pervasively, add critics like Roderick Hindery, than has been previously realized. Fundamentalist dysfunctions and functions recently recognized in new religious groups are freshly perceived as increasingly visible among larger traditions. In short, intensive fundamentalist traits shed new light on the presence of fundamentalist features in more comprehensive and traditional contexts. Further discussion might disclose how deeply fundamentalist phenomena may or may not be rooted and spread throughout broader religious traditions.     [ edit ] Jewish views       Main article: Jewish fundamentalism       Most Jewish denominations believe that the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible or Old Testament) cannot be understood literally or alone, but rather needs to be read in conjunction with additional material known as the Oral Torah ; this material is contained in the Mishnah , Talmud , Gemara and Midrash . While the Tanakh is not read in a literal fashion, Orthodox Judaism does view the text itself as divine, infallible, and transmitted essentially without change, and places great import in the specific words and letters of the Torah . As well, adherents of Orthodox Judaism , especially Haredi Judaism , see the Mishnah, Talmud and Midrash as divine and infallible in content, if not in specific wording. Hasidic Jews frequently ascribe infallibility to their Rebbe 's interpretation of the traditional sources of truth. On the other hand the Karaites according to themselves \"are a Jewish sect which does not recognize the authority of the post-Biblical tradition incorporated in the Talmud and in the latter Rabbinic works.\"     [ edit ] Mormon views       Main article: Mormon fundamentalism       Mormon fundamentalism is a conservative movement of Mormonism that believes or practices what its adherents consider to be the fundamental aspects of Mormonism . Most often, Mormon fundamentalism represents a break from the brand of Mormonism practiced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and a return to Mormon doctrines and practices which adherents believe the LDS Church has wrongly abandoned, such as plural marriage , the Law of Consecration , the Adam-God theory , blood atonement , the Patriarchal Priesthood , elements of the Mormon Endowment ritual, and often the exclusion of Blacks from the priesthood . Mormon fundamentalists have formed numerous sects, many of which have established small, cohesive, and isolated communities in areas of the Western United States .     [ edit ] Islamic views       Main article: Islamic fundamentalism       Muslims believe that their religion was revealed by God ( Allah in Arabic) to Muhammad ,the prophet of Islam, the final prophet delivered by God. However, the Muslims brand of conservatism which is generally termed Islamic fundamentalism encompasses all the following:     It describes the beliefs of traditional Muslims that they should restrict themselves to literal interpretations of their sacred texts, the Qur'an and Hadith . This may describe the private religious attitudes of individuals and have no relationship with larger social groups.       It describes a variety of religious movements and political parties in Muslim communities.       As opposed to the above two usages, in the West \"Islamic fundamentalism\" is most often used to describe Muslim individuals and groups which advocate Islamism , a political ideology calling for the replacement of state secular laws with Islamic law . The more radical of these Islamists may advocate violent overthrow of secular states, or even Islamist terrorism .     In all the above cases, Islamic fundamentalism represents a conservative religious belief, as opposed to liberal movements within Islam .     [ edit ] \"Non-Abrahamic\" religions   Some argue that the religious idea of fundamentalism is limited to \" Abrahamic religions \", and have connected the phenomenon specifically to the notion of revealed religion. However, the answer to the question, Who is a fundamentalist? is in the eye of the beholder. It is not uncommon for detractors to apply the fundamentalist label to Wiccans or virtually anything else religious, describing an attitude rather than a self-perception or a doctrine.     [ edit ] Buddhism   H.H. the Dalai Lama has agreed that there exist also extremists and fundamentalists in Buddhism, [1] arguing that fundamentalists are not even able to pick up the idea of a possibly dialogue. [1]   The Japanese Nichiren sect of Buddhism , which believes that other forms of Buddhism are heretical, is also sometimes labelled fundamentalist. However, Nichiren Buddhism contains influences from Shintoism and a strongly nationalistic streak that would disqualify it from being fundamentalist in the strictest sense.   At the height of the Dorje Shugden Controversy Robert Thurman claimed: \"It would not be unfair to call Shugdens the Taliban of Tibetan Buddhism\" referring to the Muslim extremists of Afghanistan, who believe in swift and brutal justice. [2] A statement which was rejected by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso , founder of the NKT , arguing: \"This really is a false accusation against innocent people. We have never done anything wrong. We simply practise our own religion, as passed down through many generations.\" [3]   David N. Kay argued in his doctoral research that the New Kadampa Tradition fits into the criteria of Robert Lifton \u2019s definition of the fundamentalist self . [4] Inken Prohl stated: \"Kay\u2019s argument shows that, due to the NKT\u2019s homogenous organizational structure, its attempts to establish a uniformity of belief and practice within the organization, and an emphasis on following one tradition coupled with a critical attitude toward other traditions, the NKT fits into Lifton\u2019s category of \u201cfundamentalism\u201d. Kay describes how struggles for control of NKT\u2019s institutional sites and NKT\u2019s repressed memory of its institutional conflicts both contribute to NKT\u2019s later 'fundamentalist' identity.\" [5] However Prohl states also: \"Although this observation presents a convincing and challenging observation of a mechanism at work in Buddhist organizations in the West, I would hesitate to characterize, as Kay does, such organizations as 'fundamentalist' due to the vague and, at the same time, extremely political implications of this term.\" [5]     [ edit ] Non-religious fundamentalism   Some refer to any literal-minded or intolerant philosophy with pretense of being the sole source of objective truth, as fundamentalist , regardless of whether it is usually called a religion . For example, when Albania under Enver Hoxha declared itself an \"atheist state\", it was deemed by some to be a kind of \"Fundamentalist Atheism\" or more accurately \" Stalinist Fundamentalism\". There are people who in their attempt to live according to the writings of Ayn Rand seem to detractors to transgress respect for other perspectives in propagating their views, so that they are deemed to be a kind of \" Objectivist Fundamentalist\", and they are spoken of derogatorily as, \" Randroids .\" In France, the imposition of restrictions on public display of religion has been labelled by some as \"Secular Fundamentalism.\" The idea of non-religious Fundamentalism almost always expands the definition of \"Fundamentalism\" along the lines of criticisms.   Occasionally, it seems to represent an idea of purity, and is self-applied as signifying a rather counter-cultural fidelity to some noble, simple, but overlooked principle, as in Economic fundamentalism ; but the same term can be used in a critical way. Roderick Hindery first lists positive qualities attributed to political, economic, or other forms of cultural fundamentalism. They include \"vitality, enthusiasm, willingness to back up words with actions, and the avoidance of facile compromise.\" Then, negative aspects are analyzed, such as psychological attitudes, occasionally elitist and pessimistic perspectives, and in some cases literalism.     [ edit ] Arguments in favour of fundamentalist positions   Fundamentalists claim both that they practice their religion as the first adherents did and that this is how religion should be practiced. In other words, a Christian ought to believe and practice as those who knew and followed Jesus during his time on earth. A Muslim ought to give the same consideration to the followers of Muhammad . Analogous arguments can be made for most systems of religious belief. Fundamentalists justify this belief on the idea that the founders of the world's religions said and did things that were not written down; in other words, their original disciples knew things that we don't. For fundamentalist Christians, this claim is justified by the Gospel of John , which ends with the statement \"there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.\" (John 21:25, NKJV) Further justification is adducted from the static or falling attendance of many liberal or reformed congregations, from the scandals that have struck, for example, the Roman Catholic church , and from the increasing difficulty of distinguishing between religiously liberal and avowedly secularist views on such matters as homosexuality , abortion and women's rights .     [ edit ] Criticism of the fundamentalist position   Many criticisms of the fundamentalist position have been offered. Some of the most common are that the theological claims made by fundamentalist groups cannot be proven, are irrational or are demonstrably false and contrary to scientific evidence. For example, some of these criticisms were famously asserted by Clarence Darrow in the Scopes Monkey Trial . Another criticism is that the rhetoric of these groups offers an appearance of uniformity and simplicity, yet within each faith community, one actually finds different texts of religious law that are accepted; each text has varying interpretations. Consequently, each fundamentalist faith is observed to splinter into many mutually antagonistic groups. They are often as hostile to each other as they are to other religions. In addition, it has been observed that there is no such thing as a Muslim , Jewish , or Christian Fundamentalist. Rather, a fundamentalist's fundamentalism is their primary concern, over and above other denominational or faith considerations.   In order to carry out the fundamentalist program in practice, critics claim that one would first need a perfect understanding of the ancient language of the original text, if indeed the true text can be discerned from among variants. Furthermore, they charge that fundamentalists fail to recognize that fallible human beings are the ones who transmit this tradition. Elliot N. Dorff writes \"Even if one wanted to follow the literal word of God, the need for people first to understand that word necessitates human interpretation. Through that process human fallibility is inextricably mixed into the very meaning of the divine word. As a result, it is impossible to follow the indisputable word of God; one can only achieve a human understanding of God's will.\" ( A Living Tree , Dorff, 1988)   Most fundamentalists do not deal with this argument. Those that do reply to this critique hold their own religious leaders are guided by God, and thus partake of divine infallibility.   Fundamentalism is held by many to cause followers of a faith to become overly attached to their religion's leaders. Followers believe that person to be infallible, or the voice of God, and who can direct them infallibly in the interpretation of the sources of truth. Religions which have such a hold over their followers are often referred to as cults .   A general criticism of fundamentalism is the claim that fundamentalists are selective in what they believe and practice. For instance, the book of Exodus dictates that when a man's brother dies, he must marry his widowed sister-in-law. Yet fundamentalist Christians do not adhere to this doctrine, despite the fact that it is not contradicted in the New Testament. However, defenders of fundamentalism argue that according to New Testament theology, large parts, if not all of the Mosaic Law, are not normative for modern Christians. They may cite passages such Colossians 2:14 which describes Jesus Christ as \"having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us\" (NKJV). Other fundamentalists argue that only certain parts of the Mosaic Law, parts that rely on universal moral principles, are normative for today. Therefore, in their view, there is no contradiction between such passages in the Old Testament and their belief in biblical infallibility. Critics contend that unreasonable literal readings of the Bible and other religious texts by fundamentalists necessarily result in advocating contradictory and even hypocritical positions.   Christian fundamentalists often insist that the Bible is infallible in its various prophetic assertions. However, in the book of Ezekiel , specifically Ezekiel 26:1-14, we find a prophecy (the conquering of the city of Tyre) that, according to Ezekiel 29:18-20, seems to have not been fullfilled in exactly the way the prophet had predicted. This prophecy is the subject of much scholarly debate in regard to interpretation of the prophecy itself and the interpretation of the actual events that took place. At any rate, it is clear that Nebuchadnezzar did in fact conquer the city of Tyre as prophesied, although the spoils of the battle apparently were not as extravagant as Ezekiel predicted they would be, and the city has been rebuilt (modern day Sur, Lebanon) contrary to prophetic claims it would never stand again.   Another discrepancy found in the actual recorded words of the Bible is found in Mark 2:26 when Jesus asks the Pharisees if they remembered how David \u201cwent into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the bread of offering.\u201d According to 1 Samuel 21, however, the high priest was Abiathar\u2019s father, Ahimelech. This stark contrast between these two books of the Bible illustrates that in no way is the Bible absolutely inerrant.   Fundamentalist teachings are criticised by questioning the historical accuracy of the religious texts in question when compared to other historical sources; as well as questioning how documents that some believe to contain many contradictions could be considered infallible.     [ edit ] Fundamentalism and politics   \"Fundamentalism\" is a morally charged, emotive term, often used as a term of opprobrium, particularly in combination with other epithets (as in the phrase \" Muslim fundamentalists \" and \"right-wing fundamentalists\").   Very often religious fundamentalists, in all religions, are politically aware. They feel that legal and government processes must recognise the way of life they see as prescribed by their god and set forth in their scripture. In their eyes, the state must be subservient to their god: this, however is a basic belief of most religions, even if their practitioners do not insist upon it.   Most \"Christian\" countries go through a similar stage in their development. The governments of many Muslim countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia , are Islamic, and include people with fundamentalist beliefs. More secular politicians are often to be found working in opposition movements in these countries.     [ edit ] References     Appleby, R. Scott, Gabriel Abraham Almond, and Emmanuel Sivan (2003).

[ edit ] Non-Subject Specific Definition:   Movement or attitude stressing strict and literal adherence to a set of basic principles. 1. (sometimes initial capital letter) a movement in American Protestantism that arose in the early part of the 20th century in reaction to modernism and that stresses the infallibility of the Bible not only in matters of faith and morals but also as a literal historical record, holding as essential to Christian faith belief in such doctrines as the creation of the world, the virgin birth, physical resurrection, atonement by the sacrificial death of Christ, and the Second Coming. 2. the beliefs held by those in this movement. 3. strict adherence to any set of basic ideas or principles: the fundamentalism of the extreme conservatives.   The American Heritage Dictionary defines fundamentalism as a usually religious movement or point of view characterized by a return to fundamental principles, by rigid adherence to those principles, and often by intolerance of other views and opposition to secularism.   Within Christianity, Fundamentalism has its roots in Biblicism. Biblicism has finds its roots in medieval Europe. The Twentieth Century Encyclopaedia of Religious Knowledge (1955) states that Biblicism began as: \"The practice of those medieval scholastics who depended on a strictly literal interpretation of the Bible for their line of argument. The biblicists were among the formal rationalsits who employed Aristotle's system and method in dealing with biblical thought. Their finespun theories proved sterile, but biblicism is to be found in all ages. . . The tendency toward biblicism is seen most markedly in two related lines: millenneialism and fundamentalism. . . Fundamentalists have certain basic beliefs which they defend largely on a literal interpretation if statements of Scripture\" (p. 160).     [ edit ] Brief History:   Fundamentalism is a continuing historical phenomenon, characterized by a sense of embattled alienation in the midst of the surrounding culture , even where the culture may be nominally influenced by the adherents' religion. The term can also refer specifically to the belief that one's religious texts are infallible and historically accurate, despite possible contradiction of these claims by modern scholarship.   Similarly, Fundamentalism, as the term is used today, is a fairly recent creation closely linked with the historical and cultural contexts of 1920s U.S. Protestantism (e.g. the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy in the Presbyterian Church). Since then the term has been 'exported' abroad and applied to a wide variety of religions including Buddhism, Judaism and Islam. Fundamentalism should not be confused with Revivalist movements which can be traced back much further in time and are not specific to 20th Century America.   Many groups described as fundamentalist often strongly object to this term because of the negative connotations it carries, or because it implies a similarity between themselves and other groups, which they find objectionable.     [ edit ] The fundamentalist phenomenon   Although the term fundamentalism in popular usage sometimes refers derogatorily to any fringe religious group, or to extremist ethnic movements with only nominally religious motivations, the term does have a more precise denotation. \"Fundamentalist\" describes a movement to return to what is considered the defining or founding principles of the religion. It has especially come to refer to any religious enclave that intentionally resists identification with the larger religious group in which it originally arose, on the basis that fundamental principles upon which the larger religious group is supposedly founded have become corrupt or displaced by alternative principles hostile to its identity.   This formation of a separate identity is deemed necessary on account of a perception that the religious community has surrendered its ability to define itself in religious terms. The \"fundamentals\" of the religion have been jettisoned by neglect, lost through compromise and inattention, so that the general religious community's explanation of itself appears to the separatist to be in terms that are completely alien and fundamentally hostile to the religion itself. Fundamentalist movements are therefore founded upon the same religious principles as the larger group, but the fundamentalists more self-consciously attempt to build an entire approach to the modern world based on strict fidelity to those principles, to preserve a distinctness both of doctrine and of life.   The term itself is borrowed from the title of a four volume set of books called The Fundamentals published in 1909 . The books were published by the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (B.I.O.L.A. now Biola University ), and edited by R.A. Torrey, who was a minister affiliated with the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago . Initially the project was funded by Lyman Stewart , president and cofounder of the Union Oil Company of California (currently known as UNOCAL ), and cofounder of B.I.O.L.A. The books were a republication of a series of essays that were sent by mail to every minister in the United States. They were called \"The Fundamentals\" because they appealed to all Christians to affirm specific fundamental doctrines such as The Virgin Birth and bodily Resurrection of Jesus . This series of essays came to be representative of the \" Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy \" which appeared late in the 19th century within the Protestant churches of the United States , and continued in earnest through the 1920s .   The pattern of the conflict between Fundamentalism and Modernism in Protestant Christianity has remarkable parallels in other religious communities, and in its use as a description of these corresponding aspects in otherwise diverse religious movements the term \"fundamentalist\" has become more than only a term either of self-description or of derogatory contempt. Fundamentalism is therefore a movement through which the adherents attempt to rescue religious identity from absorption into modern, Western culture, where this absorption appears to the enclave to have made irreversible progress in the wider religious community, necessitating the assertion of a separate identity based upon the fundamental or founding principles of the religion.   Fundamentalists believe their cause to have grave and even cosmic importance. They see themselves as protecting not only a distinctive doctrine, but also a vital principle, and a way of life and of salvation. Community, comprehensively centered upon a clearly defined religious way of life in all of its aspects, is the promise of fundamentalist movements, and it therefore appeals to those adherents of religion who find little that is distinctive, or authentically vital in their previous religious identity.   The fundamentalist \"wall of virtue\", which protects their identity, is erected against not only alien religions, but also against the modernized, compromised, nominal version of their own religion. In Christianity, fundamentalists can be known as \"born again\" and \"Bible-believing\" Protestants, as opposed to \"mainline\", \"liberal\", \"modernist\" Protestants, who represent \"Churchianity\". In Islam there are jama'at ( Arabic : (religious) enclaves with connotations of close fellowship ) fundamentalists self-consciously engaged in jihad ( struggle ) against the Western culture that suppresses authentic Islam ( submission ) and the God-given ( Shari'ah ) way of life. In Judaism fundamentalists are Haredi \"Torah-true\" Jews. There are fundamentalist equivalents in Hinduism and other world religions. These groups insist on a sharp boundary between themselves and the faithful adherents of other religions, and finally between a \"sacred\" view of life and the \"secular\" world and \"nominal religion\". Fundamentalists direct their critiques toward and draw most of their converts from the larger community of their religion, by attempting to convince them that they are not experiencing the authentic version of their professed religion.   Many scholars see most forms of fundamentalism as having similar traits. This is especially obvious if modernity , secularism or an atheistic perspective is adopted as the norm, against which these varieties of traditionalism or supernaturalism are compared. From such a perspective, Peter Huff wrote in the International Journal on World Peace :     \"According to Antoun, fundamentalists in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, despite their doctrinal and practical differences, are united by a common worldview which anchors all of life in the authority of the sacred and a shared ethos that expresses itself through outrage at the pace and extent of modern secularization.\" [2]       [ edit ] Objections to the use of the term   Christian fundamentalists , who generally consider the term to be positive when used to refer to themselves, often strongly object to the placement of themselves and Islamist groups into a single category. They feel that characteristics based on the new definition are wrongly projected back onto Christian fundamentalists by their critics. There is however no objection to the term fundamentalist when used to describe only Christian groups, and objections to the term Muslim fundamentalist are much less strong. The term has also been applied to Protestant Christians that are against Catholicism .   Many Muslims protest the use of the term when referring to Islamist groups, because all Muslims believe in the absolute inerrancy of the Qur'an , and western writers only use the term to refer to extremist groups. Furthermore, many Muslims strongly object to being placed in the same category as Christian fundamentalists, whom they see as being religiously incorrect. Unlike Christian fundamentalist groups, Islamist groups do not use the term fundamentalist to refer to themselves. Shiite groups which are considered fundamentalist in the western world are not considered such in the Islamic world.   The Associated Press ' AP Stylebook recommends that the term fundamentalist not be used for any group that does not apply the term to itself. This would generally mean that some Christian groups can be described as fundamentalist, but Islamist groups can not be. This recommendation is not universally followed by news writers, however.     [ edit ] Basic beliefs of religious fundamentalists   For religious fundamentalists, sacred scripture is considered the authentic, and literal word of their religion's god. Fundamentalist beliefs depend on the twin doctrines that their god articulated his will precisely to prophets, and that followers also have a reliable and perfect record of that revelation .   Since a religion's scripture is considered the word of its god, fundamentalists believe that no person is right to change it or disagree with it. Within that though, there are many differences between different fundamentalists. For example, many Christian fundamentalists believe in free will, that every person is allowed to make their own choices, but with consequence. The appeal of this point of view is its simplicity: every person can do what they like, as much as they are able, but God will bring those who disobey him without repentance (\"turning away from sin\") to justice. This is made clear by the commands of Jesus in the New Testament concerning any kind of revenge(\"Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord\" for one). The Judaist belief is similar, but they do not believe that it is wrong to take vengeance. The fundamentalist insistence on strict observation of religious laws may lead to an accusation of legalism in addition to exclusivism in the interpretation of metaphysical beliefs.     [ edit ] Christian views       Main article: Fundamentalist Christianity       Self-described Christian fundamentalists see the scripture, a combination of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament , as both infallible and historically accurate. The New Testament represents a new covenant between God and human beings, which is held to fulfill the Old Testament, in regard to God's redemptive plan. On the basis of this confidence in Scripture, many fundamentalist Christians accept the account of scripture as being literally true.   It is important to distinguish between the \"literalist\" and Fundamentalist groups within the Christian community. Literalists, as the name indicates, hold that the Bible should be taken literally in every part. English language Bibles are themselves translations and therefore not a literal word-for-word rendering of the original texts; the King James Version is notable, which while poetic, uses arcane language. Literalism can also encompass only believing one translation of the Bible, usually the KJV, is valid for use.   Many Christian Fundamentalists, on the other hand, are for the most part content to hold that the Bible should be taken literally only where there is no indication to the contrary. As William Jennings Bryan put it, in response to Clarence Darrow's questioning during the Scopes Trial (1925):     \"I believe that everything in the Bible should be accepted as it is given there; some of the Bible is given illustratively. For instance: 'Ye are the salt of the earth.' I would not insist that man was actually salt, or that he had flesh of salt, but it is used in the sense of salt as saving Ebba's people.\"     Still, the tendency toward a literal reading of the Bible is criticized by mainline Protestant scholars and others. [3] [4] [5] .   According to Lionel Caplan, a so-called expert on religious fundamentalism,     \"In the Protestant milieu of the USA, fundamentalism crystallized in response to liberals' eagerness to bring Christianity into the post-Darwinian world by questioning the scientific and historical accuracy of the scripture. Subsequently, the scourge of evolution was linked with socialism, and during the Cold War period, with communism. This unholy trinity came to be regarded as a sinister, atheistic threat to Christian America...Bruce [Chpt. 9 of Caplan 1987] suggests that to understand the success of the Moral Majority, an alliance between the conservative forces of the New Right and the fundamentalist wings on the mainly Southern Baptist Churches, we have to appreciate these fears, as well as the impact of a host of unwelcome changes - in attitudes to 'morality', family, civil and women's rights, and so on - which have, in the wake of economic transformations since the Second World War, penetrated especially the previously insular social and cultural world of the American South.\" (Caplan 1987: 6)     The term fundamentalist has historically referred specifically to members of the various Protestant denominations who subscribed to the five \"fundamentals\", rather than fundamentalists forming an independent denomination. This wider movement of Fundamentalist Christianity has since broken up into various movements which are better described in other terms. Early \"fundamentalists\" included J. Gresham Machen and B.B. Warfield , men who would not be considered \"Fundamentalists\" today.   Over time the term came to be associated with a particular segment of evangelical Protestantism , who distinguished themselves by their separatist approach toward modernity , toward aspects of the culture which they feel typify the modern world, and toward other Christians who did not similarly separate themselves. Examples of things that fundamentalists might believe important to avoid are, modern translations of the Bible, alcoholic drinks or recreational drugs, tobacco, modern popular music including Christian contemporary music, folk instruments in worship, dancing, \"mixed bathing\" (men and women swimming together), and gender-neutral or trans-gender clothing and hair-styles. Such things might seem innocuous to the outsider, but to some fundamentalists they represent the leading edge of a threat to the virtuous way of life and the purer form of belief that they seek to protect and to hold forth before the world as an example. Many fundamentalists accept only the King James Version translation of the Bible and study tools based on it, such as the Scofield Reference Bible .   Because of the prevalence of dispensational eschatology , some fundamentalists vehemently support the modern nation of Israel , believing the Jews to have significance in God's purposes parallel to the Christian churches, and a special role to play at the end of the world.   The term, fundamentalist , is difficult to apply unambiguously, especially when applied to groups outside the USA, which are typically far less dogmatic. Many self-described Fundamentalists would include Jerry Falwell in their company, but would not embrace Pat Robertson as a fundamentalist because of his espousal of charismatic teachings. Fundamentalist institutions include Pensacola Christian College , and Bob Jones University , but classically Fundamentalist schools such as Fuller Theological Seminary and Biola University no longer describe themselves as Fundamentalist, although in the broad sense described by this article they are fundamentalist (better, Evangelical ) in their perspective. (The forerunner to Biola U. - the Bible Institute of Los Angeles - was founded under the financial patronage of Lyman Stewart, with his brother Milton, underwrote the publication of a series of 12 books jointly entitled The Fundamentals between 1909 and 1920.)   In its broader sense fundamentalism has been applied to some Catholic as well as Protestant groups within Christianity. Arguably fundamentalist features within some Catholic monastic or religious orders, past or present, have not yet been sufficiently discussed. Members of the Catholic group, Opus Dei, insist that they lack fundamentalist and other traits usually ascribed to cults or sects. They add that if their perspective can be called fundamentalist, then so can many other groups among Catholic and Protestant Christians(In example, the Catholic Church does not believe in the total sinfulness of homosexuality, a belief which would be a far stretch for most Protestant churches). Their critics would readily agree and expand the issue: fundamentalism exists more pervasively, add critics like Roderick Hindery, than has been previously realized. Fundamentalist dysfunctions and functions recently recognized in new religious groups are freshly perceived as increasingly visible among larger traditions. In short, intensive fundamentalist traits shed new light on the presence of fundamentalist features in more comprehensive and traditional contexts. Further discussion might disclose how deeply fundamentalist phenomena may or may not be rooted and spread throughout broader religious traditions.     [ edit ] Jewish views       Main article: Jewish fundamentalism       Most Jewish denominations believe that the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible or Old Testament) cannot be understood literally or alone, but rather needs to be read in conjunction with additional material known as the Oral Torah ; this material is contained in the Mishnah , Talmud , Gemara and Midrash . While the Tanakh is not read in a literal fashion, Orthodox Judaism does view the text itself as divine, infallible, and transmitted essentially without change, and places great import in the specific words and letters of the Torah . As well, adherents of Orthodox Judaism , especially Haredi Judaism , see the Mishnah, Talmud and Midrash as divine and infallible in content, if not in specific wording. Hasidic Jews frequently ascribe infallibility to their Rebbe 's interpretation of the traditional sources of truth. On the other hand the Karaites according to themselves \"are a Jewish sect which does not recognize the authority of the post-Biblical tradition incorporated in the Talmud and in the latter Rabbinic works.\"     [ edit ] Mormon views       Main article: Mormon fundamentalism       Mormon fundamentalism is a conservative movement of Mormonism that believes or practices what its adherents consider to be the fundamental aspects of Mormonism . Most often, Mormon fundamentalism represents a break from the brand of Mormonism practiced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and a return to Mormon doctrines and practices which adherents believe the LDS Church has wrongly abandoned, such as plural marriage , the Law of Consecration , the Adam-God theory , blood atonement , the Patriarchal Priesthood , elements of the Mormon Endowment ritual, and often the exclusion of Blacks from the priesthood . Mormon fundamentalists have formed numerous sects, many of which have established small, cohesive, and isolated communities in areas of the Western United States .     [ edit ] Islamic views       Main article: Islamic fundamentalism       Muslims believe that their religion was revealed by God ( Allah in Arabic) to Muhammad ,the prophet of Islam, the final prophet delivered by God. However, the Muslims brand of conservatism which is generally termed Islamic fundamentalism encompasses all the following:     It describes the beliefs of traditional Muslims that they should restrict themselves to literal interpretations of their sacred texts, the Qur'an and Hadith . This may describe the private religious attitudes of individuals and have no relationship with larger social groups.       It describes a variety of religious movements and political parties in Muslim communities.       As opposed to the above two usages, in the West \"Islamic fundamentalism\" is most often used to describe Muslim individuals and groups which advocate Islamism , a political ideology calling for the replacement of state secular laws with Islamic law . The more radical of these Islamists may advocate violent overthrow of secular states, or even Islamist terrorism .     In all the above cases, Islamic fundamentalism represents a conservative religious belief, as opposed to liberal movements within Islam .     [ edit ] \"Non-Abrahamic\" religions   Some argue that the religious idea of fundamentalism is limited to \" Abrahamic religions \", and have connected the phenomenon specifically to the notion of revealed religion. However, the answer to the question, Who is a fundamentalist? is in the eye of the beholder. It is not uncommon for detractors to apply the fundamentalist label to Wiccans or virtually anything else religious, describing an attitude rather than a self-perception or a doctrine.     [ edit ] Buddhism   H.H. the Dalai Lama has agreed that there exist also extremists and fundamentalists in Buddhism, [1] arguing that fundamentalists are not even able to pick up the idea of a possibly dialogue. [1]   The Japanese Nichiren sect of Buddhism , which believes that other forms of Buddhism are heretical, is also sometimes labelled fundamentalist. However, Nichiren Buddhism contains influences from Shintoism and a strongly nationalistic streak that would disqualify it from being fundamentalist in the strictest sense.   At the height of the Dorje Shugden Controversy Robert Thurman claimed: \"It would not be unfair to call Shugdens the Taliban of Tibetan Buddhism\" referring to the Muslim extremists of Afghanistan, who believe in swift and brutal justice. [2] A statement which was rejected by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso , founder of the NKT , arguing: \"This really is a false accusation against innocent people. We have never done anything wrong. We simply practise our own religion, as passed down through many generations.\" [3]   David N. Kay argued in his doctoral research that the New Kadampa Tradition fits into the criteria of Robert Lifton \u2019s definition of the fundamentalist self . [4] Inken Prohl stated: \"Kay\u2019s argument shows that, due to the NKT\u2019s homogenous organizational structure, its attempts to establish a uniformity of belief and practice within the organization, and an emphasis on following one tradition coupled with a critical attitude toward other traditions, the NKT fits into Lifton\u2019s category of \u201cfundamentalism\u201d. Kay describes how struggles for control of NKT\u2019s institutional sites and NKT\u2019s repressed memory of its institutional conflicts both contribute to NKT\u2019s later 'fundamentalist' identity.\" [5] However Prohl states also: \"Although this observation presents a convincing and challenging observation of a mechanism at work in Buddhist organizations in the West, I would hesitate to characterize, as Kay does, such organizations as 'fundamentalist' due to the vague and, at the same time, extremely political implications of this term.\" [5]     [ edit ] Non-religious fundamentalism   Some refer to any literal-minded or intolerant philosophy with pretense of being the sole source of objective truth, as fundamentalist , regardless of whether it is usually called a religion . For example, when Albania under Enver Hoxha declared itself an \"atheist state\", it was deemed by some to be a kind of \"Fundamentalist Atheism\" or more accurately \" Stalinist Fundamentalism\". There are people who in their attempt to live according to the writings of Ayn Rand seem to detractors to transgress respect for other perspectives in propagating their views, so that they are deemed to be a kind of \" Objectivist Fundamentalist\", and they are spoken of derogatorily as, \" Randroids .\" In France, the imposition of restrictions on public display of religion has been labelled by some as \"Secular Fundamentalism.\" The idea of non-religious Fundamentalism almost always expands the definition of \"Fundamentalism\" along the lines of criticisms.   Occasionally, it seems to represent an idea of purity, and is self-applied as signifying a rather counter-cultural fidelity to some noble, simple, but overlooked principle, as in Economic fundamentalism ; but the same term can be used in a critical way. Roderick Hindery first lists positive qualities attributed to political, economic, or other forms of cultural fundamentalism. They include \"vitality, enthusiasm, willingness to back up words with actions, and the avoidance of facile compromise.\" Then, negative aspects are analyzed, such as psychological attitudes, occasionally elitist and pessimistic perspectives, and in some cases literalism.     [ edit ] Arguments in favour of fundamentalist positions   Fundamentalists claim both that they practice their religion as the first adherents did and that this is how religion should be practiced. In other words, a Christian ought to believe and practice as those who knew and followed Jesus during his time on earth. A Muslim ought to give the same consideration to the followers of Muhammad . Analogous arguments can be made for most systems of religious belief. Fundamentalists justify this belief on the idea that the founders of the world's religions said and did things that were not written down; in other words, their original disciples knew things that we don't. For fundamentalist Christians, this claim is justified by the Gospel of John , which ends with the statement \"there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.\" (John 21:25, NKJV) Further justification is adducted from the static or falling attendance of many liberal or reformed congregations, from the scandals that have struck, for example, the Roman Catholic church , and from the increasing difficulty of distinguishing between religiously liberal and avowedly secularist views on such matters as homosexuality , abortion and women's rights .     [ edit ] Criticism of the fundamentalist position   Many criticisms of the fundamentalist position have been offered. Some of the most common are that the theological claims made by fundamentalist groups cannot be proven, are irrational or are demonstrably false and contrary to scientific evidence. For example, some of these criticisms were famously asserted by Clarence Darrow in the Scopes Monkey Trial . Another criticism is that the rhetoric of these groups offers an appearance of uniformity and simplicity, yet within each faith community, one actually finds different texts of religious law that are accepted; each text has varying interpretations. Consequently, each fundamentalist faith is observed to splinter into many mutually antagonistic groups. They are often as hostile to each other as they are to other religions. In addition, it has been observed that there is no such thing as a Muslim , Jewish , or Christian Fundamentalist. Rather, a fundamentalist's fundamentalism is their primary concern, over and above other denominational or faith considerations.   In order to carry out the fundamentalist program in practice, critics claim that one would first need a perfect understanding of the ancient language of the original text, if indeed the true text can be discerned from among variants. Furthermore, they charge that fundamentalists fail to recognize that fallible human beings are the ones who transmit this tradition. Elliot N. Dorff writes \"Even if one wanted to follow the literal word of God, the need for people first to understand that word necessitates human interpretation. Through that process human fallibility is inextricably mixed into the very meaning of the divine word. As a result, it is impossible to follow the indisputable word of God; one can only achieve a human understanding of God's will.\" ( A Living Tree , Dorff, 1988)   Most fundamentalists do not deal with this argument. Those that do reply to this critique hold their own religious leaders are guided by God, and thus partake of divine infallibility.   Fundamentalism is held by many to cause followers of a faith to become overly attached to their religion's leaders. Followers believe that person to be infallible, or the voice of God, and who can direct them infallibly in the interpretation of the sources of truth. Religions which have such a hold over their followers are often referred to as cults .   A general criticism of fundamentalism is the claim that fundamentalists are selective in what they believe and practice. For instance, the book of Exodus dictates that when a man's brother dies, he must marry his widowed sister-in-law. Yet fundamentalist Christians do not adhere to this doctrine, despite the fact that it is not contradicted in the New Testament. However, defenders of fundamentalism argue that according to New Testament theology, large parts, if not all of the Mosaic Law, are not normative for modern Christians. They may cite passages such Colossians 2:14 which describes Jesus Christ as \"having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us\" (NKJV). Other fundamentalists argue that only certain parts of the Mosaic Law, parts that rely on universal moral principles, are normative for today. Therefore, in their view, there is no contradiction between such passages in the Old Testament and their belief in biblical infallibility. Critics contend that unreasonable literal readings of the Bible and other religious texts by fundamentalists necessarily result in advocating contradictory and even hypocritical positions.   Christian fundamentalists often insist that the Bible is infallible in its various prophetic assertions. However, in the book of Ezekiel , specifically Ezekiel 26:1-14, we find a prophecy (the conquering of the city of Tyre) that, according to Ezekiel 29:18-20, seems to have not been fullfilled in exactly the way the prophet had predicted. This prophecy is the subject of much scholarly debate in regard to interpretation of the prophecy itself and the interpretation of the actual events that took place. At any rate, it is clear that Nebuchadnezzar did in fact conquer the city of Tyre as prophesied, although the spoils of the battle apparently were not as extravagant as Ezekiel predicted they would be, and the city has been rebuilt (modern day Sur, Lebanon) contrary to prophetic claims it would never stand again.   Another discrepancy found in the actual recorded words of the Bible is found in Mark 2:26 when Jesus asks the Pharisees if they remembered how David \u201cwent into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the bread of offering.\u201d According to 1 Samuel 21, however, the high priest was Abiathar\u2019s father, Ahimelech. This stark contrast between these two books of the Bible illustrates that in no way is the Bible absolutely inerrant.   Fundamentalist teachings are criticised by questioning the historical accuracy of the religious texts in question when compared to other historical sources; as well as questioning how documents that some believe to contain many contradictions could be considered infallible.     [ edit ] Fundamentalism and politics   \"Fundamentalism\" is a morally charged, emotive term, often used as a term of opprobrium, particularly in combination with other epithets (as in the phrase \" Muslim fundamentalists \" and \"right-wing fundamentalists\").   Very often religious fundamentalists, in all religions, are politically aware. They feel that legal and government processes must recognise the way of life they see as prescribed by their god and set forth in their scripture. In their eyes, the state must be subservient to their god: this, however is a basic belief of most religions, even if their practitioners do not insist upon it.   Most \"Christian\" countries go through a similar stage in their development. The governments of many Muslim countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia , are Islamic, and include people with fundamentalist beliefs. More secular politicians are often to be found working in opposition movements in these countries.     [ edit ] References     Appleby, R. Scott, Gabriel Abraham Almond, and Emmanuel Sivan (2003).
