These tests do not require knowledge of technical terms or specialized vocabulary.         12-Point Exam     The NYU School of Professional Studies Foreign Language Proficiency Exam tests three skills\u2014listening, reading, and writing\u2014 that are necessary for everyday communicative tasks. Students are required to answer questions after listening to a passage to demonstrate comprehension, to translate into English and into the test language, and to write a short essay in response to a selection of general topics. The format of some language tests may be somewhat different, requiring short answers, multiple-choice selections, or other responses. Students are given two hours to complete the entire 12-point exam.         16-Point Exam   The 16-point exam is comprised of the 12-point exam, as well as a 350-word essay on a more complex subject. In the essay, students are required to write about abstract ideas, support an argument, hypothesize, and write in longer paragraphs. Students are given three hours to complete the entire 16-point exam. Please note that a perfect 12-point score on the first part of the exam is required in order for the 4-point essay portion to be graded.         4-Point Exam   For students who elected to take the 12-point exam and later wish to be tested on the extended 350-word essay portion of the 16-point exam, we offer an additional 4-point exam. This exam is offered only to students who received a perfect score on the 12-point exam. Students are given one hour (60 minutes) to complete the 4-point exam.           Scheduling an Exam            * It is important to note that the actual amount of credit granted is at the discretion of the institution receiving the results. Students are strongly urged to discuss accreditation with the institution\u2019s advisor prior to taking the exam. Exam results are valid for five years from the test date. Official letters will not be mailed to institutions for tests that are more than five years old.            Exam Results        An official letter stipulating the results of the examination will be mailed to the designated institution up to eight weeks after the test is taken. The student will receive an unofficial copy of the letter.   Allow two extra weeks during winter break.
