The &quot;state&quot; of the matter refers to the group of matter   with the same properties. In other words, you group the objects together according   to their properties.     Solids  The wood block   is solid. A solid has a certain size and shape. The wood   block does not change size or shape. Other examples of solids are the computer,   the desk, and the floor. You can change the shape   of solids. You change the shape of sheets of lumber by sawing it in half or burning   it. From wood    to  How   might you change the shape of a piece of gum?      Liquids  Milk is a liquid.   Milk is liquid matter. It has a size or volume. Volume means it takes up space.   But milk doesn't have a definite shape. It takes the shape of its container.    Liquids can flow, be poured, and spilled. Did you ever spill   juice? Did you notice how the liquid goes everywhere and you have to hurry and   wipe it up? The liquid is taking the shape of the floor and the floor is expansive   limitless boundary (until it hits the wall). You can't spill a wooden block. You   can drop it and it still has the same shape.  What   about jello and peanut butter?  You can spread peanut   butter on bread, but peanut butter does not flow. It is not a liquid at room temperature.   You have to heat peanut butter up to make it a liquid. When you or your mom makes   jello, it is first a liquid. You have to put it in the refrigerator so that it   becomes a solid. These are yummy forms of matter with properties of a liquid and   a solid.     Gases  Run in place very   fast for a minute. Do you notice how hard you are breathing? What you are breathing   is oxygen? You need oxygen to live. That's why you can only hold your breath for   a certain amount of time.  You can't see oxygen. It's   invisible. It is a gas. A gas is matter that has no shape or size of its own.   Gases have no color.  Gases are all around you. You   can feel gas when the wind blows. The wind is moving air. Air is many gases mixed   together.  to Matter Review    Pages and gif animations written and designed by   Sheila M. Estacio.
