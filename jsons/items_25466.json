Clive Gabay | Queen Mary, University of London                               I am a political scientist working in the areas of African history and politics, state-society relations and international development. I use these frameworks to explore a number of related issues pertinent to the study of international relations and politics:   Forms of knowledge production and maintenance in the area of International Development;   The relationship between modes of global governance and civil society in sub-Saharan Africa;   Post-colonial state formation in sub-Saharan Africa   African political thought, and the historical antecedents of contemporary discourses on Africa.   In terms of the first two of these interests, I have interrogated the power relations which construct a significant alter-globalisationist actor, the Global Call to Action against Poverty (www.whiteband.org), in order to understand its impact, actual and potential, on discourses and actors in IR. This research appeared in a book published in 2012. I am also co-editing a book with Dr Carl Death at the University of Manchester due out in 2014 on neoliberal governmentality and civil society in Africa. My other research interests are reflected in papers I have published and ongoing research projects, including a study of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and their socio-cutural-spatial implications; a project exploring the discursive relationship between the MDGs and civil society organisations in East Africa (funded by the British Academy); and a historical (genealogical) study of Afro-optimism.

In terms of the first two of these interests, I have interrogated the power relations which construct a significant alter-globalisationist actor, the Global Call to Action against Poverty (www.whiteband.org), in order to understand its impact, actual and potential, on discourses and actors in IR. This research appeared in a book published in 2012.

In my lab at University College London ( www.eyethink.org ), we use gaze, speech and motion tracking technology to investigate how perception and cognition are embedded in the social world. We present pictures, speech and movies to participants. They watch the displays, recall information, form opinions, talk to each other and play games. We explore how the identity, beliefs and simply the presence of other people can influence individuals\u2019 cognitive and perceptual processing.

The semester will be punctuated by (1) major cultural/political developments and controversies: the founding of the Abbey Theatre; the decline of the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy; the 1916 Rising; the Troubles in the North (2) dominant literary figures: Yeats, Joyce, Beckett, and (3) ubiquitous themes: the idea of blood sacrifice as a liberation narrative; the fraught place of the Irish language; the persistent mythic, cultural, and literary trope of woman-as-nation?an image bound up with Ireland\u2019s colonial history. In additions to plays, novels, poems, short stories, and essays, we will read manifestos, pamphlets, reviews, debates in newspapers, and contemporary critical interventions, and we will think about texts in the context of the nation's turbulent history of colonial trauma, the complex path to independence, and the challenges of globalization. Course readings will also include essays that investigate such issues as nationalism, gender, myth, sexuality, religion, and postcolonialism.           Engl.GA.1085    Greg Londe (cross-listed with Irish Studies)    Beckett and His Contexts    Monday 6:10 - 8:40 PM      In this seminar we will read most of Beckett\u2019s body of work \u2013 his novels, plays, poems, and essays \u2013 and explore wide-ranging points of contact and comparison that emerge across his long career: disaffected son of Dublin, expatriate amanuensis to Joyce, translator of the black diaspora in Nancy Cunard\u2019s Negro Anthology , inheritor and apotheosis of Franco-Irish interchanges, key theorist of the mid-century\u2019s tragicomic negativity, cartographer of devastated landscapes from post-Famine Ireland to post-War France to post-Katrina New Orleans. Our study of Beckett\u2019s writing will be supplemented with reference to the contexts he chose and those that have been imposed upon him, from the abstractions of W.B. Yeats\u2019s late plays and Jack B. Yeats\u2019s late paintings, to the deadpan of Buster Keaton\u2019s films, to existentialism, the \u201ctheater of the absurd,\u201d and minimalism. We will read critical and theoretical responses to Beckett\u2019s work, from Theodor Adorno to Pascale Casanova, and consider his vast legacy in texts by Harold Pinter, John Banville, Susan Sontag, Enrique Vila-Matas, Susan Howe, Marina Carr and others.           Engl.GA.1972    Howard Besser (cross-listed with Cinema Studies)    Topics in Digital Humanities: Free Culture and Open Access    Thursday 6:00 - 10:00 PM      At the root of \"Free Culture\" and \"Open Access\" lies the idea that aesthetic and informational works become public resources that should be shared. This interdisciplinary class examines both ideas from a variety of perspectives: aesthetics, politics, law, and social movements. It pays particular attention to the relationship between these ideas and the rise of new forms of media that allow age-old concepts like \"The Commons\" to flourish. It also situates these ideas within longstanding practices of both scholarship and librarianship. The course places a focus on contemporary and very recent activities, and will also examine closely related ideas and movements such as \"Information Wants to be Free\", Free Software, CopyLeft, and Access to Knowledge.           Engl.GA.2062    Mark Sanders (cross-listed with Comparative Literature)    Studies in Prose Genres: J.M. Coetzee &amp; Metafiction    Wednesday 11:00 AM - 1:45 PM      When J.M. Coetzee received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003, he stunned the Swedish Academy in Stockholm by presenting not the customary lecture, but a story. In this tale, entitled \u201cHe and His Man,\u201d Robinson Crusoe sends reports to his \u201cman,\u201d whom Coetzee\u2019s audience recognizes as being Daniel Defoe, since the reports appear to come from books authored by Defoe. The relationship of character and author is turned inside out, in an exciting metafictional performance that also places in question the conventional boundaries of the lecture. The Swedish audience should not have been stunned, however, for some of J.M. Coetzee\u2019s most recent novels, Summertime, Slow Man , and Elizabeth Costello have, in different ways, foregrounded the mechanics of fiction-making typically concealed by the realist novel. Concentrating on these works, as well as Coetzee\u2019s early novels, in which metafiction is the dominant mode for interrogating colonial literary genres, and drawing comparisons with the fiction of Italo Calvino, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Zoe Wicomb, while at the same time availing ourselves of relevant narrative theory (Mieke Bal, Roland Barthes) and critical commentary (Attwell, Attridge, Spivak, Wicomb), the seminar will explore the aesthetic, ethical and political implications of a writer putting the inner workings of his or her craft on open display. The seminar will culminate with a roundtable on Coetzee\u2019s enigmatic new novel, The Childhood of Jesus .           Engl.GA.2270    Hal Momma    Topics in Medieval Lit: Medieval Visions and Travels in the Other World    Monday 3:30 - 5:30 PM      This course takes a new approach to early medieval English literature by reading two types of texts that are usually designated as two separate genres: visions and travel narratives. Upon closer look, however, we recognize similarities between them. In both genres, the subject of experience (i.e. the traveler, the dreamer, etc.) leaves home, visits a strange place, observes extraordinary phenomena, and comes home to bear witness. The close relationship between the two was apparently understood by classical and medieval authors, for visions and travels often appear side by side in their wok (Cicero, Vergil, and Dante come to mind); and in case of some genres, the coupling of the two has even become a convention (e.g. epic/heroic poetry and, to a certain degree, hagiography).      The course will mainly focus on Old English texts, both verse and prose, but we will also compare them with literature of vision and/or travel from antiquity (e.g. Aeneid, Dream of Scipio with Macrobius); medieval Ireland, Scandinavia, and the Continent (e.g. imram, zombie sagas, The Divine Comedy); and post-Conquest Britain (Pearl, Sir John Mandeville). The ultimate goal of the course is for us to build, collectively, a new perspective on early medieval literature, while, individually, developing conference-worthy topics and publishable essays.           Engl.GA.2414    Ernest Gilman    Age of Donne: The New Philosophy calls all in doubt    Thursday 1:00 - 3:00 PM      The subtitle of this course comes from Donne\u2019s \u201cAnatomy\u201d\u2014his vivisection of the body of the world to discover the cause of its imminent demise. For Donne, the unsettling speculations of the \u201cNew Philosophy,\u201d in this instance Kepler\u2019s heliocentric theory and Galileo\u2019s observations through the telescope, are key symptoms of the world\u2019s moribund condition. The search for \u201cconstancy\u201d that marks the Songs and Sonnets is frustrated by the revelation of a \u201cnew\u201d world characterized by vagrant movement. The proper philosophical stance called for in these circumstances is \u201cdoubt,\u201d a neo-skepticism which, like the word \u201cnew\u201d in the period has both positive and negative connotations. With Donne\u2019s poetry at the center of the circle, this course radiates out to other themes and writers in the orbit of (what we would call) the scientific revolution, including Luther, Vesalius, Montaigne, Gilbert, Galileo, Hobbes, Descartes, and Milton.           Engl.GA.2620    Laurence Lockridge    Romantic Movement    Thursday 3:30 - 5:30 PM      William Blake, William Wordsworth, Dorothy Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley, and John Keats are the canonical British Romantic writers considered in this seminar. Participants are free to pursue less familiar writers of the period if they so choose. Though a syllabus and set of discussion topics are shared by all, topics for term essays may reflect the particular critical and scholarly interests of participants working off syllabus.      Among standard topics to be discussed: Blake\u2019s revolutionary satire and mythology; the literary relationship of Coleridge, Dorothy Wordsworth, and William Wordsworth; Romantic autobiography; Coleridge as philosophic critic; William Wordsworth and the uses of memory; Lord Byron as performance artist; Percy Shelley and the Romantic theory of mind; Mary Shelley\u2019s questioning of Romantic ideology; Keats and cultural poetics; formal innovations in Romantic narrative, lyric, and drama; Romantic politics; representations of gender, race, and class; and issues concerning the Romantic canon. Such topics tend to be perennial; the seminar will seek out the state of current critical play concerning them.      Prominent schools of modern theory and criticism\u2014from archetypal, formalist, psychoanalytic, and ethical to feminist, historicist, and deconstructive\u2014have found in British Romantic writers a literature of great import. We debate a variety of such approaches.           Engl.GA.2720    Perry Meisel    Woolf, Mansfield, Cather    Monday 6:20 - 8:20 PM     An examination of Virginia Woolf and Willa Cather as transatlantic modernists based on their common influence by Katherine Mansfield. Mansfield's dialectical source is the transatlantic Henry James, whose social impressionism she sharpens by gendering and eroticizing. Woolf's dialectic with Mansfield is resolved by her use of Pater's sensory impressionism to unsex Mansfield while retaining her Jamesian psychologism and vivid sense of domestic life. Cather's dialectic with Mansfield is resolved by her use of Hardy's focus on the working farm to materialize Mansfield's psychologism and give it a more overt basis in the means of production that James's suppression of labor abjures. Biographical and historical contexts will be supplied to ground this literary assessment in the cold light of fact. Doing so redoubles Woolf and Cather's own relationship to Mansfield by inscribing it within a material and historical frame. Readings will begin with James, Pater, and Hardy before proceeding to the course's primary focus on Mansfield, Woolf, and Cather. Texts will include Mansfield's stories; Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, Orlando , and Between the Acts ; and Cather's O Pioneers!, The Song of the Lark, A Lost Lady, The Professor\u2019s House , and Lucy Gayheart .          Engl.GA.2805    Pat Crain and Catherine Robson    Transatlantic Childhoods    Wednesday 3:30 - 5:30      This seminar explores what we can see better, or see anew, when we juxtapose American and British experiences of, and responses to, emergent ideas and ideals of childhood in the child-obsessed nineteenth-century. After setting up key eighteenth-century concepts and contexts for what French historian Philippe Ari\u00e8s called the \"invention of childhood,\" we'll explore the ways in which children came to be defined between 1800 and 1900, in relation to such rubrics as law, labor, education, sex, play, and psychology, through examinations of both \"literary\" works and texts and artifacts from a range of other discourses and spheres. We'll pivot between American and British examples, aiming to track the commonalities at work in our two nations and the effects of marked structural differences. Here we'll be especially attentive to chattel slavery in the U.S., and to the relations, and non-relations, between the racialized notions of childhood produced in this country and those which arise out of Britain's sharply stratified class landscape. If race and class are produced differently, we'll also consider the degree to which British and American histories and representations of boyhood and girlhood converge and diverge across the period. We\u2019ll close with reflections on the ways in which a range of literary genres on the cusp of modernism form themselves in and through the new discourses of childhood and evolving figures of the child.      We will make use of special collections at Fales, New York Public Library, and other local archives.           Engl.GA.2900    Rajeswari Sunder Rajan    Postcolonial Thought: Politics, Ethics, Philosophy    Tuesday 6:20 - 8:20 PM      This seminar outlines a global intellectual history that looks at the diverse ways in which thinkers in Africa and Asia responded to colonialism in the last two centuries, to both colonial rule itself and the contact of cultures produced by colonial rule or European domination in other forms. The resulting discourse, which is here broadly identified under the heads of \u2018politics, ethics, and philosophy\u2019, is in fact an eclectic one, not containable within formal disciplinary boundaries. These writings are not what constitute \u2018postcolonial theory\u2019 as it is known and canonized in metropolitan academic studies. They have tended indeed to be overlooked as \u2018theory\u2019, but are now coming to the attention of historians of intellectual thought.      As we might expect, it was in the colonies rather than in the metropolis that the meeting of cultures resulted in the most productive intellectual consequences. The new knowledge from the west\u2014in the form of disciplines, ideas, epistemologies, and values-- was eagerly absorbed, processed, debated, contested and creatively re-thought by those who encountered it. Forged in the crucible of anti-colonial struggle are the ethics of non-violence, pacifism and sacrifice; ideas of universalism, egalitarianism and brotherhood; the reactive politics of nationalism; revisionary and adaptive Marxisms; major initiatives in political and social reform; and the politicization of religion.      How influential has \u2018postcolonial thought\u2019 been within decolonized nations and globally? How radical is it in its originality, its difference from European thought? Some of the figures whose life and work will be considered are (in no particular order): M.K. Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, B. R. Ambedkar, Tarabai Shinde (India); Muhammad Iqbal (India, Pakistan); Anagarika Dharmapala, Ananda Coomaraswamy (Ceylon/Sri Lanka); Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (Afghanistan?); Ali Shariati (Iran); Liang Qichao (China); Tenshin Okakura (Japan); Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u (Vietnam); Kartini (Indonesia); Jomo Kenyatta (Kenya); Kwame Nkrumah (Ghana); Samir Amin (Egypt); Abdullahi An-Na\u2019im (Sudan); Edouard Glissant (Martinique ). Writings by three or four of these will be studied in detail, the rest in broad survey mode.           Engl.GA.2902    Sonya Posmentier    Topics in Black Lit: Literary and Cultural Criticism from the Black Diaspora    Thursday 1:00 - 3:00 PM      In her 1988 lecture on the American literary canon, \u201cUnspeakable Things Unspoken\u201d Toni Morrison responded to the emergence of the \u201cAfro-American artistic presence\u201d in white literary discourse: \u201cit is no longer acceptable merely to imagine us and imagine for us. We have always been imagining ourselves\u2026. \u201c Morrison called for future theories of black literature equal to the history and present of black literature, and simultaneously called attention to the past and present of black theory. In this class we will pay attention to her call. How do black writers, artists and critics theorize their work in relationship to mainstream literary and cultural criticism, while at the same time claiming autochthonous critical traditions? And how have concepts such as double-consciousness, mimicry, calibanization, nation language and black optimism informed our readings of modern literature?      To answer these questions we\u2019ll delve into theories of performance, gender, sexuality, reading, nation and race emerging from and around black literature and culture. We will also consider how modern and contemporary theories of black art extend beyond the framework of the nation state that contained Morrison\u2019s groundbreaking critique. Readings may include works by: Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Sterling Brown, James Baldwin, George Lamming, Amiri Baraka, Audre Lorde, Ralph Ellison, CLR James, Ng\u0169g\u0129 Wa Thiong\u2019o, Houston Baker, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Alice Walker, Kamau Brathwaite, \u00c9douard Glissant, Barbara Johnson, Valerie Smith, Fred Moten, and others. In their writing and their reading, students will also have the opportunity to analyze and practice multiple forms of critical work, from the critical essay to the interview.           Engl.GA.2916    Patrick Deer    The Contemporary Novel and the Culture of War    Wednesday 1:00 - 3:00 PM      This seminar will explore contemporary American, British and Anglophone fiction and non-fiction representations of war. Reading in a transatlantic frame, we will focus on the work of writers and intellectuals who have struggled to create in the shadow of violence and to resist its seductive logic. In order to give students a sense of the range and diversity of contemporary war writing, the course will counterpoint selected texts from modern war literature and culture with the recent wave of literary and non-fiction representations from Iraq, Afghanistan and the \u201cglobal war on terror.\u201d We will trace genealogies for recent war literature and culture in the era of colonial warfare and the dislocations of World War I, through the total war culture of World War Two, the apocalyptic imaginary of Cold War, guerilla warfare and counterinsurgency, to the high tech claims of \u201cpostmodern warfare.\u201d We will also consider the wider implications of censorship, propaganda, trauma, the war economy, and the technologies of violence for postmodern and contemporary narrative and popular memory. Focusing on themes of gender, trauma, imperialism, and resistance, the course will explore the intimate relations between contemporary literature, reportage, film and media, and military discourse.       Readings may be drawn from the work of: Virginia Woolf, Ernest Hemingway, Ernst Junger, Primo Levi, George Orwell, Graham Greene, Thomas Pynchon, Tim O\u2019Brien, Pat Barker, Martin Amis, Michael Ondaatje, Anthony Swofford, Gabe Hudson, Colby Buzzell, Kayla Williams, Dexter Filkins, Riverbend, Kevin Powers, and Ben Fountain. Films will include: The Battle of the Somme, All Quiet on the Western Front, Listen to Britain, Dr. Strangelove, The Battle of Algiers, Apocalypse Now, The Thin Red Line, Saving Private Ryan, The Fog of War, Bloody Sunday, Three Kings, Occupation Dreamland, Fallujah: A Lost Generation?, The Hurt Locker , and Restrepo . Theoretical texts may include: Freud, Adorno, Derrida, Foucault, Agamben, De Certeau, Theweleit, Williams, Said, Melman, Enloe, Virilio, Baudrillard, Scarry, Butler, Zi\u017eek, and Deleuze and Guattari.             Engl.GA.2917    Tom\u00e1s Noel    U.S. Latino/a Modernisms    Wednesday 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM      While critical conversations on U.S. Latino/a literatures and cultures have tended to foreground the social movements of the postwar era, Latino/a writers and artists were active in the Modernist    period, producing works of formal complexity that were also attuned to culturally specific locations and dislocations. In this course, we will approach both Latino/a and Modernism as open-ended terms, in an effort to bring together a broad range of texts (potentially including poems, novels, essays, drama, memoir, folklore, journalism, film, mural art, music, and dance) from around 1890 to 1950. We will consider national differences and contexts, emphasizing key terms (border, diaspora, exile) and stressing hemispheric, transnational, and cross-cultural contexts. We will pay special attention to spatial politics, and to the intersections between modernist form and a variety of vernacular practices and expressive cultures. Acknowledging the \u201cdouble attachments\u201d (Anglo, Hispanic) that frame Ilan Stavans's introduction to The Norton Anthology of Latino Literature (2011), we will also seek to complicate Stavans's formulation by examining a constellation of identifications (blackness, indigeneity, gender, and others).      Literary texts may include works by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, William Carlos Williams, Salom\u00f3n de la Selva, Jaime de Angulo, Leonor Villegas de Magn\u00f3n, Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a, Am\u00e9rico Paredes, Jovita Gonz\u00e1lez, Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, Julia de Burgos, Pura Belpr\u00e9, Alberto O'Farrill, Eugenio Florit, and Josefina Niggli. Performances may include works by Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n, Eusebia Cosme, Machito and his Afro-Cubans, Canario y Su Grupo, Lupe V\u00e9lez, and Maria Montez. Critical readings may include works by Laura Lomas, Kristen Silva Gruesz, Marissa K. L\u00f3pez, Antonio L\u00f3pez, Lisa S\u00e1nchez Gonz\u00e1lez, Fredric Jameson, Henri Lefebvre, Miriam Hansen, Alicia Schmidt Camacho, Ruth Glasser, Rosa-Linda Fregoso, Marta Moreno Vega, and Silvio Torres-Saillant.      Major assignments will likely consist of a research paper and a short archival project.

How can a history of paper supplement and enrich recent histories of printing technology and printed artifacts like \"the book\"? What would it mean to imagine a paperless future? Organized around discussions of readings in common, this course considers the history, production, circulation and use of paper in the social production of knowledge, the shared imagination of value, and the mutual relations of consumers and commodities.           Engl.GA.2971    David Hoover (cross-listed with the Draper Program)    Topics in Digital Humanities: Digital Literary Studies    Thursday 6:20 - 8:20 PM      The availability of digital resources has significantly changed literary studies, especially because of the rapid increase the accessability of literary and critical texts that were previously very difficult to locate or access, or were extremely rare. Because of their digital form, such texts can be searched and can be transferred almost instantaneously from place to place. Yet locating, accessing, searching, and easily distributing digital texts are not the only ways of taking advantage of their digital nature.      This course will investigate some of the ways that manipulation and analysis can more fully exploit the nature of digital texts. We will consider some methods of distant reading, such as those recently practiced by Franco Moretti in Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for a Literary History (London: Verso, 2005)\u2013methods possible only since the advent of huge collections of publicly available digital texts. We will also consider some methods of very close reading that digital texts and tools make possible for the first time, including those introduced by Hugh Craig and Arthur Kinney in Shakespeare, Computers, and the Mystery of Authorship (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009). Along the way, we will work with individual digital literary texts, specially constructed iterary corpora, online portals, databases, natural language corpora, text collections, and single-author sites, and with digital archives, including some, like the Willa Cather Digital Archive, the Brown Women Writers Project, and the MONK project, that include their own analytical tools.      Our goal will be to apply innovative techniques to long-standing literary questions and to explore kinds of inquiries that digital texts and tools have made possible for the first time. We will focus on a fairly wide range of literature in English from about 1800 to about 1925, to avoid copyright problems, but students can study texts from any period and in many different languages in their own projects. The course assumes no advanced computational background, but it will take place in a computer lab (PC computers; some of the software does not run on Macs), and will involve extensive hands-on computational analysis.           Engl.GA.3323    Susanne Wofford (cross-listed with Comparative Literature)    Spenser\u2019s Faerie Queene and the Epic    Monday 11:00 AM - 1:30 PM      This course will focus on The Faerie Queene in its wider literary context, including selections from classical epic (Vergil, Ovid), Ariosto, Tasso, and Cervantes. Readings in theory of allegory and ideology will complement a focus on epic. We will explore the relation of pastoral and epic, placing pastoral moments in The Faerie Queene against selections from The Shepheardes Calendar and from Vergil and Theocritus. Some attention will be paid to the visual tradition of representing epic and allegory, including mythological paintings, emblem books, iconography and Renaissance mythography (Cartari, Conti and others). We will rethink the convergences and divergences of epic, allegory and romance as they help to shape questions of gender, nation, ideology and ethics.           Engl.GA.3920    Toral Gajarawala (cross-listed with Comparative Literature and American Studies)    The Contemporary Novel and the Space of the Political    Tuesday 2:00 - 4:00 PM      This course considers the problem of the political posed by the novel in an era of postmodernism and the \u201cglobal novel\u201d. How does the contemporary novel construct narrative worlds? And how does it now circulate in the world outside it? This course will rethink recent fiction from the last decade in light of two theoretical problems: \u201cworldliness\u201d and \"the contemporary\". We will begin by reading broadly from recent theories of postmodernism, postcolonial studies, world literature and novel theory in order to assess the field of contemporary fiction. We will thus encounter a range of critical concepts and categories that have structured recent debates: \u201cworlding\u201d, \u201cworld literature\u201d, \u201cthe human rights novel\u201d, \u201cplanetarity\u201d, \u201cdystopia\u201d, \u201chysterical realism\u201d and so forth. We will then move on to consider recent fiction: How does it understand the concept of the political? For what kind of ethical act does it create the narrative conditions? We will read Anglophone fiction and will also pay particular attention to the question of the post 9/11 novel: Aravind Adiga\u2019s The White Tiger , Zadie Smith\u2019s White Teeth , Don DeLillo\u2019s Falling Man , Teju Cole\u2019s Open City , Tom McCarthy\u2019s Remainder , Michael Ondaatje\u2019s Anils Ghost , Chris Abani's Graceland .

Jan de Fockert\u00a0| Psychology, Goldsmith's College, University of London                               I am a cognitive psychologist, and my main research interest is human visual selective attention. I use a range of selective attention paradigms to investigate to what extent the attention system of the human brain is capable of selective processing of to-be-attended information. I am specifically interested in the control of selective attention by frontal areas of the human brain, which I investigate using behavioural measures, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electro-encephalography (EEG). After studying at the University of Amsterdam and King\u2019s College London, I received my PhD from the University of Essex, and was then a postdoctoral research fellow at University College London. Since 2002, I am a faculty member of the Psychology Department at Goldsmiths, University of London.

Clive Gabay | Queen Mary, University of London                               I am a political scientist working in the areas of African history and politics, state-society relations and international development. I use these frameworks to explore a number of related issues pertinent to the study of international relations and politics:   Forms of knowledge production and maintenance in the area of International Development;   The relationship between modes of global governance and civil society in sub-Saharan Africa;   Post-colonial state formation in sub-Saharan Africa   African political thought, and the historical antecedents of contemporary discourses on Africa.   In terms of the first two of these interests, I have interrogated the power relations which construct a significant alter-globalisationist actor, the Global Call to Action against Poverty (www.whiteband.org), in order to understand its impact, actual and potential, on discourses and actors in IR. This research appeared in a book published in 2012. I am also co-editing a book with Dr Carl Death at the University of Manchester due out in 2014 on neoliberal governmentality and civil society in Africa. My other research interests are reflected in papers I have published and ongoing research projects, including a study of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and their socio-cutural-spatial implications; a project exploring the discursive relationship between the MDGs and civil society organisations in East Africa (funded by the British Academy); and a historical (genealogical) study of Afro-optimism.

Her research is focused on defining differences in the signalling pathways which operate in normal and cancer cells, in order to exploit differences in their genetic makeup which can be targeted to selectively activate programmed cell death in cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed. A novel cytokine, \u03b2GBP, has been identified and cloned and has been found to selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Valeries Wells is currently investigating the molecular signalling pathways activated by \u03b2GBP leading to programmed cell death.

The semester will be punctuated by (1) major cultural/political developments and controversies: the founding of the Abbey Theatre; the decline of the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy; the 1916 Rising; the Troubles in the North (2) dominant literary figures: Yeats, Joyce, Beckett, and (3) ubiquitous themes: the idea of blood sacrifice as a liberation narrative; the fraught place of the Irish language; the persistent mythic, cultural, and literary trope of woman-as-nation?an image bound up with Ireland\u2019s colonial history. In additions to plays, novels, poems, short stories, and essays, we will read manifestos, pamphlets, reviews, debates in newspapers, and contemporary critical interventions, and we will think about texts in the context of the nation's turbulent history of colonial trauma, the complex path to independence, and the challenges of globalization. Course readings will also include essays that investigate such issues as nationalism, gender, myth, sexuality, religion, and postcolonialism.           Engl.GA.1085    Greg Londe (cross-listed with Irish Studies)    Beckett and His Contexts    Monday 6:10 - 8:40 PM      In this seminar we will read most of Beckett\u2019s body of work \u2013 his novels, plays, poems, and essays \u2013 and explore wide-ranging points of contact and comparison that emerge across his long career: disaffected son of Dublin, expatriate amanuensis to Joyce, translator of the black diaspora in Nancy Cunard\u2019s Negro Anthology , inheritor and apotheosis of Franco-Irish interchanges, key theorist of the mid-century\u2019s tragicomic negativity, cartographer of devastated landscapes from post-Famine Ireland to post-War France to post-Katrina New Orleans. Our study of Beckett\u2019s writing will be supplemented with reference to the contexts he chose and those that have been imposed upon him, from the abstractions of W.B. Yeats\u2019s late plays and Jack B. Yeats\u2019s late paintings, to the deadpan of Buster Keaton\u2019s films, to existentialism, the \u201ctheater of the absurd,\u201d and minimalism. We will read critical and theoretical responses to Beckett\u2019s work, from Theodor Adorno to Pascale Casanova, and consider his vast legacy in texts by Harold Pinter, John Banville, Susan Sontag, Enrique Vila-Matas, Susan Howe, Marina Carr and others.           Engl.GA.1972    Howard Besser (cross-listed with Cinema Studies)    Topics in Digital Humanities: Free Culture and Open Access    Thursday 6:00 - 10:00 PM      At the root of \"Free Culture\" and \"Open Access\" lies the idea that aesthetic and informational works become public resources that should be shared. This interdisciplinary class examines both ideas from a variety of perspectives: aesthetics, politics, law, and social movements. It pays particular attention to the relationship between these ideas and the rise of new forms of media that allow age-old concepts like \"The Commons\" to flourish. It also situates these ideas within longstanding practices of both scholarship and librarianship. The course places a focus on contemporary and very recent activities, and will also examine closely related ideas and movements such as \"Information Wants to be Free\", Free Software, CopyLeft, and Access to Knowledge.           Engl.GA.2062    Mark Sanders (cross-listed with Comparative Literature)    Studies in Prose Genres: J.M. Coetzee &amp; Metafiction    Wednesday 11:00 AM - 1:45 PM      When J.M. Coetzee received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003, he stunned the Swedish Academy in Stockholm by presenting not the customary lecture, but a story. In this tale, entitled \u201cHe and His Man,\u201d Robinson Crusoe sends reports to his \u201cman,\u201d whom Coetzee\u2019s audience recognizes as being Daniel Defoe, since the reports appear to come from books authored by Defoe. The relationship of character and author is turned inside out, in an exciting metafictional performance that also places in question the conventional boundaries of the lecture. The Swedish audience should not have been stunned, however, for some of J.M. Coetzee\u2019s most recent novels, Summertime, Slow Man , and Elizabeth Costello have, in different ways, foregrounded the mechanics of fiction-making typically concealed by the realist novel. Concentrating on these works, as well as Coetzee\u2019s early novels, in which metafiction is the dominant mode for interrogating colonial literary genres, and drawing comparisons with the fiction of Italo Calvino, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Zoe Wicomb, while at the same time availing ourselves of relevant narrative theory (Mieke Bal, Roland Barthes) and critical commentary (Attwell, Attridge, Spivak, Wicomb), the seminar will explore the aesthetic, ethical and political implications of a writer putting the inner workings of his or her craft on open display. The seminar will culminate with a roundtable on Coetzee\u2019s enigmatic new novel, The Childhood of Jesus .           Engl.GA.2270    Hal Momma    Topics in Medieval Lit: Medieval Visions and Travels in the Other World    Monday 3:30 - 5:30 PM      This course takes a new approach to early medieval English literature by reading two types of texts that are usually designated as two separate genres: visions and travel narratives. Upon closer look, however, we recognize similarities between them. In both genres, the subject of experience (i.e. the traveler, the dreamer, etc.) leaves home, visits a strange place, observes extraordinary phenomena, and comes home to bear witness. The close relationship between the two was apparently understood by classical and medieval authors, for visions and travels often appear side by side in their wok (Cicero, Vergil, and Dante come to mind); and in case of some genres, the coupling of the two has even become a convention (e.g. epic/heroic poetry and, to a certain degree, hagiography).      The course will mainly focus on Old English texts, both verse and prose, but we will also compare them with literature of vision and/or travel from antiquity (e.g. Aeneid, Dream of Scipio with Macrobius); medieval Ireland, Scandinavia, and the Continent (e.g. imram, zombie sagas, The Divine Comedy); and post-Conquest Britain (Pearl, Sir John Mandeville). The ultimate goal of the course is for us to build, collectively, a new perspective on early medieval literature, while, individually, developing conference-worthy topics and publishable essays.           Engl.GA.2414    Ernest Gilman    Age of Donne: The New Philosophy calls all in doubt    Thursday 1:00 - 3:00 PM      The subtitle of this course comes from Donne\u2019s \u201cAnatomy\u201d\u2014his vivisection of the body of the world to discover the cause of its imminent demise. For Donne, the unsettling speculations of the \u201cNew Philosophy,\u201d in this instance Kepler\u2019s heliocentric theory and Galileo\u2019s observations through the telescope, are key symptoms of the world\u2019s moribund condition. The search for \u201cconstancy\u201d that marks the Songs and Sonnets is frustrated by the revelation of a \u201cnew\u201d world characterized by vagrant movement. The proper philosophical stance called for in these circumstances is \u201cdoubt,\u201d a neo-skepticism which, like the word \u201cnew\u201d in the period has both positive and negative connotations. With Donne\u2019s poetry at the center of the circle, this course radiates out to other themes and writers in the orbit of (what we would call) the scientific revolution, including Luther, Vesalius, Montaigne, Gilbert, Galileo, Hobbes, Descartes, and Milton.           Engl.GA.2620    Laurence Lockridge    Romantic Movement    Thursday 3:30 - 5:30 PM      William Blake, William Wordsworth, Dorothy Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley, and John Keats are the canonical British Romantic writers considered in this seminar. Participants are free to pursue less familiar writers of the period if they so choose. Though a syllabus and set of discussion topics are shared by all, topics for term essays may reflect the particular critical and scholarly interests of participants working off syllabus.      Among standard topics to be discussed: Blake\u2019s revolutionary satire and mythology; the literary relationship of Coleridge, Dorothy Wordsworth, and William Wordsworth; Romantic autobiography; Coleridge as philosophic critic; William Wordsworth and the uses of memory; Lord Byron as performance artist; Percy Shelley and the Romantic theory of mind; Mary Shelley\u2019s questioning of Romantic ideology; Keats and cultural poetics; formal innovations in Romantic narrative, lyric, and drama; Romantic politics; representations of gender, race, and class; and issues concerning the Romantic canon. Such topics tend to be perennial; the seminar will seek out the state of current critical play concerning them.      Prominent schools of modern theory and criticism\u2014from archetypal, formalist, psychoanalytic, and ethical to feminist, historicist, and deconstructive\u2014have found in British Romantic writers a literature of great import. We debate a variety of such approaches.           Engl.GA.2720    Perry Meisel    Woolf, Mansfield, Cather    Monday 6:20 - 8:20 PM     An examination of Virginia Woolf and Willa Cather as transatlantic modernists based on their common influence by Katherine Mansfield. Mansfield's dialectical source is the transatlantic Henry James, whose social impressionism she sharpens by gendering and eroticizing. Woolf's dialectic with Mansfield is resolved by her use of Pater's sensory impressionism to unsex Mansfield while retaining her Jamesian psychologism and vivid sense of domestic life. Cather's dialectic with Mansfield is resolved by her use of Hardy's focus on the working farm to materialize Mansfield's psychologism and give it a more overt basis in the means of production that James's suppression of labor abjures. Biographical and historical contexts will be supplied to ground this literary assessment in the cold light of fact. Doing so redoubles Woolf and Cather's own relationship to Mansfield by inscribing it within a material and historical frame. Readings will begin with James, Pater, and Hardy before proceeding to the course's primary focus on Mansfield, Woolf, and Cather. Texts will include Mansfield's stories; Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, Orlando , and Between the Acts ; and Cather's O Pioneers!, The Song of the Lark, A Lost Lady, The Professor\u2019s House , and Lucy Gayheart .          Engl.GA.2805    Pat Crain and Catherine Robson    Transatlantic Childhoods    Wednesday 3:30 - 5:30      This seminar explores what we can see better, or see anew, when we juxtapose American and British experiences of, and responses to, emergent ideas and ideals of childhood in the child-obsessed nineteenth-century. After setting up key eighteenth-century concepts and contexts for what French historian Philippe Ari\u00e8s called the \"invention of childhood,\" we'll explore the ways in which children came to be defined between 1800 and 1900, in relation to such rubrics as law, labor, education, sex, play, and psychology, through examinations of both \"literary\" works and texts and artifacts from a range of other discourses and spheres. We'll pivot between American and British examples, aiming to track the commonalities at work in our two nations and the effects of marked structural differences. Here we'll be especially attentive to chattel slavery in the U.S., and to the relations, and non-relations, between the racialized notions of childhood produced in this country and those which arise out of Britain's sharply stratified class landscape. If race and class are produced differently, we'll also consider the degree to which British and American histories and representations of boyhood and girlhood converge and diverge across the period. We\u2019ll close with reflections on the ways in which a range of literary genres on the cusp of modernism form themselves in and through the new discourses of childhood and evolving figures of the child.      We will make use of special collections at Fales, New York Public Library, and other local archives.           Engl.GA.2900    Rajeswari Sunder Rajan    Postcolonial Thought: Politics, Ethics, Philosophy    Tuesday 6:20 - 8:20 PM      This seminar outlines a global intellectual history that looks at the diverse ways in which thinkers in Africa and Asia responded to colonialism in the last two centuries, to both colonial rule itself and the contact of cultures produced by colonial rule or European domination in other forms. The resulting discourse, which is here broadly identified under the heads of \u2018politics, ethics, and philosophy\u2019, is in fact an eclectic one, not containable within formal disciplinary boundaries. These writings are not what constitute \u2018postcolonial theory\u2019 as it is known and canonized in metropolitan academic studies. They have tended indeed to be overlooked as \u2018theory\u2019, but are now coming to the attention of historians of intellectual thought.      As we might expect, it was in the colonies rather than in the metropolis that the meeting of cultures resulted in the most productive intellectual consequences. The new knowledge from the west\u2014in the form of disciplines, ideas, epistemologies, and values-- was eagerly absorbed, processed, debated, contested and creatively re-thought by those who encountered it. Forged in the crucible of anti-colonial struggle are the ethics of non-violence, pacifism and sacrifice; ideas of universalism, egalitarianism and brotherhood; the reactive politics of nationalism; revisionary and adaptive Marxisms; major initiatives in political and social reform; and the politicization of religion.      How influential has \u2018postcolonial thought\u2019 been within decolonized nations and globally? How radical is it in its originality, its difference from European thought? Some of the figures whose life and work will be considered are (in no particular order): M.K. Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, B. R. Ambedkar, Tarabai Shinde (India); Muhammad Iqbal (India, Pakistan); Anagarika Dharmapala, Ananda Coomaraswamy (Ceylon/Sri Lanka); Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (Afghanistan?); Ali Shariati (Iran); Liang Qichao (China); Tenshin Okakura (Japan); Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u (Vietnam); Kartini (Indonesia); Jomo Kenyatta (Kenya); Kwame Nkrumah (Ghana); Samir Amin (Egypt); Abdullahi An-Na\u2019im (Sudan); Edouard Glissant (Martinique ). Writings by three or four of these will be studied in detail, the rest in broad survey mode.           Engl.GA.2902    Sonya Posmentier    Topics in Black Lit: Literary and Cultural Criticism from the Black Diaspora    Thursday 1:00 - 3:00 PM      In her 1988 lecture on the American literary canon, \u201cUnspeakable Things Unspoken\u201d Toni Morrison responded to the emergence of the \u201cAfro-American artistic presence\u201d in white literary discourse: \u201cit is no longer acceptable merely to imagine us and imagine for us. We have always been imagining ourselves\u2026. \u201c Morrison called for future theories of black literature equal to the history and present of black literature, and simultaneously called attention to the past and present of black theory. In this class we will pay attention to her call. How do black writers, artists and critics theorize their work in relationship to mainstream literary and cultural criticism, while at the same time claiming autochthonous critical traditions? And how have concepts such as double-consciousness, mimicry, calibanization, nation language and black optimism informed our readings of modern literature?      To answer these questions we\u2019ll delve into theories of performance, gender, sexuality, reading, nation and race emerging from and around black literature and culture. We will also consider how modern and contemporary theories of black art extend beyond the framework of the nation state that contained Morrison\u2019s groundbreaking critique. Readings may include works by: Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Sterling Brown, James Baldwin, George Lamming, Amiri Baraka, Audre Lorde, Ralph Ellison, CLR James, Ng\u0169g\u0129 Wa Thiong\u2019o, Houston Baker, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Alice Walker, Kamau Brathwaite, \u00c9douard Glissant, Barbara Johnson, Valerie Smith, Fred Moten, and others. In their writing and their reading, students will also have the opportunity to analyze and practice multiple forms of critical work, from the critical essay to the interview.           Engl.GA.2916    Patrick Deer    The Contemporary Novel and the Culture of War    Wednesday 1:00 - 3:00 PM      This seminar will explore contemporary American, British and Anglophone fiction and non-fiction representations of war. Reading in a transatlantic frame, we will focus on the work of writers and intellectuals who have struggled to create in the shadow of violence and to resist its seductive logic. In order to give students a sense of the range and diversity of contemporary war writing, the course will counterpoint selected texts from modern war literature and culture with the recent wave of literary and non-fiction representations from Iraq, Afghanistan and the \u201cglobal war on terror.\u201d We will trace genealogies for recent war literature and culture in the era of colonial warfare and the dislocations of World War I, through the total war culture of World War Two, the apocalyptic imaginary of Cold War, guerilla warfare and counterinsurgency, to the high tech claims of \u201cpostmodern warfare.\u201d We will also consider the wider implications of censorship, propaganda, trauma, the war economy, and the technologies of violence for postmodern and contemporary narrative and popular memory. Focusing on themes of gender, trauma, imperialism, and resistance, the course will explore the intimate relations between contemporary literature, reportage, film and media, and military discourse.       Readings may be drawn from the work of: Virginia Woolf, Ernest Hemingway, Ernst Junger, Primo Levi, George Orwell, Graham Greene, Thomas Pynchon, Tim O\u2019Brien, Pat Barker, Martin Amis, Michael Ondaatje, Anthony Swofford, Gabe Hudson, Colby Buzzell, Kayla Williams, Dexter Filkins, Riverbend, Kevin Powers, and Ben Fountain. Films will include: The Battle of the Somme, All Quiet on the Western Front, Listen to Britain, Dr. Strangelove, The Battle of Algiers, Apocalypse Now, The Thin Red Line, Saving Private Ryan, The Fog of War, Bloody Sunday, Three Kings, Occupation Dreamland, Fallujah: A Lost Generation?, The Hurt Locker , and Restrepo . Theoretical texts may include: Freud, Adorno, Derrida, Foucault, Agamben, De Certeau, Theweleit, Williams, Said, Melman, Enloe, Virilio, Baudrillard, Scarry, Butler, Zi\u017eek, and Deleuze and Guattari.             Engl.GA.2917    Tom\u00e1s Noel    U.S. Latino/a Modernisms    Wednesday 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM      While critical conversations on U.S. Latino/a literatures and cultures have tended to foreground the social movements of the postwar era, Latino/a writers and artists were active in the Modernist    period, producing works of formal complexity that were also attuned to culturally specific locations and dislocations. In this course, we will approach both Latino/a and Modernism as open-ended terms, in an effort to bring together a broad range of texts (potentially including poems, novels, essays, drama, memoir, folklore, journalism, film, mural art, music, and dance) from around 1890 to 1950. We will consider national differences and contexts, emphasizing key terms (border, diaspora, exile) and stressing hemispheric, transnational, and cross-cultural contexts. We will pay special attention to spatial politics, and to the intersections between modernist form and a variety of vernacular practices and expressive cultures. Acknowledging the \u201cdouble attachments\u201d (Anglo, Hispanic) that frame Ilan Stavans's introduction to The Norton Anthology of Latino Literature (2011), we will also seek to complicate Stavans's formulation by examining a constellation of identifications (blackness, indigeneity, gender, and others).      Literary texts may include works by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, William Carlos Williams, Salom\u00f3n de la Selva, Jaime de Angulo, Leonor Villegas de Magn\u00f3n, Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a, Am\u00e9rico Paredes, Jovita Gonz\u00e1lez, Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, Julia de Burgos, Pura Belpr\u00e9, Alberto O'Farrill, Eugenio Florit, and Josefina Niggli. Performances may include works by Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n, Eusebia Cosme, Machito and his Afro-Cubans, Canario y Su Grupo, Lupe V\u00e9lez, and Maria Montez. Critical readings may include works by Laura Lomas, Kristen Silva Gruesz, Marissa K. L\u00f3pez, Antonio L\u00f3pez, Lisa S\u00e1nchez Gonz\u00e1lez, Fredric Jameson, Henri Lefebvre, Miriam Hansen, Alicia Schmidt Camacho, Ruth Glasser, Rosa-Linda Fregoso, Marta Moreno Vega, and Silvio Torres-Saillant.

How can a history of paper supplement and enrich recent histories of printing technology and printed artifacts like \"the book\"? What would it mean to imagine a paperless future? Organized around discussions of readings in common, this course considers the history, production, circulation and use of paper in the social production of knowledge, the shared imagination of value, and the mutual relations of consumers and commodities.           Engl.GA.2971    David Hoover (cross-listed with the Draper Program)    Topics in Digital Humanities: Digital Literary Studies    Thursday 6:20 - 8:20 PM      The availability of digital resources has significantly changed literary studies, especially because of the rapid increase the accessability of literary and critical texts that were previously very difficult to locate or access, or were extremely rare. Because of their digital form, such texts can be searched and can be transferred almost instantaneously from place to place. Yet locating, accessing, searching, and easily distributing digital texts are not the only ways of taking advantage of their digital nature.      This course will investigate some of the ways that manipulation and analysis can more fully exploit the nature of digital texts. We will consider some methods of distant reading, such as those recently practiced by Franco Moretti in Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for a Literary History (London: Verso, 2005)\u2013methods possible only since the advent of huge collections of publicly available digital texts. We will also consider some methods of very close reading that digital texts and tools make possible for the first time, including those introduced by Hugh Craig and Arthur Kinney in Shakespeare, Computers, and the Mystery of Authorship (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009). Along the way, we will work with individual digital literary texts, specially constructed iterary corpora, online portals, databases, natural language corpora, text collections, and single-author sites, and with digital archives, including some, like the Willa Cather Digital Archive, the Brown Women Writers Project, and the MONK project, that include their own analytical tools.      Our goal will be to apply innovative techniques to long-standing literary questions and to explore kinds of inquiries that digital texts and tools have made possible for the first time. We will focus on a fairly wide range of literature in English from about 1800 to about 1925, to avoid copyright problems, but students can study texts from any period and in many different languages in their own projects. The course assumes no advanced computational background, but it will take place in a computer lab (PC computers; some of the software does not run on Macs), and will involve extensive hands-on computational analysis.

Readings in theory of allegory and ideology will complement a focus on epic. We will explore the relation of pastoral and epic, placing pastoral moments in The Faerie Queene against selections from The Shepheardes Calendar and from Vergil and Theocritus. Some attention will be paid to the visual tradition of representing epic and allegory, including mythological paintings, emblem books, iconography and Renaissance mythography (Cartari, Conti and others). We will rethink the convergences and divergences of epic, allegory and romance as they help to shape questions of gender, nation, ideology and ethics.

How does the contemporary novel construct narrative worlds? And how does it now circulate in the world outside it? This course will rethink recent fiction from the last decade in light of two theoretical problems: \u201cworldliness\u201d and \"the contemporary\". We will begin by reading broadly from recent theories of postmodernism, postcolonial studies, world literature and novel theory in order to assess the field of contemporary fiction. We will thus encounter a range of critical concepts and categories that have structured recent debates: \u201cworlding\u201d, \u201cworld literature\u201d, \u201cthe human rights novel\u201d, \u201cplanetarity\u201d, \u201cdystopia\u201d, \u201chysterical realism\u201d and so forth. We will then move on to consider recent fiction: How does it understand the concept of the political? For what kind of ethical act does it create the narrative conditions? We will read Anglophone fiction and will also pay particular attention to the question of the post 9/11 novel: Aravind Adiga\u2019s The White Tiger , Zadie Smith\u2019s White Teeth , Don DeLillo\u2019s Falling Man , Teju Cole\u2019s Open City , Tom McCarthy\u2019s Remainder , Michael Ondaatje\u2019s Anils Ghost , Chris Abani's Graceland .
