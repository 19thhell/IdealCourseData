We begin with two shorter pieces and then work toward creating a longer research-based non-fiction feature. Finally, we conclude with a work of short fiction.

We'll follow Freya Stark and Tony Horwitz to the Middle East; Robert Kaplan to the Balkans; Mary Taylor Simeti to Sicily; Mary Morris to Mexico; and Neal Ascherson to the Black Sea. You'll develop stories from your own travel experiences, and report both in New York and further afield. You'll also have the opportunity to create at least one multimedia project: a slideshow, audio piece or video. Several stories produced in this rigorous class have won national travel writing awards, and many have been published, in such venues as Saveur, Go World Travel, the Orange County Register, the San Antonio Express, the Ithaca Journal, Worldpress, goNomad, Mr. Beller's Neighborhood, IntheFray and the New York Resident .

In addition to developing practical skills of research and crafting sentences, we consider how the struggle to capture settings with words reveals larger truths about not only the places we visit, but also the people who inhabit them (including ourselves). Other issues we examine include the ethical dilemmas of travel writing, the relationship of place of origin to destination, and the thorny question of the \u201cauthentic\u201d travel experience. Students craft four original pieces during the term that represent four different genres of travel literature. We begin with two shorter pieces and then work toward creating a longer research-based non-fiction feature. Finally, we conclude with a work of short fiction. For inspiration, we do short exercises and analyze work by writers like D. H. Lawrence, Ernest Hemingway, Patricia Highsmith, Bruce Chatwin, W. G. Sebald, Mary Gordon, Jhumpa Lahiri, Barack Obama, as well as contemporary working travel writers.

We'll follow Freya Stark and Tony Horwitz to the Middle East; Robert Kaplan to the Balkans; Mary Taylor Simeti to Sicily; Mary Morris to Mexico; and Neal Ascherson to the Black Sea. You'll develop stories from your own travel experiences, and report both in New York and further afield. You'll also have the opportunity to create at least one multimedia project: a slideshow, audio piece or video. Several stories produced in this rigorous class have won national travel writing awards, and many have been published, in such venues as Saveur, Go World Travel, the Orange County Register, the San Antonio Express, the Ithaca Journal, Worldpress, goNomad, Mr. Beller's Neighborhood, IntheFray and the New York Resident .
