The film must be shot entirely on exterior sets. No interiors! The final film may have sound effects but no music or sync sound, and no dialogue. We call this the MOS (without sound) project. The purpose of the MOS is to create a dramatic moment within these confines that is specifically cinematic. The drama should emerge from the audience\u2019s observation of one or more characters in the midst of an ongoing event, however large or small, however quiet or extreme. It is crucial that the drama not require pantomime as a replacement for dialogue. There should be no need for dialogue. This is a rigorous exploration of purely visual storytelling. Your classes during the first six weeks of the term are designed to help you prepare to shoot the MOS project. Weeks 7 \u2013 10 are devoted to the actual production. The last weeks of the term are for editing, evaluations and to prepare for the next project. In order to use the first six weeks of classes as an efficient pre-production period, incoming 1st year students should start working on ideas for their projects during the previous summer. It is recommended that each student develop at least two or three different scripts for this project before they arrive in the fall. First Year \u2013 Spring Semester Each student will make two projects in the spring term, an observational documentary and a narrative adaptation. 1. The first project is a short observational documentary, to be shot on digital video and edited on Final Cut Pro. The final production will be an observational style documentary without narration or \u201ctalking heads.\u201d Most students will shoot this project over the winter break, but production time is also available in the first two weeks of the spring semester. The principal goal of this project is to sharpen the observational, shooting, and craft skills of the narrative filmmaker. Observing and capturing unfiltered, non-manipulated human behavior (what we are calling, for lack of a better phrase, 'real life') will inform future narrative work. 2. The second project is an adaptation of a short story. This project will also be shot on digital video, and edited on Final Cut Pro. The objective of this project is to build confidence and encourage risk-taking in adapting and directing source material. This includes developing the ability to analyze and interpret a given narrative text for the purpose of translating it into cinematic story telling. The emphasis is also on the practice of working with speaking actors, developing character and directing performance that is dialogue-driven. Second Year \u2013 10 Minute Narrative  The principle production of the second year is a ten-minute synch sound narrative. The student may choose to shoot in either Super 16mm film or 24p digital video formats. The project is to be edited on Avid. During the orientation week, second year students will attend a week-long writing boot camp to develop and revise their scripts. Students are expected to bring a complete draft of their scripts to the first day of boot camp. Directors will organize their own production teams and crews, drawing from the entire student body, other departments, and the resources of New York City. The Director of Photography must be either a current NYU student or alumnus. Every 2nd year student is required to work on at least five of their classmates\u2019 productions over the course of the production period, in various crew positions. The second year narrative is a more ambitious production, allowing students to work with larger crews, more advanced equipment, and more time. The project develops the director\u2019s ability ultimately to realize longer and feature-length works, demanding collaboration with a wider range of craft areas and focusing on working with actors. Second year productions are eligible for the NYU First Run Film Festival. After seven weeks of classes in the fall semester, the production period will begin. Each student is allowed one week of production time, with four crews going out each week. Classes do not resume until the start of the spring semester. Productions are scheduled through the Head of Production. Third Year Students are able to focus on specific areas of interest in the 3rd year and choose from an array of classes and production opportunities. In addition to the courses in feature writing, students are offered advanced classes in cinematography, producing, post production and directing actors. There are a number of collaboration projects (described in the following section) as well as opportunities to focus on documentary filmmaking and directing commercials for TV and other digital mediums. Thesis All students pursuing the directing track must direct a thesis project in order to earn an MFA from the Kanbar Institute of Film &amp; TV. Most students choose to make a narrative or documentary project 15 to 30 minutes in length. In some cases, a student may gain approval from the Thesis Review Committee to direct a feature length project for their thesis. The thesis is to be shot on either Super 16mm film, 35mm film, 24p digital video or HD digital video formats. The student may edit the thesis on either AVID or Final Cut Pro. Most students choose to shoot their thesis films after the conclusion of their coursework, during a period of matriculation. As with the second year production, crews are drawn from the student body, other departments, and the city. Directors must go through a process of Treatment Approval and Pre-Thesis Review with the Chair and departmental faculty in order to receive their production allotments and proceed with production. Treatment Approval can be scheduled at any time through the Chair\u2019s Office; Pre-Thesis Reviews typically occur on a monthly basis during the school year. The thesis film is the culmination of three years\u2019 worth of study, training, and production experience. Typically demanding a higher budget and greater resources, the thesis makes considerable demands of the time, talent, and ambitions of the director, crew, and cast. It is the final film you will make as a student and will be the centerpiece of how you present yourself to the industry as a filmmaker. However, as with any film, the thesis remains very much a learning experience, informing future productions of ever increasing sophistication and complexity. Students pursuing a producing, cinematography, or editing track are not required to direct a thesis project. They earn their MFA by working on a number of other student productions, taking certain electives, and by taking part in an internship or apprenticeship. Specific requirements for earning an MFA in this fashion are available in the Production Handbook. Though not a degree requirement, it is highly recommended that the student leave the program having written a feature length screenplay. Feature writing is a three year discipline in the department. All students are required to take a Script Analysis course in spring of the 1st year. They may elect Developing the Feature in spring of the 2nd year, and may elect Feature Writing in both fall and spring of the 3rd year. Workshops, writing groups, and mentoring by faculty and professional filmmakers is available to thesis students in the 4th and 5th year.
