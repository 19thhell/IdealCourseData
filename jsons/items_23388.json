Click here for the event program and full schedule.   Issues of trauma and risk in children\u2019s lives are frequently overlooked, yet are pervasive in urban areas like New York City. School systems, which often lack trauma-focused resources and professional development, struggle to adequately serve children who confront these issues.   The Risk to Resilience conference will address current resources, practices, and services to help teachers, administrators, and other community leaders think strategically about support systems for vulnerable children. The event will include panel discussions, workshops, and talks by thought leaders on children and education. Target audiences include advocacy community-based organizations, school principals, and other school administrators.   Highlights include keynote speeches by Angela Glover Blackwell , founder and CEO of PolicyLink (April 6 at 6:30 p.m.), and C. Cybele Raver , vice provost for research and faculty affairs and professor of applied psychology at NYU (April 7, 8:45 a.m.), as well as remarks by New York City Schools Chancellor Carmen Fari\u00f1a (April 7, 10 a.m.)   Additional thought leaders and speakers include Pedro Noguera , executive director of the Metro Center and professor of education at NYU Steinhardt; Richard Buery , New York City Deputy Mayor for Strategic Policy Initiatives; Anne Williams-Isom , CEO of Harlem Children's Zone; New York City Health Commissioner Mary Bassett ; and five New York City principals.
