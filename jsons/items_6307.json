The course emphasizes the reading of classic and more contemporary works of social theory and methodology, with a focus on key concepts and thinkers. How does one define a society? What is culture? How have social and cultural processes been understood? What is the relationship between a society or culture and a social group, an institution, or an individual? What is the nature of power, difference and identity? How do such foundational questions generate theories of modernity, capitalism, nationalism and globalization? How do such foundational questions orient the variety of disciplines within the social sciences? The course also surveys qualitative and quantitative methodologies, exploring the relationship between theory, methods, and the broader goals of research within the social sciences. Empirically grounded writings will explore the links between research frameworks, methodologies, data collection and theoretical claims. Readings will include classic texts by Karl Marx and Max Weber and more contemporary theorists such as Michel Foucault, David Harvey and Judith Butler, among others. Guest lectures by Gallatin faculty will introduce students to a range of methodologies (ethnography, quantitative data sets, the case study method, documentary analysis, interviewing and survey methods) and interdisciplinary research frameworks.

NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE                               Home       People       Undergraduate Program       Graduate Programs       News and Events       Resources       Employment Opportunities             Stay Connected           Facebook       Twitter                    Back to Home       Major Requirements for Social &amp; Cultural Analysis   The Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA) explores the  range of relationships between human collectivities, on the one hand, and  institutions and structures of power, on the other, taking into account how  these are affected by such modern global developments as intensified  urbanization, increased transnational exchange, and proliferating diasporic  populations.      Because these matters are highly complex, SCA combines research  methods from the social sciences and the humanities, and examines such varied  phenomena as consumer culture, industrial activity, mass media representations,  artistic productions, subcultural practices, and aspects of everyday life in  their economic, material, political, and historical contexts. At the same time,  it typically focuses its analyses through attention to the city in general and  New York in particular, in order to situate the region\u2013and the nation\u2013amid the  conditions and processes affecting the entire globe.      Study in SCA thus provides excellent background for careers in  such fields as community organizing, legal advocacy, non-profit administration,  public policy, and urban and regional planning, among many others. SCA students  select specific courses of study from among the several majors currently  offered in the department. These include majors in Africana Studies, Gender and  Sexuality Studies, and Metropolitan Studies; and minors in Social and Cultural  Analysis, Asian/Pacific/American Studies, American Studies, and Latino Studies.  See the Bulletin entries for these individual programs for detailed  information.      Major Requirements      The Social and Cultural Analysis major consists of introductory, elective, and  research components, together comprising a total of eleven courses, as laid out  below:      Three introductory courses, could be taken in any order:      \u2022   V18.0001   Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis\u2014An introduction to key terms and  analytical categories for interdisciplinary work in Social and Cultural  Analysis and related fields. This course  fulfills Society and Social Science MAP requirement       Two courses from among the following:       \u2022   V18.0101 ,  Approaches to Africana Studies       \u2022   V18.0201 ,  Approaches to American Studies       \u2022    Approaches to Asian/Pacific/American Experience  (V18.0301) or History of Asians in the United States       \u2022    (V18.0302) or MAP course World Cultures:  Asian/Pacific/American Cultures (V55.0539)       \u2022    Approaches to Gender and Sexuality Studies  (V18.0401)       \u2022    Approaches to Latino Studies (V18.0501) or the  MAP course, World Cultures: Contemporary Latino Cultures (V55.0529)       \u2022    Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Metropolitan  Studies (V18.0601) or Cities in a Global Context (V18.0602).       Six elective  courses      \u2022   Four   courses (at least two of which must be upper division) distributed across two  of the six different programs within the Department: Africana Studies; American  Studies; Asian/Pacific/American Studies; Gender and Sexuality Studies; Latino  Studies; Metropolitan Studies.       \u2022   Two   upper-division courses offered by the Department of Social and Cultural  Analysis which address issues relevantacross the Department\u2019s various fields of  study       Two research courses:      \u2022   V18.0040 Social  and Cultural Analysis-related Internship Fieldwork       \u2022   V18.0090 Senior  Research Seminar pertinent to Social and Cultural Analysis       A note about Language/Linguistic  Competency : The type of rigorous intercultural  study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires  students to recognize the complex modes of communication at work both within  and across different social groups. Thus the department strongly  encourages its students to develop advanced skills in language and linguistics  by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics;  studying a language other than English beyond the minimum level required by  CAS; studying languages especially germane to the department's fields of study;  pursuing community-based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and  use of specific language skills; undertaking study or research abroad in  contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities.
