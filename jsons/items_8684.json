Whether you're living in one of the residence halls centered around Washington Square in Greenwich Village, in Brooklyn Heights, or in a residence hall located in one of the city's other bustling neighborhoods, there is an endless amount of activity and things to do and see. Traveling to other areas of NYU and around the city is simple and affordable too, thanks to NYU's transportation services and New York City's extensive public transportation system. Both are easy to use and will ensure that you take advantage of all that New York City offers.     Below you will find a complete list of our residence halls. Each residence hall falls into one or more of the following three categories:     #FYRE: refers to the First-Year Residential Experience; residence halls that house first-year students     #Grad: refers to residence halls that house graduate students     #UC: refers to residence halls that house upperclass students (sophomores, juniors &amp; seniors)     In addition, each residence hall is categorized as apartment-style or traditional and falls into one of the following two categories:       #Apt: refers to apartment-style residence halls. In apartment-style halls, a kitchen is provided in the suite/apartment or a communal kitchen is available. Residents are not required to have a meal plan.   #Trad : refers to traditional residence halls. In traditional halls, a kitchen is not provided in the suite and residents are required to maintain a meal plan.

While this guide is intended for planning future communications, we ask that the new NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering identity not be used in external communications until we are fully merged on January 1, 2014 unless you have been previously granted permission by marketing and communications.     Our Name   Templates   Logos       Our Name   Following is a guide on how to use our new name in written communication.         What Was   Is Now           Polytechnic Institute of New York University   NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering       Usage: Formal documents issued from the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering       NYU-Poly   NYU School of Engineering or School of Engineering         Usage: Second instance in article, paragraph, etc. for public view, or to internal and external audiences, e.g., correspondence to research partner at another institution. And all subsequent mentions in article, paragraph, etc. for public view; anywhere   Note: If &quot;Polytechnic&quot; is used, it must be used in conjunction with NYU, example: &quot;NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering.&quot;   Shortening it is allowed in two ways:   &quot;NYU School of Engineering&quot;       (Allowed in a formal or external document as a second mention)   OR   &quot;School of Engineering&quot;       (Allowed in a less formal setting [web, social media] where the context of NYU is already implied).         &quot;Poly&quot; is no longer in use         Templates   Presentations     PowerPoint template     Sample Stationery   See Stationery Specification for more details, including specifications for business cards and envelopes.     Sample Letter (Black)   Sample Letter (Color)     Logos   To establish the full identity of our school, the logo should be used in its official, unaltered official form, i.e., do not stretch, change colors, enlarge to the point of pixilation, manually type the letterforms, or otherwise modify the logo.   Note: If more than one school is mentioned, use the NYU logo instead of displaying the logos of multiple schools.   Please review Visual Identity Guidelines before using our logo.

Whether you're living in one of the residence halls centered around Washington Square in Greenwich Village, in Brooklyn Heights, or in a residence hall located in one of the city's other bustling neighborhoods, there is an endless amount of activity and things to do and see. Traveling to other areas of NYU and around the city is simple and affordable too, thanks to NYU's transportation services and New York City's extensive public transportation system. Both are easy to use and will ensure that you take advantage of all that New York City offers.     Below you will find a complete list of our residence halls. Each residence hall falls into one or more of the following three categories:     #FYRE: refers to the First-Year Residential Experience; residence halls that house first-year students     #Grad: refers to residence halls that house graduate students     #UC: refers to residence halls that house upperclass students (sophomores, juniors &amp; seniors)     In addition, each residence hall is categorized as apartment-style or traditional and falls into one of the following two categories:       #Apt: refers to apartment-style residence halls. In apartment-style halls, a kitchen is provided in the suite/apartment or a communal kitchen is available. Residents are not required to have a meal plan.   #Trad : refers to traditional residence halls. In traditional halls, a kitchen is not provided in the suite and residents are required to maintain a meal plan.

NYU students reflect this diversity; they arrive from all over the country and the world not only to find themselves and \u201cmake it\u201d here, but to teach\u2014and learn from\u2014each other (not to mention build amazing friendships along the way). This makes student life at NYU a remarkable, life-changing experience unlike that at many other colleges.           Students at NYU are in the unique position to experience a college lifestyle in a city setting. NYU offers many of the essential activities that are traditionally associated with college student life, and its location in the heart of New York City creates a setting that presents a myriad of non-traditional opportunities that will supplement and accentuate the student life experience.     While here, students can join a fraternity or sorority. They can join one of our sports teams: NYU athletics range from intramural soccer to varsity fencing. They can develop and engage in a diverse, personal spiritual life. Academy Award winning directors and prize winning writers have honed their craft in NYU classrooms. Students can follow in their footsteps, exploring radio, film and the printed word by contributing to or joining one of the University\u2019s student media outlets. From Washington Square News to WNYU Radio to Tisch film courses, NYU students take advantage of New York City as a global center for media, journalism and communications.

Students can live in residential housing near the Washington Square campus\u2014soaking in the vibrant Greenwich Village neighborhood\u2014or they can live off campus in one of the five boroughs and beyond. With either option, students aren\u2019t just residents of a college campus; they are citizens, users and a vital aspect of one of the world\u2019s largest, diverse, most interesting cities.     As members of a metropolitan community, NYU students have access to the University\u2019s greatest resource: New York City itself. They use the city to launch a great career. Students intern for the world\u2019s most influential companies, biggest media outlets and largest organizations. They network with some of the most powerful people in the city, the country and the globe. Students also get involved in the community, volunteering or working for one of the city\u2019s many charities or even starting community service organizations of their own. That\u2019s just one example of how students take leadership positions that prepare them for what lies ahead after college.          NYU is \"in and of the city,\" and now with its growing global presence, in and of the world. Student Life at NYU reflects this. An NYU education is an experience like no other: diverse, cosmopolitan, vibrant and rich. NYU students do not just become well-rounded college graduates, but accomplished global citizens.
