View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1002 - Space and Place in Human Communication   This course will build on a core concept of Lewis Mumford who understood media ecology as a component of spatial and urban ecology. Emphasis will be given on how space socially organizes human meaning and on the inscription of space. How do people, through their practices and their being in the world, form relationships with the locales they occupy (both the natural world and the build environment)? How do they attach meaning to spaces to create places? And how do the experiences of inhabiting, viewing, and hearing those places shape their meanings, communicative practices, cultural performances, memories, and habits? Course themes include: mapping and the imagination; vision and space, soundscape, architecture and landscape, new media and space/time compression; space and identity; spatial violence; spatialization of memory.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1010 - Censorship in American Culture   An upper level course on the topic of censorship in American culture, from the late 19th century to the present. The broader context for our exploration will be the public sphere, understood in two ways: as the classic, liberal ideal-a space for civil, and equitable exchange of ideas and opinions open to all citizens-and in the more contemporary reality-a highly contested space of public discussion, where the boundaries concerning who can participate, what topics are allowed, and how the exchange takes place are drawn and redrawn. The tension between ideal and real forms of public communication plays out in highly charged debates around censorship, which take place in diverse public spaces, including literature, film, theatre, art galleries, the press, the internet, sidewalks, courts, and bars. Because these debates are cultural and legal ones, and are frequently deeply divisive within American society, the goal is for the students to have an enhanced understanding of the historical contexts in which important cultural and legal struggles over censorship took place, and to bring that understanding to bear on contemporary debates about the arts, sexuality, gender, privacy, national security, media technology, and government involvement in the marketplace of ideas and images. View sample syllabus              MCC-UE 1011 - Media and Migration   The course examines the role of media in the lives and cultures of transnational immigrant communities.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1016 - Media Audiences   Communication scholars have long concerned themselves with the relationship between various media/technologies and &lsquo;the audience.&rsquo;  Different intentions and perspectives inform the discourse and research on how media and communication technologies and their audiences/users interact.  This course will proceed historically, theoretically, and methodologically, always questioning the construction of audiences and media users -- constructions that are shaped by commercial, academic, political and cultural contexts. Students will reflect on some historical analyses of &lsquo;emergent&rsquo; audiences and critical responses to institutional constructions of audiences.  Students will critique mass communication &lsquo;positivist&rsquo; studies and questions of &lsquo;media effects&rsquo; that dominated debates about audiences beginning in the early twentieth century and still continue today. In addition, students will examine how media and audiences are both situated in particular multiple contexts that have a bearing on how media are generated and circulated, and how audiences experience and make meaning of media/technologies. Methodologically, students will investigate how audiences are conceptualized and researched by scholars and cultural critics.  Throughout the course, students will explore the thinking and multiple contexts that frame various conceptualizations of media/technologies and audiences, and how these different approaches inform the concerns, questions, methods, findings, and implications of audience/user research . View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1017 - Youth Media and Social Change   This course explores the theory, practice, and impact of the non-profit youth media organizations and school-based programs working in this field locally and around the world. Students will also use media production to conduct fieldwork in the New York City area that further builds the subfields of youth media/youth development, teaching and learning, and community building. Research projects will document and investigate how youth media is supporting the development of young people's capacities for 21st century skills of digital communication, critical literacy, and civic engagement. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1018 - Kids in Media Culture   In this course, students will examine how young people of different ages and backgrounds use, value, and find meaning in different media in different kinds of contexts, and we discuss the social, cultural, and political implications of these lived experiences. In addition, we will explore how we might address the issues raised by the contemporary communication environment, and by the realities of young people's complex interactions with popular media. Books required are David Buckingham's After the Death of Childhood: Growing Up in the Age of Electronic Media and Fisherkeller's Growing up with Television: Everyday Learning Among Young Adolescents. A packet of readings will include cultural audience studies investigating different actual kids' relationships to different media in a variety of social contexts. The culminating assignment for this class requires students to write a paper addressing a 'real' audience outside of the classroom informing them about the issues of the course, and proposing how that audience might take a course of action in response. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1019 - Media and Identity   This course will examine the relationship between mediated forms of communications the formation of identities, both individual and social.

MCC-UE 1025 - Race and Media   America&#39;s founding principles of equality and equal opportunity have long been the subject of interpretation, debate, national angst and widespread (often violent) conflict. No more is this the case than when we talk about the issue of race. While biological notions of race have lost their scientific validity, race remains a salient issue in American life as a social and political reality sustained through a wide variety of media forms. The broad purpose of this course is to better understand how notions of race have been defined and shaped in and through these mediated forms. Specific attention may be given to the ways that race is articulated in forms of mass media and popular culture.

Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1030 - Architecture as Media: Communication Through the Built Environment   This class reads architecture and the built environment through the lenses of media, communication, and culture. The course takes seriously the proposition that spaces communicate meaningfully and that learning to read spatial productions leads to better understanding how material and technological designs are in sustained conversation with the social, over time. Through analyses of a range of spaces from Gothic Cathedrals to suburban shopping malls to homes, factories, skyscrapers and digital cities students will acquire a vocabulary for relating representations and practices, symbols and structures, and for identifying the ideological and aesthetic positions that produce settings for everyday life. View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1031 - Digital Media: Theory and Practice   This course offers students a foundational understanding of the technological building blocks that make up digital media and culture, and of the ways they come together to shape myriad facets of life. Students will acquire a working knowledge of the key concepts behind coding, and survey the contours of digital media architecture, familiarizing themselves with algorithms, databases, hardware, and similar key components. These technological frameworks will be examined as the basic grammar of digital media and related to theories of identity, privacy, policy, and other pertinent themes.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1032 - Social Media Networking   This course will examine &ldquo;social media&rdquo; from a cultural perspective, with a focus on how media technologies figure in practices of everyday life and in the construction of social relationships and identities. We will work from an expansive definition of what constitutes &ldquo;social media,&rdquo; considering social network sites, smartphone apps, and online games, among other technologies. The course itself will involve communication in social media channels in addition to the traditional seminar format, thus we will be actively participating in the phenomena under study as we go.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1033 Critical Making (NEW for Spring 2015!)   Critical making is hands-on hardware practice as a form of reflection and analysis: a way of thinking through what (and how) computing and digital media mean by understanding how they work , building on the literature of media studies and the digital humanities . By turning from software to hardware, to the physicality of computation and communications infrastructure, we will take objects apart, literally and figuratively, and in the process will learn to interpret and to intervene -- using prototyping, reverse engineering, hardware hacking and circuit bending, design fiction, electronics fabrication and other approaches -- in the material layer of digital technologies.    View Sample Syllabus (DRAFT)          MCC-UE 1034 - Media, Technology and Society   An inquiry into the interplay of technology and contemporary society.

It surveys the technical development of the telephone, from its roots in telegraphy to radio and portable phones to mobile computing. We will trace the history of &ldquo;telephonic principles&rdquo; such as interaction and universality, and telephony in various social contexts: national and transnational telephone cultures; genres of text messaging; the relationship of communication technology to public, private, and virtual space; and the appropriation of the medium for the purposes of art and activism.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1037 - Music and Media   This course investigates the mediation of  music and music-like sounds in both private and public life. Commercial venues,  from restaurants to rest rooms, pipe Muzak into its spaces; radios broadcast  more music than any other content today; soundtracks imprint the texture of  signifying associations for television shows and films; we carry personal  playlists on mobile music players; and musical media and technologies for  making music are more readily available to us on our home computers than ever  before. We examine music and media from a variety of perspectives, including  its cultural, sensory, technological, ideological and metaphysical dimensions;  as well as the relation of music to mass media (radio, television, the  internet) and the film and music industries.       Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1040 - Health Media and Communication   The meanings of health and disease are shaped not only by  scientific and medical discourses, but by media, communication, and the  cultures of health. This course examines  the impact of media and health cultures on what counts as normal and  pathological, how medical environments are understood and experienced, popular  tactics for communicating and contesting biomedical information, public  understandings of biotechnology, and how media representation and popular  culture help to shape understandings of disease and health. Through the topic  of health, we will look at nationhood and population management,  subject-formation and stigma, individual and environmental risk. At the level  of language, we will question the metaphoric uses of disease and their  consequences. Readings, films (and other sources) will be drawn from a variety  of genres, including epidemiology, public health, anthropology, history,  communication studies, and medical memoir.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1065 - Media Events and Spectacle   This course examines the role played by media events and spectacle in the shaping of belief, attitudes, and actions, with particular attention paid to the concept of the masses and its changed meaning over time.

Internships expand student understanding of the dynamics of the ever-changing field of communication.          MCC-UE 1140 - Screening History: The Construction of American History in Hollywood Films   This course explores the ways in which popular Hollywood films construct the historical past, the ensuing battles among historians and the public over Hollywood's version of American history, and the ways that such films can be utilized as historical documents themselves. We will consider films as products of the culture industry; as visions of popularly understood history and national mythology; as evidence for how social conflicts have been depicted; and as evidence of how popular understanding and interpretations of the past have been revised from earlier eras to the present.    View sample syllabus              MCC-UE 1151 - Media History of New York   New York has played a crucial role in the history of media, and media have played a crucial role in the history of New York.

Summer 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 Communication &amp; Persuasion - Film Classics of Propaganda Instructor: Terence Moran , Mon/Wed 5:10-8:10 PM    Topic: Communication and Persuasion: Film Classics of Propaganda   An examination of classics of film propaganda in terms of their ideologies and mythic structures and messages. We will examine three powerful ideologies of the 20 th Century via analyses of films that exemplify and promote the values and life styles of Communism in Battleship Potemkin (Soviet Union, 1925), Fascisim in Triumph des Willens (National Socialist Germany, 1934-35), and Capitalism in Sex and the City (United States, 2008). Our analyses of these films will be based upon selected readings in Jacques Ellul&rsquo;s Propaganda, The Formation of Men&rsquo;s Attitudes and Joseph Campbell&rsquo;s The Hero With a Thousand Faces with regard to propaganda and the myth of the hero. Background readings, class lectures, and models for analyzing communication and propaganda will be used to structure an environment in which our class will examine specific case studies involving films from American and foreign sources, and covering films from the silent era to the 21 st Century.    Fall 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 / Topic: The Raw Data of Intimate Life Instructor: Roger Friedland, Tuesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Social research tries to make sense of &ldquo;raw data&rdquo;, doubly so in this case as they refer to quantitative information about the sexual, romantic and religious lives of young people. This seminar seeks to teach students the basics of quantitative social research, a particular kind of sense-making that both makes and manipulates the data. This seminar will consider both the generation and testing of hypotheses using survey data on intimate life recently collected by the instructor through social network sites, the blogsphere and university course websites in the United States and Muslim-majority countries in the Near East. Students will learn to use STATA, a statistical software, in order to calculate distributions of values, cross-tabulations, and potentially regression analyses. Students will use these skills to develop and test their own hypothesis for the final paper for this seminar. Students need not have any previous statistical training. Note: This is not a course on social media; it uses social media to generate samples of media users for explanatory analysis.    MCC-UE 1200-002 / Topic: Black Lives Matter - Race, Media, and Social Movements Instructor: Nicholas Mirzoeff, Tuesdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This seminar concentrates on the use of media by and for the Black Lives Matter movement. We will historicise the movement by examining Reconstruction, Civil Rights and the Black Power movement. We will contextualize it by learning about the prison-industrial complex and the New Jim Crow. At the heart of our discussion will be media in and for the movement. We'll look at performative resistance like Hands Up, Don't Shoot; Die Ins; and Black Brunch; and the role of social media in shaping resistance. We will get to the heart of what happened in Ferguson by reading the grand jury depositions. We'll look at how #BlackLivesMatter has challenged art, cinema and museums. And we'll consider what actions to take next.    MCC-UE 1200-003 / Topic: Media Landscapes - \"The Wire\" Instructor: Arvind Rajagopal , Thursdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This course will investigate the landscapes brought into view by a specific media artifact, in this case the critically acclaimed HBO show, The Wire. The Wire&rsquo;s extraordinary success as a TV series about a &ldquo;black site&rdquo; stretched across the American heartland, namely the African American urban underclass, has been copiously studied and commented upon. It has been seen as an example of the critical and creative turn taken by a segment of the cultural industry, as a maturation of the audience and a de-massification of viewer tastes in the era of addressable mass culture. David Simon himself, among others, has also described it as a move away from postmodern irony and narrative fragmentation and towards ancient Greek myth. In this class we will explore the show as a case study in making the black underclass simultaneously spectacular and theoretically invisible.The show will provide a set of texts for students to undertake detailed textual analysis, and to deepen their readings drawing on other texts provided in the class, and on students' own readings of the world.    MCC-UE 1200-004 / Topic: Digital Media, Advocacy, and Equal Rights, in the U.S. and Abroad Instructor: Isra Ali, Mondays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    In this course we will examine different moments in which digital media plays a significant role in the advocacy for equal rights related to gender and sexuality. We will look at domestic, transnational, and international advocacy. We will consider how the political, economic, and social, impacts the way digital media is deployed, paying particular attention to forces such as militarism, nationalism, and corporate interest. We will identify who utilizes digital media to participate in the discourse, how that usage impacts and relates to offline activism, and the role digital media plays in reshaping the conversation about gender and sexuality. We will look at how people engaged in these causes use digital media to speak to one another, and to traditional media outlets that want to hear from them as a result of the presence they build on digital media. We will also examine how the notion of gender and sexual equality is articulated through social media, and think critically about the concepts of gender, sexuality, and equality, and the institutionalization of this advocacy.    MCC-UE 1200-005 / Topic: Mediating Israel/Palestine Instructor: Helga Tawil-Souri, Wednesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Israel-Palestine &ndash; whether approached as a particular place, a political problem, a conflict, or even a metaphor &ndash; is fraught with controversies, contradictions, questions, and misunderstandings. More often that not, the more one learns about Israel-Palestine, the more likely the result is of a feeling of political paralysis (&ldquo;there is simply no solution to this intractable conflict!&rdquo;). This senior seminar will attempt to reverse this by having students collectively work on one media-related problem having to do with Israel-Palestine in order to solve it, as one would do as part of an architecture studio for example. A &ldquo;problem&rdquo; will be decided on during the first sessions of the class (for example: build an equitable and shared media infrastructure; improve reporting on the conflict in mainstream media; launch a marketing campaign for a one-state solution). As with any course, students will be introduced to a range of materials; most of the time however students will be asked to bring in readings, graphics and other materials based on individual research to help the collective obtain a deeper understanding of the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; and ways to solve it. Each student will also bring his/her own expertise (e.g. historical research, photography, archival work, interviews, sketching, software coding) in order to tackle the various components of the problem we are attempting to solve. Throughout this process, students will gain an in-depth understanding of the complexities of Israel-Palestine, and end the course with a collectively-built solution.    MCC-UE 1200-006 / Topic: Time and Technology Instructor: Kate Brideau, Thursdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Many of our concerns about modern technologies have to do with time&mdash;for instance, the growing inability to sustain attention for an extended period of time, or the ways email and mobile devices seem to expand the hours of the &ldquo;work day&rdquo; indefinitely. But this is not new; technology has long had an impact on our experiences and notions of time. This course will explore that relationship, considering how technology relates both to the deep time of human history, and also to our everyday lives. Technological developments have had a significant impact on how we think about history, memory, life, death, and immortality; the rhythms by which our cities move; the speeds at which we live life, and the ways we think about labor and leisure. In this course we will engage with media archaeology, read historical and philosophical works, and analyze photography, film, recorded music, digital media, and the possibilities of biotechnology. In addition to learning about the mutability of time as it relates to technology, this course will encourage students to think critically about how technology is affecting time as they experience it today, and what relationship to time they would like to have. Should we now be turning back toward slowness as we seem to be moving ever more quickly into the future?             MCC-UE 1210 - Senior Honors in Media, Culture, and Communication   Prerequisite: senior standing and department approval to pursue honors in the major. Open only to MCC majors with senior standing.

This course presents a philosophical, social, and legal inquiry into the impact of digital communications upon privacy &amp; its meanings, in order to prepare students to recognize, contextualize, and analyze privacy challenges created by new information technologies. We will explore the philosophical roots of privacy as a deeply held social value and consider how it may conflict with other values, such as freedom of speech, anonymity, efficiency, accountability, and national security. Our discussions will be situated in leading ethical and legal controversies concerning new media tools (e.g., social networks, mobile apps, digital e-readers, wearable health sensors), practices (e.g., online tracking, behavioral advertising, automated face recognition, video surveillance), platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and Google Maps), and other topics shaping today's privacy discourse.

Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1306 - Transnational Media Flows   This class examines the intersecting dynamics of media genres and geo-linguistic cultural markets in the configuration of global and regional media flows. It looks in particular at the way media genres travel and how their circulation raises issues about the cultural power of certain media narratives in specific historical, political and social conditions of consumption. We will examine the battle for national, regional, and global media markets as a struggle for the ?legitimate? cultural and political view of the world expressed through information (news), scientific discourse (documentaries), and popular culture (films, telenovelas, reality television, music) to understand the complex global flow of television programs and films.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1342 - Sounds In and Out of Africa   This course investigates cultural influence and exchange between Africa, the African diaspora, Europe, and America with a particular emphasis on sound and music. How has the sound of Africa been transcribed, recorded, stored, transported, and represented in the West? What can this tell us about global cultural flow? How do specific recording techniques articulate with global music markets? The course analyzes the transatlantic feedback between Africa, America and Europe; evaluates the politics of transcription, ethnographic description, and recording; and examines the changing role for traditional African music in a global world. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1345 - Fashion and Power   This course examines fashion as a form of communication and culture. Through cultural and media studies theory, we will examine how fashion makes meaning, and how it has been valued through history, popular culture and media institutions, focusing on the relationship between fashion, visual self-presentation, and power. The course will situate fashion both in terms of its production and consumption, addressing its role in relation to identity and body politics (gender, race, sexuality, class), art and status, nationhood and the global economy, celebrity and Hollywood culture, youth cultures and subversive practices. Note: This course is also offered abroad at NYU Paris under course code MCC-UE 9345. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1346 - Fame   Fame, notoriety, renown &ndash; the desire to be recognized and immortalized is the most enduring and perhaps the most desirable form of power. Culture, commerce, politics, and religion all proffer promises of fame &ndash; whether for fifteen minutes or fifteen centuries. This course departs from the insight that fame is a uniquely human ambition and a central force for social life. Together, we will investigate this subject by asking, what is fame?, Why do people want it?, How do they get it?, What can they do with it?, How does it affect those around them, and the generations that come after? In other words, what kind of good is fame? Drawing on texts from history, ethnography, theory, literature, philosophy, and contemporary media, this course will reflect on the ethics, erotics, pragmatics and pathologies of fame. We will compare fame to other forms of recognition (reputation, honor, etc.), and look at how fame operates in various social and historical circumstances, from small agricultural communities to enormous, hyper-mediated societies such as our own. Is fame, in our contemporary understanding, possible before photography? We&rsquo;ll consider the enduring question of fame as it is transformed by the technological conditions of reproducing reputation across space, time, and societies.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1347 - Culture of the Screen: From the Cinematic to the Handheld   Whether large, small, wide, high-definition, public, personal, shared, or handheld, screens are one of the most pervasive technologies in everyday life. From spaces of work to spaces of leisure, screens are sites for collaboration, performance, surveillance, and resistance. This course traces the cultural history of screens through a range of forms -- from the panorama to the cinema, from the radar system to the television, and from the terminal to the mobile device -- to provide a way of thinking about the development of the screen as simultaneously architectural, material, representational and computational.

In introducing students to the concept of the visual construction of the social field, the course compares the means by which cultures visualize themselves in forms ranging from the imagination to the encounter between people and visualized media. The course takes as its fundamental premise that visual culture circulates and creates meaning in increasing global flows and that the very foundations of global capital, global culture, and global media are based on the dynamics of visuality and the power systems it both affirms and challenges. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1411 - Visual Culture of Science and Technology   This course examines the imagery of science and technology, the role of visuality in the construction of scientific knowledge, artistic renditions of science, and the emergence of visual technologies in modern society. It looks at how visuality has been key to the exercise of power through such practices as cataloguing and identification; the designation of abnormality, disease, and pathologies; medical diagnosis; scientific experimentation; and the marketing of science and medicine. We will examine the development of the visual technologies in the emerging scientific practices of psychiatry and criminology; explore the sciences of eugenics, genetics, pharmacology, brain and body scans, and digital medical images of many kinds; the marketing of pharmaceuticals, and the emerging politics of scientific activism.

Emphasis will be given on how space socially organizes human meaning and on the inscription of space. How do people, through their practices and their being in the world, form relationships with the locales they occupy (both the natural world and the build environment)? How do they attach meaning to spaces to create places? And how do the experiences of inhabiting, viewing, and hearing those places shape their meanings, communicative practices, cultural performances, memories, and habits? Course themes include: mapping and the imagination; vision and space, soundscape, architecture and landscape, new media and space/time compression; space and identity; spatial violence; spatialization of memory.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1010 - Censorship in American Culture   An upper level course on the topic of censorship in American culture, from the late 19th century to the present. The broader context for our exploration will be the public sphere, understood in two ways: as the classic, liberal ideal-a space for civil, and equitable exchange of ideas and opinions open to all citizens-and in the more contemporary reality-a highly contested space of public discussion, where the boundaries concerning who can participate, what topics are allowed, and how the exchange takes place are drawn and redrawn. The tension between ideal and real forms of public communication plays out in highly charged debates around censorship, which take place in diverse public spaces, including literature, film, theatre, art galleries, the press, the internet, sidewalks, courts, and bars. Because these debates are cultural and legal ones, and are frequently deeply divisive within American society, the goal is for the students to have an enhanced understanding of the historical contexts in which important cultural and legal struggles over censorship took place, and to bring that understanding to bear on contemporary debates about the arts, sexuality, gender, privacy, national security, media technology, and government involvement in the marketplace of ideas and images. View sample syllabus              MCC-UE 1011 - Media and Migration   The course examines the role of media in the lives and cultures of transnational immigrant communities.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1016 - Media Audiences   Communication scholars have long concerned themselves with the relationship between various media/technologies and &lsquo;the audience.&rsquo;  Different intentions and perspectives inform the discourse and research on how media and communication technologies and their audiences/users interact.  This course will proceed historically, theoretically, and methodologically, always questioning the construction of audiences and media users -- constructions that are shaped by commercial, academic, political and cultural contexts. Students will reflect on some historical analyses of &lsquo;emergent&rsquo; audiences and critical responses to institutional constructions of audiences.  Students will critique mass communication &lsquo;positivist&rsquo; studies and questions of &lsquo;media effects&rsquo; that dominated debates about audiences beginning in the early twentieth century and still continue today. In addition, students will examine how media and audiences are both situated in particular multiple contexts that have a bearing on how media are generated and circulated, and how audiences experience and make meaning of media/technologies. Methodologically, students will investigate how audiences are conceptualized and researched by scholars and cultural critics.  Throughout the course, students will explore the thinking and multiple contexts that frame various conceptualizations of media/technologies and audiences, and how these different approaches inform the concerns, questions, methods, findings, and implications of audience/user research .

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1018 - Kids in Media Culture   In this course, students will examine how young people of different ages and backgrounds use, value, and find meaning in different media in different kinds of contexts, and we discuss the social, cultural, and political implications of these lived experiences. In addition, we will explore how we might address the issues raised by the contemporary communication environment, and by the realities of young people's complex interactions with popular media. Books required are David Buckingham's After the Death of Childhood: Growing Up in the Age of Electronic Media and Fisherkeller's Growing up with Television: Everyday Learning Among Young Adolescents. A packet of readings will include cultural audience studies investigating different actual kids' relationships to different media in a variety of social contexts.

MCC-UE 1025 - Race and Media   America&#39;s founding principles of equality and equal opportunity have long been the subject of interpretation, debate, national angst and widespread (often violent) conflict. No more is this the case than when we talk about the issue of race. While biological notions of race have lost their scientific validity, race remains a salient issue in American life as a social and political reality sustained through a wide variety of media forms. The broad purpose of this course is to better understand how notions of race have been defined and shaped in and through these mediated forms. Specific attention may be given to the ways that race is articulated in forms of mass media and popular culture.

Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1040 - Health Media and Communication   The meanings of health and disease are shaped not only by  scientific and medical discourses, but by media, communication, and the  cultures of health. This course examines  the impact of media and health cultures on what counts as normal and  pathological, how medical environments are understood and experienced, popular  tactics for communicating and contesting biomedical information, public  understandings of biotechnology, and how media representation and popular  culture help to shape understandings of disease and health. Through the topic  of health, we will look at nationhood and population management,  subject-formation and stigma, individual and environmental risk. At the level  of language, we will question the metaphoric uses of disease and their  consequences. Readings, films (and other sources) will be drawn from a variety  of genres, including epidemiology, public health, anthropology, history,  communication studies, and medical memoir.

Summer 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 Communication &amp; Persuasion - Film Classics of Propaganda Instructor: Terence Moran , Mon/Wed 5:10-8:10 PM    Topic: Communication and Persuasion: Film Classics of Propaganda   An examination of classics of film propaganda in terms of their ideologies and mythic structures and messages. We will examine three powerful ideologies of the 20 th Century via analyses of films that exemplify and promote the values and life styles of Communism in Battleship Potemkin (Soviet Union, 1925), Fascisim in Triumph des Willens (National Socialist Germany, 1934-35), and Capitalism in Sex and the City (United States, 2008). Our analyses of these films will be based upon selected readings in Jacques Ellul&rsquo;s Propaganda, The Formation of Men&rsquo;s Attitudes and Joseph Campbell&rsquo;s The Hero With a Thousand Faces with regard to propaganda and the myth of the hero. Background readings, class lectures, and models for analyzing communication and propaganda will be used to structure an environment in which our class will examine specific case studies involving films from American and foreign sources, and covering films from the silent era to the 21 st Century.    Fall 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 / Topic: The Raw Data of Intimate Life Instructor: Roger Friedland, Tuesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Social research tries to make sense of &ldquo;raw data&rdquo;, doubly so in this case as they refer to quantitative information about the sexual, romantic and religious lives of young people. This seminar seeks to teach students the basics of quantitative social research, a particular kind of sense-making that both makes and manipulates the data. This seminar will consider both the generation and testing of hypotheses using survey data on intimate life recently collected by the instructor through social network sites, the blogsphere and university course websites in the United States and Muslim-majority countries in the Near East. Students will learn to use STATA, a statistical software, in order to calculate distributions of values, cross-tabulations, and potentially regression analyses. Students will use these skills to develop and test their own hypothesis for the final paper for this seminar. Students need not have any previous statistical training. Note: This is not a course on social media; it uses social media to generate samples of media users for explanatory analysis.    MCC-UE 1200-002 / Topic: Black Lives Matter - Race, Media, and Social Movements Instructor: Nicholas Mirzoeff, Tuesdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This seminar concentrates on the use of media by and for the Black Lives Matter movement. We will historicise the movement by examining Reconstruction, Civil Rights and the Black Power movement. We will contextualize it by learning about the prison-industrial complex and the New Jim Crow. At the heart of our discussion will be media in and for the movement. We'll look at performative resistance like Hands Up, Don't Shoot; Die Ins; and Black Brunch; and the role of social media in shaping resistance. We will get to the heart of what happened in Ferguson by reading the grand jury depositions. We'll look at how #BlackLivesMatter has challenged art, cinema and museums. And we'll consider what actions to take next.    MCC-UE 1200-003 / Topic: Media Landscapes - \"The Wire\" Instructor: Arvind Rajagopal , Thursdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This course will investigate the landscapes brought into view by a specific media artifact, in this case the critically acclaimed HBO show, The Wire. The Wire&rsquo;s extraordinary success as a TV series about a &ldquo;black site&rdquo; stretched across the American heartland, namely the African American urban underclass, has been copiously studied and commented upon. It has been seen as an example of the critical and creative turn taken by a segment of the cultural industry, as a maturation of the audience and a de-massification of viewer tastes in the era of addressable mass culture. David Simon himself, among others, has also described it as a move away from postmodern irony and narrative fragmentation and towards ancient Greek myth. In this class we will explore the show as a case study in making the black underclass simultaneously spectacular and theoretically invisible.The show will provide a set of texts for students to undertake detailed textual analysis, and to deepen their readings drawing on other texts provided in the class, and on students' own readings of the world.    MCC-UE 1200-004 / Topic: Digital Media, Advocacy, and Equal Rights, in the U.S. and Abroad Instructor: Isra Ali, Mondays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    In this course we will examine different moments in which digital media plays a significant role in the advocacy for equal rights related to gender and sexuality. We will look at domestic, transnational, and international advocacy. We will consider how the political, economic, and social, impacts the way digital media is deployed, paying particular attention to forces such as militarism, nationalism, and corporate interest. We will identify who utilizes digital media to participate in the discourse, how that usage impacts and relates to offline activism, and the role digital media plays in reshaping the conversation about gender and sexuality. We will look at how people engaged in these causes use digital media to speak to one another, and to traditional media outlets that want to hear from them as a result of the presence they build on digital media. We will also examine how the notion of gender and sexual equality is articulated through social media, and think critically about the concepts of gender, sexuality, and equality, and the institutionalization of this advocacy.    MCC-UE 1200-005 / Topic: Mediating Israel/Palestine Instructor: Helga Tawil-Souri, Wednesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Israel-Palestine &ndash; whether approached as a particular place, a political problem, a conflict, or even a metaphor &ndash; is fraught with controversies, contradictions, questions, and misunderstandings. More often that not, the more one learns about Israel-Palestine, the more likely the result is of a feeling of political paralysis (&ldquo;there is simply no solution to this intractable conflict!&rdquo;). This senior seminar will attempt to reverse this by having students collectively work on one media-related problem having to do with Israel-Palestine in order to solve it, as one would do as part of an architecture studio for example. A &ldquo;problem&rdquo; will be decided on during the first sessions of the class (for example: build an equitable and shared media infrastructure; improve reporting on the conflict in mainstream media; launch a marketing campaign for a one-state solution). As with any course, students will be introduced to a range of materials; most of the time however students will be asked to bring in readings, graphics and other materials based on individual research to help the collective obtain a deeper understanding of the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; and ways to solve it. Each student will also bring his/her own expertise (e.g. historical research, photography, archival work, interviews, sketching, software coding) in order to tackle the various components of the problem we are attempting to solve. Throughout this process, students will gain an in-depth understanding of the complexities of Israel-Palestine, and end the course with a collectively-built solution.    MCC-UE 1200-006 / Topic: Time and Technology Instructor: Kate Brideau, Thursdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Many of our concerns about modern technologies have to do with time&mdash;for instance, the growing inability to sustain attention for an extended period of time, or the ways email and mobile devices seem to expand the hours of the &ldquo;work day&rdquo; indefinitely. But this is not new; technology has long had an impact on our experiences and notions of time. This course will explore that relationship, considering how technology relates both to the deep time of human history, and also to our everyday lives. Technological developments have had a significant impact on how we think about history, memory, life, death, and immortality; the rhythms by which our cities move; the speeds at which we live life, and the ways we think about labor and leisure. In this course we will engage with media archaeology, read historical and philosophical works, and analyze photography, film, recorded music, digital media, and the possibilities of biotechnology. In addition to learning about the mutability of time as it relates to technology, this course will encourage students to think critically about how technology is affecting time as they experience it today, and what relationship to time they would like to have. Should we now be turning back toward slowness as we seem to be moving ever more quickly into the future?             MCC-UE 1210 - Senior Honors in Media, Culture, and Communication   Prerequisite: senior standing and department approval to pursue honors in the major. Open only to MCC majors with senior standing.

View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1303 - Privacy and Media Technology   Few values have been as unalterably disturbed by developments in new media as privacy. This course presents a philosophical, social, and legal inquiry into the impact of digital communications upon privacy &amp; its meanings, in order to prepare students to recognize, contextualize, and analyze privacy challenges created by new information technologies. We will explore the philosophical roots of privacy as a deeply held social value and consider how it may conflict with other values, such as freedom of speech, anonymity, efficiency, accountability, and national security. Our discussions will be situated in leading ethical and legal controversies concerning new media tools (e.g., social networks, mobile apps, digital e-readers, wearable health sensors), practices (e.g., online tracking, behavioral advertising, automated face recognition, video surveillance), platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and Google Maps), and other topics shaping today's privacy discourse.

Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1306 - Transnational Media Flows   This class examines the intersecting dynamics of media genres and geo-linguistic cultural markets in the configuration of global and regional media flows. It looks in particular at the way media genres travel and how their circulation raises issues about the cultural power of certain media narratives in specific historical, political and social conditions of consumption. We will examine the battle for national, regional, and global media markets as a struggle for the ?legitimate? cultural and political view of the world expressed through information (news), scientific discourse (documentaries), and popular culture (films, telenovelas, reality television, music) to understand the complex global flow of television programs and films.    View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1310 - Culture and Media in Urban China   What  does it mean to be &ldquo;urban&rdquo; in China and how is Chinese urbanism mediated by new  cultural formations?

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1342 - Sounds In and Out of Africa   This course investigates cultural influence and exchange between Africa, the African diaspora, Europe, and America with a particular emphasis on sound and music. How has the sound of Africa been transcribed, recorded, stored, transported, and represented in the West? What can this tell us about global cultural flow? How do specific recording techniques articulate with global music markets? The course analyzes the transatlantic feedback between Africa, America and Europe; evaluates the politics of transcription, ethnographic description, and recording; and examines the changing role for traditional African music in a global world. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1345 - Fashion and Power   This course examines fashion as a form of communication and culture. Through cultural and media studies theory, we will examine how fashion makes meaning, and how it has been valued through history, popular culture and media institutions, focusing on the relationship between fashion, visual self-presentation, and power. The course will situate fashion both in terms of its production and consumption, addressing its role in relation to identity and body politics (gender, race, sexuality, class), art and status, nationhood and the global economy, celebrity and Hollywood culture, youth cultures and subversive practices. Note: This course is also offered abroad at NYU Paris under course code MCC-UE 9345. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1346 - Fame   Fame, notoriety, renown &ndash; the desire to be recognized and immortalized is the most enduring and perhaps the most desirable form of power. Culture, commerce, politics, and religion all proffer promises of fame &ndash; whether for fifteen minutes or fifteen centuries. This course departs from the insight that fame is a uniquely human ambition and a central force for social life. Together, we will investigate this subject by asking, what is fame?, Why do people want it?, How do they get it?, What can they do with it?, How does it affect those around them, and the generations that come after? In other words, what kind of good is fame? Drawing on texts from history, ethnography, theory, literature, philosophy, and contemporary media, this course will reflect on the ethics, erotics, pragmatics and pathologies of fame. We will compare fame to other forms of recognition (reputation, honor, etc.), and look at how fame operates in various social and historical circumstances, from small agricultural communities to enormous, hyper-mediated societies such as our own. Is fame, in our contemporary understanding, possible before photography? We&rsquo;ll consider the enduring question of fame as it is transformed by the technological conditions of reproducing reputation across space, time, and societies.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1347 - Culture of the Screen: From the Cinematic to the Handheld   Whether large, small, wide, high-definition, public, personal, shared, or handheld, screens are one of the most pervasive technologies in everyday life. From spaces of work to spaces of leisure, screens are sites for collaboration, performance, surveillance, and resistance. This course traces the cultural history of screens through a range of forms -- from the panorama to the cinema, from the radar system to the television, and from the terminal to the mobile device -- to provide a way of thinking about the development of the screen as simultaneously architectural, material, representational and computational. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1351 - War As Media   This course examines the proposition that contemporary war should be understood as media. War has become mediatized and media has been militarized. This course treats war and poltical violence as communicative acts and technologies and focuses on how they shape our understanding and experience of landscape, vision, body, time and memory.    View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1352 - Empire, Revolution and Media   This course examines the role of media in the history and emergence of empires and revolutions and the history of media empires.

View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1403 - Postcolonial Visual Culture   This courses addresses how colonialism and postcolonialism are shaped and mediated through images and the gaze. The dynamics of colonial history motivate and shape colonial and postcolonial perceptions and influence their patterns of global circulation when the boundary between the world out there and the nation at home is increasingly blurred. We will survey a range of image texts through various media (photography, television, cinema) and sites (war, the harem, refugee camps, prisons, disasters): nationalist mobilization, counter-insurgency, urban conflict, disaster management, the prison system, and the war on terror. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1404 - Media and the Culture of Money   This course examines the culture of money and finance, and the role of the media and popular culture in making sense of economics.

View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1410 - Global Visual Culture   This course examines the role of visual culture in the emergence of, concepts of, and processes of globalization and the global cultural flows. In introducing students to the concept of the visual construction of the social field, the course compares the means by which cultures visualize themselves in forms ranging from the imagination to the encounter between people and visualized media. The course takes as its fundamental premise that visual culture circulates and creates meaning in increasing global flows and that the very foundations of global capital, global culture, and global media are based on the dynamics of visuality and the power systems it both affirms and challenges. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1411 - Visual Culture of Science and Technology   This course examines the imagery of science and technology, the role of visuality in the construction of scientific knowledge, artistic renditions of science, and the emergence of visual technologies in modern society. It looks at how visuality has been key to the exercise of power through such practices as cataloguing and identification; the designation of abnormality, disease, and pathologies; medical diagnosis; scientific experimentation; and the marketing of science and medicine. We will examine the development of the visual technologies in the emerging scientific practices of psychiatry and criminology; explore the sciences of eugenics, genetics, pharmacology, brain and body scans, and digital medical images of many kinds; the marketing of pharmaceuticals, and the emerging politics of scientific activism. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1412 - Introduction to Visual Culture   Visual images pervade our everyday lives. We negotiate the world through visual culture, and the world itself is negotiated politically through visuality and visual images. This class is an introduction to the key issues of visual culture. It will examine the politics of images, the role that images play in producing cultural meaning, visuality and power relations, and how images are forms of visual communication. We will examine how images circulate through digital media, remakes, and viral networks, and the cross-fertilization of images between various social arenas, such as art, advertising, popular culture, news, science, entertainment media, video games, theme parks, and design.

In order to provide a complex perspective, the course will begin with a reflection about globalization, identities and local cultures and their tensions with the constitution of a global culture. The second and most important part of the course are the Latin American researches, perspectives and representations about the media, their place in contemporary societies, their active participation in the constitution of identities and the role in the construction of an agenda. This is how the course will introduce not only Latin American perspectives but also a global vision that will allow students to articulate global and local problems from a critical point of view. The denaturalization of the media, the identification of their constructions, representations and selections are some of the objectives of the course: to re-read media practices as a way to reflect about everyday practices.

Consult the MAP website for descriptions of each term's offerings.      Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the  Middle Ages   MAP-UA 401 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Readings: Hebrew Scriptures and  Christian New Testament, ancient Greek drama and philosophy, Vergil,  and Augustine. Continues with Dante's Inferno, selections from  Paradiso, and other texts from the Middle Ages.      Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the  Renaissance   MAP-UA 402 Offered every semester. 4  points.

Students read and write about the  course texts both for the lecture course and in their linked section  of Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1).         Cultures and Contexts      Cultures and Contexts: Islamic  Societies   MAP-UA 502 Offered every year. 4  points.   Examines the common base and regional  variations of Islamic societies. An \"Islamic society\" is here  understood as one that shares, either as operative present or  historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For  Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but  also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical,  topical, and regional. The emphasis in the premodern period is first  on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and  mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search  for religious identity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic  societies in the words of their own writings.      Cultures and Contexts: Africa   MAP-UA 505 Offered every year. 4  points.   Key concepts related to understanding  sub-Saharan African cultures and societies, concentrating in  particular on teaching students how to think critically and consult  sources sensibly when studying non-Western cultures. Topics include  problems in the interpretation of African literature, African  history, gender issues, the question of whether African thought and  values constitute a unique system of thinking, the impact of the  slave trade and colonialism on African societies and culture, and the  difficulties of and means for translating and interpreting the system  of thought and behavior in an African traditional society into terms  meaningful to Westerners. Among the readings are novels, current  philosophical theory, and feminist interpretations of black and white  accounts of African societies and the place of women in them. Issues  are approached with the use of analyses from history, anthropology,  sociology, literary theory, and philosophy.      Cultures and Contexts: The Chinese and  Japanese Traditions   MAP-UA 506 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Essential aspects of Asian  culture\u2014Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shintoism\u2014studied  through careful reading of major works of philosophy and literature.  A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese works is meant  to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities and the less  obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures of  Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese  legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China,  show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western  invasions.      Cultures and Contexts: Japan\u2014A  Cultural History   MAP-UA 507 Offered every other year. 4  points.   A consideration of the prehistory to  Japan's modernist transformation through an analysis of key  literary, religious, and artistic texts. Concentrates on the  historical experiences that produced elements of a national culture  before there was a nation and on the consciousness of being Japanese  before there was a \"Japan.\" Examines how key cultural elements  were used to make a modern nation-state.      Cultures and Contexts: The Pacific  Islands   MAP-UA 508 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   The Pacific Island region sweeps from  Easter Island in the East to Papua New Guinea in the West, a vast  \"sea of islands\" that has been a crucial space of exchange: of  perspectives, materials, people, and ideas. What can we learn from  the study of this region, a set of islands with both commonalities  and differences that is often imagined as one \"place\"? We examine  the cultures of the Pacific Islands, moving from the first migrations  of indigenous navigators through the age of European exploration and  colonialism, to the local experience of World War II and contemporary  engagements with globalization. We also study the area's unique  cultural configurations of ritual practice, cosmology, and society.  Along the way, we engage directly with the voices of Pacific  islanders, from those who participated in the voyages of Captain  Cook, to indigenous artists who reflect on these complex and  entangled histories. Other primary sources include museum  collections, film, painting, and other visual representations. This  comparative approach enables us to understand debates about colonial  encounter, primitivism, cannibalism, cargo cults, nuclear testing,  resource extraction, and the morality of diet, from a Pacific  perspective.      Cultures and Contexts: Middle Eastern  Societies   MAP-UA 511 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The popular American picture of the  Middle East as a place of violence, veiled women, and oil wealth  portrays none of the richness or complexity of most people's lives  in the region. How can we make sense of these seemingly unfamiliar  societies and think critically about Western images of the  unfamiliar? Questions examined in depth include the following: What  variety of sources do people in the Middle East draw on to define  their sense of who they are\u2014as members of particular households,  regions, nations, or religious communities? How do women and men  construct their gender identity? In what ways are village, town, and  city lives being transformed? Do people of the Middle East experience  their region's politics the way it is portrayed in the West? What  are some of the causes of political repression, armed struggle, or  terror? How did European colonialism reshape the lives of people in  the region, and how do they today encounter the cultural and economic  power of the United States and Europe? Readings are drawn from  history, anthropology, political economy, and the contemporary  literature of the region.      Cultures and Contexts: China   MAP-UA 512 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Fundamental concepts and practices of  Chinese society and culture, examined using primary sources in  translation whenever possible. By studying the social, political,  religious, ideological, ritual, economic, and cultural life of the  Chinese, students gain a sense of the core values and issues of  Chinese civilization and how these have affected and continue to have  an impact on the way people think and live.      Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel   MAP-UA 514 Offered every semester. 4  points.   The culture of the ancient Israelite  societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200  B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century  B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the  areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite  religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves  much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological  excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery  of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added  greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times.  The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on  Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of  Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the  mother religion of Christianity and Islam.      Cultures and Contexts: Latin America   MAP-UA 515 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Explores the cultural, social, and  political organization of indigenous people before the period of  European colonization. Studies the dynamics of the colonial  encounter, focusing on such themes as indigenous responses to  European rule, the formation of \"Indian\" society, and the  interaction of Europeans, Africans, and indigenous people. Considers  postcolonial Latin America, focusing on themes such as political  culture, competing ideologies of economics and social development,  and the construction of collective identities based on region, race,  ethnicity, gender, and class. Readings consist mostly of primary  sources and allow students to hear diverse voices within Latin  American society. Works by European conquerors, Inca and Aztec  descendants in the colonial period, and African and creole slaves are  studied. Novels, short stories, films, photographs, and music are  also included.      Cultures and Contexts: India   MAP-UA 516 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Considers the paradoxes of modern  India: ancient religious ideas coexisting with material progress,  hierarchical caste society with parliamentary democracy, and urban  shantytowns with palatial high-rises. Integrates research on India's  cultural values with social-scientific perspectives on their  contemporary relevance. Examines problems such as protective  discrimination for lower castes and cultural nationalism. Shows how  democracy involves difficult choices among competing, often opposed,  ancient and modern cultural values.      Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary  Latino Cultures   MAP-UA 529 Offered every year. 4  points.   Examines the growth and development of  \"Latino\" as a distinct category of identity out of the highly  diverse populations of Latin American background in the United  States, paying particular attention to the social processes shaping  its emergence. Provides a detailed examination of the processes of  cultural creation behind the rising growth of transnational cultures  and identities worldwide, and of the forces that are fueling their  development. Begins by exploring the immigration of Latin American  peoples to U.S. cities, then turns to three case studies of emerging  Latino communities, and ends by examining contemporary issues  involving Latinos in urban centers such as New York.      Cultures and Contexts: The African  Diaspora   MAP-UA 532 Offered every year. 4  points.   The dispersal of Africans to various  parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and  those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the  Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and  freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their  relationship to both African and non-African influences.      Cultures and Contexts: Indigenous  Australia   MAP-UA 536 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The indigenous people of Australia have  long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for  their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and  politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively  \"other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the  \"primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them  such as Walkabout and Rabbit-Proof Fence, in New Age literature, or  in museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms  of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have  struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own  terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and  self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range  of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic  texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film, and other media, and  consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and  constructed.      Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel   MAP-UA 537 Offered every year. 4  points.   Despite its small size and population,  Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its  ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic  origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years are  examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20  percent) in Israeli society is discussed. The special role of  religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew-speaking  culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace  movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life  are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether  Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the  controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched  on, the focus is on the character of Israeli society and the impact  on everyday life of living in the international limelight.      Cultures and Contexts:  Asian/Pacific/American Cultures   MAP-UA 539 Offered every year. 4  points.   Major issues in the historical and  contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, including  migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and  political mobilization. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex,  diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. Particular  attention is given to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions  (films, literature, art, media, and popular culture) as an expression  and reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions,  and political efforts.      Cultures and Contexts: New World  Encounters   MAP-UA 541 Offered every year. 4  points.   What was America before it was called  America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their  first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and  cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of  the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home  to several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire,  and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the  Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and  later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the  Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the  Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new  world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by  conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their  experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from  these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation  of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary  documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\"  including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with  historical and theoretical texts.      Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the  Pharaohs   MAP-UA 545 Offered every year. 4  points.   The archaeology, literature, and art of  ancient Egypt all offer insights into its culture. Subjects of  special interest are ancient Egyptian religious experiences and  ethics, as well as constructions of gender, class, and ethnicity.  Settlements that are particularly well documented through both  archaeological and textual remains\u2014such as Kahun and Deir  el-Medina\u2014yield extensive information about the varieties of social  experience in these societies. Lives differed tremendously based on  gender, profession, and locality (both spatial and temporal).  Likewise, we explore how Egyptians, regardless of social standing,  attempted to alter their socio-political circumstances through  avenues such as concerted political action, magic, revolt, or the  construction of well-crafted satire. Primary sources include letters,  wisdom literature, love poetry, ancient house plans, tomb scenes, and  physical anthropology.        Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia   MAP-UA 546 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Explores the expansive transformation  of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on  networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that  form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with  others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the  formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows the tracks of  Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion and then turns to  the age of early modern landed empires,  Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with  seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of  culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions,  during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise  of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese  expansion around the Pacific Rim. Concludes by considering cultural  change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on  entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the  market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor  migration, as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York  City, including our nearby Chinatown.      Cultures and Contexts: Globalizing the  Americas   MAP-UA 550 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The idea of \"America\" has long been  dissected and reconstituted by a number of ideologues, theorists,  policymakers, artists, activists, and ordinary people. Each has  sought to craft a new existence that distinguished itself from \"Old  World\" tyranny and tensions, significantly through the creation of  imagined communities of identity and belonging, based on various  cultural, political-economic, and social criteria. We focus on  studies of selected communities (e.g., the concept and experience of  race in Brazil, homophobia in the West Indies) and historical events  (e.g., 19th- and 20th-century migrations of Asians to Central  America) and explore how global visions and international movements  as, for example, Negritude, Pan-Americanism, Pan-Africanism,  cosmopolitanism, and mestizaje/cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 emerge from local currents  and practices.      Cultures and Contexts: Immigrant  America in the 19th Century   MAP-UA 551 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   The \"long nineteenth century,\" from  the 1820s through the 1920s, saw the arrival of no fewer than 50  million immigrants to the United States. Coming primarily, although  not exclusively, from Europe, their migrations not only transformed  the places they left, but profoundly altered American society. These  migrations, all of which involved a high degree of choice on the part  of their participants, took place within the context of family and  communal decision making, which in turn impacted significantly on the  women and men who made these journeys, allowing\u2014or forcing\u2014them  to create new kinds of identities, institutions, and cultures.  Indeed, as a result of their migrations, they became new people. They  became \"ethnic,\" as they had to redefine themselves both in terms  of what they left, what they \"brought\" with them, and what they  encountered in America. We explore how their journeys led to the  creation of a set of ethnic communities in America, which we can see  as specific and unique and yet resembling each other in notable ways,  focusing on three seemingly very different 19th-century groups:  Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants, and the ethnic cultures they  created.      Cultures &amp; Contexts: Topics\u2014Empires  and Political Imagination   MAP-UA 552 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Comparative study of empires, from the  Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and  constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power.  Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that  consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a  language and culture. Empires\u2014polities that maintained social and  cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people\u2014have  been one of the most common and durable forms of political  organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must   take account of how people lived in  empires\u2014sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes  accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend  their own power over others. The study of empire expands our ideas of  citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is  natural and necessary. We investigate how empires were held  together\u2014and where they were weak\u2014from perspectives that focus on  political and economic connections over long distances and long time  periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of  empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings  include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol,  Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as  primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial  polities.         Societies and the Social Sciences      Note that the prerequisite for all  Societies and the Social Sciences courses is completion of Texts and  Ideas (MAP-UA 4XX) and Cultures and Contexts (MAP-UA 5XX), as well as  completion of (or exemption from) Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1),   Writing II (WRI-UF 2002), or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9).      Societies and the Social Sciences:  Topics in Interdisciplinary Perspective   MAP-UA 600 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines social phenomena that cross  the boundaries among the various social-scientific disciplines.  Topics vary each term and may include, for example, human migration,  religion, fascism, or colonialism. By considering the methodologies  appropriate to the study of these topics, students learn to  appreciate the characteristic approaches of the social sciences,  their power to help us understand such phenomena, and their  limitations.         Expressive Culture      Note that the prerequisite for all  Expressive Culture courses is completion of Texts and Ideas (MAP-UA  4XX) and Cultures and Contexts (MAP-UA 5XX), as well as completion of  (or exemption from) Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1), Writing II (WRI-UF 2002), or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9).      Expressive Culture: Words   MAP-UA 710 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   What is literature or the literary? Is  there a literary language that works differently from ordinary  language? What is literary style and form? What is the position of  the writer or artist in relation to society, and what is the function  of the reader? Is literature a mirror of the world that it describes,  an attempt to influence a reader's ideas or opinions, an expression  of the identity of the writer, or none of these?      Expressive Culture: The Graphic Novel   MAP-UA 711 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines the interplay between words  and images in the graphic novel, a hybrid medium with a system of  communication reminiscent of prose fiction, animation, and film. What  is the connection between text and art? How are internal psychology,  time, and action conveyed in a static series of words and pictures?  What can the graphic novel convey that other media cannot? Authors  include Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, Peter Milligan, Charles Burns,  and Carla Speed McNeil.      Expressive Culture: Images   MAP-UA 720 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   What is the place of art in an  image-saturated world? We begin by considering the power and taboo of  images and the ways in which individuals and institutions that  constitute \"the art world\" classify some of these images as works  of art; turn to explore the visual and conceptual challenges  presented by major works of sculpture, architecture, and painting;  and conclude with a selection of problems raised by art today.  Students develop the vocabulary to both appreciate and question the  artistic \"gestures\" of society in various places and times.      Expressive Culture: Painting and  Sculpture in New York Field Study   MAP-UA 721 Offered every spring. 4  points.   New York's public art collections  contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost  every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost  works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period  and combines on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums  or other locations where these works are exhibited.      Expressive Culture: Architecture in New  York Field Study   MAP-UA 722 Offered every fall. 4  points.   New York's rich architectural  heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of  the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its  social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an  extended period and combines on-campus lectures with group excursions  to prominent buildings. Consideration is given both to individual  buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture, as well  as to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the  adaptation of older buildings to new uses.      Expressive Culture: Sounds   MAP-UA 730 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Our lives pulsate with patterns of  sounds that we call music. We encounter these sounds in our homes,  cars, stores, and exercise salons; they accompany us to the grocery  store, the dentist's office, and the movies. Yet we rarely think  consciously about what they mean. Through a series of specific case  studies, we investigate the function and significance of music and  the musician in human life. We raise basic questions about how music  has been created, produced, perceived, and evaluated at diverse  historical moments, in a variety of geographical locations, and among  different cultural groups. Through aural explorations and discussion  of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time and space, we assess  the value of music in human experience.      Expressive Culture: Performance   MAP-UA 740 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines \"performance\" both as a  practice and as a theoretical tool with which to understand today's  world. The broad spectrum of live performance is explored by means of  lectures, discussions, and field trips. Students look at theatre and  dance, performance in everyday life, rituals, popular entertainments,  and intercultural performance. On the theoretical level, students are  introduced to \"speech acts,\" \"restored behavior,\" \"ritual  process,\" and \"play.\" Students see a broad variety of  performances, such as Native American powwow, Indian Hindu ritual  drama, off-Broadway theatre and dance, African American gospel,  street performers, and courtroom trials.      Expressive Culture: Film   MAP-UA 750 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Film is a medium that combines a number  of arts. It lies at the intersection of art and technology and of art  and mass culture, and at the boundaries of the national and the  global. Film is also a medium that coincides with and contributes to  the invention of modern life. By exploring the expressive and  representational achievements of cinema in the context of modernity  and mass culture, students learn the concepts to grasp the different  ways in which films create meaning, achieve their emotional impact,  and respond in complex ways to the historical contexts in which they  are made.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1002 - Space and Place in Human Communication   This course will build on a core concept of Lewis Mumford who understood media ecology as a component of spatial and urban ecology. Emphasis will be given on how space socially organizes human meaning and on the inscription of space. How do people, through their practices and their being in the world, form relationships with the locales they occupy (both the natural world and the build environment)? How do they attach meaning to spaces to create places? And how do the experiences of inhabiting, viewing, and hearing those places shape their meanings, communicative practices, cultural performances, memories, and habits? Course themes include: mapping and the imagination; vision and space, soundscape, architecture and landscape, new media and space/time compression; space and identity; spatial violence; spatialization of memory.

We will read a range of psychoanalytic theorists while studying how their insights have been put to work by both the culture industry and its critics. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1010 - Censorship in American Culture   An upper level course on the topic of censorship in American culture, from the late 19th century to the present. The broader context for our exploration will be the public sphere, understood in two ways: as the classic, liberal ideal-a space for civil, and equitable exchange of ideas and opinions open to all citizens-and in the more contemporary reality-a highly contested space of public discussion, where the boundaries concerning who can participate, what topics are allowed, and how the exchange takes place are drawn and redrawn. The tension between ideal and real forms of public communication plays out in highly charged debates around censorship, which take place in diverse public spaces, including literature, film, theatre, art galleries, the press, the internet, sidewalks, courts, and bars. Because these debates are cultural and legal ones, and are frequently deeply divisive within American society, the goal is for the students to have an enhanced understanding of the historical contexts in which important cultural and legal struggles over censorship took place, and to bring that understanding to bear on contemporary debates about the arts, sexuality, gender, privacy, national security, media technology, and government involvement in the marketplace of ideas and images. View sample syllabus              MCC-UE 1011 - Media and Migration   The course examines the role of media in the lives and cultures of transnational immigrant communities.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1016 - Media Audiences   Communication scholars have long concerned themselves with the relationship between various media/technologies and &lsquo;the audience.&rsquo;  Different intentions and perspectives inform the discourse and research on how media and communication technologies and their audiences/users interact.  This course will proceed historically, theoretically, and methodologically, always questioning the construction of audiences and media users -- constructions that are shaped by commercial, academic, political and cultural contexts. Students will reflect on some historical analyses of &lsquo;emergent&rsquo; audiences and critical responses to institutional constructions of audiences.  Students will critique mass communication &lsquo;positivist&rsquo; studies and questions of &lsquo;media effects&rsquo; that dominated debates about audiences beginning in the early twentieth century and still continue today. In addition, students will examine how media and audiences are both situated in particular multiple contexts that have a bearing on how media are generated and circulated, and how audiences experience and make meaning of media/technologies. Methodologically, students will investigate how audiences are conceptualized and researched by scholars and cultural critics.  Throughout the course, students will explore the thinking and multiple contexts that frame various conceptualizations of media/technologies and audiences, and how these different approaches inform the concerns, questions, methods, findings, and implications of audience/user research . View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1017 - Youth Media and Social Change   This course explores the theory, practice, and impact of the non-profit youth media organizations and school-based programs working in this field locally and around the world. Students will also use media production to conduct fieldwork in the New York City area that further builds the subfields of youth media/youth development, teaching and learning, and community building. Research projects will document and investigate how youth media is supporting the development of young people's capacities for 21st century skills of digital communication, critical literacy, and civic engagement. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1018 - Kids in Media Culture   In this course, students will examine how young people of different ages and backgrounds use, value, and find meaning in different media in different kinds of contexts, and we discuss the social, cultural, and political implications of these lived experiences. In addition, we will explore how we might address the issues raised by the contemporary communication environment, and by the realities of young people's complex interactions with popular media. Books required are David Buckingham's After the Death of Childhood: Growing Up in the Age of Electronic Media and Fisherkeller's Growing up with Television: Everyday Learning Among Young Adolescents. A packet of readings will include cultural audience studies investigating different actual kids' relationships to different media in a variety of social contexts. The culminating assignment for this class requires students to write a paper addressing a 'real' audience outside of the classroom informing them about the issues of the course, and proposing how that audience might take a course of action in response.

MCC-UE 1025 - Race and Media   America&#39;s founding principles of equality and equal opportunity have long been the subject of interpretation, debate, national angst and widespread (often violent) conflict. No more is this the case than when we talk about the issue of race. While biological notions of race have lost their scientific validity, race remains a salient issue in American life as a social and political reality sustained through a wide variety of media forms. The broad purpose of this course is to better understand how notions of race have been defined and shaped in and through these mediated forms. Specific attention may be given to the ways that race is articulated in forms of mass media and popular culture.

These technological frameworks will be examined as the basic grammar of digital media and related to theories of identity, privacy, policy, and other pertinent themes.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1032 - Social Media Networking   This course will examine &ldquo;social media&rdquo; from a cultural perspective, with a focus on how media technologies figure in practices of everyday life and in the construction of social relationships and identities. We will work from an expansive definition of what constitutes &ldquo;social media,&rdquo; considering social network sites, smartphone apps, and online games, among other technologies. The course itself will involve communication in social media channels in addition to the traditional seminar format, thus we will be actively participating in the phenomena under study as we go.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1033 Critical Making (NEW for Spring 2015!)   Critical making is hands-on hardware practice as a form of reflection and analysis: a way of thinking through what (and how) computing and digital media mean by understanding how they work , building on the literature of media studies and the digital humanities . By turning from software to hardware, to the physicality of computation and communications infrastructure, we will take objects apart, literally and figuratively, and in the process will learn to interpret and to intervene -- using prototyping, reverse engineering, hardware hacking and circuit bending, design fiction, electronics fabrication and other approaches -- in the material layer of digital technologies.    View Sample Syllabus (DRAFT)          MCC-UE 1034 - Media, Technology and Society   An inquiry into the interplay of technology and contemporary society.

We will trace the history of &ldquo;telephonic principles&rdquo; such as interaction and universality, and telephony in various social contexts: national and transnational telephone cultures; genres of text messaging; the relationship of communication technology to public, private, and virtual space; and the appropriation of the medium for the purposes of art and activism.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1037 - Music and Media   This course investigates the mediation of  music and music-like sounds in both private and public life. Commercial venues,  from restaurants to rest rooms, pipe Muzak into its spaces; radios broadcast  more music than any other content today; soundtracks imprint the texture of  signifying associations for television shows and films; we carry personal  playlists on mobile music players; and musical media and technologies for  making music are more readily available to us on our home computers than ever  before. We examine music and media from a variety of perspectives, including  its cultural, sensory, technological, ideological and metaphysical dimensions;  as well as the relation of music to mass media (radio, television, the  internet) and the film and music industries.       Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1040 - Health Media and Communication   The meanings of health and disease are shaped not only by  scientific and medical discourses, but by media, communication, and the  cultures of health. This course examines  the impact of media and health cultures on what counts as normal and  pathological, how medical environments are understood and experienced, popular  tactics for communicating and contesting biomedical information, public  understandings of biotechnology, and how media representation and popular  culture help to shape understandings of disease and health. Through the topic  of health, we will look at nationhood and population management,  subject-formation and stigma, individual and environmental risk. At the level  of language, we will question the metaphoric uses of disease and their  consequences. Readings, films (and other sources) will be drawn from a variety  of genres, including epidemiology, public health, anthropology, history,  communication studies, and medical memoir.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1065 - Media Events and Spectacle   This course examines the role played by media events and spectacle in the shaping of belief, attitudes, and actions, with particular attention paid to the concept of the masses and its changed meaning over time.

Internships expand student understanding of the dynamics of the ever-changing field of communication.          MCC-UE 1140 - Screening History: The Construction of American History in Hollywood Films   This course explores the ways in which popular Hollywood films construct the historical past, the ensuing battles among historians and the public over Hollywood's version of American history, and the ways that such films can be utilized as historical documents themselves. We will consider films as products of the culture industry; as visions of popularly understood history and national mythology; as evidence for how social conflicts have been depicted; and as evidence of how popular understanding and interpretations of the past have been revised from earlier eras to the present.    View sample syllabus              MCC-UE 1151 - Media History of New York   New York has played a crucial role in the history of media, and media have played a crucial role in the history of New York.

Summer 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 Communication &amp; Persuasion - Film Classics of Propaganda Instructor: Terence Moran , Mon/Wed 5:10-8:10 PM    Topic: Communication and Persuasion: Film Classics of Propaganda   An examination of classics of film propaganda in terms of their ideologies and mythic structures and messages. We will examine three powerful ideologies of the 20 th Century via analyses of films that exemplify and promote the values and life styles of Communism in Battleship Potemkin (Soviet Union, 1925), Fascisim in Triumph des Willens (National Socialist Germany, 1934-35), and Capitalism in Sex and the City (United States, 2008). Our analyses of these films will be based upon selected readings in Jacques Ellul&rsquo;s Propaganda, The Formation of Men&rsquo;s Attitudes and Joseph Campbell&rsquo;s The Hero With a Thousand Faces with regard to propaganda and the myth of the hero. Background readings, class lectures, and models for analyzing communication and propaganda will be used to structure an environment in which our class will examine specific case studies involving films from American and foreign sources, and covering films from the silent era to the 21 st Century.    Fall 2015    MCC-UE 1200-001 / Topic: The Raw Data of Intimate Life Instructor: Roger Friedland, Tuesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Social research tries to make sense of &ldquo;raw data&rdquo;, doubly so in this case as they refer to quantitative information about the sexual, romantic and religious lives of young people. This seminar seeks to teach students the basics of quantitative social research, a particular kind of sense-making that both makes and manipulates the data. This seminar will consider both the generation and testing of hypotheses using survey data on intimate life recently collected by the instructor through social network sites, the blogsphere and university course websites in the United States and Muslim-majority countries in the Near East. Students will learn to use STATA, a statistical software, in order to calculate distributions of values, cross-tabulations, and potentially regression analyses. Students will use these skills to develop and test their own hypothesis for the final paper for this seminar. Students need not have any previous statistical training. Note: This is not a course on social media; it uses social media to generate samples of media users for explanatory analysis.    MCC-UE 1200-002 / Topic: Black Lives Matter - Race, Media, and Social Movements Instructor: Nicholas Mirzoeff, Tuesdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This seminar concentrates on the use of media by and for the Black Lives Matter movement. We will historicise the movement by examining Reconstruction, Civil Rights and the Black Power movement. We will contextualize it by learning about the prison-industrial complex and the New Jim Crow. At the heart of our discussion will be media in and for the movement. We'll look at performative resistance like Hands Up, Don't Shoot; Die Ins; and Black Brunch; and the role of social media in shaping resistance. We will get to the heart of what happened in Ferguson by reading the grand jury depositions. We'll look at how #BlackLivesMatter has challenged art, cinema and museums. And we'll consider what actions to take next.    MCC-UE 1200-003 / Topic: Media Landscapes - \"The Wire\" Instructor: Arvind Rajagopal , Thursdays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    This course will investigate the landscapes brought into view by a specific media artifact, in this case the critically acclaimed HBO show, The Wire. The Wire&rsquo;s extraordinary success as a TV series about a &ldquo;black site&rdquo; stretched across the American heartland, namely the African American urban underclass, has been copiously studied and commented upon. It has been seen as an example of the critical and creative turn taken by a segment of the cultural industry, as a maturation of the audience and a de-massification of viewer tastes in the era of addressable mass culture. David Simon himself, among others, has also described it as a move away from postmodern irony and narrative fragmentation and towards ancient Greek myth. In this class we will explore the show as a case study in making the black underclass simultaneously spectacular and theoretically invisible.The show will provide a set of texts for students to undertake detailed textual analysis, and to deepen their readings drawing on other texts provided in the class, and on students' own readings of the world.    MCC-UE 1200-004 / Topic: Digital Media, Advocacy, and Equal Rights, in the U.S. and Abroad Instructor: Isra Ali, Mondays 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm    In this course we will examine different moments in which digital media plays a significant role in the advocacy for equal rights related to gender and sexuality. We will look at domestic, transnational, and international advocacy. We will consider how the political, economic, and social, impacts the way digital media is deployed, paying particular attention to forces such as militarism, nationalism, and corporate interest. We will identify who utilizes digital media to participate in the discourse, how that usage impacts and relates to offline activism, and the role digital media plays in reshaping the conversation about gender and sexuality. We will look at how people engaged in these causes use digital media to speak to one another, and to traditional media outlets that want to hear from them as a result of the presence they build on digital media. We will also examine how the notion of gender and sexual equality is articulated through social media, and think critically about the concepts of gender, sexuality, and equality, and the institutionalization of this advocacy.    MCC-UE 1200-005 / Topic: Mediating Israel/Palestine Instructor: Helga Tawil-Souri, Wednesdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Israel-Palestine &ndash; whether approached as a particular place, a political problem, a conflict, or even a metaphor &ndash; is fraught with controversies, contradictions, questions, and misunderstandings. More often that not, the more one learns about Israel-Palestine, the more likely the result is of a feeling of political paralysis (&ldquo;there is simply no solution to this intractable conflict!&rdquo;). This senior seminar will attempt to reverse this by having students collectively work on one media-related problem having to do with Israel-Palestine in order to solve it, as one would do as part of an architecture studio for example. A &ldquo;problem&rdquo; will be decided on during the first sessions of the class (for example: build an equitable and shared media infrastructure; improve reporting on the conflict in mainstream media; launch a marketing campaign for a one-state solution). As with any course, students will be introduced to a range of materials; most of the time however students will be asked to bring in readings, graphics and other materials based on individual research to help the collective obtain a deeper understanding of the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; and ways to solve it. Each student will also bring his/her own expertise (e.g. historical research, photography, archival work, interviews, sketching, software coding) in order to tackle the various components of the problem we are attempting to solve. Throughout this process, students will gain an in-depth understanding of the complexities of Israel-Palestine, and end the course with a collectively-built solution.    MCC-UE 1200-006 / Topic: Time and Technology Instructor: Kate Brideau, Thursdays 9:30 am - 12:00 pm    Many of our concerns about modern technologies have to do with time&mdash;for instance, the growing inability to sustain attention for an extended period of time, or the ways email and mobile devices seem to expand the hours of the &ldquo;work day&rdquo; indefinitely. But this is not new; technology has long had an impact on our experiences and notions of time. This course will explore that relationship, considering how technology relates both to the deep time of human history, and also to our everyday lives. Technological developments have had a significant impact on how we think about history, memory, life, death, and immortality; the rhythms by which our cities move; the speeds at which we live life, and the ways we think about labor and leisure. In this course we will engage with media archaeology, read historical and philosophical works, and analyze photography, film, recorded music, digital media, and the possibilities of biotechnology. In addition to learning about the mutability of time as it relates to technology, this course will encourage students to think critically about how technology is affecting time as they experience it today, and what relationship to time they would like to have. Should we now be turning back toward slowness as we seem to be moving ever more quickly into the future?             MCC-UE 1210 - Senior Honors in Media, Culture, and Communication   Prerequisite: senior standing and department approval to pursue honors in the major. Open only to MCC majors with senior standing.

View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1303 - Privacy and Media Technology   Few values have been as unalterably disturbed by developments in new media as privacy. This course presents a philosophical, social, and legal inquiry into the impact of digital communications upon privacy &amp; its meanings, in order to prepare students to recognize, contextualize, and analyze privacy challenges created by new information technologies. We will explore the philosophical roots of privacy as a deeply held social value and consider how it may conflict with other values, such as freedom of speech, anonymity, efficiency, accountability, and national security. Our discussions will be situated in leading ethical and legal controversies concerning new media tools (e.g., social networks, mobile apps, digital e-readers, wearable health sensors), practices (e.g., online tracking, behavioral advertising, automated face recognition, video surveillance), platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and Google Maps), and other topics shaping today's privacy discourse.

Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1306 - Transnational Media Flows   This class examines the intersecting dynamics of media genres and geo-linguistic cultural markets in the configuration of global and regional media flows. It looks in particular at the way media genres travel and how their circulation raises issues about the cultural power of certain media narratives in specific historical, political and social conditions of consumption. We will examine the battle for national, regional, and global media markets as a struggle for the ?legitimate? cultural and political view of the world expressed through information (news), scientific discourse (documentaries), and popular culture (films, telenovelas, reality television, music) to understand the complex global flow of television programs and films.    View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1310 - Culture and Media in Urban China   What  does it mean to be &ldquo;urban&rdquo; in China and how is Chinese urbanism mediated by new  cultural formations?

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1342 - Sounds In and Out of Africa   This course investigates cultural influence and exchange between Africa, the African diaspora, Europe, and America with a particular emphasis on sound and music. How has the sound of Africa been transcribed, recorded, stored, transported, and represented in the West? What can this tell us about global cultural flow? How do specific recording techniques articulate with global music markets? The course analyzes the transatlantic feedback between Africa, America and Europe; evaluates the politics of transcription, ethnographic description, and recording; and examines the changing role for traditional African music in a global world. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1345 - Fashion and Power   This course examines fashion as a form of communication and culture. Through cultural and media studies theory, we will examine how fashion makes meaning, and how it has been valued through history, popular culture and media institutions, focusing on the relationship between fashion, visual self-presentation, and power. The course will situate fashion both in terms of its production and consumption, addressing its role in relation to identity and body politics (gender, race, sexuality, class), art and status, nationhood and the global economy, celebrity and Hollywood culture, youth cultures and subversive practices. Note: This course is also offered abroad at NYU Paris under course code MCC-UE 9345. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1346 - Fame   Fame, notoriety, renown &ndash; the desire to be recognized and immortalized is the most enduring and perhaps the most desirable form of power. Culture, commerce, politics, and religion all proffer promises of fame &ndash; whether for fifteen minutes or fifteen centuries. This course departs from the insight that fame is a uniquely human ambition and a central force for social life. Together, we will investigate this subject by asking, what is fame?, Why do people want it?, How do they get it?, What can they do with it?, How does it affect those around them, and the generations that come after? In other words, what kind of good is fame? Drawing on texts from history, ethnography, theory, literature, philosophy, and contemporary media, this course will reflect on the ethics, erotics, pragmatics and pathologies of fame. We will compare fame to other forms of recognition (reputation, honor, etc.), and look at how fame operates in various social and historical circumstances, from small agricultural communities to enormous, hyper-mediated societies such as our own. Is fame, in our contemporary understanding, possible before photography? We&rsquo;ll consider the enduring question of fame as it is transformed by the technological conditions of reproducing reputation across space, time, and societies.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1347 - Culture of the Screen: From the Cinematic to the Handheld   Whether large, small, wide, high-definition, public, personal, shared, or handheld, screens are one of the most pervasive technologies in everyday life. From spaces of work to spaces of leisure, screens are sites for collaboration, performance, surveillance, and resistance. This course traces the cultural history of screens through a range of forms -- from the panorama to the cinema, from the radar system to the television, and from the terminal to the mobile device -- to provide a way of thinking about the development of the screen as simultaneously architectural, material, representational and computational. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1351 - War As Media   This course examines the proposition that contemporary war should be understood as media. War has become mediatized and media has been militarized. This course treats war and poltical violence as communicative acts and technologies and focuses on how they shape our understanding and experience of landscape, vision, body, time and memory.    View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1352 - Empire, Revolution and Media   This course examines the role of media in the history and emergence of empires and revolutions and the history of media empires.

View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1410 - Global Visual Culture   This course examines the role of visual culture in the emergence of, concepts of, and processes of globalization and the global cultural flows. In introducing students to the concept of the visual construction of the social field, the course compares the means by which cultures visualize themselves in forms ranging from the imagination to the encounter between people and visualized media. The course takes as its fundamental premise that visual culture circulates and creates meaning in increasing global flows and that the very foundations of global capital, global culture, and global media are based on the dynamics of visuality and the power systems it both affirms and challenges. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1411 - Visual Culture of Science and Technology   This course examines the imagery of science and technology, the role of visuality in the construction of scientific knowledge, artistic renditions of science, and the emergence of visual technologies in modern society. It looks at how visuality has been key to the exercise of power through such practices as cataloguing and identification; the designation of abnormality, disease, and pathologies; medical diagnosis; scientific experimentation; and the marketing of science and medicine. We will examine the development of the visual technologies in the emerging scientific practices of psychiatry and criminology; explore the sciences of eugenics, genetics, pharmacology, brain and body scans, and digital medical images of many kinds; the marketing of pharmaceuticals, and the emerging politics of scientific activism. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1412 - Introduction to Visual Culture   Visual images pervade our everyday lives. We negotiate the world through visual culture, and the world itself is negotiated politically through visuality and visual images. This class is an introduction to the key issues of visual culture. It will examine the politics of images, the role that images play in producing cultural meaning, visuality and power relations, and how images are forms of visual communication. We will examine how images circulate through digital media, remakes, and viral networks, and the cross-fertilization of images between various social arenas, such as art, advertising, popular culture, news, science, entertainment media, video games, theme parks, and design.

In order to provide a complex perspective, the course will begin with a reflection about globalization, identities and local cultures and their tensions with the constitution of a global culture. The second and most important part of the course are the Latin American researches, perspectives and representations about the media, their place in contemporary societies, their active participation in the constitution of identities and the role in the construction of an agenda. This is how the course will introduce not only Latin American perspectives but also a global vision that will allow students to articulate global and local problems from a critical point of view. The denaturalization of the media, the identification of their constructions, representations and selections are some of the objectives of the course: to re-read media practices as a way to reflect about everyday practices.

How has our experience of sound changed as we move from the piano to the personal computer, from the phonoautograph to the mp3? How have political, commercial, and cultural forces shaped what we are able to listen to, and how we listen to it? Finally, how have performers, physiologists, and philosophers worked to understand this radical transformation of the senses?

Consult the MAP website for descriptions of each term's offerings.      Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the  Middle Ages   MAP-UA 401 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Readings: Hebrew Scriptures and  Christian New Testament, ancient Greek drama and philosophy, Vergil,  and Augustine. Continues with Dante's Inferno, selections from  Paradiso, and other texts from the Middle Ages.      Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the  Renaissance   MAP-UA 402 Offered every semester. 4  points.

Students read and write about the  course texts both for the lecture course and in their linked section  of Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1).         Cultures and Contexts      Cultures and Contexts: Islamic  Societies   MAP-UA 502 Offered every year. 4  points.   Examines the common base and regional  variations of Islamic societies. An \"Islamic society\" is here  understood as one that shares, either as operative present or  historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For  Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but  also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical,  topical, and regional. The emphasis in the premodern period is first  on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and  mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search  for religious identity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic  societies in the words of their own writings.      Cultures and Contexts: Africa   MAP-UA 505 Offered every year. 4  points.   Key concepts related to understanding  sub-Saharan African cultures and societies, concentrating in  particular on teaching students how to think critically and consult  sources sensibly when studying non-Western cultures. Topics include  problems in the interpretation of African literature, African  history, gender issues, the question of whether African thought and  values constitute a unique system of thinking, the impact of the  slave trade and colonialism on African societies and culture, and the  difficulties of and means for translating and interpreting the system  of thought and behavior in an African traditional society into terms  meaningful to Westerners. Among the readings are novels, current  philosophical theory, and feminist interpretations of black and white  accounts of African societies and the place of women in them. Issues  are approached with the use of analyses from history, anthropology,  sociology, literary theory, and philosophy.      Cultures and Contexts: The Chinese and  Japanese Traditions   MAP-UA 506 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Essential aspects of Asian  culture\u2014Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shintoism\u2014studied  through careful reading of major works of philosophy and literature.  A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese works is meant  to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities and the less  obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures of  Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese  legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China,  show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western  invasions.      Cultures and Contexts: Japan\u2014A  Cultural History   MAP-UA 507 Offered every other year. 4  points.   A consideration of the prehistory to  Japan's modernist transformation through an analysis of key  literary, religious, and artistic texts. Concentrates on the  historical experiences that produced elements of a national culture  before there was a nation and on the consciousness of being Japanese  before there was a \"Japan.\" Examines how key cultural elements  were used to make a modern nation-state.      Cultures and Contexts: The Pacific  Islands   MAP-UA 508 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   The Pacific Island region sweeps from  Easter Island in the East to Papua New Guinea in the West, a vast  \"sea of islands\" that has been a crucial space of exchange: of  perspectives, materials, people, and ideas. What can we learn from  the study of this region, a set of islands with both commonalities  and differences that is often imagined as one \"place\"? We examine  the cultures of the Pacific Islands, moving from the first migrations  of indigenous navigators through the age of European exploration and  colonialism, to the local experience of World War II and contemporary  engagements with globalization. We also study the area's unique  cultural configurations of ritual practice, cosmology, and society.  Along the way, we engage directly with the voices of Pacific  islanders, from those who participated in the voyages of Captain  Cook, to indigenous artists who reflect on these complex and  entangled histories. Other primary sources include museum  collections, film, painting, and other visual representations. This  comparative approach enables us to understand debates about colonial  encounter, primitivism, cannibalism, cargo cults, nuclear testing,  resource extraction, and the morality of diet, from a Pacific  perspective.      Cultures and Contexts: Middle Eastern  Societies   MAP-UA 511 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The popular American picture of the  Middle East as a place of violence, veiled women, and oil wealth  portrays none of the richness or complexity of most people's lives  in the region. How can we make sense of these seemingly unfamiliar  societies and think critically about Western images of the  unfamiliar? Questions examined in depth include the following: What  variety of sources do people in the Middle East draw on to define  their sense of who they are\u2014as members of particular households,  regions, nations, or religious communities? How do women and men  construct their gender identity? In what ways are village, town, and  city lives being transformed? Do people of the Middle East experience  their region's politics the way it is portrayed in the West? What  are some of the causes of political repression, armed struggle, or  terror? How did European colonialism reshape the lives of people in  the region, and how do they today encounter the cultural and economic  power of the United States and Europe? Readings are drawn from  history, anthropology, political economy, and the contemporary  literature of the region.      Cultures and Contexts: China   MAP-UA 512 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Fundamental concepts and practices of  Chinese society and culture, examined using primary sources in  translation whenever possible. By studying the social, political,  religious, ideological, ritual, economic, and cultural life of the  Chinese, students gain a sense of the core values and issues of  Chinese civilization and how these have affected and continue to have  an impact on the way people think and live.      Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel   MAP-UA 514 Offered every semester. 4  points.   The culture of the ancient Israelite  societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200  B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century  B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the  areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite  religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves  much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological  excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery  of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added  greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times.  The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on  Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of  Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the  mother religion of Christianity and Islam.      Cultures and Contexts: Latin America   MAP-UA 515 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Explores the cultural, social, and  political organization of indigenous people before the period of  European colonization. Studies the dynamics of the colonial  encounter, focusing on such themes as indigenous responses to  European rule, the formation of \"Indian\" society, and the  interaction of Europeans, Africans, and indigenous people. Considers  postcolonial Latin America, focusing on themes such as political  culture, competing ideologies of economics and social development,  and the construction of collective identities based on region, race,  ethnicity, gender, and class. Readings consist mostly of primary  sources and allow students to hear diverse voices within Latin  American society. Works by European conquerors, Inca and Aztec  descendants in the colonial period, and African and creole slaves are  studied. Novels, short stories, films, photographs, and music are  also included.      Cultures and Contexts: India   MAP-UA 516 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Considers the paradoxes of modern  India: ancient religious ideas coexisting with material progress,  hierarchical caste society with parliamentary democracy, and urban  shantytowns with palatial high-rises. Integrates research on India's  cultural values with social-scientific perspectives on their  contemporary relevance. Examines problems such as protective  discrimination for lower castes and cultural nationalism. Shows how  democracy involves difficult choices among competing, often opposed,  ancient and modern cultural values.      Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary  Latino Cultures   MAP-UA 529 Offered every year. 4  points.   Examines the growth and development of  \"Latino\" as a distinct category of identity out of the highly  diverse populations of Latin American background in the United  States, paying particular attention to the social processes shaping  its emergence. Provides a detailed examination of the processes of  cultural creation behind the rising growth of transnational cultures  and identities worldwide, and of the forces that are fueling their  development. Begins by exploring the immigration of Latin American  peoples to U.S. cities, then turns to three case studies of emerging  Latino communities, and ends by examining contemporary issues  involving Latinos in urban centers such as New York.      Cultures and Contexts: The African  Diaspora   MAP-UA 532 Offered every year. 4  points.   The dispersal of Africans to various  parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and  those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the  Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and  freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their  relationship to both African and non-African influences.      Cultures and Contexts: Indigenous  Australia   MAP-UA 536 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The indigenous people of Australia have  long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for  their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and  politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively  \"other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the  \"primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them  such as Walkabout and Rabbit-Proof Fence, in New Age literature, or  in museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms  of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have  struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own  terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and  self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range  of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic  texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film, and other media, and  consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and  constructed.      Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel   MAP-UA 537 Offered every year. 4  points.   Despite its small size and population,  Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its  ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic  origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years are  examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20  percent) in Israeli society is discussed. The special role of  religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew-speaking  culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace  movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life  are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether  Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the  controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched  on, the focus is on the character of Israeli society and the impact  on everyday life of living in the international limelight.      Cultures and Contexts:  Asian/Pacific/American Cultures   MAP-UA 539 Offered every year. 4  points.   Major issues in the historical and  contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, including  migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and  political mobilization. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex,  diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. Particular  attention is given to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions  (films, literature, art, media, and popular culture) as an expression  and reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions,  and political efforts.      Cultures and Contexts: New World  Encounters   MAP-UA 541 Offered every year. 4  points.   What was America before it was called  America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their  first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and  cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of  the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home  to several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire,  and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the  Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and  later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the  Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the  Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new  world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by  conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their  experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from  these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation  of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary  documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\"  including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with  historical and theoretical texts.      Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the  Pharaohs   MAP-UA 545 Offered every year. 4  points.   The archaeology, literature, and art of  ancient Egypt all offer insights into its culture. Subjects of  special interest are ancient Egyptian religious experiences and  ethics, as well as constructions of gender, class, and ethnicity.  Settlements that are particularly well documented through both  archaeological and textual remains\u2014such as Kahun and Deir  el-Medina\u2014yield extensive information about the varieties of social  experience in these societies. Lives differed tremendously based on  gender, profession, and locality (both spatial and temporal).  Likewise, we explore how Egyptians, regardless of social standing,  attempted to alter their socio-political circumstances through  avenues such as concerted political action, magic, revolt, or the  construction of well-crafted satire. Primary sources include letters,  wisdom literature, love poetry, ancient house plans, tomb scenes, and  physical anthropology.        Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia   MAP-UA 546 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Explores the expansive transformation  of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on  networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that  form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with  others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the  formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows the tracks of  Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion and then turns to  the age of early modern landed empires,  Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with  seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of  culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions,  during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise  of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese  expansion around the Pacific Rim. Concludes by considering cultural  change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on  entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the  market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor  migration, as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York  City, including our nearby Chinatown.      Cultures and Contexts: Globalizing the  Americas   MAP-UA 550 Offered every other year. 4  points.   The idea of \"America\" has long been  dissected and reconstituted by a number of ideologues, theorists,  policymakers, artists, activists, and ordinary people. Each has  sought to craft a new existence that distinguished itself from \"Old  World\" tyranny and tensions, significantly through the creation of  imagined communities of identity and belonging, based on various  cultural, political-economic, and social criteria. We focus on  studies of selected communities (e.g., the concept and experience of  race in Brazil, homophobia in the West Indies) and historical events  (e.g., 19th- and 20th-century migrations of Asians to Central  America) and explore how global visions and international movements  as, for example, Negritude, Pan-Americanism, Pan-Africanism,  cosmopolitanism, and mestizaje/cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 emerge from local currents  and practices.      Cultures and Contexts: Immigrant  America in the 19th Century   MAP-UA 551 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   The \"long nineteenth century,\" from  the 1820s through the 1920s, saw the arrival of no fewer than 50  million immigrants to the United States. Coming primarily, although  not exclusively, from Europe, their migrations not only transformed  the places they left, but profoundly altered American society. These  migrations, all of which involved a high degree of choice on the part  of their participants, took place within the context of family and  communal decision making, which in turn impacted significantly on the  women and men who made these journeys, allowing\u2014or forcing\u2014them  to create new kinds of identities, institutions, and cultures.  Indeed, as a result of their migrations, they became new people. They  became \"ethnic,\" as they had to redefine themselves both in terms  of what they left, what they \"brought\" with them, and what they  encountered in America. We explore how their journeys led to the  creation of a set of ethnic communities in America, which we can see  as specific and unique and yet resembling each other in notable ways,  focusing on three seemingly very different 19th-century groups:  Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants, and the ethnic cultures they  created.      Cultures &amp; Contexts: Topics\u2014Empires  and Political Imagination   MAP-UA 552 Offered every other year. 4  points.   Comparative study of empires, from the  Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and  constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power.  Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that  consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a  language and culture. Empires\u2014polities that maintained social and  cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people\u2014have  been one of the most common and durable forms of political  organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must   take account of how people lived in  empires\u2014sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes  accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend  their own power over others. The study of empire expands our ideas of  citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is  natural and necessary. We investigate how empires were held  together\u2014and where they were weak\u2014from perspectives that focus on  political and economic connections over long distances and long time  periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of  empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings  include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol,  Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as  primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial  polities.         Societies and the Social Sciences      Note that the prerequisite for all  Societies and the Social Sciences courses is completion of Texts and  Ideas (MAP-UA 4XX) and Cultures and Contexts (MAP-UA 5XX), as well as  completion of (or exemption from) Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1),   Writing II (WRI-UF 2002), or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9).      Societies and the Social Sciences:  Topics in Interdisciplinary Perspective   MAP-UA 600 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines social phenomena that cross  the boundaries among the various social-scientific disciplines.  Topics vary each term and may include, for example, human migration,  religion, fascism, or colonialism. By considering the methodologies  appropriate to the study of these topics, students learn to  appreciate the characteristic approaches of the social sciences,  their power to help us understand such phenomena, and their  limitations.         Expressive Culture      Note that the prerequisite for all  Expressive Culture courses is completion of Texts and Ideas (MAP-UA  4XX) and Cultures and Contexts (MAP-UA 5XX), as well as completion of  (or exemption from) Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1), Writing II (WRI-UF 2002), or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9).      Expressive Culture: Words   MAP-UA 710 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   What is literature or the literary? Is  there a literary language that works differently from ordinary  language? What is literary style and form? What is the position of  the writer or artist in relation to society, and what is the function  of the reader? Is literature a mirror of the world that it describes,  an attempt to influence a reader's ideas or opinions, an expression  of the identity of the writer, or none of these?      Expressive Culture: The Graphic Novel   MAP-UA 711 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines the interplay between words  and images in the graphic novel, a hybrid medium with a system of  communication reminiscent of prose fiction, animation, and film. What  is the connection between text and art? How are internal psychology,  time, and action conveyed in a static series of words and pictures?  What can the graphic novel convey that other media cannot? Authors  include Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, Peter Milligan, Charles Burns,  and Carla Speed McNeil.      Expressive Culture: Images   MAP-UA 720 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   What is the place of art in an  image-saturated world? We begin by considering the power and taboo of  images and the ways in which individuals and institutions that  constitute \"the art world\" classify some of these images as works  of art; turn to explore the visual and conceptual challenges  presented by major works of sculpture, architecture, and painting;  and conclude with a selection of problems raised by art today.  Students develop the vocabulary to both appreciate and question the  artistic \"gestures\" of society in various places and times.      Expressive Culture: Painting and  Sculpture in New York Field Study   MAP-UA 721 Offered every spring. 4  points.   New York's public art collections  contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost  every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost  works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period  and combines on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums  or other locations where these works are exhibited.      Expressive Culture: Architecture in New  York Field Study   MAP-UA 722 Offered every fall. 4  points.   New York's rich architectural  heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of  the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its  social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an  extended period and combines on-campus lectures with group excursions  to prominent buildings. Consideration is given both to individual  buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture, as well  as to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the  adaptation of older buildings to new uses.      Expressive Culture: Sounds   MAP-UA 730 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Our lives pulsate with patterns of  sounds that we call music. We encounter these sounds in our homes,  cars, stores, and exercise salons; they accompany us to the grocery  store, the dentist's office, and the movies. Yet we rarely think  consciously about what they mean. Through a series of specific case  studies, we investigate the function and significance of music and  the musician in human life. We raise basic questions about how music  has been created, produced, perceived, and evaluated at diverse  historical moments, in a variety of geographical locations, and among  different cultural groups. Through aural explorations and discussion  of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time and space, we assess  the value of music in human experience.      Expressive Culture: Performance   MAP-UA 740 Offered occasionally. 4  points.   Examines \"performance\" both as a  practice and as a theoretical tool with which to understand today's  world. The broad spectrum of live performance is explored by means of  lectures, discussions, and field trips. Students look at theatre and  dance, performance in everyday life, rituals, popular entertainments,  and intercultural performance. On the theoretical level, students are  introduced to \"speech acts,\" \"restored behavior,\" \"ritual  process,\" and \"play.\" Students see a broad variety of  performances, such as Native American powwow, Indian Hindu ritual  drama, off-Broadway theatre and dance, African American gospel,  street performers, and courtroom trials.      Expressive Culture: Film   MAP-UA 750 Offered every semester. 4  points.   Film is a medium that combines a number  of arts. It lies at the intersection of art and technology and of art  and mass culture, and at the boundaries of the national and the  global. Film is also a medium that coincides with and contributes to  the invention of modern life. By exploring the expressive and  representational achievements of cinema in the context of modernity  and mass culture, students learn the concepts to grasp the different  ways in which films create meaning, achieve their emotional impact,  and respond in complex ways to the historical contexts in which they  are made.

Emanuela Bianchi, 2014   The Feminine Symptom: Aleatory Matter in the Aristotelian Cosmos (Fordham University Press, 2014)      The Feminine Symptom takes as its starting point the problem of female offspring for Aristotle: If form is transmitted by the male and the female provides only matter, how is a female child produced? Aristotle answers that there must be some fault or misstep in the process.    This inexplicable but necessary coincidence--sumptoma in Greek--defines the feminine symptom. Departing from the standard associations of male-activity-form and female-passivity-matter, Bianchi traces the operation of chance and spontaneity throughout Aristotle's biology, physics, cosmology, and metaphysics and argues that it is not passive but aleatory matter--unpredictable, ungovernable, and acting against nature and teleology--that he continually allies with the feminine.    Aristotle's pervasive disparagement of the female as a mild form of monstrosity thus works to shore up his polemic against the aleatory and to consolidate patriarchal teleology in the face of atomism and Empedocleanism.    Bianchi concludes by connecting her analysis to recent biological and materialist political thinking, and makes the case for a new, antiessentialist politics of aleatory feminism.         Jacques Lezra (ed) and Emily Apter (ed), 2014   Dictionary of Untranslatables: A Philosophical Lexicon (Princeton University Press, 2014)   This is an encyclopedic dictionary of close to 400 important philosophical, literary, and political terms and concepts that defy easy--or any--translation from one language and culture to another. Drawn from more than a dozen languages, terms such as Dasein (German), pravda (Russian), saudade (Portuguese), and stato (Italian) are thoroughly examined in all their cross-linguistic and cross-cultural complexities. Spanning the classical, medieval, early modern, modern, and contemporary periods, these are terms that influence thinking across the humanities. The entries, written by more than 150 distinguished scholars, describe the origins and meanings of each term, the history and context of its usage, its translations into other languages, and its use in notable texts. The dictionary also includes essays on the special characteristics of particular languages--English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.   Originally published in French, this one-of-a-kind reference work is now available in English for the first time, with new contributions from Judith Butler, Daniel Heller-Roazen, Ben Kafka, Kevin McLaughlin, Kenneth Reinhard, Stella Sandford, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Jane Tylus, Anthony Vidler, Susan Wolfson, Robert J. C. Young, and many more.The result is an invaluable reference for students, scholars, and general readers interested in the multilingual lives of some of our most influential words and ideas.         Richard Sieburth (tr, ed), 2014   Translation of Louise Lab\u00e9, Love Sonnets & Elegies (NYRB/Poets, 2014)   Louise Lab\u00e9, one of the most original poets of the French Renaissance, published her complete Works around the age of thirty and then disappeared from history. Rediscovered in the nineteenth century, her incandescent love sonnets were later translated into German by Rilke and appear here in a revelatory new English version by the award-winning translator Richard Sieburth.         Emily Apter, 2013   Against World Literature: On the Politics of Untranslatability (Verso, 2013) Against World Literature: On the Politics of Untranslatability argues for a rethinking of comparative literature focusing on the problems that emerge when large-scale paradigms of literary studies ignore the politics of the \u201cUntranslatable\u201d\u2014the realm of those words that are continually retranslated, mistranslated, transferred from language to language, or especially resistant to substitution.      In the place of \u201cWorld Literature\u201d\u2014a dominant paradigm in the humanities, one grounded in market-driven notions of readability and universal appeal\u2014Apter proposes a plurality of \u201cworld literatures\u201d oriented around philosophical concepts and geopolitical pressure points. The history and theory of the language that constructs World Literature is critically examined with a special focus on Weltliteratur, literary world systems, narrative ecosystems, language borders and checkpoints, theologies of translation, and planetary devolution in a book set to revolutionize the discipline of comparative literature.         Hala Halim, 2013   Alexandrian Cosmopolitanism: An Archive (Fordham University Press, 2013)   Interrogating how Alexandria became enshrined as the exemplary cosmopolitan space in the Middle East, this book mounts a radical critique of Eurocentric conceptions of cosmopolitanism. The dominant account of Alexandrian cosmopolitanism elevates things European in the city's culture and simultaneously places things Egyptian under the sign of decline. The book goes beyond this civilization/barbarism binary to trace other modes of intercultural solidarity.     Halim presents a comparative study of literary representations, addressing poetry, fiction, guidebooks, and operettas, among other genres. She reappraises three writers--C. P. Cavafy, E. M. Forster, and Lawrence Durrell--whom she maintains have been cast as the canon of Alexandria. Attending to issues of genre, gender, ethnicity, and class, she refutes the view that these writers' representations are largely congruent and uncovers a variety of positions ranging from Orientalist to anti-colonial. The book then turns to Bernard de Zogheb, a virtually unpublished writer, and elicits his Camp parodies of elite Levantine mores in operettas one of which centers on Cavafy. Drawing on Arabic critical and historical texts, as well as contemporary writers' and filmmakers' engagement with the canonical triumvirate, Halim orchestrates an Egyptian dialogue with the European representations.         Richard Sieburth (tr), 2013   Translator, The Prophecies by Nostradamus (Penguin, 2013) The mysterious quatrains of the sixteenth-century French astrologer Nostradamus have long proved captivating for their predictions. Nostradamus has been credited with anticipating the Great Fire of London, the rise of Adolf Hitler, and the September 11 terrorist attacks. Today, as the world grapples with financial meltdowns, global terrorism, and environmental disasters\u2014as well as the Mayan prediction of the apocalypse on December 21, 2012\u2014his prophecies of doom have assumed heightened relevance. How has The Prophecies outlasted most books from the Renaissance? This edition considers its legacy in terms of the poetics of the quatrains, published here in a brilliant new translation and with introductory material and notes mapping the cultural, political, and historical forces that resonate throughout Nostradamus's epic, giving it its visionary power.         Avital Ronell, 2012   Loser Songs (University of Illinois Press, 2012)   There are sons who grow up unhappily believing that no matter what they do, they cannot please their fathers. Often unable to shed their sense of lifelong failure, either they give up and suffer in a permanent sulk, or they try with all their might to prove they are worth something after all. These are the \"loser sons,\" a group of historical men as varied as President George W. Bush, Osama bin Laden, and Mohammed Atta. Their names quickly illustrate that not only are their problems serious, but they also make serious problems for others, expanding to whole nations. When God is conceived and inculcated as an angry and impossible-to-please father, the problems can last for generations.     In Loser Sons, Avital Ronell draws on current philosophy, literary history, and political events to confront the grim fact that divested boys become terrifying men. This would be old news if the problem didn't recur so often with such disastrous consequences. Looking beyond our current moment, she interrogates the problems of authority, paternal fantasy, and childhood as they have been explored and exemplified by Franz Kafka, Goethe's Faust, Benjamin Franklin, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, Hannah Arendt, Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve, and Immanuel Kant.     Brilliantly weaving these threads into a polyvocal discourse, Ronell shows how, with their arrays of powerful symbols, ideologies of all sorts perpetuate the theme that while childhood represents innocence, adulthood entails responsible cruelty. The need for suffering--preferably somebody else's--has become a widespread assumption, not only justifying abuses of authority, but justifying authority itself.      Shockingly honest, Loser Sons recognizes that focusing on the spectacular catastrophes of modernity might make writer and reader feel they're engaged in something important, while in fact what they are engaged in is still only spectacle. To understand the implications of her insights, Ronell addresses them directly to her readers, challenging them to think through their own notions of authority and their responses to it.         Kamau Brathwaite, 2010   Elegguas (Wesleyan University Press, 2010)   Eleggua, a word for \u201cthe Yoruba deity of the threshold, doorway, and crossroad,\u201d coincidentally resembles \u201celegy,\u201d a poem for the dead. \u201cElegguas\u201d weaves epic and elegy, lyric and polemic, to celebrate and mourn the dead of Brathwaite\u2019s extended family, from \u201cIvie Andersonnng\u201d to Mikey Smith, \u201cstone to death on Stony Hill Kingston Jamaica on Marcus Garvey birthday 17 August 1983\u2033 (\u201cStone\u201d). Homeric and Joycean allusions harmonize with Caribbean dialect and Brathwaite\u2019s own fine lyric idiolect.         John Chioles (tr), 2010   Translator, C.P. Cavafy, Poems- The Canon (Early Modern and Modern Greek Studies) (Hardcover-Harvard UP, 2010)   C.P. Cavafy (Konstantinos Petrou Kavafis) is one of the most important Greek poets since antiquity. He was born, lived, and died in Alexandria (1863-1933), with brief periods spent in England, Constantinople, and Athens. Cavafy set in motion the most powerful modernism in early twentieth-century European poetry, exhibiting simple truths about eroticism, history, and philosophy-an inscrutable triumvirate that informs the Greek language and culture in all their diachrony. The Cavafy Canon plays with the complexities of ironic Socratic thought, suffused with the honesty of unadorned iambic verse         Manthia Diawara, 2010   African Film: New Forms of Aesthetics and Politics (Prestel USA, 2010)   Contemporary African filmmaking is the subject of this insightful and exciting look at every aspect of the art form on the African continent. Focusing on new trends in African cinema from the 1990s to today, this book explores new cinematic languages and modes of production, films departure from nationalism and social realism, and the Nollywood film industry, among other topics.         Mikhail Iampolski, 2010   Through the Glass Darkly: 20 Chapters on Undeterminacy (New Literary Review, Moscow, 2010)            Jaques Lezra, 2010   Wild Materialism: The Ethic of Terror and the Modern Republic ,(Fordham University Press, 2010)    Wild Materialism speaks to three related questions in contemporary political philosophy. How, if different social interests and demands are so constitutively antagonistic, can social unity emerge out of heterogeneity? Does such unity require corresponding universals, and, if so, what are they, where are they found, or how are they built? Finally, how must the concept of democracy be revised in response to economic globalization, state and nonstate terrorism, and religious, ethnic, or national fundamentalism? Polemically rehabilitating the term terror , Lezra argues that it can and should operate as a social universal. Social terror, he dramatically proposes, is the foundation on which critiques of terrorist fundamentalisms must be constructed. Opening a groundbreaking methodological dialogue between Freud's work and Althusser's late understanding of aleatory materialism, Lezra shows how an ethic of terror, and in the political sphere a radically democratic republic, can be built on what he calls \"wild materialism.\"         Avital Ronell, 2010   Fighting Theory (University of Illinois Press, 2010), Lignes de Front (Paris)   For Fighting Theory , psychoanalyst and philosopher Anne Dufourmantelle conducted twelve interviews with Ronell, each focused on a key topic in one of Ronell's books or on a set of issues that run throughout her work. Ronell's discussions of such issues are candid, thoughtful, and often personal, bringing together elements from several texts, illuminating hints about them, and providing her up-to-date reflections on what she had written earlier. Intense and often ironic, Fighting Theory is a poignant self-reflection of the worlds and walls against which Avital Ronell crashed.         Richard Sieburth (ed), 2010   Editor, New Selected Poems and Translations of Ezra Pound (New Directions, October 30, 2010   The essential collection of Ezra Pound\u2019s poetry\u2014newly expanded and annotated with essays by Richard Sieburth, T. S. Eliot, and John Berryman. This newly revised and greatly expanded edition of Ezra Pound\u2019s Selected Poems is intended to articulate Pound for the twenty-first century. Gone are many of the \u201cstale creampuffs\u201d (as Pound called them) of the 1949 edition. Instead, new emphasis has been laid on the interpenetration of original composition and translation within Pound\u2019s career. New features of this edition include the complete \u201cHomage to Sextus Propertius\u201d in its original lineation, early translations from Cavalcanti, Heine, and the troubadours, as well as late translations of Sophocles, and the Confucian Odes. Unlike all previous selections, this volume provides annotation to all the early poems as well as a running commentary on the later Cantos \u2014 indispensable to any reader wanting to follow Pound on his epic odyssey through ancient China, medieval Provence, the Italian Renaissance, the early American Republic, and the darkness of the twentieth century. The editor, Richard Sieburth, provides a chronology of Pound\u2019s life, a new preface, and an informative afterword, \u201cSelecting Pound.\u201d Also included in the appendix are T. S. Eliot\u2019s and John Berryman\u2019s original introductions to Pound\u2019s Selected Poems.              Richard Sieburth (tr), 2010   Translator, Geometries by Guillevic (Ugly Duckling Press, 2010)   Guillevic wrote Geometries ( Euclidiennes in French) in the early sixties, after his friend, the poet Andr\u00e9 Frenaud, recognizing in his poetry an inclination toward mathematics, and more specifically geometry, encouraged him to pursue this direction. Guillevic places a series of geometrical figures before our eyes, as they might appear in a schoolchild's primer, paired with poems that let us hear how these forms might speak. These talking circles, squares and angles\u2014these articulations of space\u2014are in turn meant to remind us of our own figures of speech. Guillevic's Geometries fits into the 1960s return to emblems, signs, and playful constraints both in art (Robert Indiana, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and even Andy Warhol) and in writing (the Noigandres poets, Oulipo, Eugen Gomringer, the Robert Creeley of Pieces). But at the same time, the Euclidean world of forms here explored remains as timeless as the stones of Guillevic's own Carnac.         Cristina Vatulescu, 2010   Police Aesthetics: Literature, Film, and the Secret Police in Soviet Times (Stanford University Press, November 1, 2010)   Winner of the 2011 Heldt Prize for the best book by a woman in area of Slavic/Eastern European/Eurasian studies.   In Police Aesthetics , Vatulescu examines the most infamous holdings\u2014the personal files\u2014 within the secret police archives of Russia and Romania, as well as on movies the police sponsored, scripted, or authored. Through the archives, she gains new insights into the writing of literature and raises new questions about the ethics of reading. Her work opens a fresh chapter in the heated debate about the relationship between culture and politics in twentieth-century police states.         Hala Halim (tr), 2009   Translator, Clamor of the Lake: A Modern Arabic Novel by Mohamed El Bisatie (American University in Cairo Press, 2009)   An old fisherman of unknown origin arrives in a black boat. Taciturn and enigmatic, he takes on a woman and her twin boys. While he gives away nothing about his past, his undemanding companionship prompts the woman to narrate her turbulent life. Meanwhile, in a nearby village by the lake, Gomaa and his wife have found respite from the dreariness of their existence in the fantastic objects the sea churns up during gales. But when the waves cast up a chest that speaks in a language no one can comprehend, Gomaa is haunted by its voice. As the tumult of the lake drives a wedge between the couple, it turns two neighbors into close allies. But Karawia and Afifi too will be haunted by the siren song of the lake.   In this lyrical novel, the stories of these various figures converge on the mercurial presence of the lake, which in the end proves the narrative's true hero.            Mikhail Iampolski, 2009   Muratova: Essays in Film Phenomenology (Saint Petersburg, Seans, 2009)            Avital Ronell, 2009   Addict: Fixions et narcotextes (Bayard, 2009)         Hala Halim (tr), 2008   Translator, Heads Ripe for Plucking by Mahmoud Al-Wardani's novel Awan al-Qitaf with a translator\u2019s afterword, (New York: American University in Cairo Press, 2008)   An Arab tyrant once infamously declared, 'I see heads that are ripe for plucking.' Mahmoud Al-Wardani's novel turns the statement on its head, using it as a point of departure to delineate a whole history of Arab tyranny and oppression. In Heads Ripe for Plucking, an impaled head seeks solace in narrating to itself stories of others who have sustained a similar fate. Beheadings, both literal and metaphorical - torture, murder, decapitation, brainwashing, losing one's head - are the subject of the six stories that unfold over the three sections of this novel. The narrative takes us from the most archetypal beheading in Arabo-Islamic history, that of al-Husayn, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, via the torture of communists in Nasser's detention camps, the meanderings of a Cairene teenager unwittingly caught in the 'bread riots' of 1977, a crime passionnel in a family alienated by petrodollars, the remembering of a father killed in the 1991 Gulf War and recovery of his lost manuscript on the eve of the millennium, into a dystopic future where heads are periodically severed to undergo maintenance and reloading of programs. The novel garnered critical acclaim for its experimentation with language and form as much as for its excavation of alternative histories.           Kristin Ross (tr), 2008   Translator, La nouvelle vague; un cinema a la premiere personne masculine singuliere (Masculine Singular; French New Wave Cinema) by Genevi\u00e8ve Sellier's (Durham: Duke University Press, 2008)    Masculine Singular is an original interpretation of French New Wave cinema by one of France's leading feminist film scholars. While most criticism of New Wave has concentrated on the filmmakers and their films, Genevi\u00e8ve Sellier focuses on the social and cultural turbulence of the cinema's formative years, from 1957 to 1962.         Kristin Ross, 2008   Mayo del 68 y sus vidas posteriores (spanish translation) (Madrid: Acuarela Libros, 2008)    Mai 68 et ses vies ult\u00e9rieures (French translation) (Le Monde Diplomatique and Editions Complexe, 2005)    May \u201868 and its Afterlives (University Of Chicago Press, 2002)      During May 1968, students and workers in France united in the biggest strike and the largest mass movement in French history. Protesting capitalism, American imperialism, and Gaullism, 9 million people from all walks of life, from shipbuilders to department store clerks, stopped working. The nation was paralyzed\u2014no sector of the workplace was untouched. Yet, just thirty years later, the mainstream image of May '68 in France has become that of a mellow youth revolt, a cultural transformation stripped of its violence and profound sociopolitical implications. Kristin Ross shows how the current official memory of May '68 came to serve a political agenda antithetical to the movement's aspirations. She examines the roles played by sociologists, repentant ex-student leaders, and the mainstream media in giving what was a political event a predominantly cultural and ethical meaning. Recovering the political language of May '68 through the tracts, pamphlets, and documentary film footage of the era, Ross reveals how the original movement, concerned above all with the question of equality, gained a new and counterfeit history, one that erased police violence and the deaths of participants, removed workers from the picture, and eliminated all traces of anti-Americanism, anti-imperialism, and the influences of Algeria and Vietnam.

The poetic stories in DS (2) use Brathwaite's trademark sycorax video style, offering personal revelations mixed with political and historical fables occurring around the globe. Brathwaite's prose poems relate with ardency and pathos the Caribbean experience and are a potent voice of the African diaspora.         Mark Sanders, 2007   Ambiguities of Witnessing: Law and Literature in the Time of the Truth Commission (Stanford: Stanford University Press/Johannesburg: Wits University Press, 2007)   The first book to explore the complex relationship between law and literature in testimony to crimes of apartheid before South Africa\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Ambiguities of Witnessing closely analyzes key individual testimonies. Whereas most existing books on this and other truth commissions are weighed down by abstract legal and philosophical discussion, this book does justice to witnesses\u2019 public testimony in a fascinating and theoretically sophisticated investigation of questions of human rights, mourning, forgiveness, and reparation. Framed by the personal, Ambiguities of Witnessing also meditates on what it means for the writer to respond to this epochal event in the history of post-apartheid South Africa.         Richard Sieburth (ed, tr), 2007   Editor and Translator, Emblems of Desire by Maurice Sc\u00e8ve with introduction (New York: Archipelago Books, 2007)   A forgotten masterpiece of French poetry, Emblems of Desire is a selection of 449 love poems first published in Lyons in 1544. Full of passionate ironies and charged obscurity, Maurice Sc\u00e9ve is considered a sixteenth-century St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. His oblique self-portraiture laid the groundwork for many contemporary poets.

From the files of James Laughlin (New York: New Directions, 2006)   James Laughlin\u2014poet, ladies' man, heir to a steel fortune, and the founder of New Directions\u2014was still at work on his autobiography when he died at 83. He left behind personal files crammed with memories and memorabilia: in \"M\" he is taking Marianne Moore to Yankee games (outings captured here in charming snapshots) to discuss \"arcane mammals,\" and in \"N\" nearly plunging off a mountain, hunting butterflies with Nabokov (\"Volya was a doll in a very severe upper-crust Russian way\").With an accent on humor, The Way It Wasn't is a scrapbook loaded with ephemera\u2014letters and memories, clippings and photographs. This richly illustrated album glitters like a magpie's nest, if a magpie could have known Tennessee Williams, W.C. Williams, Merton, Miller, Stein, and Pound.         Avital Ronell (ed), 2006   ed. & contributor, Kathy Acker: Lust for Life (Verso Books, 2006)         Avital Ronell, 2006   American Philo: Entretiens Avec Anne Dufourmantelle (Paris: Editions Stock, 2006)         Kristin Ross, 2006   Rouler Plus Vite, Laver Plus Blanc (Paris: Flammarion, 2006)         Mark Sanders, 2006   Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak: Live Theory (London: Continuum, 2006)    Live Theory offers a concise, comprehensive and accessible introduction to the themes central to the thought of one of the world\u2019s most provocative and original theorists. The book concentrates on Spivak\u2019s engagement, in theory and practice, with deconstruction, Marxism, feminism, and issues of postcoloniality and globalization, and makes clear the extent of her impact in the fields of postcolonial and literary theory.         Richard Sieburth (tr), 2006   Translator, Stroke by Stroke by Henri Michaux (Archipelago Books, 2006)   A pairing of two of Henri Michaux's most suggestive texts, Stroke by Stroke ( Par des traits , 1984) and Grasp ( Saisir , 1979), written towards the end of his life. Michaux's ideogrammic ink drawings accompany his poetic explorations of animals, humans, and the origins of language. This series of verbal and pictorial gestures is at once explosive and contemplative. Michaux emerges at his most Zen.         Richard Sieburth (tr), 2006   Translator, The Salt Smugglers by G\u00e9rard de Nerval (Archipelago Books, 2009)   First published as a sprawling feuilleton in the newspaper Le National in 1850, Les Faux Saulniers was political and topical. With nods to Diderot and Sterne, this protean digressive satire deals less with contraband salt smugglers and more with questions of subversion, transgression, censorship, and marginality. The Salt Smugglers is an unearthed pre-postmodern gem. By writing a first-person narrative detailing his dizzying quest for a elusive book holding the history of the Abb\u00e9 de Bucquoy, Nerval was able dance with the censors of the day who forbid fiction to appear in newspaper serials while questioning and opening the borders between fact and fiction.         Emily Apter, 2005   The Translation Zone: A New Comparative Literature (Princeton University Press, 2005)   Translation, before 9/11, was deemed primarily an instrument of international relations, business, education, and culture. Today it seems, more than ever, a matter of war and peace. In The Translation Zone , Emily Apter argues that the field of translation studies, habitually confined to a framework of linguistic fidelity to an original, is ripe for expansion as the basis for a new comparative literature. Organized around a series of propositions that range from the idea that nothing is translatable to the idea that everything is translatable, The Translation Zone examines the vital role of translation studies in the \"invention\" of comparative literature as a discipline. Ultimately, The Translation Zone maintains that a new comparative literature must take stock of the political impact of translation technologies on the definition of foreign or symbolic languages in the humanities, while recognizing the complexity of language politics in a world at once more monolingual and more multilingual.         Ulrich Baer (ed, tr), 2005   Editor and Translator, The Poet\u2019s Guide to Life: The Wisdom of Rainer Maria Rilke (Random House/Modern Library, 2005)   Gleaned from Rainer Maria Rilke\u2019s voluminous, never-before-translated correspondence, this volume offers the best writings and personal philosophy of one of the twentieth century\u2019s greatest poets. The result is a profound vision of how the human drive to create and understand can guide us in every facet of life. Arranged by theme\u2013from everyday existence with others to the exhilarations of love and the experience of loss, from dealing with adversity to the nature of inspiration\u2013here are Rilke\u2019s thoughts on how to infuse everyday life with beauty, wonder, and meaning.  Intimate, stylistically masterful, brilliantly translated and assembled, and brimming with the passion of Rilke, Letters on Life is a font of wisdom and a perfect book for all occasions.         Ulrich Baer, 2005   Spectral Evidence: The Photography of Trauma (MIT Press, 2005)   In this remarkable contribution to photographic criticism and psychoanalytic literature, Ulrich Baer traces the hitherto overlooked connection between the experience of trauma and the photographic image. Instead of treating trauma as a photographic \"theme,\" Baer examines the striking parallel between those moments arrested mechanically by photography and those arrested experientially by the traumatized psyche - moments that bypass normal cognition and memory. Taking as points of departure Charcot's images of hysteria and Freud's suggestion that the unconscious is structured like a camera, Baer shows how the invention of photography and the emergence of the modern category of \"trauma\" intersect.         Gabriela Basterra, 2005   Seductions of Fate: Tragic Subjectivity, Ethics, Politics (Palgrave Macmillan, 2004)   Engaging with a wide variety of literary, philosophical and psychoanalytic texts (from Aeschylus to Lorca, from Aristotle to Kant, from Hegel and Freud to Lacan and Levinas), Seductions of Fate argues that tragedy shapes our subjectivity. We, modern subjects, constitute ourselves on new versions of destiny, such as \"power\", the law or the past. Though this tragic self-representation seems to contradict the modern rationality, it allows the self to protect its freedom from the ethical experience that would put it into question. This radical ethical experience constitutes the subject as other than itself. Focusing primarily on this gap within the self, which compels the self to act on an unconditional but but impossible address, this book opens a new perspective on the rapport between ethics and politics.         Kamau Braithwaite, 2005   Born to Slow Horses (Wesleyan University Press, 2005)         Ana Maria Dopico (ed), 2005   ed, Jose Marti: Revolution, Politics, and Letters (Oxford University Press, November 2005)   This ground-breaking two-volume work offers the most comprehensive collection of Marti's prose work available in English. Where recent translations have offered selective anthologies of Marti's writing, this edition offers a key archive of essays, journalism, speeches, political documents, and historic correspondence, many translated for the first time. The first volume gathers essential texts and letters that have shaped Cuban history, nationalism, and political ideology, and which challenged and defined the course of revolutionary struggle. The second volume offers a comprehensive selection of Marti's vision of the Americas, combining his reflections on Latin American history, culture and political economy, and his critical observations on the modernity and upheavals of the United States in the late nineteenth century.         Avital Ronell, 2005   The Test Drive (On Nietzsche, Technology, & the Experimental Disposition) (University of Illinois Press, 2005)   Beginning with Nietzsche's discovery of the \"experimental disposition,\" Ronell explores testing's ascension to truth in modern practice. To know something, and to know that it is true, has never been a simple matter of recognition and assent. Instead, increasing numbers of tests of ever increasing complexity have been established to determine and constitute what is true, probable, or verifiable. In The Test Drive, Ronell explores vast areas of testing in the works of Husserl, Popper, Freud, Lyotard, Derrida, and others, including Zen philosophies.         Kamau Braithwaite, 2004   Words Need Love Too. (New York: Savacou North, 2004)         Timothy Reiss (ed), 2004   Editor, Music, Writing, and Cultural Unity in the Caribbean (New Jersey: Africa World Press, 2004)    Music, Writing, and Cultural Unity in the Caribbean brings together performers, writers, critics, and musicologists from the Dutch-, English-, French- and Spanish-speaking Caribbean, as well as Britain and the United States. The collection explores the history of the circulation of music and writing in trans-Atlantic, intra-Caribbean, and finally global perspectives.         Kristin Ross, 2004   Anti-Americanism (New York: New York University Press, 2004)   In this multidisciplinary collection, seventeen leading thinkers provide substance and depth to the recent outburst of fast talk on the topic of anti-Americanism by analyzing its history and currency in five key global regions: the Middle East, Latin America, Europe, East Asia, and the United States. The commentary draws from social science as well as the humanities for an in-depth study of anti-American opinion and sentiment in different cultures.The questions raised by these essays force us to explore the new ways America must interact with the world after 9/11 and the war against Iraq.          Richard Sieburth (tr), 2004   Translator, Lenz by Georg B\u00fcchner (New York: Archipelago Books, 2004)    Lenz , Georg Buchner's visionary exploration of an 18th century playwright's descent into madness, grew in part out of Alsatian pastor Oberlin's journal, which is translated here in its entirety for the first time. Lenz is a dispassionate account on the nervous system of a schizophrenic, perhaps the first third-person text ever written from the \"inside\" of insanity. Richard Sieburth's translations include Friedrich Holderlin's Hymns and Fragments , Walter Benjamin's Moscow Diary , Gerard de Nerval's Selected Writings and Henri Michaux's Emergences/Resurgences .         Manthia Diawara, 2003   We Won't Budge: An African Exile in the World (Basic Civitas Books, 2003)   Diawara\u2019s provocative, highly readable memoir draws on his personal journeys, as well as those of friends and relatives in Africa, Europe, and the U. S., to open up the contemporary arguments about identity and politics. In the first chapter, he's visiting his Mali hometown, and he can't wait to leave. In New York, he misses \"home.\" On sabbatical in Paris, he's furious at the racism that makes him a marginalized exotic, even as he separates himself from the tradition that includes polygamy and female circumcision. Far from self-importance and didacticism, he keeps switching sides to reveal the good and bad of assimilation versus cultural roots. Like Ariel Dorfman and other fine immigrant writers, Diawara shows that loss is necessary and that you can't go home again.         Timothy Reiss, 2003   Mirages of the Self: Patterns of Personhood in Ancient and Early Modern Europe (Stanford University Press, 2003)    Mirages of the Self argues that in ancient and early modern Europe individual subjects were defined by the social and biological spheres in which they were embedded, not by an independent free will. Timothy Reiss uses the idea of passibility (from patior, to endure) to sum up this idea of being acted upon. He also argues that before and through Rene Descartes the \"selfe\" (so spelled to distinguish the earlier sense) never had the modern meaning of independent agency. For Reiss, the modern understanding of the self derived not exactly from Descartes but strong misreadings of his work.         Avital Ronell, 2003   Stupidity (University of Illinois Press, 2003)   In \"Stupidity\" Avital Ronell explores the fading empire of cognition, modulating stupidity into idiocy, puerility, and the figure of the ridiculous philosopher instituted by Kant. Drawing on a range of writers including Dostoevsky, Schlegel, Musil, and Wordsworth, \"Stupidity\" investigates ignorance, dumbfounded-ness, and the limits of reason.         Richard Sieburth (ed), 2003   Editor, Ezra Pound: Poems and Translations (New York: Library of America, 2003)   For decades, readers have patched together the portions of Pound's oeuvre that interested them via the myriad New Directions editions, some of which are now out of print. Poems and Translations, is a collection of nearly everything that Pound wrote that could be called a poem or translation.         Richard Sieburth (ed), 2003   Editor, The Pisan Cantos by Ezra Pound (New York: New Directions, 2003)   Pound wrote these poems in 1945 while incarcerated by the occupying U.S. Army near Pisa, Italy, and awaiting transport back to the United States to stand trial for treason. Despite Pound's political stature, the Library of Congress awarded the 11 pieces the 1948 Bollingen Prize. These poems generally are included in Pound's overall epic The Cantos but here are broken out and annotated by scholar Sieburth, who also provides an introduction to the work and to Pound.         Richard Sieburth (tr), 2003   Translator, The Fullness of Time: Poems by Gershom Scholem (Jerusalem: Ibis Editions, 2003)   One of the greatest scholars of the twentieth century, Gershom Scholem virtually created the subject of Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism is it serious area Of Study. His influence has been felt far beyond the confines of the academy, and extends into the realm of the arts. Literature played a critical part in Scholem's own life. This bilingual volume in English and German gathers together the best of his poems for the first time. It contains dark, shockingly prescient poems about Zionism, parodies of German and Jewish philosophers, and poems to other writers, including a series of powerful lyrics to his close friend Walter Benjamin.         Ulrich Baer (ed), 2002   Editor, 110 Stories: New York Writes After September 11 (New York University Press, 2002)   In 110 Stories: New York Writes After September 11 , Ulrich Baer gathers a multi-hued range of voices that chronicle, with vivid immediacy and heightened imagination, the shock and loss suffered in September 2001. From a stunning lineup of 110 writers who represent New York at its most imaginative, these stories give readers the very shape and texture of a city in crisis, a glimpse of how things would develop in the aftermath, and the external and internal damage that the city and its inhabitants absorbed in a few unforgettable hours that would set the world's course for years to come.         Daniel Javitch (ed), 2002   Editor, Baldesar Castiglione\u2019s The Book of the Courtier (New York: Norton and Company, 2002)    The Book of the Courtier (1528) is a series of fictional conversations by courtiers of the Duke of Urbino that take place in 1507, when Baldesar Castiglione was himself attach\u00e9 to the Duke. Today, The Book of the Courtier remains the most illuminating account of court life and its culture in the Renaissance and of what it took to be the \u201cPerfect Courtier\u201d and \u201cCourt Lady.\u201d The text of this edition is Charles Singletons\u2019 translation. It is accompanied by the detailed annotations of both translator and editor.         Timothy Reiss (ed), 2002   Editor, Sisyphus and Eldorado: Magical and Other Realisms in Caribbean Literature (Africa World Press, 2nd edition, 2002)   This book investigates \u201ccultural instruments,\u201d meaning normative forms of analysis and practice that are central to Western culture. It explores their history from antiquity to the early Enlightenment and their use and reworking by different cultures, moving from Europe to Africa and the Americas, especially the Caribbean, in the process giving close readings of a wide range of authors.         Timothy Reiss, 2002   Against Autonomy: Global Dialectics of Cultural Exchange (Stanford University Press, 2002)   This book investigates \u201ccultural instruments,\u201d meaning normative forms of analysis and practice that are central to Western culture. It explores their history from antiquity to the early Enlightenment and their use and reworking by different cultures, moving from Europe to Africa and the Americas, especially the Caribbean, in the process giving close readings of a wide range of authors.         Mark Sanders, 2002   Complicities: The Intellectual and Apartheid (Duke University Press, 2002)      Complicities explores the complicated \u2013 even contradictory \u2013 position of the intellectual who takes a stand against political policies and ideologies. Sanders argues that intellectuals cannot avoid some degree of complicity in what they oppose and that responsibility can only be achieved with their acknowledgment of this complicity. He examines the roles of South African intellectuals by looking at the works of a number of key figures \u2013 both supporters and opponents of apartheid.         Kamau Braithwaite, 2001   Ancestors (New York: New Directions, 2001)   Ancestors recasts three of Brathwaite\u2019s previous works --Mother Poem, Sun Poem and X/Self-- by stressing as strongly as possible the spoken aspects of the text (thereby allowing regional and local dialects to threaten the homogenizing tendencies of \"proper\" English), cladding them in jagged breaks, computerized glyphs, \"Sycorax video style\" type, extended puns and unorthodox spellings: \"cause no bright/ man cyaaan be// faddah to faddah to faddah/ to sun// if e nevvah get chance/ to the son// light.\" Extensive passages describe boys fighting, men fishing, women cleaning and adolescents flirting, but at the same time Brathwaite sketches a vast, economically determined history encompassing the Caribbean, Africa, Europe and the Middle East--as if the shadows of Prospero, Caliban and Miranda extended from the plantation (a frequent setting) across the globe, fiercely throwing exploitation, misery, loneliness, joy, celebration, dignity and humanity into bold, intensely detailed relief.         Jacques Lezra (ed), 2001   Editor, Suplemento al Tesoro de la Lengua Espanola Castellana (Madrid: Ediciones Polifemo, 2001)         Timothy Reiss (ed), 2001   Editor, For the Geography of a Soul: Emerging Perspectives on Kamau Brathwaite (Africa World Press, Inc., 2001)   This important new work on Kamau Brathwaite includes work on and inspired by his writing, recognizing the power and influence of his poetry and other creative work, historical research and cultural and literary criticism. The collection includes major new essays on Brathwaite's creative writing, new poetry and fiction by writers reflecting on his influential importance in their work, new historiographical research and commentary echoing his preoccupations and setting Brathwaite himself in this context, and three memoirs by major Caribbean figures close to him. Also included is the fullest bibliography to date of Brathwaite's work and the increasing writing on it.         Ulrich Baer, 2000   Remnants of Song: Trauma and the Experience of Modernity in Charles Baudelaire and Paul Celan (Stanford University Press, 2000)   Drawing on trauma studies and Holocaust research, Remnants of Song demonstrates that the act of engaging with a poem on its own terms may serve as an important model for an ethical response to the radical experiences of trauma.         Emily Apter, 1999   Continental Drift: From National Characters to Virtual Subjects (Chicago University Press, 1999)   From xenophobic appropriations of Joan of Arc to Afro-futurism and cyberpunk, the \"national\" characters of the colonial era often seem to be dissolving into postnational and virtual subjects. In Continental Drift , Emily Apter deftly analyzes the French colonial and postcolonial experience as a case study in the erosion of belief in national destiny and the emergence of technologically mediated citizenship.Among the many topics Apter explores are the fate of national literatures in an increasingly transnational literary climate; the volatile stakes of Albert Camus's life and reputation against the backdrop of Algerian civil strife; the use of literary and theatrical productions to \"script\" national character for the colonies; belly-dancing and aesthetic theory; and the impact of new media on colonial and postcolonial representation, from tourist photography to the videos of Digital Diaspora. Continental Drift advances debates not just in postcolonial studies, but also in gender, identity, and cultural studies; ethnography; psychoanalysis; and performance studies.         Richard Sieburth (ed), 1999   Editor, Gerard de Nerval \u2013 Selected Writings with introduction (New York: Penguin Books, 1999)   This selection of writings \u2013 the first such comprehensive gathering to appear in English \u2013 provides an overview of Nerval\u2019s work as a poet, belletrist, short-story writer and autobiographer.         Manthia Diawara, 1998   In Search of Africa (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1998)   Diawara traveled to his native land in 1996 on a double mission: while making a documentary on the life of the Guinean freedom fighter and dictator Sekou Toure, he also set out to find a childhood friend. He is able to see Guinea with a nostalgia that doesn't turn a blind eye to the nation's faults, pointing out what needs to be done without falling prey to \"Afro-pessimism.\" He painfully recounts how he and his family were forced to leave Guinea and how the country sank into a Marxist-oriented dictatorial nightmare. While not overlooking the horrible historical impact of the slave trade and European colonialism, Diawara also blames internal corruption and dangerous African ethnic customs, like female genital mutilation, for his country's underdevelopment. Ultimately, however, he remains confident that this people will one day ascend to their full political, economic, and cultural potential.         Jacques Lezra, 1997   Unspeakable Subjects: The Genealogy of the Event in Early Modern Europe (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997)   In Unspeakable Subjects , Jacques Lezra explores the origins, the nature, and the \u201cconsequences\u201d of an essential theme in post-modern critical discourse: the \u201cincommensurability\u201d between materiality and the aesthetic principles that inform history, between accidents of nature and their \u201csublimation\u201d in language as \u201cevents.\u201d Lezra's central chapters focus on Descartes's Second Meditation (chapter 2), Cervantes's Don Quixote (chapters 3 and 4), and Shakespeare's Measure for Measure (chapter 5). In these and other texts contemporary to them, Lezra explores the divergence between language as rhetorical strategy and truth. The scope of the book, however, reaches much farther, from Lucretius, Aristotle, and Plato to Freud, Derrida, Foucault and Lacan, embracing in-between writings by a host of the main figures of the Western intellectual tradition.         Kristin Ross, 1996   Fast Cars, Clean Bodies: Decolonization and the Reordering of French Culture (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1996)    Fast Cars, Clean Bodies examines the crucial decade from Dien Bien Phu to the mid-1960s when France shifted rapidly from an agrarian, insular, and empire-oriented society to a decolonized, Americanized, and fully industrial one. In this analysis of a startling cultural transformation Ross finds the contradictions of the period embedded in its various commodities and cultural artifacts - automobiles, washing machines, women's magazines, film, popular fiction, even structuralism - as well as in the practices that shape, determine, and delimit their uses.         Manthia Diawara, 1992   African Cinema: Politics and Culture (Indiana University Press, 1992)   Drawing on political science, economics, history, and cultural studies, Diawara provides an insider's account of the development and current status of African cinema. He discusses such issues as film production and distribution, and film aesthetics from the colonial period to the present.         Daniel Javitch, 1991   Proclaiming a Classic: The Canonization of Orlando Furioso (Princeton University Press, 1991)   In this original scholarly study, Daniel Javitch isolates the forces of the Renaissance cultural marketplace \u2013 the printing house, humanist education, neo-Aristotelian critical orthodoxy \u2013 that led to the canonization of the bestselling Orlando Furisoso the first modern \u201cclassic.\u201d         Kristin Ross (tr), 1991   Translator, The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation by Jacquse Ranci\u00e8re (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991)   This book examines the historical development of English in the United States, in how it became a central discipline in the humanities, and in what the ideological affiliations of literature and literary study might be. It is strikingly original, however, in that instead of focusing on the subject matter of English (e.g., the canon or critical positions), it examines precisely how work time is spent within English departments, as well as what circulates through them, and to where.         Emily Apter, 1990   Feminizing the Fetish: Psychoanalysis and Narrative Obsession in Turn-of-the Century France (Cornell University Press, 1990)   This interdisciplinary study of turn-of-the-century French authors who have combined medical observation with an interest in writing literary chronicles of deviant behavior\u2014what Apter, borrowing from Freud, calls \"pathography\"\u2014resists simple classification. Apter's inquiry into the ideological underpinnings of the fetishistic \"sensibility\" leads her into the fields of cultural history, psychoanalysis, the history of science, economic theory, feminism, and anthropology. The result is a theory of feminine fetishism designed to mobilize the critical potential dormant in the concept of fetishism but hitherto impeded by its customary assimilation to a logic of phallocentrism.
