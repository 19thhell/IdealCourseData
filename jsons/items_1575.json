MARC; French.      Prof. Evelyn B. (Timmie) Vitz           Short description:  There is a rich tradition of stories  told in song throughout medieval and early modern Europe, from Scandinavia down  to Iberia, from England and Scotland in the West to Greece (and beyond). This  course focuses on high points from this tradition, which is full of fairies,  trolls, and devils; knights (some of them outlandish) and strong women; love  and adventure, violence and death. French, Spanish and Italian songs will  receive special emphasis, along with the vibrant tradition from the British  Isles. We will also examine the enduring appeal of the sung ballad in the  modern period, in contemporary performances by major artists.
