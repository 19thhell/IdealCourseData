Administration of Policy   Appendix A: Definitions  Appendix B: University Intellectual Property Agreement            Preamble   The mission of New York University (\u201cNYU\u201d or the \u201cUniversity\u201d) includes the provision and promotion of education and research and the provision of patient and other clinical services. This mission is supported by well-established academic values and practices, including, among others: academic freedom; promotion of excellence and innovation in teaching and research; support of the ability of faculty and research staff to publish, share information, collaborate in research activities, innovate and develop technologies that benefit the public; and support of students in full participation in these and other educational activities.   This Statement of Policy on Intellectual Property includes a Patent Policy , a Copyright Policy , and a Tangible Research Property Policy . It replaces the University\u2019s Statement of Policy on Patents, as approved on November 26, 1956 and amended through December 12, 1983; the Statement of Policy on Copyrights, as approved on January 24, 1972; the Statement of Policy on Computer Software Copyrights, as approved on June 5, 1989; and the Policy on Tangible Research Property, effective March 1, 2010. This Statement of Policy is subject to change at any time and from time to time, with the approval of the Board of Trustees of the University.   In certain cases, Inventions may be closely associated with non-patentable Copyrightable Works and/or Tangible Research Property and/or Research Data. Unless otherwise determined by the Provost (the Executive Vice President for Health in the case of the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing), the Patent Policy applies to non-patentable Copyrightable Works and/or Tangible Research Property and/or Research Data closely associated with an Invention.   This Statement of Policy on Intellectual Property should be considered together with other pertinent NYU policies, including the NYU Policy on Academic Conflict of Interest and Conflict of Commitment, the NYU Policy on Retention of and Access to Research Data, the Guidelines for Sponsored Research, and the Statement of Policy on Photocopying Copyrighted Materials, which are available at www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance.html .   This policy applies, among other things, to all research and other sponsored projects conducted by or under the auspices of NYU, whether funded by a US sponsoring agency, NYU or another funding source. It is the policy of NYU to comply with requirements imposed by a US sponsoring agency and by US law, including but not limited to the Bayh-Dole Act, and with requirements to which NYU has duly entered into or agreed to in connection with other funding sources and collaborators. This policy is believed to be in compliance with applicable US sponsoring agency requirements and US law. To the extent there is any issue about whether this policy wholly complies with applicable US sponsoring agency requirements and US law or with requirements to which NYU has agreed in connection with other funding sources and collaborators, it is to be interpreted to assure compliance. Additionally, research must be conducted in accordance with NYU policies, including this policy and the policies of a relevant School. Each member of the University Community is responsible for assuring his or her compliance with the requirements applicable to such person\u2019s specific research and other sponsored projects.   Certain defined terms used throughout this Statement of Policy on Intellectual Property are set forth in Appendix A.   The electronic version of this policy will, from time to time, be accompanied by \u201cFrequently Asked Questions,\u201d which provide further guidance regarding a variety of practical situations.

The Patent Policy guides the University Community in disclosing and managing inventions made at or under the auspices of NYU in a manner consistent with NYU\u2019s commitment to the public good, including: promoting research and scholarship, and facilitating the development, dissemination and commercialization of its inventions. The Copyright Policy identifies the situations in which copyrightable works may be created at or under the auspices of NYU, defines ownership and license rights for such works, and expresses NYU\u2019s commitment to disseminate and commercialize its copyrightable works consistent with the public good. The Tangible Research Property Policy addresses the ownership, distribution and commercialization of tangible items produced in the course of NYU\u2019s research, clinical or other activities, consistent with the public good.                                            Who needs to know this policy                                        This policy applies to all members of the \u201cUniversity Community.\u201d As used in this policy, \u201cUniversity Community\u201d means: NYU faculty, including visiting faculty; researchers, including persons participating in research at or under the auspices of NYU; employees; professional staff, including medical, dental and nursing staff; volunteers; fellows, trainees and post-doctoral appointees; students; and any other persons involved in the creation of Inventions, Copyrightable Works and/or Tangible Research Property at or under the auspices of NYU, including consultants, vendors and contractors, irrespective of the source of funding for the creation.

Administration of Policy   Appendix A: Definitions  Appendix B: University Intellectual Property Agreement            Preamble   The mission of New York University (\u201cNYU\u201d or the \u201cUniversity\u201d) includes the provision and promotion of education and research and the provision of patient and other clinical services. This mission is supported by well-established academic values and practices, including, among others: academic freedom; promotion of excellence and innovation in teaching and research; support of the ability of faculty and research staff to publish, share information, collaborate in research activities, innovate and develop technologies that benefit the public; and support of students in full participation in these and other educational activities.   This Statement of Policy on Intellectual Property includes a Patent Policy , a Copyright Policy , and a Tangible Research Property Policy . It replaces the University\u2019s Statement of Policy on Patents, as approved on November 26, 1956 and amended through December 12, 1983; the Statement of Policy on Copyrights, as approved on January 24, 1972; the Statement of Policy on Computer Software Copyrights, as approved on June 5, 1989; and the Policy on Tangible Research Property, effective March 1, 2010. This Statement of Policy is subject to change at any time and from time to time, with the approval of the Board of Trustees of the University.   In certain cases, Inventions may be closely associated with non-patentable Copyrightable Works and/or Tangible Research Property and/or Research Data. Unless otherwise determined by the Provost (the Executive Vice President for Health in the case of the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing), the Patent Policy applies to non-patentable Copyrightable Works and/or Tangible Research Property and/or Research Data closely associated with an Invention.   This Statement of Policy on Intellectual Property should be considered together with other pertinent NYU policies, including the NYU Policy on Academic Conflict of Interest and Conflict of Commitment, the NYU Policy on Retention of and Access to Research Data, the Guidelines for Sponsored Research, and the Statement of Policy on Photocopying Copyrighted Materials, which are available at www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance.html .   This policy applies, among other things, to all research and other sponsored projects conducted by or under the auspices of NYU, whether funded by a US sponsoring agency, NYU or another funding source. It is the policy of NYU to comply with requirements imposed by a US sponsoring agency and by US law, including but not limited to the Bayh-Dole Act, and with requirements to which NYU has duly entered into or agreed to in connection with other funding sources and collaborators. This policy is believed to be in compliance with applicable US sponsoring agency requirements and US law. To the extent there is any issue about whether this policy wholly complies with applicable US sponsoring agency requirements and US law or with requirements to which NYU has agreed in connection with other funding sources and collaborators, it is to be interpreted to assure compliance. Additionally, research must be conducted in accordance with NYU policies, including this policy and the policies of a relevant School. Each member of the University Community is responsible for assuring his or her compliance with the requirements applicable to such person\u2019s specific research and other sponsored projects.   Certain defined terms used throughout this Statement of Policy on Intellectual Property are set forth in Appendix A.   The electronic version of this policy will, from time to time, be accompanied by \u201cFrequently Asked Questions,\u201d which provide further guidance regarding a variety of practical situations.

The Patent Policy guides the University Community in disclosing and managing inventions made at or under the auspices of NYU in a manner consistent with NYU\u2019s commitment to the public good, including: promoting research and scholarship, and facilitating the development, dissemination and commercialization of its inventions. The Copyright Policy identifies the situations in which copyrightable works may be created at or under the auspices of NYU, defines ownership and license rights for such works, and expresses NYU\u2019s commitment to disseminate and commercialize its copyrightable works consistent with the public good. The Tangible Research Property Policy addresses the ownership, distribution and commercialization of tangible items produced in the course of NYU\u2019s research, clinical or other activities, consistent with the public good.                                            Who needs to know this policy                                        This policy applies to all members of the \u201cUniversity Community.\u201d As used in this policy, \u201cUniversity Community\u201d means: NYU faculty, including visiting faculty; researchers, including persons participating in research at or under the auspices of NYU; employees; professional staff, including medical, dental and nursing staff; volunteers; fellows, trainees and post-doctoral appointees; students; and any other persons involved in the creation of Inventions, Copyrightable Works and/or Tangible Research Property at or under the auspices of NYU, including consultants, vendors and contractors, irrespective of the source of funding for the creation.

Students then can select from a rich menu of advanced courses and seminars. For example, students can study patent litigation issues with one of the country\u2019s premier patent litigators or learn about international patent law from Professor Rochelle Dreyfuss, one of the drafters of the American Law Institute\u2019s Project on Intellectual Property: Principles Governing Jurisdiction, Choice of Law, and Judgments in Transnational Disputes. Some courses, such as Patent Litigation, Advanced Copyright, Advanced Trademark and Advertising Law, and International Intellectual Property Law, dig more deeply into the three basic forms of intellectual property. Others, such as Entertainment Law, Art Law, Fashion Law, and Internet and Business Law for Technology Companies, investigate the way that IP law plays out in particular business contexts. Students also explore the impact of law on innovation and information in courses and seminars on topics such as traditional knowledge, media law, innovation without IP, information privacy, electronic commerce law, and First Amendment rights of expression.   Antitrust and competition policy   Antitrust looks to those laws that structure and control marketplace competition, creating incentives to innovate while at the same time controlling monopolies and restrictive trade practices.   The antitrust and competition policy curriculum begins with the introductory course in US antitrust law. Students can then select from a diverse group of advanced courses that focus on four different areas related to competition policy. The first area is economics, and includes Professor Daniel Rubinfeld\u2019s antitrust law and economics course and his course in quantitative methods.

The third area is international, which includes Professor Eleanor Fox\u2019s courses in European competition law and comparative competition law. The fourth area is practice-oriented, featuring courses such as Antitrust Issues in the Distribution of Goods and Services, taught by a leading antitrust specialist.   The Colloquium on Innovation Policy   For more than a decade, the capstone of the study of innovation at NYU has been the Colloquium on Innovation Policy . Co-taught each spring semester by two NYU faculty members, the colloquium provides students with an opportunity to explore in depth the current work of invited scholars from a variety of universities who examine innovation policy from various disciplines, including law, economics, history, psychology, sociology, business, and the humanities. The colloquium draws attendees from the New York area's innovation policy community: academics from other institutions, intellectual property and antitrust practitioners, and businesspeople. Our students are the heart of the colloquium, however, critiquing the papers that the outside speakers present, and preparing and presenting research papers of their own.
