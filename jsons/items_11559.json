Religion does not function,  however, simply as unchanging content while media names the ways that content  is formed. Instead shifts in media  technique, from ritual innovations to the invention of printing through TV and  to the internet, also shape religious practice.   In this course, we are interested in gathering theoretical tools for  understanding the form and politics of this mutual dialectic.          Students will analyze how human hearing, vision and the  performing body have been used historically to express and maintain religious  life through music, voice, images, words and rituals. Time will also be spent  focusing on more recent electronic media such as cassette, film, television,  video, and the internet. Students will  consider, among other things: religious memory, both embodied and outsourced in  other media; the role of TV in the rise of the Hindu Right; the material  culture of Buddhism (icons, relics, sutras); religion and commodification; film  as religious experience; and Christian Evangelical media."}]}]
