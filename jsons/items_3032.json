The U.S. Postal Service just issued a Harvey Milk stamp. Laverne Cox is on the cover of Time magazine. Michael Sam kissed his boyfriend on national television when he was drafted into the NFL last month. The National Parks Service just launched an initiative to mark prominent places and events from LGBT American history.   To anyone who\u2019s been paying attention, it should be obvious that our country has undergone rapid, sweeping cultural change over the past 4 or 8 or 12 years regarding how we think about gay rights. Gallup poll data shows that 58% of Americans believe that gay and lesbian relations are morally acceptable, up from 38% in 2002, and 54% now believe that same-sex marriages should be recognized by the law, with same rights as traditional marriages, up from 37% in 2005. And a whopping 90% of Americans support protections from discrimination for gay and lesbian employees.   But what\u2019s driving the trend? And will it last?                             Patrick Egan         Divining the answers to those questions can be a little like reading tealeaves. So for some concrete, fact-based insights, NYU Stories turned to Patrick J. Egan , a stats-minded politics and public policy professor who\u2019s spent a lot of time studying fluctuations in public opinion. A leading researcher on what led voters to pass Proposition 8 in California, he\u2019s also the author of a book on issue ownership, or the tendency of voters to identify certain causes with certain political parties.   Egan dates the start of the move toward widely held liberal attitudes on gay rights to the 1970s\u2014but notes that the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s dampened what might otherwise have been a quicker progression. The pace of change picked up in the \u201990s (after antiviral therapies began to curtail the AIDS death toll, Egan points out), stalled briefly with a conservative backlash to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision (striking down all remaining state laws that criminalized gay sex) in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, and accelerated rapidly in recent years, with an indisputable majority of Americans now even supporting adoption rights for gay people. \u201cIt\u2019s really been quite an amazing change,\u201d Egan says, \u201cand one whose swiftness we hardly ever see in aggregate public opinion trends in the U.S.\u201d   Two primary factors are driving the shift. One has to do with the overwhelming support of gay rights by members of the millennial generation, who are joining the electorate as older voters who hold more conservative views on the issue die off; experts like Egan call this effect \u201ccohort replacement.\u201d In other cases, Americans are simply changing their minds\u2014a phenomenon reflected in panel data collected from individuals surveyed repeatedly over time.   While we\u2019ll never know exactly what\u2019s swaying individual hearts and minds, the evidence suggests that some Americans\u2014particularly Democrats\u2014who\u2019ve moved in favor of gay rights over the past 10 years may have taken their cues from political leaders. \u201cIn political science,\u201d Egan explains, \u201cprobably the number one source of attitude change on any issue\u2014from taxes to the Iraq war\u2014is what elites say about it.\u201d And among the Democratic party elite, the shift has been dramatic: In the 2004 Democratic primary, Egan points out, the controversial question was which candidate would support civil unions for gay people; looking ahead to the 2016 race, all of the Democratic presidential candidates will support same-sex marriage. Of course, politicians adjust their positions to the whims of public opinion, too\u2014often leading, as in the months approaching President Obama\u2019s public endorsement of marriage equality , to a kind of game of \u201cchicken.\u201d   And these days, Republicans are also getting in on the act: Egan points to a \u201csmall but substantial group\u201d of leaders\u2014from former vice president Dick Cheney to Ohio Senator Rob Portman and Mary Bono, a former Congresswoman from California\u2014who are \u201cbreaking the party\u2019s Orthodoxy\u201d by speaking out in favor of gay rights. In February, Republican Arizona governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed business owners to refuse service to gays and lesbians on religious grounds. At the same time, Egan says, the party\u2014like the country at large\u2014is split along generational lines, with young Republicans beginning to embrace same-sex marriage. It\u2019s a rift, he predicts, that will eventually lead the party to abandon opposition to gay marriage as one of its signature issues.   If there\u2019s a precedent for all of this, it\u2019s the decades-long progression toward near universal acceptance of interracial marriage: In fact, the map of where interracial marriage was legal in 1951 is strikingly similar to the map of where same-sex marriage is legal today. \u201cThe parallel has a lot of intellectual force and also moral gravity,\u201d Egan says. \u201cAre you going to legally recognize these people who are willing to make a lifelong commitment to one another, or are you going to use the force of law to render that commitment null and void?\u201d   While it\u2019s inspiring to witness a growing number gay marriage bans going the way of anti-miscegenation laws, it\u2019s also curious that our political geography\u2014as represented in those near-identical maps\u2014has changed so little in more than 60 years. When asked why the states that opposed interracial marriage are the same ones where marriage equality struggles to gain traction today, Egan points to two demographic factors that make a difference when it comes to tolerance: religiosity and educational attainment. Over 60 years, most places haven\u2019t changed much on those variables: States where populations tend to support gay marriage (like they did interracial marriage) boast higher levels of educational attainment and lower levels of religiosity than those that oppose it.   And as for millennials? Compared to their parents, they\u2019re less invested in religion\u2014and in institutions of all kinds\u2014and they\u2019re the most highly educated generation in U.S. history. Add to that the fact that a growing number of religious institutions have shifted on gay rights issues\u2014even the Mormon Church has withdrawn its once generous financial support from groups opposing gay marriage\u2014and it would seem that we\u2019re about to reach some kind of tipping point.   That\u2019s not to suggest the going will be easy: \u201cIn socially conservative states like Alabama or Nebraska or Wyoming, it\u2019s going to take a very, very long time, if trends persist, to get majorities on gay marriage,\u201d Egan says. And then there\u2019s a question of a national standard that would allow married gay couples to be recognized in every state. Loving v. Virginia , the 1967 Supreme Court decision that invalidated legal prohibitions against interracial marriage, came at a time when most states had already abandoned their miscegenation laws. \u201cIt may be that a similar story will take place for gay marriage. Does the Supreme Court want to impose a 50-state standard now, or much later when gay-marriage bans are seen more as an anachronism?\u201d   Egan predicts that in 20 years, national law and policy on gay rights will resemble that of Massachusetts today: Same-sex marriage will likely be legal and recognized throughout the land, and there will be laws in place to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination in a variety of realms. And yet as any child of the civil rights era can attest, the culture often lags behind the law. Racial prejudice did not end with laws that prohibited discrimination, and segregation in housing and education persists, to some degree, even to this day. Likewise, Egan muses, if you \u201casked gay people in Massachusetts where they\u2019d feel comfortable holding their spouse\u2019s hand, they could probably identify only about 6 blocks within the whole state.\u201d   \u2014Eileen Reynolds   Follow Patrick Egan on Twitter .

The U.S. Postal Service just issued a Harvey Milk stamp. Laverne Cox is on the cover of Time magazine. Michael Sam kissed his boyfriend on national television when he was drafted into the NFL last month. The National Parks Service just launched an initiative to mark prominent places and events from LGBT American history.   To anyone who\u2019s been paying attention, it should be obvious that our country has undergone rapid, sweeping cultural change over the past 4 or 8 or 12 years regarding how we think about gay rights. Gallup poll data shows that 58% of Americans believe that gay and lesbian relations are morally acceptable, up from 38% in 2002, and 54% now believe that same-sex marriages should be recognized by the law, with same rights as traditional marriages, up from 37% in 2005. And a whopping 90% of Americans support protections from discrimination for gay and lesbian employees.   But what\u2019s driving the trend? And will it last?                             Patrick Egan         Divining the answers to those questions can be a little like reading tealeaves. So for some concrete, fact-based insights, NYU Stories turned to Patrick J. Egan , a stats-minded politics and public policy professor who\u2019s spent a lot of time studying fluctuations in public opinion. A leading researcher on what led voters to pass Proposition 8 in California, he\u2019s also the author of a book on issue ownership, or the tendency of voters to identify certain causes with certain political parties.   Egan dates the start of the move toward widely held liberal attitudes on gay rights to the 1970s\u2014but notes that the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s dampened what might otherwise have been a quicker progression. The pace of change picked up in the \u201990s (after antiviral therapies began to curtail the AIDS death toll, Egan points out), stalled briefly with a conservative backlash to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision (striking down all remaining state laws that criminalized gay sex) in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, and accelerated rapidly in recent years, with an indisputable majority of Americans now even supporting adoption rights for gay people. \u201cIt\u2019s really been quite an amazing change,\u201d Egan says, \u201cand one whose swiftness we hardly ever see in aggregate public opinion trends in the U.S.\u201d   Two primary factors are driving the shift. One has to do with the overwhelming support of gay rights by members of the millennial generation, who are joining the electorate as older voters who hold more conservative views on the issue die off; experts like Egan call this effect \u201ccohort replacement.\u201d In other cases, Americans are simply changing their minds\u2014a phenomenon reflected in panel data collected from individuals surveyed repeatedly over time.   While we\u2019ll never know exactly what\u2019s swaying individual hearts and minds, the evidence suggests that some Americans\u2014particularly Democrats\u2014who\u2019ve moved in favor of gay rights over the past 10 years may have taken their cues from political leaders. \u201cIn political science,\u201d Egan explains, \u201cprobably the number one source of attitude change on any issue\u2014from taxes to the Iraq war\u2014is what elites say about it.\u201d And among the Democratic party elite, the shift has been dramatic: In the 2004 Democratic primary, Egan points out, the controversial question was which candidate would support civil unions for gay people; looking ahead to the 2016 race, all of the Democratic presidential candidates will support same-sex marriage. Of course, politicians adjust their positions to the whims of public opinion, too\u2014often leading, as in the months approaching President Obama\u2019s public endorsement of marriage equality , to a kind of game of \u201cchicken.\u201d   And these days, Republicans are also getting in on the act: Egan points to a \u201csmall but substantial group\u201d of leaders\u2014from former vice president Dick Cheney to Ohio Senator Rob Portman and Mary Bono, a former Congresswoman from California\u2014who are \u201cbreaking the party\u2019s Orthodoxy\u201d by speaking out in favor of gay rights. In February, Republican Arizona governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed business owners to refuse service to gays and lesbians on religious grounds. At the same time, Egan says, the party\u2014like the country at large\u2014is split along generational lines, with young Republicans beginning to embrace same-sex marriage. It\u2019s a rift, he predicts, that will eventually lead the party to abandon opposition to gay marriage as one of its signature issues.   If there\u2019s a precedent for all of this, it\u2019s the decades-long progression toward near universal acceptance of interracial marriage: In fact, the map of where interracial marriage was legal in 1951 is strikingly similar to the map of where same-sex marriage is legal today. \u201cThe parallel has a lot of intellectual force and also moral gravity,\u201d Egan says. \u201cAre you going to legally recognize these people who are willing to make a lifelong commitment to one another, or are you going to use the force of law to render that commitment null and void?\u201d   While it\u2019s inspiring to witness a growing number gay marriage bans going the way of anti-miscegenation laws, it\u2019s also curious that our political geography\u2014as represented in those near-identical maps\u2014has changed so little in more than 60 years. When asked why the states that opposed interracial marriage are the same ones where marriage equality struggles to gain traction today, Egan points to two demographic factors that make a difference when it comes to tolerance: religiosity and educational attainment. Over 60 years, most places haven\u2019t changed much on those variables: States where populations tend to support gay marriage (like they did interracial marriage) boast higher levels of educational attainment and lower levels of religiosity than those that oppose it.   And as for millennials? Compared to their parents, they\u2019re less invested in religion\u2014and in institutions of all kinds\u2014and they\u2019re the most highly educated generation in U.S. history. Add to that the fact that a growing number of religious institutions have shifted on gay rights issues\u2014even the Mormon Church has withdrawn its once generous financial support from groups opposing gay marriage\u2014and it would seem that we\u2019re about to reach some kind of tipping point.   That\u2019s not to suggest the going will be easy: \u201cIn socially conservative states like Alabama or Nebraska or Wyoming, it\u2019s going to take a very, very long time, if trends persist, to get majorities on gay marriage,\u201d Egan says. And then there\u2019s a question of a national standard that would allow married gay couples to be recognized in every state. Loving v. Virginia , the 1967 Supreme Court decision that invalidated legal prohibitions against interracial marriage, came at a time when most states had already abandoned their miscegenation laws. \u201cIt may be that a similar story will take place for gay marriage. Does the Supreme Court want to impose a 50-state standard now, or much later when gay-marriage bans are seen more as an anachronism?\u201d   Egan predicts that in 20 years, national law and policy on gay rights will resemble that of Massachusetts today: Same-sex marriage will likely be legal and recognized throughout the land, and there will be laws in place to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination in a variety of realms. And yet as any child of the civil rights era can attest, the culture often lags behind the law. Racial prejudice did not end with laws that prohibited discrimination, and segregation in housing and education persists, to some degree, even to this day. Likewise, Egan muses, if you \u201casked gay people in Massachusetts where they\u2019d feel comfortable holding their spouse\u2019s hand, they could probably identify only about 6 blocks within the whole state.\u201d   \u2014Eileen Reynolds   Follow Patrick Egan on Twitter .

Since then, graduates of the program have been considered fully qualified psychologists with specialized training in counseling and eligible for licensure by the state. The Counseling Psychology program has been fully accredited since 1981 by the American Psychological Association, Office of Program Consultation and Accreditation, 750 First Street, NE, Washington DC 20002-4242 (202-336-5979). Questions related to the program's accreditation status may be directed to this office. In 1989, the Department of Counselor Education and the Department of Educational Psychology were merged into the current Department of Applied Psychology.    The major philosophical principles underlying the doctoral program in Counseling Psychology at NYU Steinhardt are: 1) a focus on a developmental understanding of clients; 2) a commitment to a health and wellness model of intervention and research; 3) an appreciation of the gendered, cultural, class, and institutional context of people's lives as these affect both clients and counselors.    We consider these principles to be central to our definition of Counseling Psychology.    The goals of our program are to:       produce graduates who are knowledgeable regarding current clinical theory    produce graduates who understand adaptive and maladaptive human functioning across the lifespan    produce graduates who are prepared to function as multi-faceted and multi-skilled professionals in a wide range of roles as counseling psychologists    produce graduates whose professional identity is that of a counseling psychologist and who are able acquire additional knowledge appropriate to this specialty    produce graduates who have attained awareness, knowledge, skills, and attitudes to work effectively with, and conduct research, about the lives of individuals from diverse backgrounds, particularly in urban settings    produce graduates who have developed a high level of ethical sensitivity and behavior in their professional roles as researchers and practitioners    produce graduates who are knowledgeable about the research process and the creation of new knowledge       Read more about student admissions, outcomes, and other data.
