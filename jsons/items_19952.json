Students develop their academic writing skills in innovative First-Year Writing and Research Seminars , explore a variety of genres in Advanced Writing Courses , and experience writing beyond the classroom through the Gallatin Writing Program\u2019s diverse events, publications, and civic engagement projects.   Each year, the Gallatin Writing Program hosts multiple conferences and readings by faculty, students, and guests; educates and employs four undergraduates to serve as Peer Writing Assistants in the Writing Center ; publishes the Gallatin Review , a student-edited journal of student writing and visual art; and maintains Confluence , an online platform for writing, art, and research. The Writing Program also sponsors two major civic engagement projects, the Literacy Project , and Great World Texts . The Literacy Project includes opportunities to tutor at adult literacy sites, mentor at a public high school, and edit the Literacy Review , an annual publication that compiles the best writing by adults from about 50 countries. Through Great World Texts, Gallatin undergraduates mentor public high school students in the study of a canonical text.

Students develop their academic writing skills in innovative First-Year Writing and Research Seminars , explore a variety of genres in Advanced Writing Courses , and experience writing beyond the classroom through the Gallatin Writing Program\u2019s diverse events, publications, and civic engagement projects.   Each year, the Gallatin Writing Program hosts multiple conferences and readings by faculty, students, and guests; educates and employs four undergraduates to serve as Peer Writing Assistants in the Writing Center ; publishes the Gallatin Review , a student-edited journal of student writing and visual art; and maintains Confluence , an online platform for writing, art, and research. The Writing Program also sponsors two major civic engagement projects, the Literacy Project , and Great World Texts . The Literacy Project includes opportunities to tutor at adult literacy sites, mentor at a public high school, and edit the Literacy Review , an annual publication that compiles the best writing by adults from about 50 countries. Through Great World Texts, Gallatin undergraduates mentor public high school students in the study of a canonical text.

Students develop their academic writing skills in innovative First-Year Writing and Research Seminars , explore a variety of genres in Advanced Writing Courses , and experience writing beyond the classroom through the Gallatin Writing Program\u2019s diverse events, publications, and civic engagement projects.   Each year, the Gallatin Writing Program hosts multiple conferences and readings by faculty, students, and guests; educates and employs four undergraduates to serve as Peer Writing Assistants in the Writing Center ; publishes the Gallatin Review , a student-edited journal of student writing and visual art; and maintains Confluence , an online platform for writing, art, and research. The Writing Program also sponsors two major civic engagement projects, the Literacy Project , and Great World Texts . The Literacy Project includes opportunities to tutor at adult literacy sites, mentor at a public high school, and edit the Literacy Review , an annual publication that compiles the best writing by adults from about 50 countries. Through Great World Texts, Gallatin undergraduates mentor public high school students in the study of a canonical text.

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.
