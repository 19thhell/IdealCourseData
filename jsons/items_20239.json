I am planning to retake the DAT, but I have to wait 90 days. Will I be at a disadvantage if I retake the DAT in November or December?                               No, NYUCD accepts application materials and updates, including retakes of the DAT, throughout the application cycle, until the application deadline of February 2, 2015. Interviews are conducted from September through April.                                                                    Does NYUCD admit transfer students?                               Yes, on a space-available basis. Applicants must be in good academic standing at their current dental school and meet all other admission requirements. A supplemental application for admission is required. To request application materials, please contact the NYUCD Admissions Office at dental.admissions@nyu.edu . The deadline to apply is February 2, 2015.                                                                    Will NYUCD contact me when they receive my application?                               Yes, the Office of Admissions will contact applicants via email to confirm receipt of applications. Applicants can expect to be contacted by the Office of Admissions approximately 3-4 weeks after their application has been submitted through AADSAS.                                                                    How can I learn the status of my application for admission?                               An applicant's final status with the program is not reported until after December 2nd, at which time the status will be sent via postal mail. Please note that in order to protect the right to privacy, NYUCD's admissions officers are not able to provide an applicant's final status over email or telephone.                                                                    What kinds of opportunities does NYUCD offer for student outreach?                               Local Outreach: DDS students provide care aboard the Smiling Faces, Going Places mobile care van, which travels throughout New York City daily to provide comprehensive care to underserved public school children, and also at local senior centers.   Global Outreach: Each year, over 200 NYU dental students participate in outreach around the world. Students speak of being &quot;transformed&quot; by these experiences, which take place in Mexico, Nicaragua, Ecuador, India, Grenada, Honduras, Nepal, and many other areas around the world, including remote areas in Alaska, upstate New York, and rural Maine.

All second-year students have individual patient rosters, including multiple pediatric dentistry rotations.                                                              What kinds of research opportunities are available to DDS students?                               The opportunities for DDS student research support NYUCD\u2019s goal of educating dentists who are able to think for themselves, be intelligent users of research, able to critique it, and comfortable with the structure and syntax of modern biomedical science. NYUCD\u2019s term for such dentists is &quot;men and women of science.&quot;     Entering students have the opportunity to engage in an  eight-week summer research program even before they formally enter the DDS program through the Summer Research Experience.   DDS students, working closely with faculty mentors, present their research at national meetings as early as their first year in dental school and consistently win top national  prizes for their research.   The Annual Research Days, Student Table Clinic Competition, and Honors in Research course are all excellent  vehicles for students wishing to enrich their dental education experience through research training.
