The Jewish Community in Palestine Under Ottoman and British Rule    HBRJD-UA  188 4 points.    The growth of Jewish national aspirations in Europe from the 1880s led to an influx of Jews who wished to settle the land as farmers and to pursue Jewish economic autonomy within the Ottoman world. The occupation of Palestine by British forces and the British support for a Jewish National Home (Balfour Declaration) transformed Jewish expectations. Increasing waves of immigration began to change the demographic character of Palestine, and the Zionist movement now dominated Jewish life there. We examine the growth of the Jewish community, as well as cooperation and conflict with the Palestinian Arab population; the growth of Arab and Palestinian nationalism and the Arab response to both British rule and the growth of Jewish society; and the parallel development of Jewish demands for separatism and statehood. The  War of 1948    HBRJD-UA  189 Offered  every three years. 4 points.    The first Arab-Israeli war of 1948 still provokes multidimensional debates, in both academic and public circles.

For both, it is the formative event of their history. In recent decades, Israel's \"New Historians,\" alongside other researchers, have contributed to changes in the way historians, and even the Israeli public, see their past. We attempt to provide students with basic knowledge and analytical tools to understand what \"really happened,\" beyond narratives and memories.

Israeli  Politics in Comparative Perspective    HBRJD-UA  711 Offered  every two years. 4 points.    One  of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's  uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and  in its relationship to the international community.

Objective (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to  critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to  which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics  in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli  case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution.

The Jewish Community in Palestine Under Ottoman and British Rule    HBRJD-UA  188 4 points.    The growth of Jewish national aspirations in Europe from the 1880s led to an influx of Jews who wished to settle the land as farmers and to pursue Jewish economic autonomy within the Ottoman world. The occupation of Palestine by British forces and the British support for a Jewish National Home (Balfour Declaration) transformed Jewish expectations. Increasing waves of immigration began to change the demographic character of Palestine, and the Zionist movement now dominated Jewish life there. We examine the growth of the Jewish community, as well as cooperation and conflict with the Palestinian Arab population; the growth of Arab and Palestinian nationalism and the Arab response to both British rule and the growth of Jewish society; and the parallel development of Jewish demands for separatism and statehood. The  War of 1948    HBRJD-UA  189 Offered  every three years. 4 points.    The first Arab-Israeli war of 1948 still provokes multidimensional debates, in both academic and public circles.

For both, it is the formative event of their history.

Israeli  Politics in Comparative Perspective    HBRJD-UA  711 Offered  every two years. 4 points.    One  of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's  uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and  in its relationship to the international community. This widespread perception  of separateness readily contributes to and is at least partially constituted by  the state's history of strategic insecurity and political isolation in the  Middle East as well as its characteristic form of democratic governance.  Objective (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to  critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to  which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics  in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli  case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution.

Increasing waves of immigration began to change the demographic character of Palestine, and the Zionist movement now dominated Jewish life there.

Israeli  Politics in Comparative Perspective    HBRJD-UA  711 Offered  every two years. 4 points.    One  of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's  uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and  in its relationship to the international community. This widespread perception  of separateness readily contributes to and is at least partially constituted by  the state's history of strategic insecurity and political isolation in the  Middle East as well as its characteristic form of democratic governance.  Objective (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to  critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to  which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics  in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli  case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution. Attempts to address  the growing interest in comparative analysis of Middle Eastern politics, with a  focus on the State of Israel.
