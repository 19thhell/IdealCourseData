McDevitt, PhD   Overview   The department has a long history of academic performance with contributions to all programs of the College. Biomaterials play a fundamental role in most dental diagnostic and restorative procedures. The department\u2019s programs are enhanced by a long history of funded research and an extensively equipped research suite for biomaterials development and characterization, much of it centered around new materials, biological models, calcium phosphate chemistry, and investigations on hard tissue architecture and regeneration.                    meet our faculty Read More                    MS Program in Biomaterials Read More                    shared scientific core resources Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   The department\u2019s educational and research role is enhanced by        the M.S. Degree Program in Biomaterials and Biomimetics, offered in        collaboration with the NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science. This        provides the opportunity for dental graduate and postgraduate students        to work on a broad range of research projects in collaboration with        graduate students with materials and engineering backgrounds. The student        educational experience is also strengthened by interaction with visiting        scholars from other research institutions from around the world.                                                  First and Second Years                               The Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics contributes to the undergraduate       dental educational program with lectures and laboratory exercises that       are integrated into freshman and sophomore General Dentistry Simulation       Programs to provide timely presentation of biomaterials course content.                                                                     Third and Fourth Years                               These first two years programs are then enhanced by presentations integrated        into the junior-year program covering the latest research findings and        the translation of these into new clinical techniques and restorative        and reconstructive philosophies. This requires close coordination with        the other clinical departments of the Division of Reconstructive and        Comprehensive Care and with the Division of Diagnostics, Infectious        Disease, and Health Promotion.                            RESEARCH   These projects involve high school students, dental students, postgraduate dentists, MS students, faculty, and visiting scholars and researchers.

McDevitt, PhD   Overview   The department has a long history of academic performance with contributions to all programs of the College. Biomaterials play a fundamental role in most dental diagnostic and restorative procedures. The department\u2019s programs are enhanced by a long history of funded research and an extensively equipped research suite for biomaterials development and characterization, much of it centered around new materials, biological models, calcium phosphate chemistry, and investigations on hard tissue architecture and regeneration.                    meet our faculty Read More                    MS Program in Biomaterials Read More                    shared scientific core resources Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM   The department\u2019s educational and research role is enhanced by        the M.S. Degree Program in Biomaterials and Biomimetics, offered in        collaboration with the NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science. This        provides the opportunity for dental graduate and postgraduate students        to work on a broad range of research projects in collaboration with        graduate students with materials and engineering backgrounds. The student        educational experience is also strengthened by interaction with visiting        scholars from other research institutions from around the world.                                                  First and Second Years                               The Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics contributes to the undergraduate       dental educational program with lectures and laboratory exercises that       are integrated into freshman and sophomore General Dentistry Simulation       Programs to provide timely presentation of biomaterials course content.                                                                     Third and Fourth Years                               These first two years programs are then enhanced by presentations integrated        into the junior-year program covering the latest research findings and        the translation of these into new clinical techniques and restorative        and reconstructive philosophies. This requires close coordination with        the other clinical departments of the Division of Reconstructive and        Comprehensive Care and with the Division of Diagnostics, Infectious        Disease, and Health Promotion.                            RESEARCH   These projects involve high school students, dental students, postgraduate dentists, MS students, faculty, and visiting scholars and researchers.

All students are required to complete the program within five years unless special permission is obtained from the Chair of the Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics or program director. However, in any case, continuous matriculation is required.                                                              Requirements for the First Year                               Research Methods and Principles of Biomaterials Science. All beginning graduate students are required to register in their first Fall semester for BIOM-DN 2001, \u201cIntroduction to Research\u201d (2 credits), and BIOM-DN 1000, \u201cPrinciples of Biomaterials Science\u201d (3 credits). For Introduction to Research there are two requirements for obtaining a grade of P (Pass) on this course: (1) Satisfactory attendance and participation in the course and (2) Submission of a research protocol (not necessarily the thesis protocol).   Also mentioned above, during the first year, the student must secure a faculty mentor from within the department who has formally agreed to supervise the thesis research or independent project. Upon approval by the Biomaterials and Biomimetics Department Chairman, a Co-mentor from another department in the University may be assigned to advise the student.   Thesis research protocol.&amp;nbsp;The thesis proposal (protocol) for the completion of original research must be: (1) approved by the mentor and the Department Chair, (2) filed with the Director of Graduate Studies and the Laboratory Manager, and (3) presented and approved at a department research meeting. The student must have received a grade of P in the Introduction to Research in Biomaterials course.   The plan of study and the thesis research are formulated in consultation with the faculty mentor(s). The thesis must represent original, independent research in a significant area of biomaterials and biomimetics at a level comparable to research published in recognized journals or as professional monographs. When the thesis is completed and has been approved by the mentor(s) and by a research advisory committee (readers) assigned by the Director of Graduate Studies, the candidate defends the results of the research before a faculty committee. No more than twelve months should lapse between the approved proposal and the thesis defense. Exceptions requiring time extension must be approved by the Chair of the Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics or program director.   Non-thesis option. The nature of the independent project in Biomaterials must be developed in consultation with a faculty mentor and approved by the director of graduate studies.                                                              Special Program                               Special Program Emphasis may be arranged by the Department Chair or program director for students desiring to participate in a Special Emphasis research study (e.g. concentration in another department of the University, but still related to Biomaterials and Biomimetics (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.). Students working with a Special Program Emphasis may, in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies, be required to take courses in addition to the 36 points mentioned above.                                                              Departmental Meetings and Seminars                               Mandatory attendance is required of all graduate students to periodic departmental seminars and/or research group meetings and various sessions of Laboratory Safety (see section \u201cRequirements for Participation in Research\u201d). At these seminars and research group meetings, students, faculty and scholars from other institutions discuss their research plans and findings. In addition, the department may co-sponsor special seminars throughout the year for which attendance is also mandatory unless specifically excused by the Director of Graduate Studies.                                                              Meetings with Program Administrator                               All students are required to schedule regular meetings with the Program Administrator in order to keep current regarding course requirements, regulatory status, research requirements, research progress, thesis defense preparations, and if applicable, visa status.                                                              Graduation Information                               Information concerning NYUCD graduation dates and participation in NYUCD graduation ceremonies can be obtained from the Program Administrator and NYUCD administration.
