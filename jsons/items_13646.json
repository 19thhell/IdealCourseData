Acceptance into the Department allows students to study in all three concentrations offered: Writing for Film, Writing for Television, and Playwriting, specializing in at least one medium as their studies advance.    Students may enter the program either as freshmen or as transfer students. The curriculum as a whole enables them to analyze the dramatic text as it has developed since the time of the ancient Greeks, learn the rudiments of production techniques, explore the world of performance and develop and refine their writing ability through a series of intensive workshops.    During the first two years of study, students acquire a strong liberal arts background while sharpening their writing skills. This grounding in the arts and humanities encourages the development of imagination and intellect-essential parts of a writer's training.    Students who have completed one or two years of college are often ready to concentrate on a particular field of interest. For upper-class students, the major in dramatic writing serves as preprofessional experience. Work is judged by eminent writers according to rigorous professional standards. Students also get a realistic view of the profession through meetings and discussions with producers, agents and directors - the people with whom the dramatic writer works.    The undergraduate program is designed to be completed in four years of full-time study. By the senior year, each student is expected to develop several full-length works for film, stage or television.    Student Distribution:    The Department of Dramatic Writing has an average of 60 students in each undergraduate year. The undergraduate student to full time faculty ratio is 1:13. The average class size for writing workshops is 12 students.    Financial Aid:    For information on tuition and fees, please visit the website of the Bursar . For information on Financial Aid, please visit the website of the Office of Financial Aid .    Work Study:    Some students may be eligible for work-study positions to help fund their studies. The opportunity to learn while working with department staff and your peers is most rewarding. Part time jobs such as working with Admissions, Student Affairs, or in Departments at Tisch are all possibilities. For more information, visit the website of the Wasserman Center for Career Development, located at 133 E. 13th St, 2nd Fl (Palladium Residence Hall). College Work Study (CWS) is a federally funded program administered by the central Office of Financial Aid and Graduate Enrollment Services. To be eligble for CWS, a student must be a US citizen or permanent resident, enrolled as a full-time or full-time equivalent degree candidate, in good academic standing and must show a financial need which is at least equal to the amount of the award (stipend and tuition). To demonstrate eligibility, a student must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), available in the central office of Financial Aid, 25 W 4th St, or online.       Library and Production Facilities       All classrooms are equipped with television, VHS and DVD capabilities. Other resources include a fixed 68 seat black box theater that also serves as a cinemateque, two video editing rooms, a student lounge, and a script library. Our theatre spaces are used for all acting and rehearsal process classes, in addition to a series of informal cabaret readings during the year and a festival of new plays, three full evenings of selected student work, presented in staged readings in the spring. Screenwriting students can take film production courses in the Undergraduate Division of the Department of Film and Television when class places are available. The program maintains its own library of play, film, and television scripts, in addition to an extensive collection of film and play scripts that is permanently housed in the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library.

NYU\u2019s required writing courses are designed to prepare students for the work they will do in all of their academic courses. These writing courses are foundational and essential; they prepare students for more rigorous thinking, more elegant writing, and more supple imagining.           In our writing courses, the essay is the coin of the realm. Essay . Not the five-paragraph one. Not the one that begins with a simple assertion, claim, proposition, or declaration and moves forward, sometimes ploddingly, point by point. The essays students write are exploratory as well as persuasive; they move forward as a form of inquiry, turning on themselves again and again, surprising even the writer as she writes. Every good essay yearns to be sui generis , unlike any of its predecessors.           But of course, even the most unusual essay has features in common with all the others: a three-part structure (beginning, middle, ending); an idea, or, more properly, a network of ideas that shape and bind the many parts of the essay together, whether those parts be stories of experience, stories about written texts, or reflections about images (paintings, movies, tv shows, or sculpted objects); and, finally, every good essay reveals how the mind writing it actually makes sense of things. That final element seems now, after more than thirty-five years of teaching, the most fundamental of all.           Said another way: The mind moves deftly but confidently across the pages of good essays, and we, the readers, are permitted to see that mind transforming evidence and being transformed by it, creating a field of intellectual energy that draws writers and readers into relationship.           The essay does not prove, repeat, or reiterate; it is not a static litany of facts. Instead, the essay, like the idea, develops, changes, and expands as the writer considers both her subject and her readers. When she gets the words right, when she figures out what she has to say and how to say it, the writing becomes compelling, the subject and the idea more interesting, the reader captivated.           You can see representative work from the Expository Writing Program and its many courses at the Mercer Street  link. There you will find annual collections of exemplary student essays.
