The fruit of research in military and film archives, it focuses on the dramatic years between the invasion of Ethiopia (1935-1936) and the loss of the colonies (1941-43) during World War Two. Promoted and created at the highest levels of the regime, empire films were Italy\u2019s entry into an international marketplace of colonial and exotic offerings, and engaged many of Italy\u2019s emerging filmmaking talents (Roberto Rossellini) as well as its most experienced and cosmopolitan directors (Augusto Genina, Mario Camerini). Shot partly or wholly in Libya, Somalia, and Ethiopia, these movies reinforced Fascist racial and labor policies: their sets were sites of violence and of interracial intimacies. Like the imperial histories they recount, they were largely forgotten for most of the postwar period. Fascism\u2019s Empire Cinema restores these films to Italian and international film history, and offers a case study of the intertwining of war and cinema and of the unfolding of imperial policy in the context of dictatorship.

Even casual observers of film history are aware of the Third Reich\u2019s relationship with the German film industry\u2014but what about its Axis ally Italy? How did it develop under fascism? How did it serve the interests of the regime? Few people know that many of Italian cinema's leading lights, from Federico Fellini to Roberto Rossellini to Michelangelo Antonioni, got their start in the Fascist film industry.   In the award-winning Italian Fascism\u2019s Empire Cinema , Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of Italian Studies and history at NYU, offers the first in-depth examination of the feature and documentary films made by Rossellini and others about Italy\u2019s African and Balkan occupations during Mussolini\u2019s dictatorship.   At the event, Ben-Ghiat, along with Richard Pe\u00f1a, former director of the New York Film Festival and a professor at Columbia University, Joseph Luzzi of Bard College, and Stanislao Pugliese of Hofstra University will discuss the link between Mussolini\u2019s regime and the Italian film industry.   The event is free and open to the public; admission is on a first-come, first-served basis . For more information, please call 212.998.8739.
