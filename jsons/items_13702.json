The CSLC allows students to enhance their clinical skills and nursing knowledge in a safe learning environment through the use of computerized manikins, Standardized Patients, task trainers and other hi-tech hospital equipment. Our cutting edge simulation center is over 10,000 square feet and is located at 433 First Avenue on the fourth and fifth floor of the College of Nursing. Each week over 100 simulations sessions are conducted at the CSLC for over 1,000 undergraduate BS and graduate MS students.   The CSLC simulation center is equipped with the most advanced Human Patient Simulators (HPS) that have realistic features such as blinking eyes with pupils that react to light, palpable pulses, and the ability to simulate normal and abnormal heart and lung sounds. The HPS also respond physiologically to treatments such as medication and oxygen administration. Each HPS is programmed with realistic case-based patient scenarios reflecting commonly occurring patient health problems that students encounter during their clinical experiences. In addition to the HPS, the CSLC uses Standardized Patients (SP\u2019s) who are actors who have been trained in a standardized manner to portray a patient during simulated patient encounters. Use of SP\u2019s has been successfully used in the nursing and medical field to educate and evaluate students. Students must use their clinical judgment, knowledge, communication and teamwork skills during each simulation. The CSLC is currently equipped with close to 30 HPS\u2019s including adult, pregnant, and pediatric manikins. NYUCN strives to provide students with the same technologies that they will use in the hospital setting including automated medication dispensing machines, smart intravenous pumps, and an electronic medical health record system.   Undergraduate BS Program: A/B Clinical Delivery Model   The clinical learning experiences for the undergraduate students at NYUCN consist of very two components: on and off-campus clinicals. The on-campus clinical component takes place at NYUCN\u2019s CSLC and the off-campus clinical component takes place at various agencies such as acute care hospitals, long-term care settings, and community health care agencies. The A/B model is the term used to describe the clinical learning experiences for all undergraduate students taking courses with a clinical component. The \u201cA\u201d of the A/B Clinical Model refers to students who start with on-campus clinical simulation and the \u201cB\u201d refers to students who start in the off-campus clinical setting. Students alternate weekly between on-campus and off-campus clinical settings. Clinical nursing courses that use the A/B model include Adult and Elder I, Adult and Elder II, Adult and Elder III, pediatric, psychiatric, and Leadership and Management in Nursing. Community health nursing and maternity use a smaller dose of simulation.   The on-campus clinical simulation learning session is viewed as a safe, supportive, nonjudgmental clinical learning environment which provides students with consistent clinical learning experiences related to expected individual course and overall program outcomes. In this protective learning environment students can make a mistake without the fear of harming a patient and subsequently learn from the mistake in order to prevent such errors from happening in the future. NYUCN\u2019s goal for using the A/B clinical learning model addresses patient safety and quality improvement. This model provides students with the necessary clinical learning experiences to meet their program outcomes and graduate successfully from NYUCN. The framework for teaching/learning and evaluation of competencies are in concert with American Association of Colleges of Nursing\u2019s (AACN) Baccalaureate and Master\u2019s Essentials. Graduates are well prepared to enter the nursing workforce and demonstrate AACN\u2019s essentials for nursing practice with a particular emphasis on those related to: Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN), Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC), evidence-based practice (EBP), and management of patient information through the electronic health record (EHR).   Graduate MS Programs   The graduate programs use simulation in one or more of their clinical courses. The Primary Care nurse practitioner (NP) programs (Adult, Pediatric, and Family), NP Adult Acute Care, and Psychiatric as well as the Nurse-Midwifery and Nursing Education students all participate in simulations involving the HPS as well as SPs. The Nursing Education students use the CSLC to gain valuable teaching experience through their teaching practicum hours working with our undergraduate students. All NP and Nurse Midwifery students are provided with simulation learning sessions in the Advanced Health Assessment courses to develop their history and physical assessment competencies and during their Common Health Problems and population specific clinical courses apply these competencies using SPs and/or hi-fidelity manikins to derive differential diagnoses and develop an appropriate plan of care.

Please note that this     process can take several weeks. We cannot guarantee a decision     date; you will be contacted by the Graduate School when an     admission decision has been made on your application. If you     have any questions and concerns regarding your application,     please contact the Math Department at admissions@math.nyu.edu .                The Program      The departments of mathematics and computer science at NYU's     Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences offer a master's     degree in scientific computing. The program provides broad yet     rigorous training in areas of mathematics and computer science     related to scientific computing. It aims to prepare people     with the right talents and background for a technical career     doing practical computing.      The program accommodates both full-time and part-time     students, with most courses meeting in the evening. The     program is self-contained and terminal, providing a complete     set of skills in a field where the need is greater than the     supply. The masters program focuses on computational science,     which includes modeling and numerical simulation as used in     engineering design, development, and optimization.           During the academic years of 2012 and 2013 a concentration in     data sciences existed within the scientific computing program;     this concentration has been discontinued as of 2014. Incoming     students interested in data sciences should consider the     recently-created Masters              of Science in Data Science within the NYU Center for Data     Science .           Starting Fall of 2014 the modified the program requirements     and guidelines listed below will apply to all incoming     students. The new list of required/approved courses includes     the previous list but gives additional flexibility for     students to tailor the list of courses to their background and     interests. Students presently enrolled in the Modeling and     Simulation track can choose to complete the program either     under the new or the old requirements. Students enrolled in     the Data Science concentration should consult the expanded     course options and modified requirements below since this     increases flexibility while maintaining consistency with the     previous requirements. These students should contact Professor     Esteban Tabak for help     in deciding on classes to take.                Scientific Computing:     Overview           Scientific computing is an indispensable part of almost all     scientific investigation and technological development at     universities, government laboratories, and within the private     sector. Typically a scientific computing team consists of     several people trained in some branch of mathematics, science,     statistics, or engineering. What is often lacking is expertise     in modern computing tools such as visualization, modern     programming paradigms, and high performance computing. The     master's program in scientific computing aims to satisfy these     needs, without omitting basic training in numerical analysis     and computer science. Many graduates of this program work at     technologically advanced institutions, especially in research     and development, where their skills and experience complement     those without interdisciplinary degrees. The program is also     open to students who will go on to pursue doctoral studies in     computer science, mathematics, or statistics.      The master's program in scientific computing focuses on the     mathematics and computer science related to advanced computer     modeling and simulation. The program is similar in structure     to terminal master's programs in engineering, combining     classroom training with practical experience. The coursework     ranges from foundational mathematics and fundamental     algorithms to such practical topics as data visualization and     software tools. Electives encourage the exploration of     specific application areas such as mathematical and     statistical finance, applications of machine learning, fluid     mechanics, finite element methods, and biomedical modeling.     The program culminates in a master's project, which serves to     integrate the classroom material.           Admission Requirements      The program requires least three semesters of Calculus     (including multivariate calculus), as well as linear algebra.     Experience with programming in a high-level language (e.g.,     Java, C, C++, Fortran. Python) as well as data structures,     equivalent to a first-year sequence in computer science,      is also required. It is highly desirable that applicants have     undergraduate major or significant experience in mathematics,     a quantitative science or engineering, or economics.      The deadline for application to the program is April 1st for     the fall semester. The program admits students both on a     full-time and on a part-time basis. The application process     takes place online via the Graduate School of Arts and     Sciences; please visit the Graduate     School Admissions site .

Students should consult these lists of course offerings to    determine the availability of desired courses.     Concentration in Data     Science     This section is meant only for students presently enrolled in    the Data Science concentration; this concentration is no longer    offered. To graduate, students enrolled in the old concentration    are required to take the following core courses     in mathematics for the concentration in data science:                One of           MATH-GA              2962 Mathematical Statistics (spring semester),      DS-GA-1001 Introduction to Data Science (fall), or           DS-GA-1002 Statistical and Mathematical Methods                and either            MATH-GA              2043 Scientific Computing (fall and spring     semesters)                or both            MATH-GA              2010 Numerical Methods I (fall semester) and            MATH-GA              2020 Numerical Methods II (spring semester)           The following are the three required core courses      in computer science for the concentration in data science:            CSCI-GA              1170 Fundamental Algorithms (fall, spring and     summer terms)       CSCI-GA              3033 Open Source Tools (fall term)          and one of           CSCI-GA              2565 Machine Learning (fall term), or      DS-GA-1003 Machine Learning and Computational Statistics     (spring)          Students in the concentration in data science must complete 33    points points of course credit (11 courses), including core and    elective courses. They must also obtain 3 points from a master's    capstone project.          The Capstone Project      The master's program culminates in a capstone project. The     capstone project course is usually taken during the final year     of study. During the project, students go through the entire     process of solving a real-world problem, from collecting and     processing data to designing and fully implementing a     solution. The problems and data sets come from settings     identical to those encountered in industry, academia, or     government.           The following is a list of courses approved to meet the     capstone requirement:             MATH-GA.2011/ CSCI-GA.2945      Advanced topics: Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Topics: High-Performance Computing      DS-GA-1006 Capstone Project in Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Computer Graphics      CSCI-GA Multicore Processors: Architecture     &amp;Programming      CSCI-GA Software Engineering           Advanced students can obtain permission from the director of     the program to do an individual capstone project under the     supervision of a faculty member.                Computing Facilities      The Courant Institute makes available for graduate training     and coursework a network of workstations maintained by systems     administrators. All graduate students have computer accounts     for the duration of their studies. NYU also runs a     high-performance computing center with both shared-memory and     distributed-memory computers.

The CSLC allows students to enhance their clinical skills and nursing knowledge in a safe learning environment through the use of computerized manikins, Standardized Patients, task trainers and other hi-tech hospital equipment. Our cutting edge simulation center is over 10,000 square feet and is located at 433 First Avenue on the fourth and fifth floor of the College of Nursing. Each week over 100 simulations sessions are conducted at the CSLC for over 1,000 undergraduate BS and graduate MS students.   The CSLC simulation center is equipped with the most advanced Human Patient Simulators (HPS) that have realistic features such as blinking eyes with pupils that react to light, palpable pulses, and the ability to simulate normal and abnormal heart and lung sounds. The HPS also respond physiologically to treatments such as medication and oxygen administration. Each HPS is programmed with realistic case-based patient scenarios reflecting commonly occurring patient health problems that students encounter during their clinical experiences. In addition to the HPS, the CSLC uses Standardized Patients (SP\u2019s) who are actors who have been trained in a standardized manner to portray a patient during simulated patient encounters. Use of SP\u2019s has been successfully used in the nursing and medical field to educate and evaluate students. Students must use their clinical judgment, knowledge, communication and teamwork skills during each simulation. The CSLC is currently equipped with close to 30 HPS\u2019s including adult, pregnant, and pediatric manikins. NYUCN strives to provide students with the same technologies that they will use in the hospital setting including automated medication dispensing machines, smart intravenous pumps, and an electronic medical health record system.   Undergraduate BS Program: A/B Clinical Delivery Model   The clinical learning experiences for the undergraduate students at NYUCN consist of very two components: on and off-campus clinicals. The on-campus clinical component takes place at NYUCN\u2019s CSLC and the off-campus clinical component takes place at various agencies such as acute care hospitals, long-term care settings, and community health care agencies. The A/B model is the term used to describe the clinical learning experiences for all undergraduate students taking courses with a clinical component. The \u201cA\u201d of the A/B Clinical Model refers to students who start with on-campus clinical simulation and the \u201cB\u201d refers to students who start in the off-campus clinical setting. Students alternate weekly between on-campus and off-campus clinical settings. Clinical nursing courses that use the A/B model include Adult and Elder I, Adult and Elder II, Adult and Elder III, pediatric, psychiatric, and Leadership and Management in Nursing. Community health nursing and maternity use a smaller dose of simulation.   The on-campus clinical simulation learning session is viewed as a safe, supportive, nonjudgmental clinical learning environment which provides students with consistent clinical learning experiences related to expected individual course and overall program outcomes. In this protective learning environment students can make a mistake without the fear of harming a patient and subsequently learn from the mistake in order to prevent such errors from happening in the future. NYUCN\u2019s goal for using the A/B clinical learning model addresses patient safety and quality improvement. This model provides students with the necessary clinical learning experiences to meet their program outcomes and graduate successfully from NYUCN. The framework for teaching/learning and evaluation of competencies are in concert with American Association of Colleges of Nursing\u2019s (AACN) Baccalaureate and Master\u2019s Essentials. Graduates are well prepared to enter the nursing workforce and demonstrate AACN\u2019s essentials for nursing practice with a particular emphasis on those related to: Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN), Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC), evidence-based practice (EBP), and management of patient information through the electronic health record (EHR).   Graduate MS Programs   The graduate programs use simulation in one or more of their clinical courses. The Primary Care nurse practitioner (NP) programs (Adult, Pediatric, and Family), NP Adult Acute Care, and Psychiatric as well as the Nurse-Midwifery and Nursing Education students all participate in simulations involving the HPS as well as SPs. The Nursing Education students use the CSLC to gain valuable teaching experience through their teaching practicum hours working with our undergraduate students. All NP and Nurse Midwifery students are provided with simulation learning sessions in the Advanced Health Assessment courses to develop their history and physical assessment competencies and during their Common Health Problems and population specific clinical courses apply these competencies using SPs and/or hi-fidelity manikins to derive differential diagnoses and develop an appropriate plan of care.

Please note that this     process can take several weeks. We cannot guarantee a decision     date; you will be contacted by the Graduate School when an     admission decision has been made on your application. If you     have any questions and concerns regarding your application,     please contact the Math Department at admissions@math.nyu.edu .                The Program      The departments of mathematics and computer science at NYU's     Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences offer a master's     degree in scientific computing. The program provides broad yet     rigorous training in areas of mathematics and computer science     related to scientific computing. It aims to prepare people     with the right talents and background for a technical career     doing practical computing.      The program accommodates both full-time and part-time     students, with most courses meeting in the evening. The     program is self-contained and terminal, providing a complete     set of skills in a field where the need is greater than the     supply. The masters program focuses on computational science,     which includes modeling and numerical simulation as used in     engineering design, development, and optimization.           During the academic years of 2012 and 2013 a concentration in     data sciences existed within the scientific computing program;     this concentration has been discontinued as of 2014. Incoming     students interested in data sciences should consider the     recently-created Masters              of Science in Data Science within the NYU Center for Data     Science .           Starting Fall of 2014 the modified the program requirements     and guidelines listed below will apply to all incoming     students. The new list of required/approved courses includes     the previous list but gives additional flexibility for     students to tailor the list of courses to their background and     interests. Students presently enrolled in the Modeling and     Simulation track can choose to complete the program either     under the new or the old requirements. Students enrolled in     the Data Science concentration should consult the expanded     course options and modified requirements below since this     increases flexibility while maintaining consistency with the     previous requirements. These students should contact Professor     Esteban Tabak for help     in deciding on classes to take.                Scientific Computing:     Overview           Scientific computing is an indispensable part of almost all     scientific investigation and technological development at     universities, government laboratories, and within the private     sector. Typically a scientific computing team consists of     several people trained in some branch of mathematics, science,     statistics, or engineering. What is often lacking is expertise     in modern computing tools such as visualization, modern     programming paradigms, and high performance computing. The     master's program in scientific computing aims to satisfy these     needs, without omitting basic training in numerical analysis     and computer science. Many graduates of this program work at     technologically advanced institutions, especially in research     and development, where their skills and experience complement     those without interdisciplinary degrees. The program is also     open to students who will go on to pursue doctoral studies in     computer science, mathematics, or statistics.      The master's program in scientific computing focuses on the     mathematics and computer science related to advanced computer     modeling and simulation. The program is similar in structure     to terminal master's programs in engineering, combining     classroom training with practical experience. The coursework     ranges from foundational mathematics and fundamental     algorithms to such practical topics as data visualization and     software tools. Electives encourage the exploration of     specific application areas such as mathematical and     statistical finance, applications of machine learning, fluid     mechanics, finite element methods, and biomedical modeling.     The program culminates in a master's project, which serves to     integrate the classroom material.           Admission Requirements      The program requires least three semesters of Calculus     (including multivariate calculus), as well as linear algebra.     Experience with programming in a high-level language (e.g.,     Java, C, C++, Fortran. Python) as well as data structures,     equivalent to a first-year sequence in computer science,      is also required. It is highly desirable that applicants have     undergraduate major or significant experience in mathematics,     a quantitative science or engineering, or economics.      The deadline for application to the program is April 1st for     the fall semester. The program admits students both on a     full-time and on a part-time basis. The application process     takes place online via the Graduate School of Arts and     Sciences; please visit the Graduate     School Admissions site .

Students should consult these lists of course offerings to    determine the availability of desired courses.     Concentration in Data     Science     This section is meant only for students presently enrolled in    the Data Science concentration; this concentration is no longer    offered. To graduate, students enrolled in the old concentration    are required to take the following core courses     in mathematics for the concentration in data science:                One of           MATH-GA              2962 Mathematical Statistics (spring semester),      DS-GA-1001 Introduction to Data Science (fall), or           DS-GA-1002 Statistical and Mathematical Methods                and either            MATH-GA              2043 Scientific Computing (fall and spring     semesters)                or both            MATH-GA              2010 Numerical Methods I (fall semester) and            MATH-GA              2020 Numerical Methods II (spring semester)           The following are the three required core courses      in computer science for the concentration in data science:            CSCI-GA              1170 Fundamental Algorithms (fall, spring and     summer terms)       CSCI-GA              3033 Open Source Tools (fall term)          and one of           CSCI-GA              2565 Machine Learning (fall term), or      DS-GA-1003 Machine Learning and Computational Statistics     (spring)          Students in the concentration in data science must complete 33    points points of course credit (11 courses), including core and    elective courses. They must also obtain 3 points from a master's    capstone project.          The Capstone Project      The master's program culminates in a capstone project. The     capstone project course is usually taken during the final year     of study. During the project, students go through the entire     process of solving a real-world problem, from collecting and     processing data to designing and fully implementing a     solution. The problems and data sets come from settings     identical to those encountered in industry, academia, or     government.           The following is a list of courses approved to meet the     capstone requirement:             MATH-GA.2011/ CSCI-GA.2945      Advanced topics: Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Topics: High-Performance Computing      DS-GA-1006 Capstone Project in Data Science      CSCI-GA Advanced Computer Graphics      CSCI-GA Multicore Processors: Architecture     &amp;Programming      CSCI-GA Software Engineering           Advanced students can obtain permission from the director of     the program to do an individual capstone project under the     supervision of a faculty member.                Computing Facilities      The Courant Institute makes available for graduate training     and coursework a network of workstations maintained by systems     administrators. All graduate students have computer accounts     for the duration of their studies. NYU also runs a     high-performance computing center with both shared-memory and     distributed-memory computers.

Students, residents and attending physicians all benefit from the controlled environment that simulation offers to manage high stakes, infrequently confronted clinical scenarios that can impact patient outcomes. The ability to reinforce patient safety initiatives, perfect procedures, emphasize teamwork, communication skills, and resource management, and integrate core principles encountered in real-world patient care scenarios are some of the many ways emergency medicine has embraced simulation as an educational tool.     July 2013 marked the inauguration of our Emergency Medicine Simulation Fellowship. We offer a one year program that provides a motivated candidate the opportunity to participate in curriculum design and implementation of simulation for medical students, residents, and faculty, along with independent and on-going research.     We anticipate that upon completion of this fellowship the graduate will be prepared to assume a leadership position in the burgeoning field of Emergency Medicine Simulation as well as have the tools to develop and manage all aspects (design, teaching, research) of a simulation program.\u00a0     Application Procedure     Applicants must have completed or expect to complete an ACGME-accredited Emergency Medicine residency and meet all New York University School of Medicine credentialing and academic appointment requirements for the rank of Instructor. Interested candidates should submit a letter of intent including experience, current research interests, and career plans, a current CV, and 3 letters of recommendation, one of which is from your Emergency Medicine Program Director, to Maureen.Gang@nyumc.org \u00a0for consideration by November 1, 2013.\u00a0     Program Description      Fellowship Co-Directors:     Maureen Gang, MD   Associate\u00a0Professor in Emergency Medicine   New York University School of Medicine   Associate Residency Director   NYU/Bellevue Emergency Medicine Residency Program   Chief, Emergency Medicine Simulation Maureen.Gang@nyumc.org   212-263-7084\u00a0     Demian Szyld, MD, EdM   Assistant Professor in Emergency Medicine   New York University School of Medicine   Associate Medical Director   New York Simulation Center for the Health Sciences (NYSIM) Demian.Szyld@nyumc.org   212-263-4083\u00a0      Length of Program: One year\u00a0      Application Deadline   November 2013 for start date of July 2014\u00a0     Fellowship Design     Fellows will participate in and develop educational material for our weekly simulation sessions with both medical students and residents. Fellows will work with faculty to integrate specific goals for each level of learner into case design based on the emergency medicine core curriculum. Principles of debriefing, the foundation for successful self-reflective learning, will be emphasized. There will be ample opportunity to develop the technical programming skills necessary to build and troubleshoot simulated scenarios.\u00a0     We have an active interdisciplinary simulation curriculum focused on team training and patient safety with our trauma, OB-GYN, orthopedics, pediatric and nursing colleagues. Fellows will participate in in-situ simulations held for our EM residents and nurses in both our pediatric and adult emergency departments. We encourage fellow participation in simulation programming development that will further patient safety initiatives and interdepartmental collaboration.\u00a0     In addition to departmental resources, we collaborate closely with the New York Simulation Center for the Health Sciences (NYSIMcenter.org). NYSIM is a state-of-the-art, 25,000 square foot facility serving NYU and CUNY; it is located within Bellevue Hospital\u00a0and \u00a0has a variety of simulation tools available for teaching and research. High-fidelity simulators, task trainers, hybrid models, and access to a talented pool of standardized patients are some of the resources available to help focus your interest and direct your career.\u00a0     Additionally, fellows participate in the monthly simulation journal club with faculty and resident to discuss research methodology, statistical analysis and applicability to further research design .\u00a0     Debriefing training is provided through the New York Simulation Center\u2019s advanced courses in debriefing and scenario design.\u00a0     A monthly \u201cjoint fellowship\u201d curriculum along with other departmental fellows in patient safety, pediatrics EM, medical toxicology, and ultrasound\u00a0 meet with fellowship directors and selected experts to discuss teaching strategies, career development and other topics that will foster and enrich your academic career.\u00a0     It is the expectation that fellows will complete one scholarly project during their training. There will be ample opportunity to participate in independent and on-going research.\u00a0     Clinical Responsibilities     Fellows are expected to work 20 hours per week divided between Bellevue Hospital Center, Tisch Hospital, and Hospital for Joint Diseases. These clinical duties will afford opportunity to maintain clinical skills as well as provide realistic material for development of simulated case scenarios. Fellows will receive competitive compensation for these clinical duties.
