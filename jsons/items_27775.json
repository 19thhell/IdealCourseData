The   minor\u2019s purpose is to increase a student's means of storytelling by   examining the world we live in utilizing the tools of the documentary   filmmaker. Students will be exposed to the history of documentary and   non-fiction film and the many varied forms it now comes in, as well as   consider the ethics and issues that arise when documenting actual   instead of fictitious subjects. Students will be exposed to directors,   cinematographers, editors, and producers of documentary films who will   share their experiences on why they chose to tell the stories they did   and how they went about it. The Minor in Documentary will be the first   of its kind offering a structured curriculum that delves into the   history, practices the hands-on mechanics of production, and explores   the means in which to distribute the final film.

Documentary   News and Documentary prepares students to report and produce short form and long form journalism for traditional and non-traditional media. From the first class, students are on the streets reporting, shooting and editing. We emphasize not only the story, but the storytelling. Our goal is to have a student skilled in both form and content, able tell a story by effectively using all aspects of the medium.   The Reporting I class begins with the basics of short form stories in a variety of formats and genres. After a progression of reporting classes, the curriculum culminates with each student producing a thirty-minute documentary . Our News Magazine editing class coincides with the Advanced Reporting class to give extra support to the production of the documentary. News Doc students have the opportunity to take electives university wide.

We also host filmmaker screenings throughout the year so students can see current work and interact with filmmakers to learn more about the process and different styles.   Our students are in demand for internships at all the major  broadcast news organizations and websites in New York as well as at  smaller documentary production companies.   \u00a0   Our Specialness   NewsDoc is special because it is among the most creative programs in journalism education. Many journalism programs today use multimedia as a catch phrase: it has become short hand for scratching the surface of everything. The problem with that approach is that you master nothing.   NewsDoc still takes the long view. It values in-depth long form journalism and takes the time to get there. Its curriculum is made up of building blocks with each class and semester layering on what came before. The diverse backgrounds of the faculty \u2013 film documentary, broadcast news, TV news magazine, multimedia reporting, even magazine writing \u2013 is a testament to the program\u2019s respect for storytelling in all forms and exposes students to a variety of tools to draw from. That is how you truly master your craft and it is evident in the annual News Doc Film Festival. You leave us prepared to work in news at the networks, a documentary production company, VICE, New York Times video or on your own.   \u00a0   Fellow Students  NewsDoc also has a tradition of attracting students from all over the  world. This commitment to creating an intimate international group each year is the best newsroom setting we can imagine. Students partner on projects, share feedback, and foster a strong professional environment. Most incoming students have two-three years of professional and intern experience in some aspect of journalism but that is not a requirement. We\u2019re interested in interesting students who have something to say.  \u00a0     \u00a0   \u00a0   Rialda Zukic (2014) films her thesis documentary in Sarajevo, Bosnia.
