The engineering challenges of the 21st century are varied, complex, and cross-disciplinary. Ranging from the nano-scale to mega-projects, they are characterized by sustainability concerns, environmental and energy constraints, global sourcing, and humanitarian goals. In the face of global competition, dwindling natural resources, and the complexity of societal needs, the leaders of technological enterprises will be those who can innovate, are inventive and entrepreneurial, and understand how technology is integrated within society.     i2e \u2014 A Unique Program     Engineering at NYUAD is designed to create technological leaders with a global perspective, a broad education, and the capacity to think creatively. The uniqueness of the program lies in the integration of invention, innovation, and entrepreneurship (i2e) into all phases of study. Through i2e, students enjoy a learning environment conducive to creativity, which is at the heart of tomorrow\u2019s technological innovations and enterprises.     NYUAD offers five degree programs :     General Engineering   Civil Engineering   Computer Engineering   Electrical Engineering   Mechanical Engineering     The engineering programs provide a sound preparation for careers in research, academia, industry, or government, and graduates receive a Bachelor of Science degree.                             Diverse Faculty    A distinguished and diverse faculty engages in state-of-the-art research, innovation, invention, and entrepreneurship. Their research is concentrated in three thematic areas :     Information, Communication, Electronic Systems   Urban Systems   BioMedical and Health Systems     Engineering faculty at NYUAD actively collaborate with faculty in other divisions at NYUAD and NYUNY, as well as faculty in the departments of civil, chemical and biological, computer, electrical, and mechanical engineering at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering .   Engineering and Context    The Engineering program draws upon courses across an array of disciplines. The liberal arts core provides the intellectual breadth, a \u201clicense to learn,\u201d preparing students to thrive in a multicultural globalized world and equipping them to learn and adapt quickly in areas that evolve with ever-increasing swiftness.   Students gain a firm grounding across various science and engineering fields that underscore the technical component of an engineering education, but they also draw upon courses across the curriculum to develop an understanding of cultural, political, economic, environmental, and public safety considerations that are integral to engineering solutions. In their engineering courses, students are involved in the design process and the progression of technological inventions from concept through product development and market introduction.                                   Early Admission to Master's Degree Programs at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering     Undergraduate engineering students with strong academic records may apply for early admission to master's degree graduate programs at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering . While the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering offers a wide range of graduate engineering programs, the allowable graduate programs for the early admission track will depend on the student\u2019s engineering major at NYUAD. Students apply for early admission at the end of the fall semester of their junior year. Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores, which are required for regular admission, are waived for NYUAD early admission applicants; however, GRE scores are required for NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering scholarship evaluations.     Masters of Science (M.S.) degrees at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering typically require 30 credits for completion. To receive the M.S. degree, students must satisfy all of the requirements of both the bachelor and master's degrees, and there is no double-counting of courses. Students who spend the spring semester of their junior year at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering may enroll in graduate courses; if these courses are not counted toward the B.S., they may be counted toward the M.S. in Engineering.
