Sound, Image, and Story and Concepts of Film and New Media in addition to two production and craft courses. The elective production/craft classes can be a combination of documentary and narrative, editing, and screenwriting or they can have a particular focus to support a possible capstone project. A student should work with an advisor in the Film and new Media program to plan his or her production/craft sequence. Only one course may double-count for the concentration in Film and New Media Production and another major or concentration.

Sound, Image, and Story and Concepts of Film and New Media in addition to two production and craft courses. The elective production/craft classes can be a combination of documentary and narrative, editing, and screenwriting or they can have a particular focus to support a possible capstone project. A student should work with an advisor in the Film and new Media program to plan his or her production/craft sequence.

major in Film and New Media emphasizes interdisciplinary and global approaches to film and new media. Students develop critical and interpretive skills for making and understanding documentary, experimental, narrative, and interactive styles of film and new media and learn the methods and theoretical models for analyzing film, new media and their histories. The six electives classes can be taken from any area in the curriculum, but students should work with an advisor in the Film and New Media program to plan a sequence to support a particular interest. Only one course may double-count for the major in Film and New Media and another major or concentration.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

This course analyzes and puts into practice principles of different forms of dramatic and dynamic writing: classical, episodic, and parametric in narrative and documentary; rhythmic and contrapuntal in experimental film; episodes and attractions for web platforms; interactive and auto-generative in new media. Writing assignments include both critical analyses and creative exercises.

This course will explore human behavior in the context of evolutionary psychology, and develop that into a working screenplay. Readings and film screenings will focus on observing human behaviors and relationships. You will hopefully leave the class with a well-honed short script, anchored to a frank and honest look at our behaviors and relationships, and perhaps some greater questions and thoughts into the human condition.

Single Shot Cinema is a film method that re-interprets film language based on the technical developments and possibilities of filmmaking in the digital age. What was once only possible with cranes and Steadicams is now accessible to the low-budget filmmaker. Students discover how to block actions and characters in a scene and how to choreograph one single shot, using smooth and flexible camera movements that expresses the drama, emotion, and vision of the director.

Through the universal language of lenses and lighting we learn how these play a central role when working with a set. Students develop the skills to use a motion picture camera in order to tell a good story. The class structure reflects a working film set with emphasis on production. Learning to create a mood advances the ultimate goal of a filmmaker. The heart of visual storytelling is composition: camera placement, camera angles, camera movement, and lens choice. Together with the lighting style a film finds its own unique life. In each class we look at selected scenes from popular films and recreate them. We shoot exercises in the classroom or on location.

First, we trace the origin and variations of New Wave films from European through Latin American to East Asian nations. Then, we expand the scope to transnational crossroads including pan-Chinese, Balkan, South Asian, and African regions. Finally, we explore how contemporary cinema reflects sociopolitical and cultural phenomena in the age of globalization. Major trends and directors are introduced with close analysis of key films.

After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the New Wave in philosophical existentialism (Sartre, de Beauvoir) and the movement&rsquo;s theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma, we examine a chronological series of films by Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rohmer), Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker), and Cin&eacute;ma V&eacute;rit&eacute; (Rouch, Morin). While focusing on the films themselves, we also take a cultural studies approach by seeing the films as part of a broader artistic and mediatic spectrum.

Through the genres of experimental, narrative, and documentary image-making, this course examines the work of women who have pioneered and re-imagined the methods, theories and ideas of the dominant culture. An eclectic and multi-cultural selection of feature length films, shorts, exhibitions, books, and iconic images will be screened and studied. During the semester students will sub-mit written responses and critiques to the work presented. Weekly exercises will help develop the students critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. Students will look to their own cultural milieu to make a final image based project in conjunction with a written essay, and create oral/visual presentations. Field trips outside of class are mandatory.

We will study closely the film style of film directors whose work exemplifies different elements of film style: mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and the long take with static camera (Antonioni, Tsai, Tarr); editing in space, shot/reverse shot cutting, eye-line matches, and point-of-view editing (Hitchcock, Ozu); camera movement (Ophuls, Fellini, Tarkovsky); and sound/image montage (Lang, Bresson, Godard). Based on identical scripts, students (working in groups) will be assigned four practical film-based exercises modeled upon the films of these directors.

FILMM-AD 154 Transtextuality: Adaptation Between Novel and Film                                                                              This course treats the theory, practice, and analysis of film adaptations of novels across a broad spectrum that includes novels by such figures as Defoe, Steinbeck, Nabokov, Flaubert, and Clarice Lispector. Combining close readings of the literary source-texts with close analysis of the films, the course will simultaneously explore the &ldquo;transtextuality&rdquo; theory that treats the complex and mutating relations between any single text and all the other texts, genres, media, and discourses with which it comes into dialogue. Through these contrapuntal analyses, the course will demonstrate the myriad ways that adaptation study can illuminate both media.

From the Libyan War of 1911-1912 onwards, film has been integral to shaping public consciousness of military events as they unfold and public memory of wars after the guns have fallen silent. The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war&rsquo;s many violences are represented; the filmmakers&rsquo; circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory. Case studies may include the two World Wars, civil wars (Spain, Lebanon), anti-colonial wars, the fall of Communism, the war in Iraq, Vietnam, the Israel-Palestinian conflict; and the Egyptian revolution.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

It will focus on strong visualization of story and camera techniques, as opposed to dialogue-based work. Students will develop skills in the elements of visual storytelling through the process of storyboarding and creating shot lists, then working in small crews to direct and shoot the projects. Students will gain knowledge of new photographic techniques, moving the camera dynamically, and the ways in which the craft of editing and sound design can be used to support story.

The course explores how documentary and fiction are combined throughout history and in different cultures. We will examine the work of ten filmmakers who have merged both formats creating singular hybrid films. Dramatic reconstructions, manipulated imagery or fictional interstitials are frequently incorporated into documentaries to elevate realism. Conversely, fiction occasionally crosses over into documentary to create a sense of authenticity or truthfulness. Lastly, the division is sometimes completely eradicated making it difficult to distinguish the reality from the imaginary. Over the course of the semester, students will create their own docu-fiction short films. They will bring together fiction and non-fiction story elements reflecting on how each form complements the other.

Beginning with recordings of oral tradition originating in the early empire of Mali to novels addressing the roles of African colonial intermediaries to music protesting apartheid in South Africa, students will engage with a variety of sources of cultural and artistic nature. The course will focus on historical developments such as the Atlantic and internal slave trades, the process of European colonization, religious practice, decolonization, genocide and migration, urbanization, and AIDS. We will also examine various themes, such as local and imposed notions of race and ethnicity, lived experiences of and Africans&rsquo; responses to colonialism on the continent, issues of gender and class, and political resistance. Our broad goal is to investigate to what extent long-term historical dynamics determine the present. Students will not only watch films, listen to music, and read literature, but also read reflections on the methods of using these sources as a way of studying the history of Africa. Course requirements provide students with a language and historical framework for understanding the dynamic history of the continent.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

What is media&rsquo;s role in creating culture, influencing political events, forming communities, and archiving? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space and how does participatory media change the face of cultural institutions, historical narratives, and mapping? Students are asked to consider the role of media in their own lives and consider where it both fails and succeeds.

In this course students design sound for ongoing theatrical productions, films by NYUAD students, or installation work, and learn how to approach sound design for these diverse media. Topics such as Automatic Dialog Replacement (ADR), Foley, post-synchronized sound and musique concr&egrave;te techniques are covered, and several examples of sound design for film and theatrical performance are analyzed and discussed in class, leading the students to develop their own conceptual approaches to sound design.    * Prerequiste: MUSIC-AD 106 and MUSIC-AD 120 or equivalent.

THEAT-AD 110 Fundamentals of Acting                                                                              Students begin to build a performance vocabulary by using a range of techniques for translating the actor&rsquo;s imagination into stage action. Students are introduced to the internal and external demands of turning psychology into behavior. Students explore acting fundamentals, such as investing yourself in the moment, genuinely listening, personalizing fictional material; and playing objectives are initially explored via games, improvisations, and exercises, followed by partnered scene work, ensemble technique, and solo performance.

Students build a directorial vocabulary for translating impulse and imagination into compelling narrative and non-narrative staged moments. Using techniques from Brecht, Brook, Grotowski, and Bogart, students learn to articulate ideas to actors in compelling and inspiring ways. Students explore physical exercises to increase their range as directors; tools with which to fuel actors physically and emotionally; and theories of collaboration and ensemble. The core of the class is the exploration of directing as a physical collaboration with actors within a landscape of thought, emotion, openness, and truth.
