The curriculum begins with the premise that the public, nonprofit and private sectors are inextricably linked, and that managers and leaders in one sector need to appreciate the demands, opportunities, and constraints of the other sectors. To help students develop the appropriate breadth and depth of skills after completing the core management course, CORE-GP 1020 ,\u00a0 Managing Public Service Organizations , the curriculum is arranged in three Areas of Expertise: Strategy &amp; Organizations , Human Resources &amp; Organizational Behavior , and Performance Management &amp; Operations . Each Area of Expertise is organized around a cluster of courses and includes one course that is required of students specializing in management.                       Required Specialization Courses    Students must complete the following 9 credits:*                         PADM-GP.2110 , Strategic Management             PADM-GP.2135 , Developing Human Resources             PADM-GP.2170 , Performance Measurement and Management for Public, Nonprofit, and Health Care Organizations                          Students must also take a total of 6 credits from the following courses:           Strategy &amp; Organization        This area of expertise teaches students skills in designing organizations, systems and strategies that anticipate and respond effectively to dynamic and complex environments. These courses develop an understanding of the multiple stakeholders for which organizations are responsible and the collaborative and competitive dynamics in fields and sectors. Another way to think of this area is that it helps students understand the \"big picture\" as they build organizations for long-term prosperity.

The curriculum begins with the premise that the public, nonprofit and private sectors are inextricably linked, and that managers and leaders in one sector need to appreciate the demands, opportunities, and constraints of the other sectors. To help students develop the appropriate breadth and depth of skills after completing the core management course, CORE-GP 1020 ,\u00a0 Managing Public Service Organizations , the curriculum is arranged in three Areas of Expertise: Strategy &amp; Organizations , Human Resources &amp; Organizational Behavior , and Performance Management &amp; Operations . Each Area of Expertise is organized around a cluster of courses and includes one course that is required of students specializing in management.                       Required Specialization Courses    Students must complete the following 9 credits:*                         PADM-GP.2110 , Strategic Management             PADM-GP.2135 , Developing Human Resources             PADM-GP.2170 , Performance Measurement and Management for Public, Nonprofit, and Health Care Organizations                          Students must also take a total of 6 credits from the following courses:           Strategy &amp; Organization        This area of expertise teaches students skills in designing organizations, systems and strategies that anticipate and respond effectively to dynamic and complex environments. These courses develop an understanding of the multiple stakeholders for which organizations are responsible and the collaborative and competitive dynamics in fields and sectors. Another way to think of this area is that it helps students understand the \"big picture\" as they build organizations for long-term prosperity.
