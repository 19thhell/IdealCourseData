Your NYUCard entitles you to a discount in the NYU Bookstore and allows you to access selected NYU buildings, campus transportation and computer centers located throughout campus.    Students must have an NYUCard in order to request services at the Student Services Center and to gain entry to the residence halls, libraries, Coles and Palladium Sports Centers and other University buildings. Do not lend this card to anyone at any time for any reason. You can be subject to disciplinary proceedings if you are involved in fraudulent use of a NYUCard. If you should terminate your stay at NYU, please notify and return your card to the NYUCard Center.
