Today's urban planners must balance development, community needs and social justice, provision of critical public services, sustainability and security.   Housed within a school of public service, rather than a school of architecture, the Master of Urban Planning program uses the broader contexts of policy, management and finance to prepare students with the critical thinking they need to succeed in urban design, land use, economic and community development, housing, and environmental and infrastructure planning.   NYU Wagner is at the forefront of the vital issues and debates about the future of cities, and the program presents myriad opportunities to obtain and practice the skills needed to confront these challenges, in New York and beyond.

In July 2012, the New York City Council approved the Core Plan described by NYU 2031, granting the University a new zoning envelope to construct needed facilities over the coming years.                  Looking to the Future           Core Plan Commitments      NYU is answering a number of local needs identified by Council Member Margaret Chin and Community Board 2 as we develop our infrastructure at Washington Square. Explore the latest news and announcements, and access detailed information and documents, at our Core Plan Commitments page.        Announcements Archive     During the ULURP, this page recorded announcements and news items pertaining to 2031. That archive is available online .

Establish criteria for development within the existing NYU footprint in the University\u2019s core location, and the surrounding neighborhoods that would prioritize.                       &mdash; Identifying opportunities to       decentralize facilities and actively       pursuing these opportunities;                            &mdash; Contextual development that is       sensitive to building heights, densities,       and materials;                            &mdash; Reuse before new development.                     &mdash; Considering mixed-use facilities that       complement Manhattan\u2019s mixed       neighborhoods, particularly in regard       to ground-floor uses.                       Identify solutions to maximize utilization of existing assets by consulting with the     community on:                           &mdash; The types of facilities that can be decentralized from the Village core and surrounding neighborhoods and cultivating locations outside these areas;                            &mdash; Preferences for appropriate places for vertical additions;                            &mdash; Encouraging programmatic and scheduling efficiencies; and                            &mdash; Opening new and reenvisioning existing recreational spaces to better serve both the student population as well as the community at large.                                      Make thoughtful urban and architectural design a priority by:                           &mdash; Respecting the limitations of the urban environment, including the impact on       New York City\u2019s infrastructure;                                   &mdash; Improving the quality of open spaces; and                            &mdash; Actively soliciting, utilizing, and implementing input from the community in the design process.                                            Support community sustainability by:                           &mdash; Preserving existing diverse social and economic character through the support of community efforts to sustain affordable housing and local retail;                                  &mdash; Exploring the utilization of ground floors of buildings for community-oriented uses such as local retail, gallery spaces for local artists, nonprofit users and other providers of community services; and                            &mdash; Generating a tenant relocation policy for legal, residential tenants, in the event that construction or conversion necessitates the relocation of tenants.                                            Respect for the community\u2019s existing qualities of life including, but not limited to:                           &mdash; Taking measures to mitigate effects of construction such as noise, dust, work hours; sound mitigation for mechanical equipment; and construction staging;                                  &mdash; Reaching out early and often for community consultation related to major construction;                            &mdash; Creating a Web site for ongoing constructions; and                            &mdash; Committing to a community-oriented public process for reviewing NYU\u2019s proposed projects and developments.
