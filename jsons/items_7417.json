Cities concentrate our most pressing social and environmental issues while also bringing about innovative responses to these challenges and numerous forms of experimentation.   The Urban Democracy Lab promotes critical, creative, just, and sustainable forms of urbanism, through scholarship, curricular activities, public engagement, and programming.\u00a0 We are especially interested in new forms of urban democracy, whether in governance, activism, self-management, or creative production.
