The program is closely integrated with the ACGME-accredited fellowship in geriatric medicine. There is exposure to a complete spectrum of clinical and academic experiences in geriatric psychiatry, geriatrics, and gerontology. Besides acquiring expertise in using pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions to treat elderly patients with late-life mental disorders, the Fellow gains experience in understanding the relationship of their elderly patients to their families and environment. Fellows, under the supervision of faculty, function as the team leader in all settings with supervisory responsibility for residents, medical students, and professional members of the multidisciplinary treatment team. This Fellowship educates in assessing and treating patients in multiple settings (inpatient, outpatient, consultation-liaison, and nursing home) and with all modalities of treatment. Finally, the Fellow can work with mentors in developing research projects and academic pursuits.   Clinical Rotations   Pearl I.
