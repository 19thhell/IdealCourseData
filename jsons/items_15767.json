Collectively these countries will add billions of new residents this century. Existing cities will expand, and entirely new cities will emerge. We encourage reform-minded leaders to use new cities as a mechanism for change&mdash;a way to experiment with new rules that can offer people more job opportunities and new ways to make progress in both their own lives and the lives of their children. A charter city is a type of civic startup, a framework for reform. Civic startups allow societies to experiment with new rules, but to do so in ways that do not force change on those who don&rsquo;t want it. They are attractive to people who want to try new ways of doing things. Because participation is voluntary, the social norms of those who participate work to legitimize the new rules that a civic startup puts to the test. Like other civic startups, a charter city offers a way to break out of systems of rules that otherwise deprive people of chances to reach their true potential.  A Flexible Framework for Reform Reformers can start a charter city by enacting founding legislation&mdash;or a charter&mdash;that commits a public entity to key principles of reform. Though the specifics of reform depend on the local context, all charter cities share two foundational principles: people must be free to choose whether to move in, and those who do must enjoy equality under the law. Opt-in and equality under the law ensure that everyone has a stake in the economic and cultural life of the new city. Grounded in these foundational principles, charter cities offer a great deal of flexibility for reform. Many will begin by identifying and adapting good rules from elsewhere in the world, much like Shenzhen did when it adopted rules that allowed China to reap the gains from global economic participation after a prolonged period of economic decline. Some charter cities will draw on the expertise of different national or municipal governments, engaging reputable partners in an effort to attract residents, businesses, and investors.  Startup Thinking at the City-Scale Charter cities will start small. But by thinking at the city-scale, leaders can give the reforms in a charter city room to succeed&mdash;the potential to attract millions of people, most of whom will be heading to cities this century anyways. A successful charter city could not only host millions of residents, it could also influence welfare-enhancing change in the broader society by demonstrating the benefits of reform. The world has locations where many new cities could be built. The benefits that these cities could generate are so large that they could be self-financing. There is no doubt that some upstart cities will fail to take off. However, those that do succeed will quickly give new social and economic opportunities to millions of people who currently lack good options&mdash;generating benefits that dwarf the costs from experimenting with new cities that never manage to get off the ground. At their best, cities are environments in which people can earn incomes, raise healthy families, and find meaning in their lives. We&rsquo;re working with governments to realize a world in which every family can choose between several safe, vibrant, and economically dynamic cities, each of which is vying to attract them as residents.

Collectively these countries will add billions of new residents this century. Existing cities will expand, and entirely new cities will emerge. We encourage reform-minded leaders to use new cities as a mechanism for change&mdash;a way to experiment with new rules that can offer people more job opportunities and new ways to make progress in both their own lives and the lives of their children. A charter city is a type of civic startup, a framework for reform. Civic startups allow societies to experiment with new rules, but to do so in ways that do not force change on those who don&rsquo;t want it. They are attractive to people who want to try new ways of doing things. Because participation is voluntary, the social norms of those who participate work to legitimize the new rules that a civic startup puts to the test. Like other civic startups, a charter city offers a way to break out of systems of rules that otherwise deprive people of chances to reach their true potential.  A Flexible Framework for Reform Reformers can start a charter city by enacting founding legislation&mdash;or a charter&mdash;that commits a public entity to key principles of reform. Though the specifics of reform depend on the local context, all charter cities share two foundational principles: people must be free to choose whether to move in, and those who do must enjoy equality under the law. Opt-in and equality under the law ensure that everyone has a stake in the economic and cultural life of the new city. Grounded in these foundational principles, charter cities offer a great deal of flexibility for reform. Many will begin by identifying and adapting good rules from elsewhere in the world, much like Shenzhen did when it adopted rules that allowed China to reap the gains from global economic participation after a prolonged period of economic decline. Some charter cities will draw on the expertise of different national or municipal governments, engaging reputable partners in an effort to attract residents, businesses, and investors.  Startup Thinking at the City-Scale Charter cities will start small. But by thinking at the city-scale, leaders can give the reforms in a charter city room to succeed&mdash;the potential to attract millions of people, most of whom will be heading to cities this century anyways. A successful charter city could not only host millions of residents, it could also influence welfare-enhancing change in the broader society by demonstrating the benefits of reform. The world has locations where many new cities could be built. The benefits that these cities could generate are so large that they could be self-financing. There is no doubt that some upstart cities will fail to take off. However, those that do succeed will quickly give new social and economic opportunities to millions of people who currently lack good options&mdash;generating benefits that dwarf the costs from experimenting with new cities that never manage to get off the ground. At their best, cities are environments in which people can earn incomes, raise healthy families, and find meaning in their lives. We&rsquo;re working with governments to realize a world in which every family can choose between several safe, vibrant, and economically dynamic cities, each of which is vying to attract them as residents.

making major investments in infrastructure, public transportation, and environmental sustainability, and drawing international attention as a model of advanced urban planning. Through course work, internships, and research projects, this program gives students first-hand exposure to the complex issues associated with urbanization.   At the start of the 20th century, only one person out of every ten lived in a city. Today, half the world's population is urbanized. United Nations projections suggest that more than 70 percent will reside in cities by 2050, with the largest increases expected in the developing world. The multidisciplinary concentration in Urbanization focuses on this process \u2014 the forces that drive it, the cities it creates, and their impacts on well-being and social interactions. Encompassing the social, economic, political, and physical dimensions of urbanization, the concentration provides students with a cross-disciplinary set of perspectives for understanding the urbanization process, across cultures, countries, and time.   The concentration is inherently global in nature, with a particular concern for the role of urbanization in the developing world, the multicultural nature of much of current urbanization, and the intersection of this process with the environment and associated issues.                             Requirements   Students who elect to take this multidisciplinary concentration take four approved courses, with at least one course selected from the electives designed specifically for the Urbanization concentration.

As the German capital, Berlin saw the transition of the German Empire to a functioning if turbulent democratic state in 1918. The rise of the Nazis to power and their defeat in WW II led to the notorious division of the city which then belonged to two states. When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, German reunification was imminent. The course will engage with Berlin as a city of memory as represented in places and reflected in literature. Visits include: Checkpoint Charlie; the Berlin Wall; the Reichstag; the Olympic stadium and village; the Bauhaus Archive and Museum; and the Gem&auml;ldegalerie.

COREI-AD 16 Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments                                                                              Over half of the human population lives within 100km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the worlds largest cities. As a result, the world&#39;s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to explain the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several NYU sites globaly and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

As a result, Australia&#39;s coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of Sydney, Australia&#39;s largest city, as a case study to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas worldwide. Using Sydney&#39;s terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a natural laboratory for field research, students will collect environmental data throughout the city and use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to examine the spatial patterns of human impacts to Sydney&#39;s environment and to compare their results with patterns observed in other coastal cities.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

They are spaces for deliberation and collective action. This class explores the reasons why most humans now live in cities, why cities rise and decline, and how they become sites and stakes of political protest. We start by examining the politics of urban development in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and by analyzing three urban protests, in early 1990s Riyadh, in Cairo during the Egyptian revolution, and in New York City during the Occupy Wall Street movement. We then explore the concomitant processes of city making and politicization as analyzed by Plato, Ibn Khaldun, Hegel, Engels, Marx, Weber, Freud, and Simmel. The last part of the course is dedicated to interdisciplinary urban studies, from urban anthropology to the history of urban planning and to subaltern urbanism. In-class sessions are complemented by field visits to Abu Dhabi and Dubai.                       This course is writing intensive .

Similarities and differences between the patterns that have occurred in many of the sub-Saharan economies and those of other countries and in other times will be discussed. Emphasis is given to the range of factors involved: history, politics, demographics, urban planning, climate change, and economics. Accra is a particularly interesting location for this course as Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to become independent following World War II, and its leadership was advised by one of the leading development economists, Nobel Prize winner Arthur Lewis, who gave considerable attention to the role of cities in the development process. The course also considers the important roles played by slavery, the structural adjustment programs, and the colonial urban planning policies drawing out their implications for Ghana&#39;s economic development and its urbanization. A number of site visits to other cities will be included.

HIST-AD 117 Urbanism and Modernity: Paris, Istanbul, Berlin                                                                   This course explores the emergence of the &ldquo;modern city&rdquo; in three significant urban centers (Paris, Istanbul, Berlin) in relation to the demographic, economic, and political pressures of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Attention is given to the foundations of community, the changing uses of public space, the appearance of new strategies of urban planning, and the contested process of defining the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; within a specific local culture.

MDURB-AD 122J Cities and Consumption                                                                              Consumption of objects, images, and places is central to the culture and economy of modern life. The class addresses three questions: Why do we want things? How do physical places organize our consumer desires? And how does place become an object of consumption? This class explores how the relationship between consumption and cities has developed by examining three key moments: world fairs and the invention of the department store in the late nineteenth century; the rise of malls in the mid-20th century and the contemporary period of digital commerce and the global commodity city. Readings include Thorstein Veblen&rsquo;s Theory of the Leisure Class, Karl Marx&rsquo;s essay on commodity fetishism, Max Weber&rsquo;s essays on economy and society, Georg Simmel&rsquo;s Metropolis and Mental Life and selections from Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s Arcades project. We relate these texts to changing forms of consumption in different settings, from Argentina to China and the United States. Site visits in Buenos Aires help deepen our analysis of cities and consumption, and illuminate our surroundings.

MDURB-AD 123J Nature of Urban Design: a New York Perspective on Resilience                                             This course is an introduction to the role of urban design in global sustainability. The first step is to understand how cities affect climate and how climate affects cities by examining New York as a model. New York is a coastal city faced with the simultaneous requirement to grow its population by a million people yet to improve the quality of its civic life when climate events threaten both its urban fabric and critical infrastructure. How New York uses urban design not just to survive but to thrive is the subject of this course, introducing the people, products, and processes of urban design. The city itself frequently serves as classroom, with students exploring and recording examples of urban design through the neighborhoods they transform.

MDURB-AD 124J Urban Form of Shanghai                                                                   Shanghai has evolved markedly through key stages in the history of urban form, vestiges of which are found within the city today: an old walled \"Chinese city\"; tree-lined boulevards and commercial avenues of 19th and 20th century foreign settlements; and suburban development in Pudong. This class examines each key stage, combining readings with in situ urban inquiry. Readings cover Chinese reflections on the city in general and Shanghai in particular, as well as urban studies classics like Lewis Mumford&rsquo;s The Culture of Cities Trips take students to historically significant cultural spaces, including the old City God Temple, Fuzhou Road Bookshops, alleyway houses, The Peace Hotel, the Great World amusement park, People&rsquo;s Park, the Moganshan Road contemporary art complex, as well as nearby waterway towns that illustrate aspects of Shanghai&rsquo;s history before urbanization.

MDURB-AD 125J Global City                                             Cities are our most powerful engines of growth and increasingly the economic organizing units of our time. More than half the world&rsquo;s population lives in cities and urban areas, a figure that grow to 70 percent by 2050. We will look in detail at great global cities across the world, giving students the concepts and tools to understand their evolution and the critical roles they play in economic, social, cultural and human development.

MDURB-AD 126J Cities, Nations, and Globalization                                             What is globalization and when did it begin? What is the difference between an imperial city and a global capital? Imperial London provides a way to explore this question, and New York, which was not capital of a vast colonial empire, provides a useful comparison case. There is also the question of globalization&rsquo;s impact on the relation between cities and nations? More directly, have global cities outgrown their host nations? Is globalization a new iteration of the world economy, or is it more multi-faceted, with social, political, and cultural implications, including new dimensions of citizenship and social movements? Can one &quot;read&quot; shift from the age of empire to that of globalization in the built environment of the city of London, New York, Jakarta, or Ho Chi Minh City? Assignments includes literary sources and visual analysis as well as social science and humanistic scholarship.    *Note: Students in the NYUNY Metropolitan Studies Dept: This course counts for the major and minor                                                                       January 2014                                                                                          Tom Bender                                                                                         Taught in London, England                                          This course appears in...

MDURB-AD 127J Public Space and the Life of Cities                                             Public spaces play an essential role in the life of cities and their residents. Public squares and parks, streets and esplanades&mdash;these are often the signature spaces that constitute a city&rsquo;s distinctive identity. They are also the settings of everyday life, mixing bowls where a city&rsquo;s diverse communities interact, forums for individual as well as collective action and expression. This course explores the nature of public space in cities around the world, with attention to their physical character and design, their history, their pictorial and literary representation, and the political and social practices that activate public space. We will explore three overarching questions. What do we mean by &ldquo;public&rdquo; and &ldquo;public space&rdquo;? What are common characteristics of public spaces and how do people use them? And why are public spaces important to city life? In addition to historical and contemporary squares and streetscapes of Europe and the Middle East, we will draw upon case studies in Sydney as well as the hometowns of our students.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

SRPP-AD 141 Urban Poverty and Social Policy                                                                   This course explores theoretical and empirical connections between economic development, urbanization, urban poverty and distress and state/non-state responses to urban poverty and distress. It begins with an exploration of theoretical and conceptual perspectives on urbanization and welfare state policies, then moves on to examine illustrative cases from global north and south cities that challenge and complicate reigning theories and concepts. The course begins with an historical and contemporary analysis of urban poverty in Global North cities (New York, Paris and London), then moves on to an examination of emergent urban poverty patterns and cases in rapidly-changing &ldquo;semi-peripheral&rdquo; regions (China, for example), and finally explores urban poverty in a wide variety of Global South cities (spanning Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia). The course will use examples from the U.S. to explore certain key topics/concepts for debate, such as &ldquo;underclass,&rdquo; &ldquo;informality,&rdquo; &ldquo;feminization of poverty,&rdquo; &ldquo;culture of poverty,&rdquo; &ldquo;prison industrial complex,&rdquo; and &ldquo;neo-liberal welfare state retrenchment.&rdquo; Students will be asked to compare and contrast historical and contemporary patterns of urban poverty across global north and south regions, with a focus on the limits and possibilities of social policies (state- and non-state-sponsored) for addressing urban distress.
