Students are required to complete 50-70 pages of a full-length screenplay with an outline of the rest.

Playwriting I    NCRD-UT 30       A playwriting workshop required of all Dramatic Writing majors and designed for the beginning playwright. Students are required to complete 50-70 pages of a full-length stage play with an outline of the complete play. The first third of the course focuses on exercises to help students develop a story idea with the complexity and depth to sustain a full-length play. The reading and analysis of four to six dramatic texts is required in conjunction with the student\u2019s original work. Students must come to the first class with two ideas for a full-length play. Each idea should be described in a one page summary.  Non-credit tuition: $2,683  View course schedule .     Intro to Writing the Half-Hour Comedy    NCRD-UT 8005       This intensive scriptwriting class answers the question, \u201cWhat do I need to break into TV writing?\u201d The student will be guided through the step-by-step development of an episode for an ongoing TV sitcom, from premise line to one-page outline, to pages and revisions. The course requires the completion of a polished draft while introducing students to the rigors of professional standards through weekly story goals. The course is taught by a professional television writer.  Non-credit tuition: $2,683  View course schedule . Writing the One-Hour Television Drama         NCRD-UT 8008 Pre-requisite: Intro to Writing the Half-Hour Comedy    A course for starting a one-hour dramatic script, OR for revising/completing a One-Hour script begun last year. (Students will arrive at this class at different levels of expertise.) For those students new to writing a One-Hour, this television workshop course takes the student step by step through writing their own script for an ongoing one-hour television dramatic series. The course will go from premise lines, through the outline, to writing a solid draft of the script. This is a high-level course that prepares students for the professional world. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule . Sketch Comedy Writing NCRD-UT 8012 This is a sketch writing workshop class. A survey of sketch genres and approaches will be integrated with writing assignments and rewriting of one's own sketches: both privately and collaboratively. The goal is for each student to emerge from the class with several polished sketches. For this class, it helps to have a good sense of humor that you want to get even better at putting down on the page. There will be a lot of group critiquing and occasionally group rewriting. So it helps to stop thinking that your first draft is perfect. Because it isn't. This can be a pretty wild class, so it also helps to never think that comedy can go \"too far.\" The course may have a guest lecturer. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule .

The core course is taught by Archie Tait, one of the UK\u2019s longest-established distributors   of World Cinema, introducing the work of directors Terence Davies, Jim   Jarmusch, Pedro Almodovar, Chen Kaige, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Luc Besson and   many others. Classes are held at the University of London\u2019s Senate House. The first half of the semester examines the principles of creating unique scripts for film and television. Toward the end of the semester, you participate in readings, workshops and appraise the work you and your classmates create. At the end of the semester, just as for the playwrights in the fall semester, there is a rehearsed reading of a section of your screenplay. You cast the actors from the RADA program having had the chance to watch them at work in one of their Shakespeare play projects. This is an exciting collaboration with actors fresh from their Shakespeare training presenting brand new contemporary work by new screenwriters. The audience is made up of all the students on the London Program together with some faculty members and guests. This is a crucial part of the London program when everyone comes together at the end of the semester to celebrate the work that has been achieved.
