An intensive production course for students interested in exploring the   creative and commercial aspects of producing &amp; directing TV   commercials, music videos and branded entertainment. As screen sizes   decrease, opportunities have increased for emerging technologies to   facilitate the production and distribution of both long and short form   film, video and animation based projects. Students produce work that   results in a series of final projects to live on a class Vimeo page, and   will serve as the basis of their own demo reel. Each student   conceives, pitches and directs 3 main short form projects, varying in   length from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Industry guest speakers visit the class and field trips are taken to NY production facilities.
