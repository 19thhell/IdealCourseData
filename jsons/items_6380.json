Description       In the aftermath of the Holocaust, Primo Levi wrote, \u201cNever forget that this has happened.\u201d Levi\u2019s imperative raises important questions about the role of memory in the aftermath of atrocity and crisis. What is the difference between individual and collective memory? What is the purpose of remembering atrocity? What is the relationship between memory and justice? What gets forgotten in the collective memory and why? How might the memory of everyday crisis and long-term conflict figure into this framework? We will pursue such questions by examining specific genres and forms of collective memory that have contributed to understandings of atrocity and crisis in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries in particular. We will consider how tribunals, memorials, archives, novels, and film have shaped, challenged, and revised the politics of remembering and forgetting contemporary atrocity and crisis. In addition to informal response papers, students will write 3 formal essays over the course of the semester. Readings may include works by Maurice Halbwachs, Karl Jaspers, Hannah Arendt, Maya Lin, and Toni Morrison.

First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

Description       In the aftermath of the Holocaust, Primo Levi wrote, \u201cNever forget that this has happened.\u201d Levi\u2019s imperative raises important questions about the role of memory in the aftermath of atrocity and crisis. What is the difference between individual and collective memory? What is the purpose of remembering atrocity? What is the relationship between memory and justice? What gets forgotten in the collective memory and why? How might the memory of everyday crisis and long-term conflict figure into this framework? We will pursue such questions by examining specific genres and forms of collective memory that have contributed to understandings of atrocity and crisis in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries in particular. We will consider how tribunals, memorials, archives, novels, and film have shaped, challenged, and revised the politics of remembering and forgetting contemporary atrocity and crisis. In addition to informal response papers, students will write 3 formal essays over the course of the semester. Readings may include works by Maurice Halbwachs, Karl Jaspers, Hannah Arendt, Maya Lin, and Toni Morrison.

First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

Description       In the aftermath of the Holocaust, Primo Levi wrote, \u201cNever forget that this has happened.\u201d Levi\u2019s imperative raises important questions about the role of memory in the aftermath of atrocity and crisis. What is the difference between individual and collective memory? What is the purpose of remembering atrocity? What is the relationship between memory and justice? What gets forgotten in the collective memory and why? How might the memory of everyday crisis and long-term conflict figure into this framework? We will pursue such questions by examining specific genres and forms of collective memory that have contributed to understandings of atrocity and crisis in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries in particular. We will consider how tribunals, memorials, archives, novels, and film have shaped, challenged, and revised the politics of remembering and forgetting contemporary atrocity and crisis. In addition to informal response papers, students will write 3 formal essays over the course of the semester. Readings may include works by Maurice Halbwachs, Karl Jaspers, Hannah Arendt, Maya Lin, and Toni Morrison.

First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.
