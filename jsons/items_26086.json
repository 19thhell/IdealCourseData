Art Form            April 23 - 26, 2009 NYU&#39;s Program in Educational Theatre has been a leader in  investigating and engaging in the teaching of theatre for the past four  decades. Currently, through our extensive curricular offerings (which range  from undergraduate to doctoral programs of study), we, as practitioners, are constantly  exploring new ways to reinvigorate our pedagogical approaches in order to keep  them both vital and innovative.      The goal of this forum is to facilitate dynamic exchange  with the best teachers of theatre on all educational levels and to talk about  what works in theory, in practice, and the space between -- sharing  inspirations, challenges and discoveries -- whether in teaching and presenting  the art form, integrating drama into any given theatre curriculum, or engaging  in teacher preparation.
