The study of Irish society and culture provides students  with an understanding of Ireland's historical experience: its colonial past;  its contribution to literature, both medieval and modern; its far-reaching  effect in the modern world through its diaspora; and its dual language  tradition and rival national narratives.          The  Irish studies minor at NYU offers an interdisciplinary program providing students  with the opportunity to study and pursue directed research in the history and  culture of Ireland and Irish America, exploring such areas as literature,  history, drama, politics, art, cinema studies, music, and the Irish language. A  faculty of internationally renowned scholars is supplemented by the regular  presence of prominent visiting professors. In addition to the program at  Washington Square, the Arts and Science summer program in Dublin gives students  the opportunity to study in Ireland.          Through  the generosity of Lewis L. and Loretta Brennan Glucksman, two landmark houses  in Washington Mews were renovated to serve as the home for Ireland House. Since  its official opening in 1993, Glucksman  Ireland House has become one of the  most vibrant centers of Irish and Irish American arts and learning in North  America. It offers a lively array of programs that are free to students,  including evening courses, public lectures, conferences, films, exhibits, and  readings.
