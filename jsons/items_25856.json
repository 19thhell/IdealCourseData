LabVIEW is a graphical programming language that uses software to stimulate hardware devices that may be custom-tailored to meet the needs of researchers. LabVIEW utilizes a series of icons that represent data collection, mathematical, statistical, & file management functions. Icons are ?wired? together to establish a directional flow of information in somewhat the same way that transistors, diodes, & computer chips are wired or soldered together on circuit boards. Data may be displayed in various graphical or tabular formats in real time or saved to memory for later analysis.
