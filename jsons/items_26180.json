New Student Seminar    Liberal Arts Requirements       Expository Writing    Foreign Language    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry          Liberal Arts Electives    Electives    Specialization Requirement    Units (Credits) by Examination    Advanced Placement Program    The Academic Planner for New Undergraduate and Transfer Students    UG Student Resources                New Student Seminar    During their first term (semester) in residence, incoming freshmen and transfer students must register for the New Student Seminar (SAHS-UE 1, formerly E03.0001). The New Student Seminar is a zero-unit (non-credit) course given on a pass/fail basis, organized by curriculum, to explore professional issues and to provide ongoing orientation and guidance for new students.    Liberal Arts Requirements    The Core Curriculum (CORE) of the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development is an approach that immerses students in comparative, critical, exploratory, and interdisciplinary studies and seeks to build students' knowledge base through sequentially-designed courses in the liberal arts.    In general, undergraduate students may use NYU study abroad course work to satisfy the Core Curriculum and/or liberal arts and/or unrestricted elective requirements, according to the Core Curriculum Equivalency Chart .    Steinhardt's Liberal Arts Core (ST-CORE-UE) courses expand the options available to Steinhardt students in NYU's Core Curriculum and are listed below.    The Core Curriculum exposes students to methods of analysis and forms of expression that are the bedrock of intellectual development in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Each major at Steinhardt requires completion of some liberal arts courses through the Core Curriculum. Core Curriculum requirements are tailored to complement coursework in the major and vary slightly by fields and programs of study. The Core Curriculum has four components:    &bull; Expository Writing &bull; Foreign Language &bull; the Humanities/Social Science sequence called Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) &bull; the Mathematics/Natural Science sequence called Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI).     Expository Writing    NYU Steinhardt students must complete two courses in expository writing and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination.    Freshmen students who complete EXPOS-UA 1(was V40.0100), Writing the Essay, with a grade of \"C\" or better are certified as proficient, and are not required to sit for the exam. In addition, students must enroll in and successfully complete ACE-UE 110 (was E52.0110), The Advanced College Essay: Education and the Professions.    Students enrolled in the Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP) completing EXPOS-UA 5 (was V40.0005) and EXPOS-UA 6 (was V40.0006) Prose Writing I and II with grades of \"C\" or better are deemed proficient.  Transfer students entering the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development must pass the Proficiency Examination administered by the Expository Writing Program. This exam determines whether additional coursework in Expository Writing will be required for proficiency certification and is given during orientation.    Transfer students who pass the examination and transfer in two courses in writing composition or the equivalent will not be required to complete additional course work in expository writing.    If the students pass and transfer in only one course, they will be required to complete EXPOS-UA 1 (was V40.0005), Writing the Essay. This course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students taken in two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    If the students fail and have received transfer units (credits) for either one or two courses in expository writing or the equivalent, they will be required to complete at least one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 13 (was V40.0013) Writing Tutorial, or EXPOS-UA 4 (was V40.0004) International Writing Workshop 1 as determined by the Expository Writing Program.    Placement may vary depending on the writing issues present in the examination. Students who achieve a letter grade of \"C\" or above in Writing Tutorial are certified as proficient. Students who do not achieve a \"C\" or above must take the Proficiency Exam.    International Students completing EXPOS-UA 4 (was V40.0004) / EXPOS-UA 9 (was V40.0009 International Writing Workshop 1/International Writing Workshop 2) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. If the students fail, they will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 13 (was V40.0013), Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Languages    Steinhardt students must complete the foreign language requirement of the Core Curriculum as listed on their program of study. Students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement. American Sign Language courses may satisfy the foreign language requirement:       ASL-UE 91 (was E64.0091), American Sign Language I    ASL-UE 92 (was E64.0092), American Sign Language II    ASL-UE 93 (was E64.0093), American Sign Language III    ASL-UE 94 (was E64.0094), American Sign Language IV       Placement examinations are required of undergraduate students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual). The results of these examinations do not exempt students from taking these courses but assist in determining the appropriate level of courses in these areas.    Examinations are available for                Arabic          Chinese (Cantonese, Mandarin)          French                Gaelic          German          Modern Greek                Hebrew          Hindi/Urdu          Italian                Japanese          Korean          Latin                Persian/Farsi          Portuguese          Russian                Spanish          Tagalog/Filipino          Turkish                The placement exams are also offered during the first week of classes as well as once a month throughout the term. See the placement test schedule .    Please note that the placement tests for the following languages are administered and scored in the departments listed below.    Arabic, Hindu/Urdu, Persian/Farsi, Turkish Department of Middle Eastern Studies Kevorkian Center 50 Washington Square South 212-998-8877    Cantonese Department of Social and Cultural Analysis 41 E. 11th Street, 7th Floor 212-998-3700    Gaelic Program in Irish Studies Glucksman Ireland House 1 Washington Mews 212-998-3950    Mandarin, Japanese Program in East Asian Studies 715 Broadway, 3rd Floor 212-998-7620    The following applies to transfer students who wish to enroll in literature courses taught in a foreign language:    Transfer students who have completed a fourth-semester college course in a foreign language and who wish to enroll in a literature course taught in that language must take the placement test if one is appropriate and offered. If a placement examination is not offered, consult with the language department prior to registration.    Transfer students who have completed an advanced literature course taught in a foreign language at another institution and who wish to take additional literature courses taught in the same language must consult with an advisor in the appropriate language department prior to registering for such a course.    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes. The four courses are Text and Ideas, Cultures and Contexts, Societies and the Social Sciences, and Expressive Cultures. Overall, the structure of the FCC ensures that every student gains a common core of skills and experiences in the liberal arts.    In addition to the information on the Foundations of Contemporary Culture provided in the NYUSteinhardt undergraduate bulletin , detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the Core Curriculum website .    The College of Arts and Sciences no longer offers specific Societies and the Social Sciences courses. Students may select from either Steinhardt or the CAS courses listed below    Steinhardt courses that will satisfy the Societies and the Social Sciences requirement:    SOED-UE 1030 (was E20.1030) Art and the City: A Sociological Perspective INTE-UE 1545 (was E53.1545) Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the New Immigration HSED-UE 610 (was E55.0610) Education and the American Dream HSED-UE 1010 (was E55.1010) History of American Professions HSED-UE (was E55.1033) Culture Wars in America MCC-UE 1 (was E59.0001) Introduction to Media Studies MCC-UE 3 (was E59.0003) History of Communication MCC-UE 5 (was E59.0005) Introduction to Human Communication and Culture    Steinhardt courses that will satisfy the Expressive Cultures requirement:    ART-UE 1220 (was E90.1220) Introduction to Visual Culture    College of Arts and Sciences courses that will satisfy the Societies and the Social Sciences requirement:    Anthropology ANTH-UA 1 (was V14.0001) Human Society and Culture ANTH-UA 3 (was V14.0003) Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures    Economics ECON-UA 1 (was V31.0001) Economic Principles I (P) ECON-UA 2 (was V31.0002) Economic Principles II (P)    History HIST-UA 9 (was V57.0009) U.S. History to 1865 HIST-UA 10 (was V57.0010) Modern America    Linguistics LING-UA 1 (was V61.0001) Language LING-UA 2 (was V61.0002) Introduction to Linguistics LING-UA 15 (was V61.0015) Language and Society LING-UA 47 (was V61.0047) The Language of America's Ethnic Minorities LING_UA 30 (V61.0030) Language in Latin America    Politics POL-UA 300 (was V53.0300) Power and Politics in America POL-UA 500 (was V53.0500) Comparative Politics    Psychology PSYCH-UA 1 (was V89.0001) Introduction to Psychology  Religious Studies RELST-UA 1 (was V90.0001) Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion    Social and Cultural Analysis SCA-UA 1 (was V18.0001) Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis SCA-UA 401 (was V18.0401) Approaches to Gender and Sexuality Studies SCAA-UA 601 (was V18.0601) Approaches to Metropolitan Studies    Sociology SOC-UA 1 (was V93.0001) Introduction to Sociology SOC-UA 2 (was V93.0002) Introduction to Sociology (Honors) SOC-UA 133 (was V93.0133) Comparative Modern Societies: 3rd Reich and the Holocaust SOC-UA 135 (was V93.0135) Race and Ethnicity SOC-UA 205 (was V93.0205) Social Movements, Protest, and Conflict SOC-UA 386 (was V93.0386) American Ideas and Institutions SOC-UA 413 (was V93.0413) Law in Society    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry    The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) component of the Core Curriculum is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reasoning and the natural sciences. The three areas are Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Sciences I, and Natural Sciences II. Together, these courses ensure that every student gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through other coursework, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the need of non-science students. Within each of the three offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes.    In addition to the information on the Foundations of Scientific Inquiry provided in the Steinhardt undergraduate bulletin and detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the Core Curriculum website .    Quantitative Reasoning/Mathematics Requirement    Courses that will satisfy Steinhardt's Quantitative Reasoning/Mathematics Requirement:    AP units (credits) for Calculus (Mathematics AB or BC) ECON-UA 18 Statistics (Prerequisites: MATH-UA 12, formerly V63.0121) with a minimum grade of C or CALCAB or CALCBC with a score of 4). Restriction: Not open to students who have taken ECON-UA 20 {was V31.0020} POL-UA 800 (was V53.0800) Quantitative Methods in Political Science CORE-UA 101 (was V55.0101) Quantitative Reasoning: Math Patterns in Nature CORE-UA 105 (was V55.0105) Quantitative Reasoning: Elementary Statistics CORE-UA 107 (was V55.01070 Quantitative Reasoning: Probability, Statistics, &amp; Decision-Making MATH-UA 9 (was V63.0009) Pre-Calculus Mathematics CORE-UA 105 {was V55.0105) QR: Elementary Statistics MATH-UA 17 (was V63.0017) Calculus for the Social Sciences MATH-UA 143 (was V63.0143) Calculus I for Biological and Life Sciences MATH-UA 121 (was V63.0121) Calculus I PSYCH-UA 9 (was V89.0009) Statistical Reasoning for the Behavioral Sciences (Cancelled - Fall 2007) PSYCH-UA 10 (was V89.0010) Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences    Liberal Arts Electives    The liberal arts provide broad, general knowledge and develop students' theoretical understanding rather than particular or specific professional ability. Students are encouraged to enroll in courses of a general or theoretical nature that are designed to develop judgment and understanding about human beings' relationship to the social, cultural, and natural facets of their total environment.    Electives    Electives are students' choice of course work taken outside the core or liberal arts requirement, but should be discussed with his/her advisor. Certain restrictions must be observed and are outlined on the Program of Study. Electives may be listed under either of two categories:    Unrestricted Electives: General course permitted within the Program of Study Restricted Electives: Specific courses outlined in the Program of Study    Specialization Requirements    General education or the liberal arts expose students to the breadth of knowledge and provides the framework for interdisciplinary inquiry. Specialization or major courses, on the other hand, presents the depth of knowledge in a discipline or field of study. Specialization courses concentrate on the skills or competencies that are required in the students' primary field of study.    Credit by Examination    The Advanced Placement Program (AP), International Baccalaureate Program (IB), and the results of some foreign maturity certificate examinations enable undergraduate students to receive credit toward the bachelor's degree on the basis of performance in college-level examinations or proficiency examinations related to the school's degree requirements, subject to the approval of the school. Please see the undergraduate bulletin for more information.    The Advanced Placement Program    NYU Steinhardt students may receive college credit toward their degree for test results of 5 or 4 depending on the subject examination. Students receiving credit toward their degree may not take the corresponding college-level course for credit. If they do, they will lose the Advanced Placement credit. The maximum number of transferable units (credits) by examination shall not exceed a total of 32 for all applicants. For AP examination course equivalents, please click here .
