[{"detail": [{"content": "Taking payments when patrons have been referred to collections                                  Collecting fines from patrons who have been referred to National Credit Systems      General information    Collections accounts will be created when a patron owes a balance of $50 or more ($25 or  more at Cooper Union library) for 120  days. Only the portion of the patron's balance which is 120 days past due will be sent to the  collection agency. Therefore, patrons might owe more than the amount for which they have  received collections notices.         When you receive your monthly list of patrons who are being referred for collections,  go through and put a note at the beginning of the comments in each patron's record:            CA [date] [amount] [location] [initials]                Also create a Family Block with the same note text.     The instructions below refer only to balances which are 120 days past due and have been  referred to the collection agency. If a patron owes both a 120-day-past-due balance and a more  recent balance, the more recent balance may be left unpaid without affecting the patron's current  collections account. Thus payment \"in full\" as described below means payment of the patron's  120-day-past-due account in full, and not necessarily the payment of all fees on a patron's record.        Accepting payments      Patrons who owe balances to only one agency will be considered first. Patrons who owe  balances to multiple agencies will be considered below.      Balances owed to your location ONLY      Balances paid in full:      The staff member taking the payment will give the patron the printed Advance receipt; if  the  patron is paying over the phone or by mail, the receipt will be mailed to the patron.    The patron's Advance record will be printed and given to a supervisor. Towards the end  of each day, the supervisor will go online and stop the collection (when this is impractical or  impossible, the supervisor will do it first thing in the morning). A printout of the patron's  record will be mailed to him/her.   If the patron needs to be sure that the collection has been stopped, a supervisor will go  online immediately, stop the account, and give a printout to the staff member to give to the  patron.   If no supervisor is available and a patron needs to be sure that the collection has been  stopped, the staff member will follow the step-by-step instructions to  stop the account online, and will give a printout to the patron and to the supervisor.   The notes in the patron's comments and the family block will be removed as the final  step.       Balances paid in part:      Arranging payment plans      If a patron wishes to arrange a payment plan, they MUST be  referred to a supervisor. The  supervisor will arrange an appropriate plan and document it in the patron's comments.    When the supervisor goes online to apply the payment (towards the end of each day, or when  this is impractical or impossible, first thing in the morning) the account will also be  suspended. This will temporarily stop the collection agency from pursuing the account. A  printout of the patron's account and the comments detailing his/her payment plan will be  placed in the \"Monthly records to be checked\" file. Records in this file will be reviewed once  a month to ensure that patrons are maintaining their arranged payment plans. Patrons who fall  behind their plans will have their accounts reinstated, allowing the collection agency to  continue its pursuit of the outstanding balance.   Each time the patron makes a payment towards his/her arranged plan, they will be given  or mailed a receipt from Advance and the patron's Advance record will be printed and given to  a  supervisor.   A printout of the patron's record will be mailed to him/her each time a payment is made.  When the balance has been paid in full, the account will be closed out.    The notes in the patron's comments and the family block will be removed as the final step.     If a partial payment is made without a payment plan being  arranged:      If the patron is paying off less than the entire amount which is 120 days past due, the  collection WILL NOT be stopped.   The staff member accepting the payment will be sure to inform the patron that the  collection agency will not stop its pursuit of the remaining balance. The person taking the  payment will give the patron the printed Advance receipt; if the patron is paying over the  phone  or by mail, the receipt will be mailed to the patron.    The patron's Advance record will be printed and given to a supervisor. Towards the end  of each day, the supervisor will go online and apply the payment (when this is impractical or  impossible, the supervisor will do it first thing in the morning). A printout of the patron's  record  will be mailed to him/her.          Balances owed to multiple agencies      Your location's balance paid in full, amount still owed to another  agency:      The staff member accepting the payment will make sure to inform the patron that only part  of the past-due balance is owed to your location, and will be told what part of the balance is  owed to which agency or agencies. The patron will be informed that the collection will not be  stopped until the balances have been cleared at all of the agencies to which they are owed.    The person taking the payment will give the patron the printed Advance receipt; if the  patron is paying over the phone or by mail, the receipt will be mailed to the patron.   The patron's Advance record will be printed and given to a supervisor. Towards the end  of each day, the supervisor will go online and apply the payment (when this is impractical or  impossible, the supervisor will do it first thing in the morning). A printout of the patron's  record  will be mailed to him/her.   Your location's notes in the patron's comments and your Family Block (both of which are  agency-specific) will be cleared.     Your location's balance paid in part, amount still owed to other  agencies:      If a patron wishes to arrange a payment plan, they MUST be referred to a supervisor. The  supervisor will contact the circulation heads at all other agencies to which balances are owed  on  the collections account and will arrange an acceptable payment plan. The plan should be global,  that is, it should go smoothly from agency to agency as the patron pays off the balance, without  new arrangements needing to be made.   When the payment plan has been approved by all relevant circ heads, the patron will be  informed. It will be explained to the patron that once the balance owed to your location is paid in  full, payments will need to be continued at the relevant agency or agencies until the entire  balance is paid in full.   When the supervisor goes online to apply the initial payment (towards the end of the day, or  when  this is impractical or impossible, first thing in the morning) the account will also be  suspended. This will temporarily stop the collection agency from pursuing the account. A  printout of the patron's account and the comments detailing his/her payment plan will be  placed in the \"Monthly records to be checked\" file. Records in this file will be reviewed once  a month to ensure that patrons are maintaining their arranged payment plans. Patrons who fall  behind their plans will have their accounts reactivated, allowing the collection agency to  continue its pursuit of the outstanding balance.   Each time the patron makes a payment towards his/her arranged plan, they will be given  or mailed a receipt from Advance. The patron's Advance record will be printed and given to a  supervisor. The supervisor will update the account, applying the payment at the same time that  other account updates are made. A printout of the patron's record will be mailed to him/her.    When your location's balance has been paid in full, your notes in the patron's comments  and your Family Block will be removed. The circulation heads of the other agencies to which  balances are owed on the account will be informed that your location's balance has been paid  off, and it will then be the responsibility of the next agency in line to monitor the patron's  payments and to remove the patron from collections when the balance is paid off (or to pass the  account along to the next agency when appropriate).     Your location's balance paid in part, without a payment plan being  arranged:      The same procedures will be followed as when a patron pays part of his/her balance and  does not owe a balance to any other agency. The collection WILL NOT be stopped.   The patron will be informed that only part of the past-due balance is owed to your  location, and will be told what part of the balance is owed to which agency or agencies. The  patron will be  informed that the collection will not be stopped until the balances have been cleared at all of the  agencies to which they are owed.

{"detail": [{"content": "Taking payments when patrons have been referred to collections                                  Collecting fines from patrons who have been referred to National Credit Systems      General information    Collections accounts will be created when a patron owes a balance of $50 or more ($25 or  more at Cooper Union library) for 120  days. Only the portion of the patron's balance which is 120 days past due will be sent to the  collection agency. Therefore, patrons might owe more than the amount for which they have  received collections notices.         When you receive your monthly list of patrons who are being referred for collections,  go through and put a note at the beginning of the comments in each patron's record:            CA [date] [amount] [location] [initials]                Also create a Family Block with the same note text.     The instructions below refer only to balances which are 120 days past due and have been  referred to the collection agency. If a patron owes both a 120-day-past-due balance and a more  recent balance, the more recent balance may be left unpaid without affecting the patron's current  collections account. Thus payment \"in full\" as described below means payment of the patron's  120-day-past-due account in full, and not necessarily the payment of all fees on a patron's record.        Accepting payments      Patrons who owe balances to only one agency will be considered first. Patrons who owe  balances to multiple agencies will be considered below.      Balances owed to your location ONLY      Balances paid in full:      The staff member taking the payment will give the patron the printed Advance receipt; if  the  patron is paying over the phone or by mail, the receipt will be mailed to the patron.    The patron's Advance record will be printed and given to a supervisor. Towards the end  of each day, the supervisor will go online and stop the collection (when this is impractical or  impossible, the supervisor will do it first thing in the morning). A printout of the patron's  record will be mailed to him/her.   If the patron needs to be sure that the collection has been stopped, a supervisor will go  online immediately, stop the account, and give a printout to the staff member to give to the  patron.   If no supervisor is available and a patron needs to be sure that the collection has been  stopped, the staff member will follow the step-by-step instructions to  stop the account online, and will give a printout to the patron and to the supervisor.   The notes in the patron's comments and the family block will be removed as the final  step.       Balances paid in part:      Arranging payment plans      If a patron wishes to arrange a payment plan, they MUST be  referred to a supervisor. The  supervisor will arrange an appropriate plan and document it in the patron's comments.    When the supervisor goes online to apply the payment (towards the end of each day, or when  this is impractical or impossible, first thing in the morning) the account will also be  suspended. This will temporarily stop the collection agency from pursuing the account. A  printout of the patron's account and the comments detailing his/her payment plan will be  placed in the \"Monthly records to be checked\" file. Records in this file will be reviewed once  a month to ensure that patrons are maintaining their arranged payment plans. Patrons who fall  behind their plans will have their accounts reinstated, allowing the collection agency to  continue its pursuit of the outstanding balance.   Each time the patron makes a payment towards his/her arranged plan, they will be given  or mailed a receipt from Advance and the patron's Advance record will be printed and given to  a  supervisor.   A printout of the patron's record will be mailed to him/her each time a payment is made.  When the balance has been paid in full, the account will be closed out.    The notes in the patron's comments and the family block will be removed as the final step.     If a partial payment is made without a payment plan being  arranged:      If the patron is paying off less than the entire amount which is 120 days past due, the  collection WILL NOT be stopped.   The staff member accepting the payment will be sure to inform the patron that the  collection agency will not stop its pursuit of the remaining balance. The person taking the  payment will give the patron the printed Advance receipt; if the patron is paying over the  phone  or by mail, the receipt will be mailed to the patron.    The patron's Advance record will be printed and given to a supervisor. Towards the end  of each day, the supervisor will go online and apply the payment (when this is impractical or  impossible, the supervisor will do it first thing in the morning). A printout of the patron's  record  will be mailed to him/her.          Balances owed to multiple agencies      Your location's balance paid in full, amount still owed to another  agency:      The staff member accepting the payment will make sure to inform the patron that only part  of the past-due balance is owed to your location, and will be told what part of the balance is  owed to which agency or agencies. The patron will be informed that the collection will not be  stopped until the balances have been cleared at all of the agencies to which they are owed.    The person taking the payment will give the patron the printed Advance receipt; if the  patron is paying over the phone or by mail, the receipt will be mailed to the patron.   The patron's Advance record will be printed and given to a supervisor. Towards the end  of each day, the supervisor will go online and apply the payment (when this is impractical or  impossible, the supervisor will do it first thing in the morning). A printout of the patron's  record  will be mailed to him/her.   Your location's notes in the patron's comments and your Family Block (both of which are  agency-specific) will be cleared.     Your location's balance paid in part, amount still owed to other  agencies:      If a patron wishes to arrange a payment plan, they MUST be referred to a supervisor. The  supervisor will contact the circulation heads at all other agencies to which balances are owed  on  the collections account and will arrange an acceptable payment plan. The plan should be global,  that is, it should go smoothly from agency to agency as the patron pays off the balance, without  new arrangements needing to be made.   When the payment plan has been approved by all relevant circ heads, the patron will be  informed. It will be explained to the patron that once the balance owed to your location is paid in  full, payments will need to be continued at the relevant agency or agencies until the entire  balance is paid in full.   When the supervisor goes online to apply the initial payment (towards the end of the day, or  when  this is impractical or impossible, first thing in the morning) the account will also be  suspended. This will temporarily stop the collection agency from pursuing the account. A  printout of the patron's account and the comments detailing his/her payment plan will be  placed in the \"Monthly records to be checked\" file. Records in this file will be reviewed once  a month to ensure that patrons are maintaining their arranged payment plans. Patrons who fall  behind their plans will have their accounts reactivated, allowing the collection agency to  continue its pursuit of the outstanding balance.   Each time the patron makes a payment towards his/her arranged plan, they will be given  or mailed a receipt from Advance. The patron's Advance record will be printed and given to a  supervisor. The supervisor will update the account, applying the payment at the same time that  other account updates are made. A printout of the patron's record will be mailed to him/her.    When your location's balance has been paid in full, your notes in the patron's comments  and your Family Block will be removed. The circulation heads of the other agencies to which  balances are owed on the account will be informed that your location's balance has been paid  off, and it will then be the responsibility of the next agency in line to monitor the patron's  payments and to remove the patron from collections when the balance is paid off (or to pass the  account along to the next agency when appropriate).     Your location's balance paid in part, without a payment plan being  arranged:      The same procedures will be followed as when a patron pays part of his/her balance and  does not owe a balance to any other agency. The collection WILL NOT be stopped.   The patron will be informed that only part of the past-due balance is owed to your  location, and will be told what part of the balance is owed to which agency or agencies. The  patron will be  informed that the collection will not be stopped until the balances have been cleared at all of the  agencies to which they are owed. The person taking the payment will give the patron the  printed  Advance receipt; if the patron is paying over the phone or by mail, the receipt will be mailed  to  the patron.    The patron's Advance record will be printed and given to a supervisor. Towards the end  of each day, the supervisor will go online and apply the payment (when this is impractical or  impossible, the supervisor will do it first thing in the morning). A printout of the patron's  record  will be mailed to him/her.
