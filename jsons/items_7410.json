Description       In Shifting Focus II, students will focus on the concrete tasks associated with video production and distribution, while at the same time investigating recent theoretical work relating to the impact of social networks on political organizing and how web 2.0 technologies alter the dynamics of video distribution. New tools and an ever changing technological environment call for a radical re-thinking of how video is, and can be, used within the context of community organizing, and yet the basic rules for how to make powerful, influential work remain mostly the same. In this course students will hone their craft as young media makers, while at the same time become web 2.0 strategists on how to deploy the media they make.

The moving image has long been used by grassroots political movements to mobilize constituencies in order to effect social change. Today, video has become an essential tool for social and political actors working on a wide array of issues. In part one of this hands-on class, students will examine the biases of corporate-controlled media; learn the theory and history of video activism; develop basic camera skills; and reflect on lessons learned in the field. Outside of class, students will break into groups and begin work on collaborative video projects with local community organizations; projects that will be completed in Shifting Focus II, in the Spring 2013 Semester.

Description       In Shifting Focus II, students will focus on the concrete tasks associated with video production and distribution, while at the same time investigating recent theoretical work relating to the impact of social networks on political organizing and how web 2.0 technologies alter the dynamics of video distribution. New tools and an ever changing technological environment call for a radical re-thinking of how video is, and can be, used within the context of community organizing, and yet the basic rules for how to make powerful, influential work remain mostly the same. In this course students will hone their craft as young media makers, while at the same time become web 2.0 strategists on how to deploy the media they make.

The moving image has long been used by grassroots political movements to mobilize constituencies in order to effect social change. Today, video has become an essential tool for social and political actors working on a wide array of issues. In part one of this hands-on class, students will examine the biases of corporate-controlled media; learn the theory and history of video activism; develop basic camera skills; and reflect on lessons learned in the field. Outside of class, students will break into groups and begin work on collaborative video projects with local community organizations; projects that will be completed in Shifting Focus II, in the Spring 2013 Semester. Readings will include selections from Noam Chomsky, Thomas Harding, and Harvey Molotch.

Description       In Shifting Focus II, students will focus on the concrete tasks associated with video production and distribution, while at the same time investigating recent theoretical work relating to the impact of social networks on political organizing and how web 2.0 technologies alter the dynamics of video distribution. New tools and an ever changing technological environment call for a radical re-thinking of how video is, and can be, used within the context of community organizing, and yet the basic rules for how to make powerful, influential work remain mostly the same. In this course students will hone their craft as young media makers, while at the same time become web 2.0 strategists on how to deploy the media they make.

The moving image has long been used by grassroots political movements to mobilize constituencies in order to effect social change. Today, video has become an essential tool for social and political actors working on a wide array of issues. In part one of this hands-on class, students will examine the biases of corporate-controlled media; learn the theory and history of video activism; develop basic camera skills; and reflect on lessons learned in the field. Outside of class, students will break into groups and begin work on collaborative video projects with local community organizations; projects that will be completed in Shifting Focus II, in the Spring 2013 Semester. Readings will include selections from Noam Chomsky, Thomas Harding, and Harvey Molotch.
