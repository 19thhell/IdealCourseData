Teaching and Learning at NYU Paris       French Immersion The two semesters spent in Paris allow students to immerse themselves in French language and culture as a means to improving and refining their language skills and socio-cultural expertise. Students work closely with French specialists in the field of foreign language acquisition, drawing on the expertise of the Department of Teaching French as a Foreign Language ( D&eacute;partement de didactique du fran&ccedil;ais langue &eacute;trang&egrave;re ) of the University of Paris III-Sorbonne Nouvelle, as well as the Institute of General and Applied Linguistics and Phonetics ( Institut de linguistique et de phon&eacute;tique g&eacute;n&eacute;rales et appliqu&eacute;es) through NYU Paris .          Pedagogical learning Specialists in the field of foreign language acquisition and authors of language textbooks are among the faculty from NYU Paris and from French universities who mentor students closely and guide them through a critical reflection of teaching and learning. Areas of academic inquiry include foreign language instruction, grammar, phonetics, socio- and psycho-linguistics, contemporary French civilization, French literature, the history of ideas, teaching pedagogy, and the teaching of French as a foreign language in France.          Field experiences During their two semesters in Paris , degree candidates observe French as a foreign language classes taught at NYU Paris (50 hours) and interact closely with teachers and students.       Teaching and Learning in New York    Course work in New York City takes place at NYU&rsquo;s Washington Square campus, located in the heart of Greenwich Village.       Pedagogical learning Core courses cover general pedagogical issues as well as knowledge critical to foreign language teaching and learning, and teaching English as a second language. These include: inquiries in teaching and learning, adolescent development, teaching students with special needs, and content-based pedagogical courses including intercultural perspectives, methods and techniques of communicative teaching, language through content, language assessment, and second language acquisition and research.          Field experiences Students complete their required two semesters of field experiences at New York City public schools, with one semester in a middle school or high school (student teaching in French) and a second semester in an elementary school (student teaching in TESOL).       Students also have an option to take an additional summer course to extend their certification to include teaching foreign languages at the K-6 level.    Degree Requirements    Students must enroll for full-time study (at least 12 points) for the two semesters at NYU Paris.
