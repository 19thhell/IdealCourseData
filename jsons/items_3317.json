While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain.

In recent years, the idea of \u201cthe three cultures\u201d of medieval Spain \u2014 Christianity, Islam and Judaism \u2014 has become a popular ideal and model for modernity among a wide variety of thinkers and writers; and both utopian and distopian visions of Sefarad and Andalus (the Hebrew and Arabic terms that refer to the Iberian Peninsula) permeate discourses on politics, religion and even education. This course will examine the ways in which that nostalgia for a lost Andalus or Sefarad is both explored as a theme and used as a device in a wide variety of modern novels and short stories (as well as some poetry), and the ways in which modern authors deploy this trope to comment on the worlds they inhabit. Reading medieval Spanish texts alongside the writing they inspired in modernity will provide a diachronic framework for better understanding medieval Iberian literature and will also raise questions about the salience of the past for the present.

The course takes as it's working model the question of art's relation to social movements, including: the rising tides of cultural and political nationalism in the Basque and Catalan regions; the Colonial Disaster of 1898 and the question of national regeneration; the impact of fin-de-siglo anarchist and worker's movements; the birth of authoritarian politics with the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera; and the ideological chaos and social violence unleashed during the Spanish Civil War) Class sessions examine the complex roles played by some of Spain's most prominent artists and architects -- Antoni Gaud\u00ed, Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\u00f3, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Josep Llu\u00eds Sert, and Salvador Dal\u00ed -- and their multivalent responses to modernization, political instability, and social praxis. The course is supplemented by regular visits to the Museo Nacional de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, Madrid's museum of modern art.

Cultures and Contexts: Spain \u0097At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America - CORE-UA 9544 - 4 points                               Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Sample Syllabus                                                                    The Politics of Climate Change - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               This course examines the interaction between two coupled systems, the Earth system and humanity\u2019s political systems. Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Current Social, Political and Urban Challenges to European Cities - SCA-UA 9680 & SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               This course is an introduction to urban politics in Europe. It is designed to provide the student with practical and theoretical tools to understand and critically analyze European cities. We will take a close look at the social, political and urban challenges these cities are currently facing.                                                                      Islam and Spain: Past and Present - MEIS-UA 9707 or SPAN-UA 9334 - 4 points                               Both English &amp; Spanish Taught sections will be offered in Spring 2015   From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.   Note: This Class does NOT currently include a trip to Morocco as in past semesters.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Comparative U.S. and European Human Rights - POL-UA 9994 or SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               This course is a study of comparative human rights between European countries, including  Spain, and the United States of America. International human rights legislation imposes  the same obligations on all signatory countries. Despite this, however, interpretation and  application of these rights vary considerably between countries. Students will explore a set  of controversial issues in order to understand the complex differences between the United  States and European countries\u2019 interpretation of human rights obligations, and will also look  at how these differences are portrayed in society by comparing international and national  media coverage of the issues.     Sample Syllabus                                                                        Madrid Stories: Engaging with the City Through Documentary Film - SPAN-UA 9661 & JOUR-UA 9204 - 4 points                               The city of Madrid will be the primary object of study in this course: its history, its architecture, its people, its neighborhoods, and its place in the Spanish imaginary.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Culture of Spain: An Anthropological Perspective - SPAN-UA 9631 or ANTH-UA 9250 - 4 points                               The recent changes in both Spain and Portugal are only the latest in a series of important transformations which these two countries have undergone over the past fifty years or so. In that time, they have both gone from being predominantly rural societies where the majority of the population live and work on the land to become industrial societies not unlike those of northern Europe and North America. Yet the underlying cultural heterogeneity of the peoples of the Iberian Peninsula has meant that different regions have often had very distinct reactions to the various pressures towards political, economic and social change.   As well as introducing you to some of the basic concepts used in the study of social change, this course concentrates on examining the ethnographic diversity of the various regions of Spain and Portugal. Knowledge of this underlying diversity is essential in comprehending the importance that regionalism has played in Iberian history and its relevance to the understanding of the acceptance or rejection of such change by the different regions in contemporary Spain and Portugal. The course will specifically examine the rapidly changing role of women in both countries.

Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.

While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age.

In recent years, the idea of \u201cthe three cultures\u201d of medieval Spain \u2014 Christianity, Islam and Judaism \u2014 has become a popular ideal and model for modernity among a wide variety of thinkers and writers; and both utopian and distopian visions of Sefarad and Andalus (the Hebrew and Arabic terms that refer to the Iberian Peninsula) permeate discourses on politics, religion and even education. This course will examine the ways in which that nostalgia for a lost Andalus or Sefarad is both explored as a theme and used as a device in a wide variety of modern novels and short stories (as well as some poetry), and the ways in which modern authors deploy this trope to comment on the worlds they inhabit. Reading medieval Spanish texts alongside the writing they inspired in modernity will provide a diachronic framework for better understanding medieval Iberian literature and will also raise questions about the salience of the past for the present.                              Courses Taught in English                                                  Art and Social Movements in Spain: 1888 - 1939 - SPAN-UA 9951 or ARTH-UA 9450 - 4 points                               This survey will examine the major artists and institutions that shaped the development of Spanish art from 1888, the date of Barcelona's Universal Exposition, to the end of the Spanish Civil War. The course takes as it's working model the question of art's relation to social movements, including: the rising tides of cultural and political nationalism in the Basque and Catalan regions; the Colonial Disaster of 1898 and the question of national regeneration; the impact of fin-de-siglo anarchist and worker's movements; the birth of authoritarian politics with the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera; and the ideological chaos and social violence unleashed during the Spanish Civil War) Class sessions examine the complex roles played by some of Spain's most prominent artists and architects -- Antoni Gaud\u00ed, Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\u00f3, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Josep Llu\u00eds Sert, and Salvador Dal\u00ed -- and their multivalent responses to modernization, political instability, and social praxis. The course is supplemented by regular visits to the Museo Nacional de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, Madrid's museum of modern art.

Cultures and Contexts: Spain \u0097At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America - CORE-UA 9544 - 4 points                               Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Current Social, Political and Urban Challenges to European Cities - SCA-UA 9680 & SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               This course is an introduction to urban politics in Europe. It is designed to provide the student with practical and theoretical tools to understand and critically analyze European cities. We will take a close look at the social, political and urban challenges these cities are currently facing.                                                                      Islam and Spain: Past and Present - MEIS-UA 9707 or SPAN-UA 9334 - 4 points                               Both English &amp; Spanish Taught sections will be offered in Spring 2015   From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.   Note: This Class does NOT currently include a trip to Morocco as in past semesters.

International human rights legislation imposes  the same obligations on all signatory countries. Despite this, however, interpretation and  application of these rights vary considerably between countries. Students will explore a set  of controversial issues in order to understand the complex differences between the United  States and European countries\u2019 interpretation of human rights obligations, and will also look  at how these differences are portrayed in society by comparing international and national  media coverage of the issues.

The principal objective of the course is the development of the student's communicative capacity through written and oral presentations, debates, and commentaries on each week's materials, as well as listening comprehension and vocabulary exercises. As a secondary objective, the student should acquire a consciousness of the reality of the United States as a place of encounter and transformation of different cultures, including Hispanic cultures that today play a predominant role.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Culture of Spain: An Anthropological Perspective - SPAN-UA 9631 or ANTH-UA 9250 - 4 points                               The recent changes in both Spain and Portugal are only the latest in a series of important transformations which these two countries have undergone over the past fifty years or so. In that time, they have both gone from being predominantly rural societies where the majority of the population live and work on the land to become industrial societies not unlike those of northern Europe and North America. Yet the underlying cultural heterogeneity of the peoples of the Iberian Peninsula has meant that different regions have often had very distinct reactions to the various pressures towards political, economic and social change.   As well as introducing you to some of the basic concepts used in the study of social change, this course concentrates on examining the ethnographic diversity of the various regions of Spain and Portugal. Knowledge of this underlying diversity is essential in comprehending the importance that regionalism has played in Iberian history and its relevance to the understanding of the acceptance or rejection of such change by the different regions in contemporary Spain and Portugal. The course will specifically examine the rapidly changing role of women in both countries.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.

This course will examine the ways in which that nostalgia for a lost Andalus or Sefarad is both explored as a theme and used as a device in a wide variety of modern novels and short stories (as well as some poetry), and the ways in which modern authors deploy this trope to comment on the worlds they inhabit. Reading medieval Spanish texts alongside the writing they inspired in modernity will provide a diachronic framework for better understanding medieval Iberian literature and will also raise questions about the salience of the past for the present.                              Courses Taught in English                                                  Art and Social Movements in Spain: 1888 - 1939 - SPAN-UA 9951 or ARTH-UA 9450 - 4 points                               This survey will examine the major artists and institutions that shaped the development of Spanish art from 1888, the date of Barcelona's Universal Exposition, to the end of the Spanish Civil War. The course takes as it's working model the question of art's relation to social movements, including: the rising tides of cultural and political nationalism in the Basque and Catalan regions; the Colonial Disaster of 1898 and the question of national regeneration; the impact of fin-de-siglo anarchist and worker's movements; the birth of authoritarian politics with the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera; and the ideological chaos and social violence unleashed during the Spanish Civil War) Class sessions examine the complex roles played by some of Spain's most prominent artists and architects -- Antoni Gaud\u00ed, Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\u00f3, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Josep Llu\u00eds Sert, and Salvador Dal\u00ed -- and their multivalent responses to modernization, political instability, and social praxis. The course is supplemented by regular visits to the Museo Nacional de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, Madrid's museum of modern art.

Cultures and Contexts: Spain \u0097At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America - CORE-UA 9544 - 4 points                               Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Current Social, Political and Urban Challenges to European Cities - SCA-UA 9680 & SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               This course is an introduction to urban politics in Europe. It is designed to provide the student with practical and theoretical tools to understand and critically analyze European cities. We will take a close look at the social, political and urban challenges these cities are currently facing.                                                                      Islam and Spain: Past and Present - MEIS-UA 9707 or SPAN-UA 9334 - 4 points                               Both English &amp; Spanish Taught sections will be offered in Spring 2015   From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.   Note: This Class does NOT currently include a trip to Morocco as in past semesters.

International human rights legislation imposes  the same obligations on all signatory countries. Despite this, however, interpretation and  application of these rights vary considerably between countries. Students will explore a set  of controversial issues in order to understand the complex differences between the United  States and European countries\u2019 interpretation of human rights obligations, and will also look  at how these differences are portrayed in society by comparing international and national  media coverage of the issues.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Culture of Spain: An Anthropological Perspective - SPAN-UA 9631 or ANTH-UA 9250 - 4 points                               The recent changes in both Spain and Portugal are only the latest in a series of important transformations which these two countries have undergone over the past fifty years or so. In that time, they have both gone from being predominantly rural societies where the majority of the population live and work on the land to become industrial societies not unlike those of northern Europe and North America. Yet the underlying cultural heterogeneity of the peoples of the Iberian Peninsula has meant that different regions have often had very distinct reactions to the various pressures towards political, economic and social change.   As well as introducing you to some of the basic concepts used in the study of social change, this course concentrates on examining the ethnographic diversity of the various regions of Spain and Portugal. Knowledge of this underlying diversity is essential in comprehending the importance that regionalism has played in Iberian history and its relevance to the understanding of the acceptance or rejection of such change by the different regions in contemporary Spain and Portugal. The course will specifically examine the rapidly changing role of women in both countries.

Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.

NYU\u2019s Study Abroad programs offer students the chance to combine total-emersion experience of everyday life in an unfamiliar setting with formal classroom learning about it. What better way to explore anthropological understandings of the world around us? Or to get a firmer grasp on the lifeways of a new place?  Paris   Buenos Aires   Madrid   Prague  WHAT CAN I EXPECT? All anthropology courses offered at NYU Study Abroad sites are taught by professional anthropologists and focus on aspects of the host society and culture. All aim to draw from\u2014and sharpen\u2014students\u2019 own experience and observations in the study-abroad setting. These courses count toward the anthropology major and minor, but are also designed to be accessible and appealing to non-majors.

Abu Dhabi Fall/Spring: ACS-AD101X - Anthropology and the Arab World Spring: ACS-AD203X - Heritage, History, and Memory in the Modern Middle East  Anthropology's Sisters One or two anthropology courses are offered at about half of NYU\u2019s study abroad sites, and anthropology majors are urged to take advantage of these. But they are just as strongly encouraged to complement this work with courses offering other approaches to their study abroad setting: its language, history, literature, politics, art, etc. Students should seriously take account of these offerings in cognate fields when making their study abroad choices. When Should I Go? There is no general rule about the best semester for anthropology majors to study abroad, but individual circumstances--aiming to participate in the Honors Program in Anthropology, for example--may affect optimal timing. Students are encouraged to consult with the Anthropology Department Director of Undergraduate Studies early in their planning.  Biological Anthropology and Archaeology At present, no courses in these subfields are offered at NYU study abroad sites. Students specializing in biological anthropology have often taken advantage of the general science offerings at NYU in London (especially during sophomore year) to advance in their major. Students most interested in archaeology have generally found it useful to enroll in summer field schools outside of NYU offerings. They are strongly advised to consult well in advance with their archaeology professors and the Anthropology Department Director of Undergraduate Studies for advice on recommended programs, course credits, and funding possibilities.  Applying to Study Abroad To learn more about Study Abroad, students are encouraged to attend one of  NYU Global Programs' weekly information sessions held every Friday during the  school year. To register, please complete the RSVP form at Access NYU's Global  Network: NYU Global Programs Info Sessions . To enroll in any of the courses offered abroad, students must first apply   to the relevant Study Abroad program through the Office of Global Programs.  Course offerings are subject to change.    Consult NYU Study Abroad Site webpages for detailed information for  all courses offered in particular semesters.    For updates on anthropology offerings, consult  the Anthropology Department Global Coordinator [ scr1@nyu.edu ]. For more information on registering for Study Abroad courses consult the NYU Study Abroad Program   Website  Study Abroad Scholarships Global Pathways Scholarship Program (GPS) All admitted Study Away undergraduate students who will receive a degree from NYU in New York applying for financial aid will be automatically evaluated for an additional need-based award: the GPS is up to $4,000 per semester (depending on demonstrated need) to cover the additional costs of studying away. Students will receive an award notification beginning in June (for fall semester) and in November (for spring semester). Students follow the regular Office of Financial Aid process for applying for need based aid. Global Programs Merit Scholarships A small group of students that have been admitted for a   semester study at one of the NYU Academic Centers will be awarded a   merit grant of $1,500. Awards will be determined based on the quality   of the student\u2019s application and academic record. Selected students will   be informed shortly after notification. All funding is posted as tuition credit to the recipient\u2019s NYU student account. No separate application is   required.
