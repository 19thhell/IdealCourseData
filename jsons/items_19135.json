They must pay particularly close attention to the mission and the obligations to society that are unique to the academic enterprise. NYU's Board of Trustees is the overall fiduciaries for the University. As such it is responsible for, among other things, creating policy, setting mission and purpose, strategic planning, reviewing programs, and relating campus to community and community to campus. Chief among its roles is fund-raising for the University, as well as engaging our alumni, parent, and student communities.
