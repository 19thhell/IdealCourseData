Applicants to NYU academic year study away programs are generally registered as full-time students at an accredited US college or university. All applicants are encouraged to include two different choices of locations for study and every attempt will be made to match students with one of their top two locations. Students who participate in study away programs have completed their freshman year of study (two full semesters) and have reached the age of 18 prior to the beginning of the term away. Students admitted to the program have earned a GPA of at least 3.0 or higher. Students who have completed at least one year of college but are not presently enrolled in a college or university or have already graduated are also eligible to apply; however, priority is given to students currently matriculated.   Students with disabilities who are requesting accommodations at NYU Global academic centers must contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities to discuss reasonable accommodations. Students are encouraged to contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities prior to choosing a location and should register with the Moses Center as soon as they receive notification of their admission to enroll. Information for students with disabilities who are requesting accommodations at an NYU academic center can be found on the Moses Center website.                  Eligibility &amp; Requirements   All students interested in applying to study at an NYU Global Academic Center must complete the online application which includes an agreement to the NYU Study Away Standard . All applicants are encouraged to include two different choices of locations for study and every attempt will be made to match students with one of their top two locations.     Eligible student types include:                                                        NYU Students - students currently enrolled in an undergraduate program at NYU                               NYU students need to fill out the online application, which includes a personal statement. Students applying to NYU Paris may also be required to submit the Language Background Form available for download within the online application.   Admissions Requirements   An integrated review of a student\u2019s academic background and University records is required to confirm admission to any NYU Global Academic Center. Initial acceptance to study away through NYU is granted conditionally until all of the following stipulations are met:   Academic Success &amp; Review of University Records   Please be aware that admission to any of the NYU Global study away sites is contingent upon the applicant\u2019s continued academic success and a review of his or her University records. Should a student\u2019s admission be revoked as a result of this review, New York University is not responsible for refunding any expenses incurred in preparation for the intended semester of study.   Students who apply to study away during their first semester in a new NYU school (internal transfers and LS transitioning students) should acknowledge the University policy that requires students to spend their first semester on campus in New York. Exceptions to that policy are granted on a case by case basis.   Discipline Statement   Given their unique nature, membership in a global campus community requires mutual respect, consideration, and concern for the well-being of others as well as a significant degree of personal integrity and maturity. Students whose prior behavior has been determined through the University student conduct process to have been disruptive to the University community and/or antithetical to these qualities may be precluded from participation in the study away experience. Accordingly, please be advised that information concerning student conduct actions is made available to the New York University Global Academic Centers and may be taken into consideration in the process of reviewing a student\u2019s application to participate. Students who have been placed on University disciplinary probation or on deferred suspension from University housing are ineligible to participate in study away during the period of their probation and/or deferred status. Students who have been suspended, withdrawn, or dismissed from the University and those who have been dismissed or suspended from University housing are permanently ineligible to enroll at the Global Academic Centers.   University Leave Policy   Students who have been on leave from the University must return to the New York City campus and successfully complete one academic semester (fall or spring) of full-time course work before enrolling at a Global Academic Center.                                                                      Visiting Students - students currently registered full-time in an undergraduate degree program at an accredited US college or university who are not on academic or disciplinary probation, nor currently on leave of absence; or individuals not presently enrolled in college courses who have completed at least one year or 24\u00a0credits\u00a0of college-level work at an accredited US institution including college graduates. **\u00a0Please note, Visiting Students are admitted on a space available basis and are not eligible to enroll at NYU Abu Dhabi.                               Non-NYU students should submit the online application and also submit official transcripts of all college-level work and other supplemental materials.

Applicants to NYU academic year study away programs are generally registered as full-time students at an accredited US college or university. All applicants are encouraged to include two different choices of locations for study and every attempt will be made to match students with one of their top two locations. Students who participate in study away programs have completed their freshman year of study (two full semesters) and have reached the age of 18 prior to the beginning of the term away. Students admitted to the program have earned a GPA of at least 3.0 or higher. Students who have completed at least one year of college but are not presently enrolled in a college or university or have already graduated are also eligible to apply; however, priority is given to students currently matriculated.   Students with disabilities who are requesting accommodations at NYU Global academic centers must contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities to discuss reasonable accommodations. Students are encouraged to contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities prior to choosing a location and should register with the Moses Center as soon as they receive notification of their admission to enroll. Information for students with disabilities who are requesting accommodations at an NYU academic center can be found on the Moses Center website.                  Eligibility &amp; Requirements   All students interested in applying to study at an NYU Global Academic Center must complete the online application which includes an agreement to the NYU Study Away Standard . All applicants are encouraged to include two different choices of locations for study and every attempt will be made to match students with one of their top two locations.     Eligible student types include:                                                        NYU Students - students currently enrolled in an undergraduate program at NYU                               NYU students need to fill out the online application, which includes a personal statement. Students applying to NYU Paris may also be required to submit the Language Background Form available for download within the online application.   Admissions Requirements   An integrated review of a student\u2019s academic background and University records is required to confirm admission to any NYU Global Academic Center. Initial acceptance to study away through NYU is granted conditionally until all of the following stipulations are met:   Academic Success &amp; Review of University Records   Please be aware that admission to any of the NYU Global study away sites is contingent upon the applicant\u2019s continued academic success and a review of his or her University records. Should a student\u2019s admission be revoked as a result of this review, New York University is not responsible for refunding any expenses incurred in preparation for the intended semester of study.   Students who apply to study away during their first semester in a new NYU school (internal transfers and LS transitioning students) should acknowledge the University policy that requires students to spend their first semester on campus in New York. Exceptions to that policy are granted on a case by case basis.   Discipline Statement   Given their unique nature, membership in a global campus community requires mutual respect, consideration, and concern for the well-being of others as well as a significant degree of personal integrity and maturity. Students whose prior behavior has been determined through the University student conduct process to have been disruptive to the University community and/or antithetical to these qualities may be precluded from participation in the study away experience. Accordingly, please be advised that information concerning student conduct actions is made available to the New York University Global Academic Centers and may be taken into consideration in the process of reviewing a student\u2019s application to participate. Students who have been placed on University disciplinary probation or on deferred suspension from University housing are ineligible to participate in study away during the period of their probation and/or deferred status. Students who have been suspended, withdrawn, or dismissed from the University and those who have been dismissed or suspended from University housing are permanently ineligible to enroll at the Global Academic Centers.   University Leave Policy   Students who have been on leave from the University must return to the New York City campus and successfully complete one academic semester (fall or spring) of full-time course work before enrolling at a Global Academic Center.                                                                      Visiting Students - students currently registered full-time in an undergraduate degree program at an accredited US college or university who are not on academic or disciplinary probation, nor currently on leave of absence; or individuals not presently enrolled in college courses who have completed at least one year or 24\u00a0credits\u00a0of college-level work at an accredited US institution including college graduates. **\u00a0Please note, Visiting Students are admitted on a space available basis and are not eligible to enroll at NYU Abu Dhabi.
