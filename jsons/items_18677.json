The minor analyzes how the techniques and methodologies of the humanities and social sciences can be used to illuminate both the context and content of science, technology, and medicine. Drawing upon history, philosophy, anthropology, and sociology, students investigate how culture and society frame\u2014and, indeed, are themselves framed by\u2014science, technology, and medicine.   The current influence of scientific, technological, and medical issues on our lives is unprecedented, altering our notions of race, health, responsibility, ownership, ethics, esthetics, and indeed self. We are therefore obliged to understand these critical interactions with a view to understand, and intervene in, the world. The types of questions this minor poses include: How has gene patenting affected both the content and conduct of molecular biology, as well as intellectual property law? What is the relationship between the mathematical descriptions that physicists employ and the nature of physical phenomena? What are the ethical and political issues involved in human embryonic stem cell research? How do machines shape esthetics? What, if anything, is the difference between a machine and a human? How does nature have a history?   This minor serves as an enlightening complement to pre-health studies, pre-law studies relevant to intellectual property, biotechnology, and environmental and healthcare studies. It also provides a potent training to those interested in pursuing advanced degrees in the history, philosophy, sociology, or anthropology of science, technology, or medicine.            Program of Study          The minor in Science and Society requires four 4-point courses (16 points). All minors take the core course, Introduction to Science and Society (HIST-UA 94), and then choose three other courses from an approved list. Many courses in the minor fall into one of the following four clusters: technology, physics, biology/prehealth, and environmental sciences. Students are strongly encouraged, however, to be creative and challenge themselves to think in ways other than those that are strictly categorical. For example, a student interested in understanding the difference between the natural and the artificial might take the following three elective courses in addition to the required Introduction to Science and Society course: Philosophy of Biology ; Humans, Machines, and Aesthetics ; and Nature and Technology in Modern America .   Students are also strongly encouraged to take courses in the various schools throughout NYU contributing to the minor. This will expose them to a plethora of diverse pedagogical experiences and greatly enhance co-learning. CAS students may apply 16 points taken in the other schools of NYU toward their degree. Students seeking to raise this limit so as to accommodate the course work of the Minor in Science and Society must file a petition in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140.    NYU students from outside of CAS are welcome to declare a minor in Science and Society. Students should consult their home-school advisor for policies on their cross-school credit limit.            Required Course in CAS          HIST-UA 94 (4 points)   Introduction to Science &amp; Society  Introduces techniques and approaches used by the humanities and social sciences in studying science, technology, and medicine. Investigates how historians, philosophers, sociologists, and anthropologists apply their methodological toolkit in investigating scientific, technological, and medical knowledge. Invites students to think synthetically, organically, and creatively across several disciplines.

Following individualized courses of study and collaboration with faculty mentors, Science and Technology Studies majors dig beneath the headlines to understand the relations among science, technology, and society.   The Science and Technology Studies curriculum falls into four broad categories: general education (40 credits), science or engineering courses (28 credits), science and technology studies courses (34 credits), and free electives (18 credits). A student can combine a core of scientific or technical courses along with the analysis of those fields from an STS perspectives. The free electives are used as a student pleases, either to increase the depth of the science/engineering core, to take advantage of cross-school minors with NYU, or to study abroad.   Foundation for the Future   For students who plan to continue their education beyond the bachelor&#39;s degree, Science and Technology Studies makes an excellent preprofessional degree.      There are more than twice the number of applicants to medical schools as there are available seats. The MCAT exam, for entrance into medical school, is expanding its scope, and students will be expected to understand more than the science of medicine. Using Science and Technology Studies as a prehealth degree gives you the flexibility to do just that.    For students heading to law school, Science and Technology Studies is an attractive prelaw option. Lawyers with expertise in science or engineering are in demand to practice cases with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Lawyers are also increasingly asked to deal with scientific and technical matters in their practice, and the STS degree helps students prepare to understand and explain technical matters that come before them.     Not all Science and Technology students go on to law or medical school -- they are also qualified to work in public health, conduct laboratory research, work as a science journalist, or pursue advanced study in the history and philosophy of science and technology.

The minor analyzes how the techniques and methodologies of the humanities and social sciences can be used to illuminate both the context and content of science, technology, and medicine. Drawing upon history, philosophy, anthropology, and sociology, students investigate how culture and society frame\u2014and, indeed, are themselves framed by\u2014science, technology, and medicine.   The current influence of scientific, technological, and medical issues on our lives is unprecedented, altering our notions of race, health, responsibility, ownership, ethics, esthetics, and indeed self. We are therefore obliged to understand these critical interactions with a view to understand, and intervene in, the world. The types of questions this minor poses include: How has gene patenting affected both the content and conduct of molecular biology, as well as intellectual property law? What is the relationship between the mathematical descriptions that physicists employ and the nature of physical phenomena? What are the ethical and political issues involved in human embryonic stem cell research? How do machines shape esthetics? What, if anything, is the difference between a machine and a human? How does nature have a history?   This minor serves as an enlightening complement to pre-health studies, pre-law studies relevant to intellectual property, biotechnology, and environmental and healthcare studies. It also provides a potent training to those interested in pursuing advanced degrees in the history, philosophy, sociology, or anthropology of science, technology, or medicine.            Program of Study          The minor in Science and Society requires four 4-point courses (16 points). All minors take the core course, Introduction to Science and Society (HIST-UA 94), and then choose three other courses from an approved list. Many courses in the minor fall into one of the following four clusters: technology, physics, biology/prehealth, and environmental sciences. Students are strongly encouraged, however, to be creative and challenge themselves to think in ways other than those that are strictly categorical. For example, a student interested in understanding the difference between the natural and the artificial might take the following three elective courses in addition to the required Introduction to Science and Society course: Philosophy of Biology ; Humans, Machines, and Aesthetics ; and Nature and Technology in Modern America .   Students are also strongly encouraged to take courses in the various schools throughout NYU contributing to the minor. This will expose them to a plethora of diverse pedagogical experiences and greatly enhance co-learning. CAS students may apply 16 points taken in the other schools of NYU toward their degree. Students seeking to raise this limit so as to accommodate the course work of the Minor in Science and Society must file a petition in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140.    NYU students from outside of CAS are welcome to declare a minor in Science and Society. Students should consult their home-school advisor for policies on their cross-school credit limit.            Required Course in CAS          HIST-UA 94 (4 points)   Introduction to Science &amp; Society  Introduces techniques and approaches used by the humanities and social sciences in studying science, technology, and medicine. Investigates how historians, philosophers, sociologists, and anthropologists apply their methodological toolkit in investigating scientific, technological, and medical knowledge. Invites students to think synthetically, organically, and creatively across several disciplines.
