Specialized programs are available in Africana studies, art and architecture, business, mathematics, British literature and writing, pre-health, and psychology. Courses in math, biology, chemistry, and physics accommodate students whose schedules might not otherwise allow for a semester of global study. Additionally, NYU is the only institution in London to offer science courses approved by the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) for medical school admittance. NYU London encourages students to enroll in for-credit internships with key institutions in fields including marketing, finance, media, law, politics, health, and theatre.     Students who spend a semester at NYU London live and learn in the heart of Bloomsbury, a neighborhood that is home to the British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the West End (London\u2019s famous theatre district). Each semester, NYU London staff plans day trips to places such as the historic cities of Bath, Cambridge, and Oxford. In addition to exploring London\u2019s myriad cultural sites, students often participate in short-term or semester-long community service projects.

In recent years Britain has undergone striking changes in its social makeup, political outlook and cultural activities. Rapid change also brings tensions around housing, the National Health Service and education all of which are increasingly facing pressures from immigration, larger numbers of unemployed and the economic squeeze. The most recent census suggested Polish was the second is spoken language in Britain. So what is happening and why and how does it affect you as a visiting student?    Global Orientation: British Culture is intended to introduce students to ideas formed by global and local issues and focus on concerns regarding politics, the media, migration, the free market, foreign policy, cultural homogeneity and democracy that are the keys to modern British national identity.  The course in based around a series of lectures and talks by prominent speakers from British politics, culture, economics and the arts, and incorporates various optional excursions into London to see some of what is being talked about in action.

A survey of British painting, sculpture and architecture of the 17ththrough 20th centuries. Museums, galleries, churches, palaces and stately homes in and around London will be visited to examine and critique major works.

London has some of the richest collections of renaissance art in the world. Students in this course will be brought into direct contact with a large variety of artefacts to be found in museums and galleries such as the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum as well as the British Library. Works by Van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Durer and Holbein will be examined alongside those of less well-known artists. Rather than provide a standard chronological narrative of European Art History c. 1400- c. 1600, focus will be placed on subject areas such as the altarpiece and the private devotional image, the renaissance portrait, graphic practices, print culture, the materials and functions of sculpture, myth and allegory, the cabinet of curiosities, the concept of the 'Renaissance' itself. These topics will not be organised around traditional national or regional 'schools' considered in isolation from one another but instead interconnections will be explored between the development of different types, technical processes and cultural practices across the Netherlands, France, Germany and Italy. A special case will be made of the English Renaissance, in order to place it within the wider European context through additional visits to Westminster Abbey and Hampton Court.                                                                    Designing Britain - ARTH-UA 9650 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Urban Design credit or Art History elective credit.   British designers are playing an increasingly important part on the world stage. This course examines changing attitudes to design in Britain: from the eighteenth century, when it played a central role in the modernisation of the country, to the Millennium and beyond, when it is being called upon to rekindle some lost glory. We will ask whether there are features about British design over the last 250 years which are distinctively British; and to what extent British designers have been informed by developments in the rest of the world.   Design now seems all-encompassing, and this very fact also raises broader questions. Have we overvalued this work of the mind over more traditional hand-skills? Are we becoming cynical in the face of endless &quot;rebrandings&quot; (which includes the rebranding of cities and whole countries)? Does design necessarily falsify, or paper over the cracks? And is it good for the planet?   The course format consists of Lectures, and Visits to museums, London sites etc.                                                                    Art &amp; War 1914 to the Present - ARTH-UA 9650 or IDSEM-UG 9251 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.                                                                    Seeing London's Architecture -\u00a0ARTH-UA\u00a09674 or SASEM-UG 9250 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Architecture and Urban Design credit only .   London, like New York is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just under 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of European built-environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, town and cities throughout the United States, and anywhere else.

Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments - BIOL-UA 9140 or ENVST-UA 9275 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and cological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the Global Network University initiative this course will be offered simultaneously in multiple locations and students will collaborate with their counterparts on other campuses.

The result is a course strongly geared towards providing students with an understanding of contemporary international economic and political trends, issues and events alongside the requisite analytical skills to evaluate current economic and political policies.   This course is divided into two sections. The first section focuses on the political economy of international trade. It will examine the role of labour, land and capital in determining what is traded, by whom and for what purpose. The second section examines the key global issues in 21st century political economy. It will focus on cultural transformation in an age of globalization, the economic rise of Asia, the political economy of militant Islam and, most saliently, the future of Western hegemony in light of the global economic crisis.

Financial systems are centered on key institutions, instruments and markets. But they  also involve governments, public policy and regulation. They span the globe from the  US, the EU and Japan to Russia, China and the Emerging Markets. In critical ways,  country-level financial architectures are integrating to form a more seamless, high-performance whole. This is good for efficiency, innovation and growth, yet it also  amplifies problems during times of crisis   This course provides students with a broad and rigorous understanding of (i) How the  global financial system works and what purposes it serves, (ii) What the major elements  are and how they operate, and (iii) What challenges the global financial system creates  for public policy makers. In seeking to achieve these objectives, this broad-gauge  course provides a perspective that helps students understand and make the most of  their own professional opportunities. Along with a working knowledge of the global  macroeconomy, foundations of finance and corporate finance, this course will be  extremely helpful for students as a lens to focus on the key dimensions of the modern  business environment.

Britain is a multi-national state, a union of 4 nations, each with their own distinctive culture and heritage. Three of the nations, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, have been brought under the English monarchy and political system, and, in the case of the first two, they have been long-term partners in the benefits accruing to the largest empire the world has seen, and the first and (for a long time) the most successful industrial nation. The height of that unity was probably in the period of the Second World War and its aftermath. Since then, with the collapse of the British Empire, Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union, and the devolution of power to Scotland and Wales, the union has come under increasing pressure from centrifugal forces. The course examines the image that Britain presents to the world, the myths on which the national identity of the component nations were formed and the institutions that might be considered to hold the union together today. This involves looking at the self-image of Britain in relation to empire, foreign policy, immigration and multiculturalism, monarchy, parliament, sport and media representations. British national identity is revealed as an increasingly contested concept in a globalised world.

Contemporary Art in Britian. Contemporary art raises vigorous debate and criticism. But what is contemporary about contemporary art? We consider some key issues in dealing critically with contemporary art with a focus on work on display in exhibitions in London, both major national collections and private galleries, exploring art produced since the late 1950s through case studies of the work of individual artists and through themes which include photography, representations of the body, gallery display, video practice, and installation art. Topics include how contemporary art came to look as it does, with a focus on British art; the different forms of material and presentation artists have employed; why and how diverse audiences are addressed; and how markets, national prizes, and private collections shape the kinds of art produced and inform public taste. We also look at the collection and display of contemporary art, on a private and a public scale; dealer galleries, and issues of curation. Critical and historical writings by artists and theorists will be considered.

The Gothic flourished especially in the nineteenth century, creating a whole vocabulary of new creatures and landscapes and two of the great books of the genre: Frankenstein And Dracula. This course concentrates on the great works of Gothic which are central to an understanding of literature, film, early Romanticism and popular culture. Specialising on the works of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries we will also explore how those texts were reinvented for film and what new elements were added in the twentieth century. Using a selection of texts and using a variety of approaches from the historical to the post modern and the feminist to queer theory we will explore the multifarious levels of meaning in Gothic texts as well as looking at narrative strategies and a variety of themes including the political and revolutionary, the erotic and the exotic, the Promethian and the undead, the role of religion, the role of women, the Wandering Jew and the 'mock' medieval.

Sample Syllabus                                                                    Writing London -\u00a0ENGL-UA\u00a09182 - 4 points                               This course will study a variety of texts written at particular times in the history of London. The aims of the course are to encourage student to think historically, in terms of the way London and representations of the city have changed and developed over time; and theoretically, in terms of the way the city is mediated through different forms and genres (e.g. poetry, novels, essays, film). We will also examine the texts in relation to issues such as gender, the definition of the modern metropolis as a labyrinthine city of Babylon, the influence of metropolitan culture on Modernism and Modernity, assimilation versus multiculturalism, immigration, and the effects of new modern spaces on individuals.

Postcolonial Indian Literature - ENGL-UA 9975 - 4 points                               This course explores the meaning of colonialism and postcolonialism in India by examining its historical background, its main themes and its defining problems. The course introduces students to some of the key texts of British cultural and educational policy in India. It also gives students the opportunity to examine a major ethnographic text. The course will then grapple with a cross-section of colonial and postcolonial literary representations of India. The focus here will be on issues of identity and strategies of narrative in colonialist and nationalist texts. The course concludes with an overall view of postcolonial studies as it relates to India and some suggestions as to its future developments.                              Environmental Studies                                                    Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments - BIOL-UA 9140 or ENVST-UA 9275 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and cological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the Global Network University initiative this course will be offered simultaneously in multiple locations and students will collaborate with their counterparts on other campuses.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.

This interdisciplinary seminar serves as a broad overview for several centuries of British male and female fashion trends, from roughly the Tudor period to today. The course focuses on ways that modes and standards of dress evolved in response to political, economic and technological developments; empire and immigration; changing gender and class formations; and the vagaries of popular culture. In short, the course examines not only what people wore at different historical moments, but why they wore what they did, and how they felt about it. Readings come from the fields of literature, history, art history, gender studies, and sociology.     Sample Syllabus                                                                      Fashion, Culture\u00a0& the Body - IDSEM-UG 9254 - 4 points                               Please note that students accepted to the Gallatin Fashion in London Program will be given registration priority for this course.   This is a course that explores the relationship between ideas, the body and the way that fashion can be understood to mediate between the two. Through a range of disciplines and media this course considers the body as an aspect of not only medical and scientific exploration, but crucially as a vital element of culture and society. Bodies affect the ways in which the social world and power relations are organised, and they even arguably condition the way that we understand reality itself. Our physical form is constantly shaped according to both philosophies and fashions. Body ideals and broader ideals often interrelate strongly through bodily practices and with what we wear. There are meanings and fashions in all bodily forms (skinny, buxom, muscular, ideas of \u2018whiteness\u2019) and body practices (dieting, hair management, cleansing rituals, plastic surgery and genital cutting).   Over the sessions, we will take a conceptual approach to fashion, as a strident condition of modern life, that incorporates politics, science and aesthetics and we will closely read a number of cultural texts against a number of theoretical models. Attitudes towards the body can vary widely according to historical period, and this course will explore how, in different moments, and via different media, we have been preoccupied with the aesthetics of different body zones, with displaying identity (gender, class and ethnicity), and also with power. Different cultural forms (literary, visual, material etc) will provide the focus of our discussions as they all engage with the different ways that we make meaning out of our bodies. Students will be invited to investigate in their written work set texts from class in addition to primary material of their own choice.

This course will introduce students to the lifecycle of fashion, from forecasting fashion trends to the retailing and representation of vintage clothing, through design development, branding, buying and journalism. The course will also explore key issues for the sector \u2013 ethics, sustainability and the impact of the digital revolution. It will add a practical dimension to the NYU London triptych of fashion exploration, giving students unique access to studios and businesses working at the heart of London\u2019s vibrant fashion industry. Each session is structured to give students an overview of a particular stage in the fashion development process, through a mix of lectures from the course leader and visiting professionals, studio visits, walking tours, reading assignments and practical projects.

Internship placements are made by EUSA, an organization partnering with NYU. EUSA provides internship placements in a wide range of organizations.     The seminar portion of the course explores many different aspects of your internship site. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization, including its approach, its policies, and the context in which it operates. We will also discuss more generally the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Finally, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience and as a way to refine your own personal and professional goals.

London, like New York is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just under 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of European built-environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, town and cities throughout the United States, and anywhere else.

Actual course description may vary.   This course will examine the various dimensions of the field of public health and how the public\u2019s health is protected. Students explore the ways social, economic, and political forces influence the health of populations. Additionally, this course will focus upon some of the current ethical public health dilemmas where the rights of the individual versus the rights of society come into conflict. The course makes use of diverse methods of instruction, including, but not limited to, small group discussion, group exercises, mini-lectures, student debates, field-based group projects and student presentations. Students may be involved in gathering information and observations from projects outside of the classroom at government, NGO and health care institutions.

Students will learn about London's changing economic and political role, and will understand how London grew to dominate the commerce, industry and culture of England. They will find out how London became the biggest city the world has ever known, and how it coped (or failed to cope) with the social and environmental problems created by its enormous size. Each week (unless there is a field trip) there will be a lecture and a discussion in which you will be able to present ideas and information gathered from lectures and from your weekly reading. There will also be four walking tours of parts of London which relate to the period we are studying at a particular time.

Students should also be prepared to pay up to \u00a3100 or $150 for extra tickets while in London as part of the Methods &amp; Practice course.     Using the cultural life of London as its focus, this course aims to enable students to report on the diversity of cultural and artistic activity in the British capital across the spectrum, with an inevitable focus on theatre and live performance (classical music/opera, classical and contemporary dance) given the professor's own ongoing career as a theatre critic; other art forms, including art, television, and film, are considered, as well, depending on what is on in the capital at any given time. Numerous forms and techniques will be explored through la mixture of lecture, discussion, and student presentations, and students will be required to follow the work of several critics throughout the term even as they develop their own critical voice and methodology. At every turn, the course aims to wed the specific cultural goings-on in London during the semester to the methods and practice necessary to respond to and evaluate the work on offer.
