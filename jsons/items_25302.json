The program is unique in its combination of a rigorous academic inpatient training, extensive formal primary care curriculum, and extraordinary outpatient clinical experience.   The three-year Primary Care Residency Program has 13.5 blocks of in-depth primary care block curriculum. Each primary care block, coordinated by primary care faculty, is designed to meet specific educational objectives. Blocks begin in the first year with a rigorous month long introduction to primary care, focusing on diagnosis and management of common illnesses, as well learning effective systems based practice. This block initiates the core pillars of learning that spiral through the three years. Subsequent blocks include dermatology, women's health, clinical epidemiology, geriatrics, health policy and economics, psychosocial medicine and health communication, geriatrics, neuro/musculoskeletal, learning to teach patients and others, teams, and research. The learning activities are highly interactive and include annual independent projects and a variety of resident lead conferences. During ward months, residents are seamlessly integrated into the inpatient rotations. The inpatient experience is identical to that of the categorical residency in content and in expectations.   The keystone of the Primary Care Residency Program is the clinic continuity experience. Residents are precepted by dedicated primary care faculty. There is a one-to-three ratio of faculty to residents to ensure outstanding supervision and teaching. Residents serve as the primary physicians for an amazing ethnic, cultural, and linguistic diversity of medically underserved people at Bellevue Hospital and Gouverneur Diagnostic and Treatment Center. The program is notable for unsurpassed camaraderie among house staff and open communication between faculty and house staff.   Graduates of the program are highly valued and sought after following their training. They contribute to the practice, teaching, and scholarship in general internal medicine and are active, informed citizens of their professions and communities. Graduates are nationally recognized for their clinical preparation and have outstanding careers in academic medicine, public sector and private practice, community-based practice, and public service.   \u00a0                                                                               NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}]},

The three-year Primary Care Residency Program has 13.5 blocks of in-depth primary care block curriculum. Each primary care block, coordinated by primary care faculty, is designed to meet specific educational objectives. Blocks begin in the first year with a rigorous month long introduction to primary care, focusing on diagnosis and management of common illnesses, as well learning effective systems based practice. This block initiates the core pillars of learning that spiral through the three years. Subsequent blocks include dermatology, women's health, clinical epidemiology, geriatrics, health policy and economics, psychosocial medicine and health communication, geriatrics, neuro/musculoskeletal, learning to teach patients and others, teams, and research. The learning activities are highly interactive and include annual independent projects and a variety of resident lead conferences. During ward months, residents are seamlessly integrated into the inpatient rotations. The inpatient experience is identical to that of the categorical residency in content and in expectations.   The keystone of the Primary Care Residency Program is the clinic continuity experience. Residents are precepted by dedicated primary care faculty. There is a one-to-three ratio of faculty to residents to ensure outstanding supervision and teaching. Residents serve as the primary physicians for an amazing ethnic, cultural, and linguistic diversity of medically underserved people at Bellevue Hospital and Gouverneur Diagnostic and Treatment Center. The program is notable for unsurpassed camaraderie among house staff and open communication between faculty and house staff.   Graduates of the program are highly valued and sought after following their training. They contribute to the practice, teaching, and scholarship in general internal medicine and are active, informed citizens of their professions and communities. Graduates are nationally recognized for their clinical preparation and have outstanding careers in academic medicine, public sector and private practice, community-based practice, and public service.   \u00a0                                                                               NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}]}]
