Specific topics include financial and managerial accounting, financial statements, business plans, budgeting, capital planning, cost accounting, managerial control, working capital management and payment systems.

Financial managers work closely with accountants, administrators, computer programmers, records managers and planners whose decisions have a considerable impact on the financial status of organizations. They, in turn, rely upon the financial managers skills and advice to assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities.
