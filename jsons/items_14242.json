For each point taken in excess of 18 points in a semester, there is an additional charge per point.   Non-NYU Students   If your college or university has a partnership with NYU Global Academic Programs the cost of tuition may be less than    the posted figures. Inquire with your study abroad office to find out if there is a partnership with NYU.              Lodging   Costs listed above range from doubles to triples in student residence halls. Limited single rooms are avaible at a higher cost. Students participating in this program are required to live in NYU housing.    Study Away housing costs, depending upon the site and the accommodation option selected, usually include: utilities, insurance, access to health professionals and medical resources, immigration fees, 24-hour security, cleaning services, and meals. These factors impact prices and guarantee that both NYU and the student are in compliance with local legislation. NYU does all it can to keep housing costs low while maintaining the high quality of services and facilities we provide - which are among the most comprehensive in the Study Away field. A cancelation fee may be assessed if a student's written request to cancel the housing license be approved.     Meals   Meals may be prepared by students in the residence hall; however, most students prefer to dine in restaurants. Prices outside the tourist center are significantly lower and students can find very reasonably priced restaurants.   Miscellaneous   Costs include visa application fee, local transportation, laundry, telephone, utilities, and some independent travel. With the exception of tuition, all costs are estimated and may vary depending on each student's budget.   In addition, student insurance (health and accident) is mandatory and will vary according to individual policies.   Excursions/Cultural Activities   Some excursions and cultural activities are included in tuition costs.

Within a few weeks of registering for classes, students (with the exception of visiting students whose home schools choose to bill them directly for their term at NYU) will receive a message at their official NYU e-mail address notifying them that a bill for tuition, fees, and housing is now available.   Please visit the NYU Bursar Web-site for details about the E-bill process.              Students going to NYU Prague will be billed an estimated housing charge. This estimate is used as a \u201cplaceholder charge\u201d until we place students in their final housing assignment; the initial charge is unrelated to the final housing charge. There are two reasons we do this:     Students on financial aid have loans and grant funds released to them earlier.   Students can budget ahead and pay the bulk of their charges earlier, rather than waiting until final housing assignments are made.     Once the actual housing placement has been made, the E-bill is adjusted, resulting in either a credit or an additional charge. The final charge will appear on the student's E-bill within 2-3 weeks following the start of the program.                                                  NYU Centers Abroad...

Please understand that completing this estimator does not take the place of actually applying for financial aid at NYU.   Returning, transfer and graduate students are excluded from the use of this estimator, and those students should review NYU's financial aid policies at Financial Aid and Scholarships to determine the financial aid award process and calendar as applicable.   All freshman applicants are strongly encouraged to file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (the FAFSA) and/or the CSS Profile application accurately and on time in order to determine their actual financial aid award (please see Applications and Forms for information regarding NYU's aid application requirements). The Profile data is needed to be considered for institutional grants and scholarships. Federal aid is dependent upon the FAFSA results, and will be awarded to those eligible, even if the preferred deadline is not met. NYU strongly encourages every applicant to carefully consider the financial investment in an NYU education once their actual financial aid award has been received, which typically occurs simultaneously with their offer of admission.   Freshman applicants must correctly follow the financial aid application process and meet the published deadlines to be considered for financial aid at NYU. Note that costs and financial aid estimates are subject to change. The results of this estimator are not actual offers of aid, and may be substantially different from your official aid offer from NYU. The results are based upon the assumption that you will be enrolled full time as an incoming freshman.   The University may not be held liable for any errors, omissions or damages. The estimated awards provided by this reference tool are based upon the assumption that the student will complete the FAFSA and CSS Profile accurately and all other data entered are true at the time of the estimate.   Also note that this estimator is not intended for use by students interested in New York University's Abu Dhabi campus. Students interested in learning about financial support from NYU Abu Dhabi should see NYU Abu Dhabi Financial Support .   Note: Any information that you provide on this site is confidential.

Some students also qualify for student loans to assist in paying this net price; however, student loans do have to be repaid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Please Note: The estimates above apply to full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students only.                                         These estimates do not represent a final determination, or actual award, of financial assistance or a final net              price; they are only estimates based on cost of attendance and financial aid provided to students in 2013-14.              Cost of attendance and financial aid availability change year to year. These estimates shall not be binding on              the Secretary of Education, the institution of higher education, or the State.                          Not all students receive financial aid. In 2013-14, 50% of our full-time students enrolling              for college for the first time received grant/scholarship aid. Students may also be eligible              for student loans and work-study. Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student              Aid (FAFSA) in order to determine their eligibility for Federal financial aid that includes              Federal grant, loan, or work-study assistance.

For each point taken in excess of 18 points in a semester, there is an additional charge per point.   Non-NYU Students   If your college or university has a partnership with NYU Global Academic Programs the cost of tuition may be less than    the posted figures. Inquire with your study abroad office to find out if there is a partnership with NYU.              Lodging   Costs listed above range from doubles to triples in student residence halls. Limited single rooms are avaible at a higher cost. Students participating in this program are required to live in NYU housing.    Study Away housing costs, depending upon the site and the accommodation option selected, usually include: utilities, insurance, access to health professionals and medical resources, immigration fees, 24-hour security, cleaning services, and meals. These factors impact prices and guarantee that both NYU and the student are in compliance with local legislation. NYU does all it can to keep housing costs low while maintaining the high quality of services and facilities we provide - which are among the most comprehensive in the Study Away field. A cancelation fee may be assessed if a student's written request to cancel the housing license be approved.     Meals   Meals may be prepared by students in the residence hall; however, most students prefer to dine in restaurants. Prices outside the tourist center are significantly lower and students can find very reasonably priced restaurants.   Miscellaneous   Costs include visa application fee, local transportation, laundry, telephone, utilities, and some independent travel. With the exception of tuition, all costs are estimated and may vary depending on each student's budget.   In addition, student insurance (health and accident) is mandatory and will vary according to individual policies.   Excursions/Cultural Activities   Some excursions and cultural activities are included in tuition costs.

Within a few weeks of registering for classes, students (with the exception of visiting students whose home schools choose to bill them directly for their term at NYU) will receive a message at their official NYU e-mail address notifying them that a bill for tuition, fees, and housing is now available.   Please visit the NYU Bursar Web-site for details about the E-bill process.              Students going to NYU Prague will be billed an estimated housing charge. This estimate is used as a \u201cplaceholder charge\u201d until we place students in their final housing assignment; the initial charge is unrelated to the final housing charge. There are two reasons we do this:     Students on financial aid have loans and grant funds released to them earlier.   Students can budget ahead and pay the bulk of their charges earlier, rather than waiting until final housing assignments are made.     Once the actual housing placement has been made, the E-bill is adjusted, resulting in either a credit or an additional charge. The final charge will appear on the student's E-bill within 2-3 weeks following the start of the program.                                                  NYU Centers Abroad...

Please read.   This net price calculator is intended to provide a general estimate of your potential financial aid package at New York University's New York campus . Please understand that completing this estimator does not take the place of actually applying for financial aid at NYU.   Returning, transfer and graduate students are excluded from the use of this estimator, and those students should review NYU's financial aid policies at Financial Aid and Scholarships to determine the financial aid award process and calendar as applicable.   All freshman applicants are strongly encouraged to file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (the FAFSA) and/or the CSS Profile application accurately and on time in order to determine their actual financial aid award (please see Applications and Forms for information regarding NYU's aid application requirements). The Profile data is needed to be considered for institutional grants and scholarships. Federal aid is dependent upon the FAFSA results, and will be awarded to those eligible, even if the preferred deadline is not met. NYU strongly encourages every applicant to carefully consider the financial investment in an NYU education once their actual financial aid award has been received, which typically occurs simultaneously with their offer of admission.   Freshman applicants must correctly follow the financial aid application process and meet the published deadlines to be considered for financial aid at NYU. Note that costs and financial aid estimates are subject to change. The results of this estimator are not actual offers of aid, and may be substantially different from your official aid offer from NYU. The results are based upon the assumption that you will be enrolled full time as an incoming freshman.   The University may not be held liable for any errors, omissions or damages. The estimated awards provided by this reference tool are based upon the assumption that the student will complete the FAFSA and CSS Profile accurately and all other data entered are true at the time of the estimate.   Also note that this estimator is not intended for use by students interested in New York University's Abu Dhabi campus. Students interested in learning about financial support from NYU Abu Dhabi should see NYU Abu Dhabi Financial Support .   Note: Any information that you provide on this site is confidential.

Some students also qualify for student loans to assist in paying this net price; however, student loans do have to be repaid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Please Note: The estimates above apply to full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students only.                                         These estimates do not represent a final determination, or actual award, of financial assistance or a final net              price; they are only estimates based on cost of attendance and financial aid provided to students in 2013-14.              Cost of attendance and financial aid availability change year to year. These estimates shall not be binding on              the Secretary of Education, the institution of higher education, or the State.                          Not all students receive financial aid. In 2013-14, 50% of our full-time students enrolling              for college for the first time received grant/scholarship aid. Students may also be eligible              for student loans and work-study. Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student              Aid (FAFSA) in order to determine their eligibility for Federal financial aid that includes              Federal grant, loan, or work-study assistance.
