Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           This undergraduate course will provide students with the tools needed to diagnose and solve organizational problems, to influence the actions of individuals, teams, and organizations, and to lead high performing effective organizations. We will examine the key variables in the organization that must be managed including the organization\u2019s planning systems, its culture, structure, people, and evaluation processes. Through a highly interactive approach, students will gain a theoretical and hands-on understanding of the critical components of managing and leading in organizations.      Our focus will be on both government and nonprofit organizations and how managing in these organizations is different from managing in the for- profit sector. For example, we will discuss public administration in the context of a democracy and the challenges of administrative leadership in an often highly charged political system. We\u2019ll explore public personnel administration and Human Resource Development and discuss the government budgeting process. We\u2019ll also review the nature of public policy and the relationship between policy decisions and program implementation. We will also discuss the nature of managing in nonprofit organizations and the challenges of being primarily a service provider. We\u2019ll focus on the difficulties in evaluating and controlling service delivery, such as evaluating the impact of a mentoring program on a young man\u2019s self-esteem. We\u2019ll also discuss the unique challenges in obtaining resources through foundations and other funding sources.    Prerequisites: None.      Open to sophomore, junior, and senior students, freshmen are ineligible to take this course.
