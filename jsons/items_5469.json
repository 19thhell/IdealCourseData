How  American slaves and Russian serfs wrote and were written about in the two  countries' literary traditions.

Theories  of Symbolic Exchange    RUSSN-UA  860 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    In  his seminal essay \"On the Gift\" (1923) Marcel Mauss developed a concept of an  alternative, non-market type of economy, based on a non-monetary exchange of  such symbolic values as social recognition, sovereignty, and political  participation. Today, this concept has acquired a new relevance in relation to the  economy of the Internet. Examines various theories of the symbolic that expand  the original Maussian model and encompass multiple aspects of culture: from  Georges Bataille, Roger Caillois and Mikhail Bakhtin to Jacques Derrida and  Jean Baudrillard.          Russia  and the West    RUSSN-UA  861 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    Explores  the question of the West in Russian history and culture since the 17th  century.

Also considers the book's  historical context; the sources that Tolstoy drew on; its place in Tolstoy's  oeuvre and thought; its place in the Russian tradition and in \"world\"  literature; and the various uses (including political and ideological) that  have been made of it since its initial publication.          The  Unquiet Dead: Imagining the Afterlife in Film and Fiction    RUSSN-UA  870 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    Explores  the connections between narrative and imagined scenarios for the afterlife.  Examines literary and cinematic treatments of vampires, ghosts, zombies, and,  in particular, posthumous narrators, and considers the political and  ideological deployment of afterlife narratives, investigating questions of  cultural and sexual purity, collective guilt, and socioeconomic anxiety.  Engages both the folklore and fiction of the Slavic world and contemporary  American reinterpretations. Readings from Nabokov, Gogol, Ovid, Stoker, and  Morrison, accompanied by selected films.          19th Century Realism: The Case of Russia   RUSSN-UA 871 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    Examines  competing literary representations of urban and rural spaces in Russian realism  as a platform for exploring the era's major cultural and ideological debates.
