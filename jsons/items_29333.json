GIPH\u2019s undergraduate program in Global Public Health requires that students participate in a 4-credit, 90 hour field-based experience called Experiential Learning (or EL) and an academic seminar.   This class is for GPH declared majors only and is restricted to sophomores, juniors and seniors. Prerequisites include UGPH GU 10 Health and Society in a Global Context and at least one other required GPH course.   The class is taught in two formats, corresponding to different sections: section 001, which is a team-based fieldwork experience; and section 002, which is an individual fieldwork experience. Both formats require experiential learning in the field for a total of 90 hours, and completion of academic course work. The guidelines below will help you determine which format you will be enrolling.   Note @ studying away: Students choosing to complete the fieldwork while they are studying abroad in any site except for London, will enroll in UGPH-60 Section 002, will need to complete the steps for section 002 and participate in the academic portion of the class on NYU Classes. Students studying away in London will register for NODEP-UA 9982 in lieu of UGPH-GU 60 002. Those students should email giph.undergrad@nyu.edu to request that a substitution memo be submitted to the registrar.            Do you see yourself working as part of a team?

GPH is not a stand-alone major. NYU\u2019s Global Institute  of Public Health provides CAS students with instructors, advisors, and courses  drawn from the entire University.       The Global Public Health/Science combined major (which includes a Prehealth concentration)  provides a unique opportunity for students to explore cutting-edge science and  how those developments can help address some of the world\u2019s most complex health  challenges. One of three concentrations that a student may select within Global  Public Health/Science is Prehealth. Students will work closely with an advisor  to select the right mix of electives to compliment individual interests and  career paths. Global Public Health/Science graduates will be well prepared to  pursue professional studies in medicine, dentistry, public health, and  nutrition, as well as academic and research positions.      Students will take  required courses in the six core public health areas:     Health &amp; Society in a Global Context     Biostatistics for Public Health     Epidemiology for Global Health Health Policy in a Global World Environmental Health in a Global World Undergraduate Experiential Learning in Global Public Health Students will also take a  set of designated Prehealth courses, and then fill out their coursework with two combined major electives (in Global Public Health and/or Prehealth) and the advanced study of  a foreign language. Study away for one semester at an approved NYU Global site  is also a requirement of the GPH combined major. Click here to see the full list of requirements for Global Public Health/ Science (Prehealth) majors. Students may declare the major only after their first year and only after they have successfully completed at least one global public health course and one prehealth course.
