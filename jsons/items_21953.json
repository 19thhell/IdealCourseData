Established as a Program, UDW+ continues to evolve and grow through:       Rebuilding existing University Data Warehouse architecture for more intuitive and integrated access to University data.   Decision Support Services around reporting and analytics.   Formalizing Data Management Policies and Practices that ensure integrity and accessibility.   Building a detailed and well executed ongoing internal Training Program.     The Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE) is gradually replacing the Brio reporting tool. OBIEE is a reporting tool that pulls data from UDW+ to deliver a full range of reporting and analytical capabilities, including interactive dashboards, full ad hoc report capabilities, and alerts.                                   UDW+ Architecture Overview         UDW+ stores major components of financial, student, HR, and research data. The UDW+ Program will continue to expand to include other areas. From the initial planning phases of the project to the design, requirements, and functionality of the new interactive dashboards, administrators, staff, department heads, and faculty from across NYU are collaborating to ensure the University will have timely access to accurate and integrated information for making critical decisions.                Currently available through UDW+:                                           Financial Reporting and Analytics                               The first project of the UDW+ Program is Financial Reporting and Analytics. One of the primary goals of the UDW+ program is improving financial reporting and analytics by providing more intuitive and flexible access to financial data. This project has impacted the entire financial reporting community, as Brio will eventually be replaced by UDW+. Deans, department heads, principal investigators, grant administrators, fiscal officers, executive leadership, and many others collaborated to design a variety of financial dashboards and reports tailored to meet the needs and requirements of groups throughout the University. ITS then developed and incorporated them into the new service.   To address specific needs of a school/division, advanced financial reporting users have the ability to create and share custom ad hoc reports. Ad hoc reports can be created with basic and complex analysis, adding graphs, formatting reports, as well as other advanced functions of the reporting tool.     To ensure continued improvements, the financial reporting and analytical capabilities are enhanced on a quarterly basis.

Departmental Metrics                               The Departmental Metrics Dashboard compiles data on faculty, sponsored research activity, student enrollment and instruction, for department chairs, deans, and university leadership. The metrics include research indicators identified by the Provost's Council on Science and Technology as &quot;Principal Markers of Success: Priority Academic Metrics for Assessing Science and Engineering at New York University.&quot;    The Departmental Metrics Dashboard was originally created for selected academic departments identified by the Provost's Council on Science and Technology, and included information on the department's faculty and research staff, faculty achievements, proposal submissions, grants and students, as well as external comparative metrics.   Due to popular demand, the Departmental Metrics Dashboard has been expanded and made available to all departments. With the expanding use of the Departmental Metrics Dashboard, additional pages have been added to provide information on doctoral time-to-degree, class enrollment, program enrollment trends, department course instructors, and technology enhanced education.   The Departmental Metrics Dashboard will continue to evolve based on feedback from Deans and Department Chairs.

HR Reporting and Analytics                               The UDW+ HR Reporting and Analytics project provisions HR data around people, positions, labor distribution, and payroll salary expenses. The development of new HR reporting content at NYU was a collaborative effort between PeopleSync and UDW+. Whereas PeopleSync is used for operational HR reporting, the focus of UDW+ development is centered around analytical and cross-functional reporting.

The goal of the UDW+ Student Reporting and Analytics is to provide a comprehensive source of data about students and instructional activity that is accurate, documented, user-friendly and integrated with financial and human resources data.   There are three subject areas that are currently available in UDW+ include Term Registration, Class Enrollment and Degrees (conferred).   Until now, the Departmental Metrics Dashboard provided deans and department chairs with summary analytics describing the students in their programs, enrollment in their courses, and doctoral time to degree. We have also expanded and enhanced the Departmental Metrics Dashboard with program enrollment trends, department course instructors page, and technology enhanced education information.   The current Brio student dashboard will be replaced with a more robust, interactive and graphic UDW+ Student Academic Management Dashboard. Starting in December 2014, the Core user group has been charged with identifying and fixing data issues (within the source, Campus Solutions). In February 2015, the Beta user group was engaged with the focus of providing feedback, prototyping and refining the UDW+ Student Academic Management Dashboard.

Established as a Program, UDW+ continues to evolve and grow through:       Rebuilding existing University Data Warehouse architecture for more intuitive and integrated access to University data.   Decision Support Services around reporting and analytics.   Formalizing Data Management Policies and Practices that ensure integrity and accessibility.   Building a detailed and well executed ongoing internal Training Program.     The Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE) is gradually replacing the Brio reporting tool. OBIEE is a reporting tool that pulls data from UDW+ to deliver a full range of reporting and analytical capabilities, including interactive dashboards, full ad hoc report capabilities, and alerts.                                   UDW+ Architecture Overview         UDW+ stores major components of financial, student, HR, and research data. The UDW+ Program will continue to expand to include other areas. From the initial planning phases of the project to the design, requirements, and functionality of the new interactive dashboards, administrators, staff, department heads, and faculty from across NYU are collaborating to ensure the University will have timely access to accurate and integrated information for making critical decisions.                Currently available through UDW+:                                           Financial Reporting and Analytics                               The first project of the UDW+ Program is Financial Reporting and Analytics. One of the primary goals of the UDW+ program is improving financial reporting and analytics by providing more intuitive and flexible access to financial data. This project has impacted the entire financial reporting community, as Brio will eventually be replaced by UDW+. Deans, department heads, principal investigators, grant administrators, fiscal officers, executive leadership, and many others collaborated to design a variety of financial dashboards and reports tailored to meet the needs and requirements of groups throughout the University. ITS then developed and incorporated them into the new service.   To address specific needs of a school/division, advanced financial reporting users have the ability to create and share custom ad hoc reports. Ad hoc reports can be created with basic and complex analysis, adding graphs, formatting reports, as well as other advanced functions of the reporting tool.     To ensure continued improvements, the financial reporting and analytical capabilities are enhanced on a quarterly basis.

Our data sources include our learning management system (ALEX), academic calendars, lecture podcasts, evaluations and examination systems, academic portfolios and online learning modules.\u00a0This approach allows us to evaluate and map our curriculum, track teaching efforts and learners\u2019 competencies across multiple systems over time.\u00a0 The EDW currently includes the continuum of learner data from undergraduate through graduate and eventually continuing medical education. As the next step, we plan to link the EDW to the Clinical Data Warehouse. This will enable clinical outcomes assessment at the individual learner-centered level as well as of our educational program as a whole.   Tools   The EDW is based on open source technologies, a MySQL database and Pentaho Business Intelligence suite, and therefore has a low barrier for implementation at other schools. The EDW is structured as a dimensional data model, which is easy to understand and provides fast performance.
