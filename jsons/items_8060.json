Research Interests   Design, Analysis and Simulation of Communication Networks   Modeling, Control and Optimization of Complex Systems     Grants Economic Incentives for P2P: Theory and Design, (co-PI) NSF, 09/01/2010 - 08/31/2013 Although P2P has proven itself as a viable architectural paradigm for distributed applications, the success of future P2P applications ultimately depends on convincing users to volunteer these resources. In this project, two inter-related P2P incentive paradigms are under investigation. In the first paradigm, called Networked Asynchronous Bilateral Trading (NABT), each user has a set of online friends. Users can trade asynchronously with direct friends using local currency and a debt limits. NABT also allows trades to pass through intermediaries. For file sharing, NABT is almost as efficient as a perfect economy, where all users can trade directly with each other. Research is also aimed at extending NABT, developing designs and theories for heterogeneous P2P resource markets. The second paradigm, called Closed P2P Communities, uses a lightweight centralized banking infrastructure. Here the focus is on designing and analyzing a new class of powerful, but lightweight currency-based incentive schemes. Game theory is being applied to design incentive mechanisms that optimize deal throughput for diverse P2P markets and pricing theory is used to study the pricing dynamics in closed P2P communities. Novel approaches for detecting and evicting colluders are also under development. Prototypes for both incentive paradigms will be constructed. The project will provide a framework for a new P2P computing paradigm. It will involve undergraduate and graduate students, especially minority students. Interactions with industry will be facilitated through the CATT center at NYU-Poly. Educational material will be developed and disseminated for undergraduate and graduate level networking courses taught by the PIs at NYU-Poly.

In these traditional systems, a peer only redistributes the video it is currently watching. In this research, the PIs are exploring a radically different approach to P2P live video streaming, View-Upload Decoupling (VUD). The main idea of VUD is to have each peer distribute one or more channels, with the assignments being made independently of what the peer is viewing. This novel approach has three major advantages over the traditional isolated-channel designs: channel-churn immunity; cross-channel multiplexing; and the enabling of structured streaming. The PIs are developing tractable analytical performance models for multi-channel P2P video streaming systems, for both VUD and traditional design approaches. The analytical results not only highlight the advantages of the VUD approach, but also provide important ``rules-of-thumb&#039;&#039; for the design of VUD systems. The PIs are developing dynamic VUD provisioning algorithms that are both robust with respect to channel churn and also adapt to dynamic channel popularity and flash crowds. The PIs are developing VUD provisioning, management and streaming schemes that take into account ISP locality and largely reduce the video streaming traffic imposed on ISP networks. The PIs and their PhD students are also developing an open-source VUD prototype. Network X-ities - Foundations and Applications, (Co-Principle Investigator) National Science Foundation, 09/01/2005 - 08/31/2010 From the early days of the ARPAnet to today&#039;s global Internet, most research on network protocols has focused on traditional performance metrics such as delay, loss, and throughput. However, it is becoming increasingly important that a network not only provides good performance, but also do so in the face of a complex, uncertain, error-prone, and ever-changing environment. In today&#039;s networks, operating conditions may change as a result of user behavior (e.g., a shift in traffic to a newly popular Web site) or the underlying infrastructure (e.g., an equipment failure). In all such cases, the network and its operators must respond in a robust fashion, continuing to provide good performance despite changing conditions.      The need for &quot;robust&quot; network operation leads to a set of design considerations that the principal investigators (PIs) refer to as the &quot;X-ities&quot; (since they all end in &quot;ity&quot;): non-fragility, manageability, diagnosability, optimizability, scalability, and evolvability. Intuitively, we know that these X-ities are crucially important if we are to design and analyze robust networks and protocols. Yet, compared with standard performance metrics, these X-ities often lack theoretical foundations, quantitative frameworks, or even well-defined metrics and meaning. The goal of this project is to build a rigorous, quantitative foundation for explicitly considering the X-ities in the design and analysis of network protocols. The PIs consider a number of specific problems, broadly in the area of routing protocols, that concretely address several of the X-ities---with particular emphasis on non-fragility and manageability---and to begin to draw larger lessons from commonalities among the problems studied.      The proposed research focuses on the X-ities in the context of the routing protocols that ensure that each computer has paths through the network to send data to other computers. There are several reasons for this choice. First, routing protocols are a crucial part of the network architecture---they are the very glue that holds the disparate parts of the Internet together. Second, the X-ities of IP routing have not received significant formal attention. Third, routing protocols expose key issues of incomplete information (e.g., across networks run by different institutions) and interacting levels of control (e.g., between applications and the underlying network)---concerns that should arise in any thorough treatment of network X-ities. Finally, routing provides a compelling context in which the X-ities can be quantitatively studied. For example, we can quantify the performance trade-off between a fragile routing solution that has been optimized for narrow, well-defined operating conditions, versus a solution that will perform well of over variety of operating conditions. The contributions of the proposed research are three-fold:      A first quantitative study of X-ities: The intellectual challenges in rigorously understanding the X-ities are many. The PIs define specific metrics and develop mathematical models to quantitatively study each X-ity.      Solutions to specific problems: To make the study of the X-ities concrete, the PIs consider a set of research problems broadly in the area of routing that are of interest in their own right.      The beginnings of a foundation for studying X-ities: The PIs believe that the study of network X-ities is a crucially important area for long-term research in networking.      The X-ity research will lead to a deeper quantitative understanding of how to develop robust network architectures and protocols---technology that is playing an increasingly crucial role in our daily lives. The broader impacts of the research will include enhanced teaching, training, and learning for our students, development and dissemination of new educational materials, and dissemination of X-ity research results throughout the technical community.

Research Interests   Design, Analysis and Simulation of Communication Networks   Modeling, Control and Optimization of Complex Systems     Grants Economic Incentives for P2P: Theory and Design, (co-PI) NSF, 09/01/2010 - 08/31/2013 Although P2P has proven itself as a viable architectural paradigm for distributed applications, the success of future P2P applications ultimately depends on convincing users to volunteer these resources. In this project, two inter-related P2P incentive paradigms are under investigation. In the first paradigm, called Networked Asynchronous Bilateral Trading (NABT), each user has a set of online friends. Users can trade asynchronously with direct friends using local currency and a debt limits. NABT also allows trades to pass through intermediaries. For file sharing, NABT is almost as efficient as a perfect economy, where all users can trade directly with each other. Research is also aimed at extending NABT, developing designs and theories for heterogeneous P2P resource markets. The second paradigm, called Closed P2P Communities, uses a lightweight centralized banking infrastructure. Here the focus is on designing and analyzing a new class of powerful, but lightweight currency-based incentive schemes. Game theory is being applied to design incentive mechanisms that optimize deal throughput for diverse P2P markets and pricing theory is used to study the pricing dynamics in closed P2P communities. Novel approaches for detecting and evicting colluders are also under development. Prototypes for both incentive paradigms will be constructed. The project will provide a framework for a new P2P computing paradigm. It will involve undergraduate and graduate students, especially minority students. Interactions with industry will be facilitated through the CATT center at NYU-Poly. Educational material will be developed and disseminated for undergraduate and graduate level networking courses taught by the PIs at NYU-Poly.

In these traditional systems, a peer only redistributes the video it is currently watching. In this research, the PIs are exploring a radically different approach to P2P live video streaming, View-Upload Decoupling (VUD). The main idea of VUD is to have each peer distribute one or more channels, with the assignments being made independently of what the peer is viewing. This novel approach has three major advantages over the traditional isolated-channel designs: channel-churn immunity; cross-channel multiplexing; and the enabling of structured streaming. The PIs are developing tractable analytical performance models for multi-channel P2P video streaming systems, for both VUD and traditional design approaches. The analytical results not only highlight the advantages of the VUD approach, but also provide important ``rules-of-thumb&#039;&#039; for the design of VUD systems. The PIs are developing dynamic VUD provisioning algorithms that are both robust with respect to channel churn and also adapt to dynamic channel popularity and flash crowds. The PIs are developing VUD provisioning, management and streaming schemes that take into account ISP locality and largely reduce the video streaming traffic imposed on ISP networks. The PIs and their PhD students are also developing an open-source VUD prototype. Network X-ities - Foundations and Applications, (Co-Principle Investigator) National Science Foundation, 09/01/2005 - 08/31/2010 From the early days of the ARPAnet to today&#039;s global Internet, most research on network protocols has focused on traditional performance metrics such as delay, loss, and throughput. However, it is becoming increasingly important that a network not only provides good performance, but also do so in the face of a complex, uncertain, error-prone, and ever-changing environment. In today&#039;s networks, operating conditions may change as a result of user behavior (e.g., a shift in traffic to a newly popular Web site) or the underlying infrastructure (e.g., an equipment failure). In all such cases, the network and its operators must respond in a robust fashion, continuing to provide good performance despite changing conditions.      The need for &quot;robust&quot; network operation leads to a set of design considerations that the principal investigators (PIs) refer to as the &quot;X-ities&quot; (since they all end in &quot;ity&quot;): non-fragility, manageability, diagnosability, optimizability, scalability, and evolvability. Intuitively, we know that these X-ities are crucially important if we are to design and analyze robust networks and protocols. Yet, compared with standard performance metrics, these X-ities often lack theoretical foundations, quantitative frameworks, or even well-defined metrics and meaning. The goal of this project is to build a rigorous, quantitative foundation for explicitly considering the X-ities in the design and analysis of network protocols. The PIs consider a number of specific problems, broadly in the area of routing protocols, that concretely address several of the X-ities---with particular emphasis on non-fragility and manageability---and to begin to draw larger lessons from commonalities among the problems studied.      The proposed research focuses on the X-ities in the context of the routing protocols that ensure that each computer has paths through the network to send data to other computers. There are several reasons for this choice. First, routing protocols are a crucial part of the network architecture---they are the very glue that holds the disparate parts of the Internet together. Second, the X-ities of IP routing have not received significant formal attention. Third, routing protocols expose key issues of incomplete information (e.g., across networks run by different institutions) and interacting levels of control (e.g., between applications and the underlying network)---concerns that should arise in any thorough treatment of network X-ities. Finally, routing provides a compelling context in which the X-ities can be quantitatively studied. For example, we can quantify the performance trade-off between a fragile routing solution that has been optimized for narrow, well-defined operating conditions, versus a solution that will perform well of over variety of operating conditions. The contributions of the proposed research are three-fold:      A first quantitative study of X-ities: The intellectual challenges in rigorously understanding the X-ities are many. The PIs define specific metrics and develop mathematical models to quantitatively study each X-ity.      Solutions to specific problems: To make the study of the X-ities concrete, the PIs consider a set of research problems broadly in the area of routing that are of interest in their own right.      The beginnings of a foundation for studying X-ities: The PIs believe that the study of network X-ities is a crucially important area for long-term research in networking.      The X-ity research will lead to a deeper quantitative understanding of how to develop robust network architectures and protocols---technology that is playing an increasingly crucial role in our daily lives. The broader impacts of the research will include enhanced teaching, training, and learning for our students, development and dissemination of new educational materials, and dissemination of X-ity research results throughout the technical community.

Research Interests   Design, Analysis and Simulation of Communication Networks   Modeling, Control and Optimization of Complex Systems     Grants Economic Incentives for P2P: Theory and Design, (co-PI) NSF, 09/01/2010 - 08/31/2013 Although P2P has proven itself as a viable architectural paradigm for distributed applications, the success of future P2P applications ultimately depends on convincing users to volunteer these resources. In this project, two inter-related P2P incentive paradigms are under investigation. In the first paradigm, called Networked Asynchronous Bilateral Trading (NABT), each user has a set of online friends. Users can trade asynchronously with direct friends using local currency and a debt limits. NABT also allows trades to pass through intermediaries. For file sharing, NABT is almost as efficient as a perfect economy, where all users can trade directly with each other. Research is also aimed at extending NABT, developing designs and theories for heterogeneous P2P resource markets. The second paradigm, called Closed P2P Communities, uses a lightweight centralized banking infrastructure. Here the focus is on designing and analyzing a new class of powerful, but lightweight currency-based incentive schemes. Game theory is being applied to design incentive mechanisms that optimize deal throughput for diverse P2P markets and pricing theory is used to study the pricing dynamics in closed P2P communities. Novel approaches for detecting and evicting colluders are also under development. Prototypes for both incentive paradigms will be constructed. The project will provide a framework for a new P2P computing paradigm. It will involve undergraduate and graduate students, especially minority students. Interactions with industry will be facilitated through the CATT center at NYU-Poly. Educational material will be developed and disseminated for undergraduate and graduate level networking courses taught by the PIs at NYU-Poly.

In these traditional systems, a peer only redistributes the video it is currently watching. In this research, the PIs are exploring a radically different approach to P2P live video streaming, View-Upload Decoupling (VUD). The main idea of VUD is to have each peer distribute one or more channels, with the assignments being made independently of what the peer is viewing. This novel approach has three major advantages over the traditional isolated-channel designs: channel-churn immunity; cross-channel multiplexing; and the enabling of structured streaming. The PIs are developing tractable analytical performance models for multi-channel P2P video streaming systems, for both VUD and traditional design approaches. The analytical results not only highlight the advantages of the VUD approach, but also provide important ``rules-of-thumb&#039;&#039; for the design of VUD systems. The PIs are developing dynamic VUD provisioning algorithms that are both robust with respect to channel churn and also adapt to dynamic channel popularity and flash crowds. The PIs are developing VUD provisioning, management and streaming schemes that take into account ISP locality and largely reduce the video streaming traffic imposed on ISP networks. The PIs and their PhD students are also developing an open-source VUD prototype. Network X-ities - Foundations and Applications, (Co-Principle Investigator) National Science Foundation, 09/01/2005 - 08/31/2010 From the early days of the ARPAnet to today&#039;s global Internet, most research on network protocols has focused on traditional performance metrics such as delay, loss, and throughput. However, it is becoming increasingly important that a network not only provides good performance, but also do so in the face of a complex, uncertain, error-prone, and ever-changing environment. In today&#039;s networks, operating conditions may change as a result of user behavior (e.g., a shift in traffic to a newly popular Web site) or the underlying infrastructure (e.g., an equipment failure). In all such cases, the network and its operators must respond in a robust fashion, continuing to provide good performance despite changing conditions.      The need for &quot;robust&quot; network operation leads to a set of design considerations that the principal investigators (PIs) refer to as the &quot;X-ities&quot; (since they all end in &quot;ity&quot;): non-fragility, manageability, diagnosability, optimizability, scalability, and evolvability. Intuitively, we know that these X-ities are crucially important if we are to design and analyze robust networks and protocols. Yet, compared with standard performance metrics, these X-ities often lack theoretical foundations, quantitative frameworks, or even well-defined metrics and meaning. The goal of this project is to build a rigorous, quantitative foundation for explicitly considering the X-ities in the design and analysis of network protocols. The PIs consider a number of specific problems, broadly in the area of routing protocols, that concretely address several of the X-ities---with particular emphasis on non-fragility and manageability---and to begin to draw larger lessons from commonalities among the problems studied.      The proposed research focuses on the X-ities in the context of the routing protocols that ensure that each computer has paths through the network to send data to other computers. There are several reasons for this choice. First, routing protocols are a crucial part of the network architecture---they are the very glue that holds the disparate parts of the Internet together. Second, the X-ities of IP routing have not received significant formal attention. Third, routing protocols expose key issues of incomplete information (e.g., across networks run by different institutions) and interacting levels of control (e.g., between applications and the underlying network)---concerns that should arise in any thorough treatment of network X-ities. Finally, routing provides a compelling context in which the X-ities can be quantitatively studied. For example, we can quantify the performance trade-off between a fragile routing solution that has been optimized for narrow, well-defined operating conditions, versus a solution that will perform well of over variety of operating conditions. The contributions of the proposed research are three-fold:      A first quantitative study of X-ities: The intellectual challenges in rigorously understanding the X-ities are many. The PIs define specific metrics and develop mathematical models to quantitatively study each X-ity.      Solutions to specific problems: To make the study of the X-ities concrete, the PIs consider a set of research problems broadly in the area of routing that are of interest in their own right.      The beginnings of a foundation for studying X-ities: The PIs believe that the study of network X-ities is a crucially important area for long-term research in networking.      The X-ity research will lead to a deeper quantitative understanding of how to develop robust network architectures and protocols---technology that is playing an increasingly crucial role in our daily lives. The broader impacts of the research will include enhanced teaching, training, and learning for our students, development and dissemination of new educational materials, and dissemination of X-ity research results throughout the technical community.
