GUIDING PRINCIPLES:   While LSJP does not take a position on the political form that should ultimately be adopted in Palestine/Israel, it does believe that certain key principles of international law will be fundamental to any genuine and just resolution. At minimum, such a resolution would include:     an end to the Israeli occupation and colonization of all Palestinian lands, in accordance with the Geneva Conventions;   the dismantling of the Apartheid Wall, in accordance with the 2004 opinion of the International Court of Justice;   a guarantee of the fundamental rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality, as articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;   a guarantee of Palestinian refugees' right of return to their homes and property, as stipulated in UN Resolution 194; and   a right to self determination for the Palestinian people.     BOYCOTT, DIVESTMENT AND SANCTIONS:   LSJP supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign as a lawful and effective tool to promote justice for the Palestinian people.
