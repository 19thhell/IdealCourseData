Under what circumstances are people in crisis seen, but not heard, in public? In what ways do visual practices condition who belongs and who does not belong to a political community? How is belonging to a political community accomplished visually? Why does seeing human rights and humanitarian crises matter? This conference explores these and other questions about the links between visual arts, public communication, human rights, and humanitarian action. The aim is to recast citizenship as more than a legal property or juridical frame. Instead, invited speakers consider the ways in which imagery and organized spaces effect how people realize their place in a political community and manage what they do about it. What we see, how we see it, according to whom, and where contribute to the way people in crisis debate meaningfully about how they are governed.
