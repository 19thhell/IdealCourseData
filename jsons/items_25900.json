Students should speak with an adviser in the department to help them plan their major. Advisers are located at 19 West Fourth Street, Rooms 836 and 837.    In the list of courses below, some courses are designated either \"P\" or \"T\" (or both). \"P\" alone represents courses to be taken only by students in the policy concentration; \"T\" alone represents courses to be taken only by students in the theory concentration; and \"P, T\" represents courses that may be taken by students in either concentration.    Economics courses for majors fall into several categories: introductory and intermediate core courses; elective courses at the 200 and 300 level; and special honors courses. Students must pay careful attention to prerequisites, as they are strictly enforced in this sequential major.    Students should refer to Albert for up-to-date listings of 200 and 300 level elective course offerings each semester.

We then ask how such departures can be formalized theoretically and how the resulting models can be tested empirically.    Political Economy (T)   ECON-UA 345 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduces the emerging field of formal political economy. The variety of ways in which economists and political scientists think about political science and the interplay of political science and economics are analyzed. The first part of the course focuses on the formal modeling of political behavior and political institutions; the theory of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action) are analyzed. The second part of the course discusses the connection between politics and economics and investigates the effect of political variables on the determination of economic outcomes. Some questions that are answered: How can special groups of individuals enhance their well-being by political action? What is lobbying? What is the effect of contributions on political outcomes?

Students should speak with an adviser in the department to help them plan their major. Advisers are located at 19 West Fourth Street, Rooms 836 and 837.    In the list of courses below, some courses are designated either \"P\" or \"T\" (or both). \"P\" alone represents courses to be taken only by students in the policy concentration; \"T\" alone represents courses to be taken only by students in the theory concentration; and \"P, T\" represents courses that may be taken by students in either concentration.    Economics courses for majors fall into several categories: introductory and intermediate core courses; elective courses at the 200 and 300 level; and special honors courses. Students must pay careful attention to prerequisites, as they are strictly enforced in this sequential major.    Students should refer to Albert for up-to-date listings of 200 and 300 level elective course offerings each semester.

Topics covered include, but are not restricted to, prospect theory, mental accounting, other-regarding preferences, and hyperbolic discounting. We usually approach a topic by examining evidence of some departure from the assumptions made in the canonical economic model. We then ask how such departures can be formalized theoretically and how the resulting models can be tested empirically.    Political Economy (T)   ECON-UA 345 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduces the emerging field of formal political economy. The variety of ways in which economists and political scientists think about political science and the interplay of political science and economics are analyzed. The first part of the course focuses on the formal modeling of political behavior and political institutions; the theory of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action) are analyzed. The second part of the course discusses the connection between politics and economics and investigates the effect of political variables on the determination of economic outcomes. Some questions that are answered: How can special groups of individuals enhance their well-being by political action? What is lobbying? What is the effect of contributions on political outcomes?

Experimental Economics (P, T)   ECON-UA 360 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.    Experimental economics is predicated on the belief that economics, like other sciences, can be a laboratory science where economic theories are tested, rejected, and revised. This course reviews the methodology of doing such laboratory experiments and investigates the use of experiments in a wide variety of fields. These include competitive markets, auctions, public goods theory, labor economics, game theory, and individual choice theory. The course functions as a research seminar in which students present their work as it progresses during the semester. Students also get exposure to the experimental laboratory in the Department of Economics and the research performed there.
