We emphasize the practical (basic and advanced skills training) and the theoretical. Students take lecture and seminar classes that emphasize professional ethics, the cultural politics of the media, the social role of the journalist, and the importance of craft (expository, explanatory, and literary technique).   Our strong liberal arts emphasis includes the requirement that every journalism student fulfill a double major with another discipline within the College of Arts and Science, or students from other NYU schools may elect journalism as a second major.   Students can expect an immersion experience in New York City, and can avail themselves of numerous pre-professional and professional publishing opportunities, including the numerous webzines produced within the Institute.   The Honors Program invites eligible juniors or seniors with the highest grade-point average to take special sections of Advanced Reporting and Senior Seminar courses, while completing a two-semester capstone project.   Students can also opt to study around the world in our Journalism Abroad program. Both summer and fall/spring courses are offered.   Activities and Awards   Throughout the year, the Institute plays host to innovators and icons of journalism in a series of guest lectures designed to acquaint its students with some of the leading reporters and editors in the field, as well as with issues dominating the news. There is not a magazine or newspaper published in the city whose editors and reporters have not visited us, whether in Institute-wide events or classroom appearances. In intimate talks, household names such as Gay Talese, Sebastian Junger, David Remnick, Garrison Keillor, Adrian Nicole Leblanc,Tavis Smiley and Greil Marcus have shared their wisdom with our students. Some of the most exciting names in journalism teach as Distinguished Writers in Residence, among them Pete Hamill, James McBride, Farai Chideya and Salman Rushdie.   The Institute also honors top students with awards at its annual post-graduation ceremony.   Career Options   The Institute is committed to preparing its students for careers in newspapers, broadcasting, magazines, and media criticism. Even for students not pursuing careers in journalism, the Institute fosters the skills necessary to succeed in the professional world. The ability to read closely, research thoroughly, think critically, and write clearly and effectively are essential for any career. Institute resources include an Office of Career Services for guidance into the profession.   Admission and Financial Aid   Admission to Journalism is not through the Institute directly, but through the University's Office of Undergraduate Admissions .   The University sponsors and administers a wide variety of financial aid programs. Awards are based on the student's record of academic achievement and test scores as well as on financial need.

We emphasize the practical (basic and advanced skills training) and the theoretical. Students take lecture and seminar classes that emphasize professional ethics, the cultural politics of the media, the social role of the journalist, and the importance of craft (expository, explanatory, and literary technique).   Our strong liberal arts emphasis includes the requirement that every journalism student fulfill a double major with another discipline within the College of Arts and Science, or students from other NYU schools may elect journalism as a second major.   Students can expect an immersion experience in New York City, and can avail themselves of numerous pre-professional and professional publishing opportunities, including the numerous webzines produced within the Institute.   The Honors Program invites eligible juniors or seniors with the highest grade-point average to take special sections of Advanced Reporting and Senior Seminar courses, while completing a two-semester capstone project.   Students can also opt to study around the world in our Journalism Abroad program. Both summer and fall/spring courses are offered.   Activities and Awards   Throughout the year, the Institute plays host to innovators and icons of journalism in a series of guest lectures designed to acquaint its students with some of the leading reporters and editors in the field, as well as with issues dominating the news. There is not a magazine or newspaper published in the city whose editors and reporters have not visited us, whether in Institute-wide events or classroom appearances. In intimate talks, household names such as Gay Talese, Sebastian Junger, David Remnick, Garrison Keillor, Adrian Nicole Leblanc,Tavis Smiley and Greil Marcus have shared their wisdom with our students. Some of the most exciting names in journalism teach as Distinguished Writers in Residence, among them Pete Hamill, James McBride, Farai Chideya and Salman Rushdie.   The Institute also honors top students with awards at its annual post-graduation ceremony.   Career Options   The Institute is committed to preparing its students for careers in newspapers, broadcasting, magazines, and media criticism. Even for students not pursuing careers in journalism, the Institute fosters the skills necessary to succeed in the professional world. The ability to read closely, research thoroughly, think critically, and write clearly and effectively are essential for any career. Institute resources include an Office of Career Services for guidance into the profession.   Admission and Financial Aid   Admission to Journalism is not through the Institute directly, but through the University's Office of Undergraduate Admissions .   The University sponsors and administers a wide variety of financial aid programs. Awards are based on the student's record of academic achievement and test scores as well as on financial need.

Carter Journalism Institute has become a leader in developing advanced forms of journalism education. The vast majority of journalism programs cling to a traditional curriculum that teaches skills specifically for one medium of communication - newspaper, magazine, digital or new media, and broadcasting. NYU, however, responding to the need for journalists who are sophisticated in the subject matter that they are covering, has pioneered a curriculum that combines education in subject matter as well as skills.   Master of Arts students at the Carter Institute can choose their program of study based on their areas of interest. They can enroll in distinct programs that focus on science, environment and health or business and economics, as well as concentrations in national and urban issues or culture and criticism. They can choose from other programs focusing on specific areas of the globe. Or they can immerse themselves in learning the most challenging forms of journalism, including literary reportage, documentaries, magazine writing, and new forms that meld the use of audio and video with experimental web-based journalism.   Our dedication to challenging our students to go well beyond traditional skills training has evolved naturally from the Institute's residence in NYU's distinguished Faculty of Arts and Science. Thus, we emphasize the kind of critical thinking skills so important in covering a complex, interrelated world. Our faculty comprises an active community of writers who turn out books on important contemporary topics, publish in the most prestigious papers, magazines, and reviews, and produce serious documentaries for such venues as National Public Radio and the network news magazines.   NYU journalism graduate students also compete for some of the most challenging paid and unpaid internships in the business. All programs feature an Arts and Sciences emphasis, basic and advanced skills training, lectures and seminars foundational to the excellent practice of journalism, and thorough exposure to the New York world. Students also have the opportunity to avail themselves of numerous pre-professional and professional publishing opportunities.

We emphasize the practical (basic and advanced skills training) and the theoretical. Students take lecture and seminar classes that emphasize professional ethics, the cultural politics of the media, the social role of the journalist, and the importance of craft (expository, explanatory, and literary technique).   Our strong liberal arts emphasis includes the requirement that every journalism student fulfill a double major with another discipline within the College of Arts and Science, or students from other NYU schools may elect journalism as a second major.   Students can expect an immersion experience in New York City, and can avail themselves of numerous pre-professional and professional publishing opportunities, including the numerous webzines produced within the Institute.   The Honors Program invites eligible juniors or seniors with the highest grade-point average to take special sections of Advanced Reporting and Senior Seminar courses, while completing a two-semester capstone project.   Students can also opt to study around the world in our Journalism Abroad program. Both summer and fall/spring courses are offered.   Activities and Awards   Throughout the year, the Institute plays host to innovators and icons of journalism in a series of guest lectures designed to acquaint its students with some of the leading reporters and editors in the field, as well as with issues dominating the news. There is not a magazine or newspaper published in the city whose editors and reporters have not visited us, whether in Institute-wide events or classroom appearances. In intimate talks, household names such as Gay Talese, Sebastian Junger, David Remnick, Garrison Keillor, Adrian Nicole Leblanc,Tavis Smiley and Greil Marcus have shared their wisdom with our students. Some of the most exciting names in journalism teach as Distinguished Writers in Residence, among them Pete Hamill, James McBride, Farai Chideya and Salman Rushdie.   The Institute also honors top students with awards at its annual post-graduation ceremony.   Career Options   The Institute is committed to preparing its students for careers in newspapers, broadcasting, magazines, and media criticism. Even for students not pursuing careers in journalism, the Institute fosters the skills necessary to succeed in the professional world.

Carter Journalism Institute has become a leader in developing advanced forms of journalism education. The vast majority of journalism programs cling to a traditional curriculum that teaches skills specifically for one medium of communication - newspaper, magazine, digital or new media, and broadcasting. NYU, however, responding to the need for journalists who are sophisticated in the subject matter that they are covering, has pioneered a curriculum that combines education in subject matter as well as skills.   Master of Arts students at the Carter Institute can choose their program of study based on their areas of interest. They can enroll in distinct programs that focus on science, environment and health or business and economics, as well as concentrations in national and urban issues or culture and criticism. They can choose from other programs focusing on specific areas of the globe. Or they can immerse themselves in learning the most challenging forms of journalism, including literary reportage, documentaries, magazine writing, and new forms that meld the use of audio and video with experimental web-based journalism.   Our dedication to challenging our students to go well beyond traditional skills training has evolved naturally from the Institute's residence in NYU's distinguished Faculty of Arts and Science. Thus, we emphasize the kind of critical thinking skills so important in covering a complex, interrelated world. Our faculty comprises an active community of writers who turn out books on important contemporary topics, publish in the most prestigious papers, magazines, and reviews, and produce serious documentaries for such venues as National Public Radio and the network news magazines.   NYU journalism graduate students also compete for some of the most challenging paid and unpaid internships in the business. All programs feature an Arts and Sciences emphasis, basic and advanced skills training, lectures and seminars foundational to the excellent practice of journalism, and thorough exposure to the New York world. Students also have the opportunity to avail themselves of numerous pre-professional and professional publishing opportunities.
