Please check there for the most up-to-date information about the Annual Survey of American Law !   Mission   Founded in 1942, the New York University Annual Survey of American Law is a student-edited journal at New York University School of Law. The Annual Survey is NYU's second-oldest legal journal and was originally compiled by NYU faculty members as a comprehensive annual reference to developments in American law. Now a quarterly publication, the Annual Survey continues its dedication to exploring contemporary legal developments in the United States from a practice-oriented perspective. Annual Survey articles analyze emerging legal trends, interpret significant recent court decisions and legislation, and explain leading legal scholars' and judges' perspectives on current legal topics. The journal is widely distributed throughout the world, giving lawyers both inside and outside the United States insight into American law and legal issues.   Scholarship   The Annual Survey publishes several unique issues each year that help to develop and deepen contemporary understanding of legal developments and influential figures in American law. Each year, the journal sponsors a symposium that brings eminent scholars and advocates to the Law School and publishes a special issue of the journal featuring articles arising out of the symposium. This year's symposium focused on labor unions, exploring the ways unions act in the political sphere given recent developments in the law, the changing public perception of organized labor, and the future of the NLRB. Other issues of the journal include a survey of legal developments in the preceding year. ( symposia | issues )   Dedication   In the spring, the Annual Survey dedicates a volume to a preeminent jurist, scholar, or legal practitioner. The dedicatee is personally honored in a ceremony and dinner, and an Annual Survey issue features tributes and scholarship on the dedicatee's achievements and contributions to American law. In 2014, the Annual Survey honored Chief Judge Diane Wood of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Past dedicatees include President Herbert Hoover; Supreme Court Justices Harry Blackmun, William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia, and Stephen Breyer; Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and George Mitchell; Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Dr. Alexander Boraine of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission; Attorney General Janet Reno; Professors Ronald Dworkin, Arthur Miller, and Derrick Bell (in memoriam) of NYU School of Law; Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School; and NYU President and former Dean of NYU School of Law John Sexton.

He has also written THESE GOOD MEN: Friendships Forged in War , a memoir published to critical acclaim in 1990. He is a former reporter and columnist for The New York Times national, foreign and metropolitan desks and was the inaugural writer for the following New York Times columns: \"A Sense of Place\", a monthly column that explored the dislocations of modern life in one suburban town; \"Lessons\", a national column on education; and \"Our Towns\", a twice-weekly column on life outside New York City.   Norman's work also includes major articles for various other national publications, including The New York Times Magazine, The Washington Post Magazine and GQ Magazine . His work has been syndicated both here and abroad. He is currently under contract to MacMillan Publishers to write a major work on Bellevue Hospital in New York City, America\u2019s oldest continuously operating hospital and perhaps the best-known medical center in the world. He is again working with a co-author, his wife, Professor Elizabeth M. Norman (Steinhardt/Humanities). The book will be a narrative look at the institution -- inside Bellevue. The authors have been named Visiting Professors of Research in the Department of Emergency Medicine at New York University Medical School, Bellevue Hospital Center. They have been working on the book for six years and plan to have it on the shelves in 2016/2017.
