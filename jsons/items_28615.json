Special emphasis is placed on the impact of recent technological developments on public art, but in turn, we use public art to reflect on emergent cultural and social transformations in New York City. The course focuses especially on the evolution of both Times Square and Union Square in New York City, to understand how art, commerce, politics, and public life have competed and converged to influence social and political change over the years. But the experiential component of the course is a technology-based public art project (most likely involving large-scale digital media) that students plan and execute. The project most likely utilizes large-scale digital media, and the instructor secures the necessary funds to carry it out. Students keep a journal for the duration of the project, which is used to evaluate the project and to connect it to other coursework.

This hybrid seminar/studio course will introduce students to the history and current discourse surrounding contemporary public art , art intervention, and social critique of space. Working individually and in teams, students will create site-specific public space interventions which explore and respond to the politics and poetics of place. Students will also receive a hands on introduction to the Berlin contemporary art scene through guided visits to artist studios, galleries, and other cultural sites. No previous background or training in studio art is required.
