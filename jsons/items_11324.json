Fall and spring. Prerequisite: Highly recommended for ALL sophomores In this course you will attain an understanding of the key factors that contribute to organizational success and the role that managers play in helping their organizations become more successful. The better that you understand these issues, the more effective you will be in your future careers. More specifically, the course will explore how organizational leaders develop winning strategies, and then design their organization in a way that aligns structures, social relationships, tasks, human resource practices, and people to achieve those strategies. In exploring these issues, you will identify the challenges that organizational leaders and managers face as they try to make good decisions in the face of a constantly evolving industry environment, competing goals and agendas, and an increasingly diverse and global workforce. International Studies Program MGMT-UB.0011 4 units. Spring. Prerequisite: SOIM-UB 6, ECON-UB 11 and junior standing. The International Studies Program (ISP) builds on the historical and cultural courses of the first two years of undergraduate study and on Economics of Global Business (ECON-UB 11). Students develop frameworks and techniques for analyzing how countries differ and the impact of those differences on opportunities for the growth and profitability of multinational firms headquartered in or investing in different countries. Students also develop concepts and tools useful in formulating competitive strategy for multinational firms competing in global industries. Working in teams, students carry out an in-depth study of a company located in a foreign country. This study consists of three parts: (1) a written proposal; (2) research and data collection from secondary sources, augmented by primary research on-site in the foreign country during the spring semester break; and (3) preparation of a final report and oral presentation of findings. Team work and oral and written presentation skills are an integral part of the ISP. This course cannot be taken to meet any elective requirements for the management major.  ELECTIVE COURSES  International Business Management MGMT-UB.0004 3 units. Fall and spring. Prerequisites: MGMT-UB.0001, ECON-UB 0011 This course focuses on the strategic and organizational challenges facing the multinational firm. Types of questions addressed in the course include: (1) What are the sources of competitive advantage in a global context? (2) What differentiates a global from a domestic industry? (3) How does/should a multinational operate in these different environments? Managing People and Teams MGMT-UB.0007 3 units. Fall and spring. Prerequisite: MGMT-UB.0001. This course combines skill building though experiential exercises and an understanding of the underlying theory to help you learn how to be an effective manager and team member in today&rsquo;s technology-enabled team context. Topics include issues such as managing collaboration in and across teams, motivating effort, performance, social judgment, and cross-cultural issues. Students learn how organizations can improve their effectiveness through better management of people and how individual managers can be more effective in working with and leading others.  Managing Innovation (MCT) MGMT-UB.0008 3 units. Spring. Prerequisite: MGMT-UB.0001 The success of firms, managers and individual contributors depends on their ability to identify innovative products, processes, or both. Research has shown that managing innovation requires a learning mindset attuned to new experiences, entrepreneurial thinking and pragmatic leadership. Some of the specific questions we will consider are: How is design thinking impacting our understanding of strategy and organization design? What roles do the project, middle and senior management play in the innovation process? How do you decide which ideas are worth pursuing? How do firms choose among multiple attractive innovation projects? What are the best ways to protect a firm&rsquo;s intellectual property? Managing in Creative Industries, MGMT-UB.0009 3 units. Spring The purpose of the course is to expose students to the dynamics of cultural industries (e.g., art, theatre, music, film, photography, architecture, and so on), and to train students to think strategically about the nature of cultural products, what drives their supply and demand, the factors that affect the value of cultural products and how firms can profit from them. In order to address these issues, it is important to understand that a key feature of these industries is that symbolic and aesthetic attributes are at the very core of value creation. This implies that the value of cultural products depends largely on third parties, e.g., critics, dealers, foundations, users, etc. Some of these parties act as powerful intermediaries or gatekeepers as they control critical material and symbolic resources firms need in order to (continue to) produce cultural products.  Strategic Analysis (MCT Essential) MGMT-UB.0018 3 units. Spring This course emphasizes the need to look outward to the environment and inward to a firm&rsquo;s resources, capabilities and operating policies. It describes a firm&rsquo;s strategy as the formulation of &ldquo;competitive strategy&rdquo;, &ldquo;corporate strategy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;organizational strategy.&rdquo; Competitive strategy involves identifying structurally attractive industries and developing the most attractive position within that industry - where attractiveness is driven by absolute conditions combined with the resources and capabilities the firm brings to that position. Businesses create value by operating in positions within industries that, by virtue of the characteristics of industry, the position, and the firm, are defensible from the encroachment of competitors and deterioration of the environment as a whole. Corporate strategy focuses on the management and understanding of multi-product, multi-location, and multi-business firms. Organizational strategy involves developing policies within each functional area of the business unit that are integrative and consistent with the firm&rsquo;s plan for creating value. Developing Managerial Skills MGMT-UB.0021 3 units. Fall Prerequisite: MGMT-UB.0001. Increasing self-awareness and openness to feedback are important first steps in leading today&rsquo;s business for tomorrow&rsquo;s results. Many companies bestow a management title on key talent and expect appropriate behavior to follow, but that is not the most effective way to develop future business leaders. In this course you will focus primarily on the practical aspects of managing. While based on solid research, the course stresses a hands-on approach to improving students&rsquo; management skills. Each session focuses on developing (1) personal skills: self-awareness, managing stress, solving problems, and creativity; (2) interpersonal skills: coaching, counseling, supportive communication, gaining power and influence, motivating self and others, and managing conflict; and (3) group skills: empowering, delegating, and building effective teams.  Managing Change (MCT) MGMT-UB.0025 3 units. Spring. Prerequisite: MGMT-UB.0001. Recommended: junior standing. Managing change is a central concern for today&rsquo;s managers. Managing change is also the primary focus of the management consulting industry. To effectively manage change you will need a solid understanding of what change is about, what are its critical aspects, and how one can lead change initiatives in a disciplined and successful way. Case analysis and applied projects are the major vehicles for learning in this course. Note: This course is particularly relevant for students who plan to pursue careers as general managers or management consultants.  Managing Family Businesses &amp; Privately Held Firms MGMT-UB.0028 3 units. Spring Co-requisite: MGMT-UB.0001 In this course you will develop an understanding of how privately held firms and family businesses differ from their for-profit competitors. The course consists of four modules, which address the following questions: (1) How does family control affect strategy and management decisions such as diversification, M&amp;As, or financial policies? (2) How can growth in family businesses be managed and financed? (3) What structures and mechanisms can be put in place to manage family dynamics in a productive way? (4) How can succession be managed to ensure continuity in family business systems? (5) How can family ownership and control be transferred from one generation to another? Students who want to pursue a general management, consulting, or finance career have a high probability of working at or with a family-controlled business. Whatever their future role, students will find it useful to understand the uniqueness of these companies, and why they may or may not want to be involved with them. Negotiation and Consensus-Building (MCT) MGMT-UB.0030 3 units. Fall &amp; Spring. Not applicable towards BS/MS Accounting Program. Effective negotiation and consensus-building skills are essential for success in almost any life domain&mdash;whether your goal is to be an entrepreneur, film producer, business manager, or political leader. In this course, students study how people reach agreement and develop an analytical approach for reaching more effective agreements in organizational settings. The course draws from research in psychology and economics to provide academic content, while making use of role-playing exercises and experiential learning to emphasize key applied lessons. Growth Strategy and Management MGMT-UB.0035 3 units. Prerequisite: MGMT-UB.0001 and sophomore standing. In this course you will learn how to devise and implement strategies that enable businesses to make the leap from entrepreneurial ventures to successful, professionally managed Small and Medium Size Enterprises. The course addresses (1) Why do some entrepreneurial ventures successfully transition to small, medium, and large-scale enterprises while others do not? (2) What are the challenges and opportunities of each growth stage? (3) How do firms successfully make the transition from each growth stage to the next?  Power &amp; Politics MGMT-UB.0066 3 units. Prerequisite: MGMT-UB.0001 Politics is not a dirty word! You just need to learn how to play good politics and keep out bad politics. By the same logic, power by itself does not necessarily corrupt though absolute power may corrupt absolutely. In other words, this course is about how to conquer the world, or at least survive the corporate jungle, without losing your soul. Even if you don&rsquo;t want to play politics, good or bad, you need the skills from this course to ensure that you don&rsquo;t become a victim of politics. By the end of this course you will (1) be able to have not only a conceptual understanding of what power is within an organizational context but a practical grasp of what the actual sources of power are; and (2) will have gained substantial insight into how best to harness your political skills for effective management of your career path.  Patterns of Entrepreneurship MGMT-UB.0085 3 units. Spring. Co-requisites: MGMT-UB.0001 and sophomore standing. This course offers a framework for understanding the entrepreneurial process and exposes students to challenges, problems, and issues faced by entrepreneurs who start new businesses. Case studies are the principal teaching method, supplemented by lectures, business cases, and guest speakers. Students learn to identify and evaluate business opportunities, develop a business concept and assess and obtain the required resources, and manage the growth of new ventures. Independent Study in Management and Organizations MGMT-UB.0094-0099. 1-3 units. Prerequisite: MGMT-UB.0001 and permission of the undergraduate faculty adviser. Independent study provides students of academic quality an opportunity to engage in intensive independent study of management issues or pursue a career-related subject area of managerial significance.
