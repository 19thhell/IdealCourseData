Using the incomparable theatrical resources of New York City as well as the superb intellectual assets of New York University, the Department has created a B.F.A. (Bachelor of Fine Arts) program that aims to establish the artistic and intellectual foundations for a successful and sustained life in the professional theatre and allied disciplines. In partnership with some of the country\u2019s foremost professional theatre training institutions, we offer comprehensive conservatory training in acting, directing, musical performance, production, design and stage management. Equally emphasized is our expansive and innovative theatre studies curriculum, unparalleled in its scope. The curriculum is further enriched by required general education courses in the humanities and sciences. The program is framed by a vast and varied schedule of productions that often involve world-famous guest artists. Our faculty comprises over 270 artists and scholars. These include resident tenured academic professors, resident artistic master teachers, academic adjuncts, and full- and part-time artistic teachers in our affiliated studios. The size and range of our faculty allows us to offer the most culturally, scholarly, and artistically diverse undergraduate theatre training curricula in the country. Our core faculty is enhanced by a constant influx of prominent visiting artists and scholars. The curriculum for a Drama student is represented by four components:  Professional Training There are two phases of professional training in the Department of Drama: a primary training phase and an advanced training phase. The primary training phase occurs in your first two years and provides   students with intensive conservatory training towards a strong   foundation in technique. Upon acceptance into the Department, students   are placed into one of eight different primary training studios where   they learn the skills needed to proceed onto an advanced level of   training. Students remain in their primary training studio for four   consecutive semesters to complete a progressive curriculum. Each   semester builds upon the last. The advanced training phase begins   once primary training is completed. Students may take advantage of a   variety of additional professional training options, which include   advanced training at their own or other primary studios, more   specialized training, study abroad and internships.  Theatre Studies Theatre Studies are taught in the Department of Drama by a faculty rich with internationally recognized scholars. Courses focus on the theoretical and historical aspects of the work students are engaged in at their studios. The curriculum covers areas such as theatre history, dramatic literature, dramatic theory and criticism, and world drama. We have a series of courses in Applied Theatre, which takes theatre out of its traditional context and applies it to areas like education, therapy, community-based initiatives, political activism, and theater in prisons.  General Education General Education (or Liberal Arts) courses take our students out into the College of Arts and Science at NYU. The freedom in our General Education requirements allows students to pursue other academic interests through a double-major or minor in another subject or by following a course of study based on their own scholarly passions. In most cases, if pursued at the College of Arts and Science, a student will be able to complete a double-major or minor without requiring extra time at NYU.  Electives Electives can be fulfilled by additional courses in professional training or academic curriculum or with artistic electives offered by the department, such as: stage combat, private voice lessons, dance classes and audition technique (where industry professionals are brought in to work with students). These are but a sampling of the numerous artistic electives found in the Department of Drama. Want to know more? Click here to Visit Us!

The school quickly established itself as one of the leading arts schools in the country, creating additional departments of dance, theater design and lighting, and cinema studies within a few short years. The undergraduate Department of Drama was founded in 1974. The establishment of the Interactive Telecommunications Program (1979), the Department of Dramatic Writing (1980), the Department of Performance Studies (1980), the Graduate Musical Theatre Writing Program (1981) and the Department of Photography and Imaging (1982) rounded out an extraordinary period of growth in terms of enrollments and breadth of programs of study. In 1982, a gift from Laurence A. and Preston Robert Tisch made possible the acquisition and renovation of 721 Broadway, where most of the school\u2019s programs are currently housed. In recognition of the Tisches\u2019 generosity, the school was renamed the Tisch School of the Arts. Dance and Graduate Musical Theatre Writing remain at the school\u2019s original site at 111 Second Avenue. In 1999, Tisch School of the Arts established the Department of Art and Public Policy followed by the founding of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music in 2003.    In 2007, Tisch School of the Arts Asia was established in Singapore, NYU's first degree granting campus outside New York City. A Master of Fine Arts degree in Film was the first to be offered. Additional programs were added: Dramatic Writing, Animation and Digital Arts (2008) and International Media Producing (2010). In 2012, the NYU Game Center was created. Today, Tisch School of the Arts educates the next generation of storytellers in multiple locations in Greenwich Village, including 721 Broadway, 111 Second Avenue, 194 Mercer Street, 665 Broadway, various acting conservatories spread through downtown, 2 Metrotech Center in Brooklyn, and in Singapore. The Tisch education also extends throughout the NYU Global Network with coursework available in Abu Dhabi, Shanghai, London, and Prague to name a few.

The Program in Dramatic Literature, Theater History, and Cinema recognizes the special nature of Drama, in particular its relationship to literary texts as well as to the performing arts, both theater and cinema. Accordingly, the program allows students with a primary interest in Drama to study it intensively and comparatively within the fields of literature, theater history and production, and cinema. The curriculum brings students into a close intellectual engagement with the classical and contemporary texts of Britain, Europe, and America, while also providing opportunities for practical dramatic and theatrical experiences. The program encourages students not only to pursue their interests through production and playwriting classes but also to take advantage of New York's thriving theater scene."}]}]
