Running February 20\u2013May 12, 2014, Visions+Voices: China includes:   \u2022 Tao Dance Theater\u2019s 4 and the U.S. Premiere of 5 (February 20\u201322); the works continue  choreographer Tao Ye\u2019s journey of pushing the boundaries of corporeal expression.  \u2022 The all-female ensemble Hangzhou Yue Opera Company transform two classic Ibsen plays into lyrical adventures with Hedda (February 25) and The Lady from the Sea (February 26).  \u2022 From March 26-30, the National Theatre of China, one of the new faces of 21st century Chinese theater, will debut a production of Richard III.  \u2022 On April 12, \u201cThe Piano in a Factory,\u201d a film by Zhang Meng, will be screened.  \u2022 The series will close on May 12 with Tan Dun\u2019s The Map performed by the NYU Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Andrew Cyr and featuring cellist Wendy Sutter.  \u2022 The series will open with an outdoor vitrine art exhibit featuring the works by Zhang Jianjun and Zhang Huan (presented in partnership with The Metropolitan Museum of Art) and Wu Jian\u2019an (presented in partnership with Chambers Gallery).   The Visions+Voices Global Performance Series is an annual performing arts series held at the  NYU Skirball Center that creates a unique opportunity to celebrate and closely examine a singular world culture through a wide-ranging artistic lens. This year\u2019s focus is China and highlights several artists who build upon cultural tradition while embracing modern perspectives. NYU Skirball believes that rich international programming not only excites New York audiences and the NYU community, but also serves as a catalyst for international dialogue and education. Celebrating the richness of NYU\u2019s global network of campuses, future seasons include partnerships with Germany, Israel, Abu Dhabi and London.   Michael Harrington, the center\u2019s Executive Director, said, \u201cEach year Visions+Voices gives us the opportunity to explore and highlight the culture and creativity from a featured locale within NYU's Global Network. This year\u2019s Chinese artists and performers will showcase numerous works never before seen in America and we are thrilled to present them here in New York and offer opportunities for cultural discovery and understanding.\u201d   2013-14 marks the tenth season for NYU Skirball Center for the Performing Arts. In its first decade, NYU Skirball has made substantial contributions not only to the community surrounding the country\u2019s largest private university, but also to a broader cultural landscape. In recent years, Michael Harrington has used the 860-seat venue to provide a platform for artists from around the world to practice their craft on a larger scale from the facility\u2019s Greenwich Village neighborhood.   In addition to multiple-night and week runs (\u201cCirkopolis,\u201d \u201cOthello,\u201d \u201cWaiting For Godot\u201d), NYU Skirball Center hosts a range of singular events, such as a dialogue between David Byrne &amp; Ahmir &quot;?uestlove&quot; Thompson, and Stephen Sondheim &amp; Tony Kushner, comedians such as Zach Galifianakis and Aziz Ansari, and musicians such as Esperanza Spalding and The Derek Trucks Band.   Tickets for Visions + Voices and the complete NYU Skirball Center for the Performing Arts season may be purchased online at www.nyuskirball.org, by phone at 212.352.3101 or 866.811.4111, or in person at the NYU Skirball Center Box Office: Tuesday-Saturday, 12-6 p.m. The NYU Skirball Center for the Performing Arts is located at 566 LaGuardia Place at Washington Square, New York, New York 10012.

Complete listings for the Visions+Voices: China are as follows:   Tao Dance Theater  [Dance]  4 and 5 (U.S. Premiere)  February 20\u201322 at 8pm  $35-$59  75 Minutes   \u201cTao Ye is emerging rapidly as a force to be reckoned with, as well as the most exciting name in  modern dance.\u201d \u2013 Time Out Beijing  One of China\u2019s premiere contemporary dance companies boldly stretches the boundaries of the human physical form.   After a sold out run at the Lincoln Center Festival in 2012, TAO Dance Theater returns with 4, a continuation of choreographer Tao Ye\u2019s exploration of the potential of the human body as a visual element, devoid of story-telling or representation. Four dancers seem to be propelled by a magnetic wave that pulls them apart, and then seems to push them together again, without ever touching.   In the U.S. Premiere of 5, which received standing ovations in Amsterdam at its world premiere, the dancers engage in physical contact, in fact, they move in an indistinguishable kaleidoscopic mass of limbs and light, never dispersing even for a moment.     Hangzhou Yue Opera Company  [Opera]   Hedda (U.S. Premiere)  February 25 at 8 p.m.  $28-$38  100 minutes   The Lady from the Sea (U.S. Premiere)  February 26 at 8 p.m.  $28-$38  90 minutes   An all female ensemble transforms two Ibsen classics into lyrical and musical adventures, with superbly stylized theatricality in one of the most popular Chinese opera genres.   Performed throughout China and Europe, Hangzhou Yue Opera Company\u2019s contemporary opera adaptations have been well-received across the globe. Hedda (based on Hedda Gabler) focuses on a highly intelligent woman, recently wed for practicality rather than love, whose jealousy leads her down a path to tragedy. The Lady from the Sea also examines a woman in a strained marriage, asked for the first time to truly examine her own desires. The pieces have been adapted to be set in China and their costumes, makeup, symbols and staging reflect a distinctive Chinese sensibility.   Yue Opera, performed by all female actors, is one of the most popular traditional operas in China.  Beginning as a form of storytelling and ballad singing, it has evolved into a theatrical genre with the addition of dramatic structure and an orchestra. Yue Opera is particularly strong in its lyrical touch, with singing and gesturing as its main acting modes. Its arias follow certain patterns, which are delicate and beautiful, reflecting the special aura of southern China.     National Theatre of China (U.S. Company Debut)  [Theater]  Richard III (U.S. Premiere)  March 26\u201330 at 8pm  $39-$65  100 minutes   \u201cIt scores for its intense confrontations and for a fascinating, mercurial villainy that needs no translation.\u201d \u2013 The Arts Desk (UK)   Shakespeare\u2019s tale of ruthless ambition is reinvigorated through a highly dramatized Chinese adaptation where traditional props, wigs, masks, costumes and musical instruments come together to create a horrific world where madness aches for power. Richard III marks National Theatre of China\u2019s first visit to the United States.   This production of Shakespeare's wicked horror-show of power and paranoia, was an audience favorite and critical hit during London\u2019s Globe to Globe Shakespeare festival and Cultural Olympiad in 2012. Performed in Putonghua, or Mandarin, with English supertitles, the plays fundamental themes of desire, power, ambition and jealousy, are potent reminders of humanity\u2019s ongoing struggles. National Theatre of China stages work in three different performance spaces in Beijing and works with the finest playwrights and directors in China. Their trailblazing productions reveal the new face of 21st century Chinese theatre.     THE PIANO IN A FACTORY  (Film)  By Zhang Meng  Presented in partnership with Reel China @ NYU  $15  April 12 at 7pm  105 minutes   \u201cFirst rate cinematography, set design and editing are in perfect sync with the director's comic intent.\u201d - The Hollywood Reporter   Set among the \u201clost generation\u201d of workers in the heavy industrial area in northeastern China who were hit by the policies of reform and economic openness in the 1990s, we see them rekindle their skills and rediscover the joy of working. When Chen\u2019s estranged wife (QIN HAI-LU) reappears asking for a divorce and custody of their daughter, the young musician decides she will live with whoever can provide her a piano. When efforts to borrow money and even steal a piano fail, Chen (WANG QIAN-YUAN) concocts a preposterous plan \u2013 to make a piano from scratch! He persuades a bunch of reluctant but loyal misfit friends to help him forge the instrument in a derelict factory from a heap of scrap steel.     NYU Symphony Orchestra  [Music]  The Map  Composed by Tan Dun  Video designed by Tan Dun  May 12 at 7 p.m.  $15-$35  90 minutes   \u201cTan Dun first attracted attention with skillfully wrought concert works in which ancient Chinese folkloric instruments and techniques mingled in potent collusion with a Western avant-garde vocabulary.\u201d \u2013 New York Times   The NYU Symphony Orchestra will perform Tan Dun\u2019s masterpiece, The Map in a one-night only concert performance. The renowned Chinese composer created the work as a response to his 1999 tour of the eastern part of Hunan Province. The Map was premiered by Yo-Yo Ma and the Boston Symphony Orchestra and has toured more than 30 countries worldwide. Its manuscript has been included in the Carnegie Hall Composers Gallery. The field video recordings used in The Map capture passionate antiphonal singing, intriguing tongue singing, emphatic percussive dance and other images of ethnic musical life. The interaction of audio-video and live music connected generations and cultures across years and over continents.   A winner of today's most prestigious honors including the Grammy Award (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Tan Dun's music has been played throughout the world by leading orchestras, opera houses, international festivals, and on the radio and television. The one-night only concert performance includes special guests, Grammy-nominated conductor Andrew Cyr and soloist Wendy Sutter heralded as \u201cone of the great leading cellist of the classical stage\u201d by the Wall Street Journal. The evening will also feature Tan Dun\u2019s &quot;Concerto for String Orchestra and Pipa&quot; featuring pipa virtuoso Zhou Yi. Performed by the NYU Symphony Orchestra.   Art Exhibit  Beginning January 20, displayed in numerous large window vitrines found along LaGuardia Place and West 3rd Street, passersby will be able to view the work of contemporary artists Zhang Jianjun and Zhang Huan and Wu Jian\u2019an. These works by Zhang Jianjun and Zhang Huan are currently on view at The Metropolitan Museum of Art through April 6, 2014, as part of the exhibition Ink Art: Past as Present in Contemporary China. The work by Wu Jian\u2019an is presented in partnership with Chambers Gallery.

In the U.S. Premiere of 5, which received standing ovations in Amsterdam at its world premiere, the dancers engage in physical contact, in fact, they move in an indistinguishable kaleidoscopic mass of limbs and light, never dispersing even for a moment.     Hangzhou Yue Opera Company  [Opera]   Hedda (U.S. Premiere)  February 25 at 8 p.m.  $28-$38  100 minutes   The Lady from the Sea (U.S. Premiere)  February 26 at 8 p.m.  $28-$38  90 minutes   An all female ensemble transforms two Ibsen classics into lyrical and musical adventures, with superbly stylized theatricality in one of the most popular Chinese opera genres.   Performed throughout China and Europe, Hangzhou Yue Opera Company\u2019s contemporary opera adaptations have been well-received across the globe. Hedda (based on Hedda Gabler) focuses on a highly intelligent woman, recently wed for practicality rather than love, whose jealousy leads her down a path to tragedy. The Lady from the Sea also examines a woman in a strained marriage, asked for the first time to truly examine her own desires. The pieces have been adapted to be set in China and their costumes, makeup, symbols and staging reflect a distinctive Chinese sensibility.   Yue Opera, performed by all female actors, is one of the most popular traditional operas in China.  Beginning as a form of storytelling and ballad singing, it has evolved into a theatrical genre with the addition of dramatic structure and an orchestra. Yue Opera is particularly strong in its lyrical touch, with singing and gesturing as its main acting modes. Its arias follow certain patterns, which are delicate and beautiful, reflecting the special aura of southern China.     National Theatre of China (U.S. Company Debut)  [Theater]  Richard III (U.S. Premiere)  March 26\u201330 at 8pm  $39-$65  100 minutes   \u201cIt scores for its intense confrontations and for a fascinating, mercurial villainy that needs no translation.\u201d \u2013 The Arts Desk (UK)   Shakespeare\u2019s tale of ruthless ambition is reinvigorated through a highly dramatized Chinese adaptation where traditional props, wigs, masks, costumes and musical instruments come together to create a horrific world where madness aches for power. Richard III marks National Theatre of China\u2019s first visit to the United States.   This production of Shakespeare's wicked horror-show of power and paranoia, was an audience favorite and critical hit during London\u2019s Globe to Globe Shakespeare festival and Cultural Olympiad in 2012. Performed in Putonghua, or Mandarin, with English supertitles, the plays fundamental themes of desire, power, ambition and jealousy, are potent reminders of humanity\u2019s ongoing struggles. National Theatre of China stages work in three different performance spaces in Beijing and works with the finest playwrights and directors in China. Their trailblazing productions reveal the new face of 21st century Chinese theatre.     THE PIANO IN A FACTORY  (Film)  By Zhang Meng  Presented in partnership with Reel China @ NYU  $15  April 12 at 7pm  105 minutes   \u201cFirst rate cinematography, set design and editing are in perfect sync with the director's comic intent.\u201d - The Hollywood Reporter   Set among the \u201clost generation\u201d of workers in the heavy industrial area in northeastern China who were hit by the policies of reform and economic openness in the 1990s, we see them rekindle their skills and rediscover the joy of working. When Chen\u2019s estranged wife (QIN HAI-LU) reappears asking for a divorce and custody of their daughter, the young musician decides she will live with whoever can provide her a piano. When efforts to borrow money and even steal a piano fail, Chen (WANG QIAN-YUAN) concocts a preposterous plan \u2013 to make a piano from scratch! He persuades a bunch of reluctant but loyal misfit friends to help him forge the instrument in a derelict factory from a heap of scrap steel.     NYU Symphony Orchestra  [Music]  The Map  Composed by Tan Dun  Video designed by Tan Dun  May 12 at 7 p.m.  $15-$35  90 minutes   \u201cTan Dun first attracted attention with skillfully wrought concert works in which ancient Chinese folkloric instruments and techniques mingled in potent collusion with a Western avant-garde vocabulary.\u201d \u2013 New York Times   The NYU Symphony Orchestra will perform Tan Dun\u2019s masterpiece, The Map in a one-night only concert performance. The renowned Chinese composer created the work as a response to his 1999 tour of the eastern part of Hunan Province. The Map was premiered by Yo-Yo Ma and the Boston Symphony Orchestra and has toured more than 30 countries worldwide. Its manuscript has been included in the Carnegie Hall Composers Gallery. The field video recordings used in The Map capture passionate antiphonal singing, intriguing tongue singing, emphatic percussive dance and other images of ethnic musical life. The interaction of audio-video and live music connected generations and cultures across years and over continents.   A winner of today's most prestigious honors including the Grammy Award (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Tan Dun's music has been played throughout the world by leading orchestras, opera houses, international festivals, and on the radio and television. The one-night only concert performance includes special guests, Grammy-nominated conductor Andrew Cyr and soloist Wendy Sutter heralded as \u201cone of the great leading cellist of the classical stage\u201d by the Wall Street Journal. The evening will also feature Tan Dun\u2019s &quot;Concerto for String Orchestra and Pipa&quot; featuring pipa virtuoso Zhou Yi. Performed by the NYU Symphony Orchestra.   Art Exhibit  Beginning January 20, displayed in numerous large window vitrines found along LaGuardia Place and West 3rd Street, passersby will be able to view the work of contemporary artists Zhang Jianjun and Zhang Huan and Wu Jian\u2019an.

Running February 20\u2013May 12, 2014, Visions+Voices: China includes:   \u2022 Tao Dance Theater\u2019s 4 and the U.S. Premiere of 5 (February 20\u201322); the works continue  choreographer Tao Ye\u2019s journey of pushing the boundaries of corporeal expression.  \u2022 The all-female ensemble Hangzhou Yue Opera Company transform two classic Ibsen plays into lyrical adventures with Hedda (February 25) and The Lady from the Sea (February 26).  \u2022 From March 26-30, the National Theatre of China, one of the new faces of 21st century Chinese theater, will debut a production of Richard III.  \u2022 On April 12, \u201cThe Piano in a Factory,\u201d a film by Zhang Meng, will be screened.  \u2022 The series will close on May 12 with Tan Dun\u2019s The Map performed by the NYU Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Andrew Cyr and featuring cellist Wendy Sutter.  \u2022 The series will open with an outdoor vitrine art exhibit featuring the works by Zhang Jianjun and Zhang Huan (presented in partnership with The Metropolitan Museum of Art) and Wu Jian\u2019an (presented in partnership with Chambers Gallery).   The Visions+Voices Global Performance Series is an annual performing arts series held at the  NYU Skirball Center that creates a unique opportunity to celebrate and closely examine a singular world culture through a wide-ranging artistic lens. This year\u2019s focus is China and highlights several artists who build upon cultural tradition while embracing modern perspectives. NYU Skirball believes that rich international programming not only excites New York audiences and the NYU community, but also serves as a catalyst for international dialogue and education. Celebrating the richness of NYU\u2019s global network of campuses, future seasons include partnerships with Germany, Israel, Abu Dhabi and London.   Michael Harrington, the center\u2019s Executive Director, said, \u201cEach year Visions+Voices gives us the opportunity to explore and highlight the culture and creativity from a featured locale within NYU's Global Network. This year\u2019s Chinese artists and performers will showcase numerous works never before seen in America and we are thrilled to present them here in New York and offer opportunities for cultural discovery and understanding.\u201d   2013-14 marks the tenth season for NYU Skirball Center for the Performing Arts. In its first decade, NYU Skirball has made substantial contributions not only to the community surrounding the country\u2019s largest private university, but also to a broader cultural landscape. In recent years, Michael Harrington has used the 860-seat venue to provide a platform for artists from around the world to practice their craft on a larger scale from the facility\u2019s Greenwich Village neighborhood.   In addition to multiple-night and week runs (\u201cCirkopolis,\u201d \u201cOthello,\u201d \u201cWaiting For Godot\u201d), NYU Skirball Center hosts a range of singular events, such as a dialogue between David Byrne &amp; Ahmir &quot;?uestlove&quot; Thompson, and Stephen Sondheim &amp; Tony Kushner, comedians such as Zach Galifianakis and Aziz Ansari, and musicians such as Esperanza Spalding and The Derek Trucks Band.

Complete listings for the Visions+Voices: China are as follows:   Tao Dance Theater  [Dance]  4 and 5 (U.S. Premiere)  February 20\u201322 at 8pm  $35-$59  75 Minutes   \u201cTao Ye is emerging rapidly as a force to be reckoned with, as well as the most exciting name in  modern dance.\u201d \u2013 Time Out Beijing  One of China\u2019s premiere contemporary dance companies boldly stretches the boundaries of the human physical form.   After a sold out run at the Lincoln Center Festival in 2012, TAO Dance Theater returns with 4, a continuation of choreographer Tao Ye\u2019s exploration of the potential of the human body as a visual element, devoid of story-telling or representation. Four dancers seem to be propelled by a magnetic wave that pulls them apart, and then seems to push them together again, without ever touching.   In the U.S. Premiere of 5, which received standing ovations in Amsterdam at its world premiere, the dancers engage in physical contact, in fact, they move in an indistinguishable kaleidoscopic mass of limbs and light, never dispersing even for a moment.     Hangzhou Yue Opera Company  [Opera]   Hedda (U.S. Premiere)  February 25 at 8 p.m.  $28-$38  100 minutes   The Lady from the Sea (U.S. Premiere)  February 26 at 8 p.m.  $28-$38  90 minutes   An all female ensemble transforms two Ibsen classics into lyrical and musical adventures, with superbly stylized theatricality in one of the most popular Chinese opera genres.   Performed throughout China and Europe, Hangzhou Yue Opera Company\u2019s contemporary opera adaptations have been well-received across the globe. Hedda (based on Hedda Gabler) focuses on a highly intelligent woman, recently wed for practicality rather than love, whose jealousy leads her down a path to tragedy. The Lady from the Sea also examines a woman in a strained marriage, asked for the first time to truly examine her own desires. The pieces have been adapted to be set in China and their costumes, makeup, symbols and staging reflect a distinctive Chinese sensibility.   Yue Opera, performed by all female actors, is one of the most popular traditional operas in China.  Beginning as a form of storytelling and ballad singing, it has evolved into a theatrical genre with the addition of dramatic structure and an orchestra. Yue Opera is particularly strong in its lyrical touch, with singing and gesturing as its main acting modes. Its arias follow certain patterns, which are delicate and beautiful, reflecting the special aura of southern China.     National Theatre of China (U.S. Company Debut)  [Theater]  Richard III (U.S. Premiere)  March 26\u201330 at 8pm  $39-$65  100 minutes   \u201cIt scores for its intense confrontations and for a fascinating, mercurial villainy that needs no translation.\u201d \u2013 The Arts Desk (UK)   Shakespeare\u2019s tale of ruthless ambition is reinvigorated through a highly dramatized Chinese adaptation where traditional props, wigs, masks, costumes and musical instruments come together to create a horrific world where madness aches for power. Richard III marks National Theatre of China\u2019s first visit to the United States.   This production of Shakespeare's wicked horror-show of power and paranoia, was an audience favorite and critical hit during London\u2019s Globe to Globe Shakespeare festival and Cultural Olympiad in 2012. Performed in Putonghua, or Mandarin, with English supertitles, the plays fundamental themes of desire, power, ambition and jealousy, are potent reminders of humanity\u2019s ongoing struggles. National Theatre of China stages work in three different performance spaces in Beijing and works with the finest playwrights and directors in China. Their trailblazing productions reveal the new face of 21st century Chinese theatre.     THE PIANO IN A FACTORY  (Film)  By Zhang Meng  Presented in partnership with Reel China @ NYU  $15  April 12 at 7pm  105 minutes   \u201cFirst rate cinematography, set design and editing are in perfect sync with the director's comic intent.\u201d - The Hollywood Reporter   Set among the \u201clost generation\u201d of workers in the heavy industrial area in northeastern China who were hit by the policies of reform and economic openness in the 1990s, we see them rekindle their skills and rediscover the joy of working. When Chen\u2019s estranged wife (QIN HAI-LU) reappears asking for a divorce and custody of their daughter, the young musician decides she will live with whoever can provide her a piano. When efforts to borrow money and even steal a piano fail, Chen (WANG QIAN-YUAN) concocts a preposterous plan \u2013 to make a piano from scratch! He persuades a bunch of reluctant but loyal misfit friends to help him forge the instrument in a derelict factory from a heap of scrap steel.     NYU Symphony Orchestra  [Music]  The Map  Composed by Tan Dun  Video designed by Tan Dun  May 12 at 7 p.m.  $15-$35  90 minutes   \u201cTan Dun first attracted attention with skillfully wrought concert works in which ancient Chinese folkloric instruments and techniques mingled in potent collusion with a Western avant-garde vocabulary.\u201d \u2013 New York Times   The NYU Symphony Orchestra will perform Tan Dun\u2019s masterpiece, The Map in a one-night only concert performance. The renowned Chinese composer created the work as a response to his 1999 tour of the eastern part of Hunan Province. The Map was premiered by Yo-Yo Ma and the Boston Symphony Orchestra and has toured more than 30 countries worldwide. Its manuscript has been included in the Carnegie Hall Composers Gallery. The field video recordings used in The Map capture passionate antiphonal singing, intriguing tongue singing, emphatic percussive dance and other images of ethnic musical life. The interaction of audio-video and live music connected generations and cultures across years and over continents.   A winner of today's most prestigious honors including the Grammy Award (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Tan Dun's music has been played throughout the world by leading orchestras, opera houses, international festivals, and on the radio and television. The one-night only concert performance includes special guests, Grammy-nominated conductor Andrew Cyr and soloist Wendy Sutter heralded as \u201cone of the great leading cellist of the classical stage\u201d by the Wall Street Journal. The evening will also feature Tan Dun\u2019s &quot;Concerto for String Orchestra and Pipa&quot; featuring pipa virtuoso Zhou Yi. Performed by the NYU Symphony Orchestra.   Art Exhibit  Beginning January 20, displayed in numerous large window vitrines found along LaGuardia Place and West 3rd Street, passersby will be able to view the work of contemporary artists Zhang Jianjun and Zhang Huan and Wu Jian\u2019an. These works by Zhang Jianjun and Zhang Huan are currently on view at The Metropolitan Museum of Art through April 6, 2014, as part of the exhibition Ink Art: Past as Present in Contemporary China. The work by Wu Jian\u2019an is presented in partnership with Chambers Gallery.

Associate Professor of Theater Rub\u00e9n Polendo was on the path to a career in science when he was asked to advise on a theater piece. This simple introduction to the stage quite literally changed his life. &quot;What I witnessed in that room changed everything,&quot; he said. &quot;My life up to then had been surrounded by protocol, hypothesis, and theory \u2014 and before my eyes there was creation, pure and simple creation.&quot;                      Since that pivotal moment, Polendo has traveled the globe, making explorations into a variety of world theater traditions in an effort to create a &quot;Whole Theater experience,&quot; a theatrical journey that is at once &quot;rigorously visual, aural, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual,&quot; he explained. In fact, this exploratory methodology forms the core of Theater Mitu, Polendo's New York- and Abu Dhabi-based theater company \u2014 in essence, his lab \u2014 which, since its founding in 1997, has merged global performance traditions into innovative productions worldwide.   Polendo's first research trip to India resulted from his involvement with a South Indian Kathakali company that was in residence at Lancaster University in the UK, where he switched from a master's in biochemistry to non-Western theater. Since then, Polendo has studied performance traditions and the philosophies behind them in countries including Japan, Thailand, India, Ethiopia, and Iran. Through the investigation of theatrical forms from Kabuki and Muay Thai to Kalaripayattu and Ta'zieh, he seeks to answer the question that was the genesis of his research: How does one train for the Whole Theater experience?   For Polendo, the answer to this question is in the examination of how performers train their focus, emotions, spirit, and physicality. By studying and learning these elements, he \u2014 and the members of Theater Mitu \u2014 explore in depth a wide range of theatrical forms and codify them into a training methodology that shapes each work the company produces.   Recently, this methodology informed Polendo's adaptation of The Ramayana , an ancient Sanskrit epic and one of Eastern literature's central myths, during which he directed NYUAD students in the University's first student-run theater production. &quot;The type of theater I'm interested in is large, physical, visual, and hyper-theatrical,&quot; Polendo said. &quot;The language and emotionality are scaled to the visual landscape and supported by the Whole Theater training. In turn, the best structure on which to build this is the epic.&quot;   For the production (Polendo's third play at the University), approximately 50 members of the Classes of 2014 and 2015 participated in The Ramayana as actors, assistant designers, producers, managers, crew, documentarians, and dramaturges. Collaborating with designers and musicians from Theater Mitu, the students staged eight performances, incorporating Turkish-inspired shadow puppetry; Balinese masks, ritualized movement, and percussion; and Afro-Indian drumming. As Polendo said, &quot;Producing the work themselves makes the art a very personal experience for the students.&quot;                                                                               My field is the study of the human experience as it spans from the personal and emotional to the cultural and communal.         Rub\u00e9n Polendo, NYUAD associate professor of Theater.                         It is with this in mind that Polendo emphasizes the foundations of Whole Theater in his courses. Giving his students the opportunity to get out of the classroom and experience firsthand some of the global performance traditions covered in class, he leads local and regional trips, during which the students perform immersive and physically rigorous explorations into understanding different theatrical forms. It is Polendo's hope that this intensive field research will give his students &quot;the ability to go from instinct to creation in any field, and to master the discipline to follow through and to further articulate their process.&quot;   As such, on regional field research trips to India, students investigated Nepali, Newari, and Malayalam performance traditions with a focus on South Indian traditional dance and martial arts including Kalaripayattu, Kathakali, Theyyam, Mohiniattam, and Kalari-Yoga, and Nawari performance rituals such as Charya Nritya and Kumari. Closer to home, during trips within the UAE, they learned the tradition of Arabic clowning; the predominantly Yemeni, Omani, and Pakistani Pehlwani fighting form; and the Emirati tribal dance-ritual form of Ayyalah.   Polendo's current research focuses on these and many other world theater traditions. Through ongoing artistic field research, he examines their foundation work, preparation, theories, and philosophical values to further articulate his Whole Theater methodology, which is constantly re-envisioned and re-invented. &quot;In many cases, these are further explorations into landscapes that have been incredibly fruitful,&quot; Polendo said.   Projects include the practical study of South Indian performance traditions \u2014 including Kalaripayattu, Kalaric-Ayurvedic healing traditions, Mohiniattam, and Kathakali \u2014 many of which are &quot;lynchpins&quot; in Whole Theater training and which Polendo has studied for more than a decade; the Japanese forms of Noh and Kabuki theaters, Bunraku puppet theater, and Butoh, whose theories, trainings, and ideas Polendo began studying 15 years ago and which are also key to the Whole Theater experience; Nepali and Newari performance rituals such as Charya Nritya, Lakhe, Kirtich Nach, and Harasiddhi; and Yemeni forms including Jambiya, Manakhah, and Harazi. Comprised of performative martial arts, dance rituals, street clowning theater, and narrative mask dances, among other forms, Polendo's research seeks to extrapolate the values of these global, and oftentimes ancient, performance traditions and fuel the exploration of their application into both original and existing theater works, thus challenging modern conceptions of what theater is and what it can be.   Polendo also continues to focus on the traditional performance and ritual forms of the UAE. In what is an ongoing research project, he is studying the Emirati cane dance of Ayyalah, the Emirati performance of Ma'alayah, ritualized bull fighting outside the Emirate of Fujairah, and the Arab/ Pakistani ritualized fighting art form of Pehlwani, while continuing to investigate the theatrical ecosystem of Abu Dhabi in order to produce highly original contemporary local theater productions.   Additional project-specific research will take place outside the UAE, in Juarez, Mexico, for Polendo's original piece entitled Juarez: A Documentary Mythology . Initial research focused on the documenting and amassing of interviews in Juarez (where Polendo was raised) and the surrounding areas to explore the emotional and personal effects created from living in the northern Mexican city known as the &quot;murder capital of the world.&quot; A meditation on violence and identity, the piece navigates between present-day political strife and the mythological retelling of family memories, &quot;ultimately interfacing potent interviews and firsthand experiences of life in Juarez with 1940s Mexican cinema \u2014 one filled with horror and death, the other with love, romance, and tradition \u2014 to uncover the strength of family, national pride, identity, and memory,&quot; Polendo explained.   With the goals of building a vibrant, global theater program for NYUAD, and sharing the arts with communities whose exposures to theater border on non-existent, Polendo hopes to create a dynamic production life for both the University and Theater Mitu in Abu Dhabi. As he said, &quot;My field is the study of the human experience as it spans from the personal and emotional to the cultural and communal. It interfaces politically and socially. It is both classical and contemporary and expands through time. It is a collaborative art form and depends on the union of heart, head, soul, and senses to vibrate at its highest intensity. It lives between lines and explores between lines. Theater has historically been a key tool in the defining and articulation of a city, and as a liberal arts university, NYUAD has a commitment to engaging the community of Abu Dhabi. I think theater is key to this conversation.&quot;   This article originally appeared in NYUAD's 2012 Research Report (12MB PDF).
