This focus provides a concrete means for deepening our understanding of alternative models of social explanation. Drawing on ethnographic material from a wide range of cultures, as well as feature films and our own observations and interviews, we consider topics such as the material dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption (e.g., how food scarcity or abundance shapes collective possibilities, expectations, and values; the causes, consequences, forms, and myths of globalization) and the cultural meanings and social distinctions encoded in food practices (e.g., how food is used cross-culturally as a marker of social identity\u2014class, gender, and ethnicity\u2014and as a source of meaning\u2014nostalgia, anxiety, and so on). Formations of Indigeneity ANTH-UA 605 Formerly ANTH-UA 320. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Through a case study of materials concerning indigenous people in Australia and North America, this course will investigate the consequences (cultural, sociological, policy) of a development that has taken place throughout the world. Many of the peoples in whom anthropologists have long been interested\u2013those organized into small-scale societies, kinship based\u2013have been encapsulated as indigenous minorities within nation states dominated by other cultural traditions. In this context, the capacity and practices of these peoples, who some have characterized as \u201cFourth World peoples,\u201d to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically reinforced.

Gender, Violence, and the Law    ANTH-UA 330 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points.   Examines the global prevalence of gender violence and the varied meanings of violence against women and changes in terminology over time. Examines ways of theorizing gender and violence, including performative ideas of gender. The creation of gender violence as a social problem is a product of social movements in the United States, Europe, India, and many other parts of the world. It is now understood globally as an important human rights violation. Also examines the forms of intervention that have been developed in the United States and globally for diminishing violence against women, including policing, prosecution, and punishment.    Human Rights and Culture    ANTH-UA 331 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points.   Offers an overview of the human rights system, looking at its basic elements and studying how it works. Focuses on the relationships between human rights and culture. Human rights campaigns frequently encounter resistance in the name of protecting cultural differences. This is particularly common with issues concerning women, children, and the family. Explores several issues that raise questions of human rights and culture, such as female genital cutting, honor killing, trafficking of persons, and indigenous peoples' rights to culture. Using these examples, considers how the human rights system deals with tensions between global standards and local ways of life. Examines the meanings of rights and of culture in these debates and shows the implications of adopting an anthropological analysis of these situations. The goal of the course is developing an understanding of human rights in practice.    Body, Gender, and Belief in China    ANTH-UA 350 Identical to RELST-UA 350.

Discusses changing roles of nation-states and the growing significance of transnational, diasporic, and globalized social relations and cultural forms.    Culture Through Food    ANTH-UA 410 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, Rogers. 4 points.   Explores some of the ways that people use food, cuisines, and eating to organize and engage with social worlds. This focus provides a concrete means for deepening our understanding of alternative models of social explanation. Drawing on ethnographic material from a wide range of cultures, as well as feature films and our own observations and interviews, we consider topics such as the material dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption (e.g., how food scarcity or abundance shapes collective possibilities, expectations, and values; the causes, consequences, forms, and myths of globalization) and the cultural meanings and social distinctions encoded in food practices (e.g., how food is used cross-culturally as a marker of social identity\u2014class, gender, and ethnicity\u2014and as a source of meaning\u2014nostalgia, anxiety, and so on). Formations of Indigeneity ANTH-UA 605 Formerly ANTH-UA 320. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Through a case study of materials concerning indigenous people in Australia and North America, this course will investigate the consequences (cultural, sociological, policy) of a development that has taken place throughout the world. Many of the peoples in whom anthropologists have long been interested\u2013those organized into small-scale societies, kinship based\u2013have been encapsulated as indigenous minorities within nation states dominated by other cultural traditions. In this context, the capacity and practices of these peoples, who some have characterized as \u201cFourth World peoples,\u201d to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically reinforced.      Roma in East Central Europe   ANTH-UA 9200 Offered at NYU Prague. 4 points.   Introduces students to the development of Romany politics and culture from a persecuted minority to the emergence of Romany organizations, with an emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe.

Barbarian Europe    ANTH-UA 217 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or permission of the instructor. Crabtree. 4 points.   Between the end of the Ice Age and the expansion of the Roman Empire, temperate Europe witnessed a series of social and economic transformations that represented a transition from a hunting and gathering way of life to urban chiefdoms. Along the way, these hunter-gatherers became agriculturalists and stockherders, learned to use metals, and developed social structures as complex as any found in Old World civilizations. Examines changes in later prehistoric Europe from about 8000 B.C.E. to the arrival of the Romans.    African Archaeology    ANTH-UA 218 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3). Tryon. 4 points.   With the longest record of human occupation in the world and a landmass that represents more than one-fifth the habitable area of the globe, Africa plays a central role in our understanding of human evolution, the prehistory of our species, and the development of complex societies. Explores the experiences of ancient human populations in Africa using evidence drawn from archaeology as well as history, ethnography, linguistics, art history, geography, geology, paleontology, biology, and other disciplines. Focuses not only on the material evidence from across the continent and its interpretation, but also an understanding of the major questions, developing methods of inquiry and problem solving, and situating the African data in the broader context of the archaeological evidence for the evolution of human behavioral diversity. The scope of the course spans hominin origins, the study of Stone Age foragers of the first 2.5 million years of human prehistory, and more recent periods characterized by food production, metallurgy, sedentism, and the development of complex societies (e.g., in Egypt, Mali, Zimbabwe, and the East African coast) with influence and contacts across and outside the continent.    Discovering Archaeology in New York City    ANTH-UA 225 Wright. 4 points.   In this course, New York City is our archaeological site. The period covered is from 10,000 years ago to the beginning of the 20th century and is based on archaeological remains. Its history is both fascinating and mind-expanding as a different perspective on the city emerges in time and space from what is learned. Walking around its various boroughs, students learn that our modern landscape is vastly different from that of earlier eras. Along with our gains as a major cultural center, we will assess some losses brought about by the destruction of aspects of the city\u2019s past. In particular, students come to understand the meaning of stewardship in the context of urban development. At the same time, viewing our place in the city\u2019s 10,000 years of history gives us a deeper sense of time and place and a unity in its shared heritage. Last Hunters-First Farmers ANTH-UA 608 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) or instructor permission. Offered every two years. 4 points. Last   Hunters-First Farmers explores the transition from foraging to   agriculture throughout the Eastern Hemisphere and the Americas. The   course begins with a review of the theories that have been proposed to   explain the transition from hunting to gathering to farming and the   archaeological methods that have been used to explore this question. The   archaeological evidence for the beginnings of farming in various   regions of the world is then explored in greater detail in order to   understand the specific reasons for the transition from foraging to   farming and the consequences of the adoption of agriculture.

Explores debates about phylogenetic relationships, taxonomy, paleobiological interpretations, and models for the origin of human behavior.    Human Variation    ANTH-UA 51 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Ant\u00f3n, Bailey, Disotell. 4 points.   Humans are the most wide-ranging of all of the species on earth. Our evolutionary history and our ability to adapt to such a broad range of environments result in the patterns of human variability we see today. New techniques have been developed that allow us to explore the different levels of human variation. Focuses on new data and methodologies, including molecular genetic techniques, and the hypotheses and controversies generated by these new perspectives.    Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior    ANTH-UA 52 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2). Ant\u00f3n, Bailey, Harrison, Higham, Williams. 4 points.

Primate Behavior and Ecology    ANTH-UA 54 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Higham. 4 points.   Why do some primates live in large social groups while others are solitary and yet others live in pairs or cooperatively breeding families? Why are strong social hierarchies seen in some primate taxa but not in others? How do multiple species of primates often manage to coexist in the same habitat? Why are social relationships in some primate species characterized by strong bonds among females while such bonds are absent in other primate societies? Why do some species of primates show marked geographic variability in behavior and social structure? The answers to these and other questions lie in understanding the relationships between each species and its ecological and social setting and in understanding each species' phylogenetic history. Explores the diversity of primate social systems and the evolutionary relationships among the primates and discusses many of the general ecological laws that have been proposed by evolutionary biologists as the keys to understanding important features of primate behavior and ecology.    Health and Disease in Human Evolution    ANTH-UA 55 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Ant\u00f3n, Disotell. 4 points.    Examines human health and disease within an ecological framework, exploring the interactions  of environmental, genetic, physiological, and cultural factors in the expression and distribution of human diseases. Develops pathology profiles for nonhuman primates; prehistoric human populations; and hunting and gathering, agricultural, and industrial groups, with emphasis on the expression of infectious disease in human history and newly (re)emerging diseases.    Comparative Biology of the Living Primates    ANTH-UA 56 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Harrison, Williams. 4 points.   Study of the comparative biology of the primates, our closest living relatives, is fundamental to a sound understanding of human biology and evolution. Surveys the comparative anatomy of the living primates from a structural, functional, and evolutionary perspective. Different anatomical systems and behaviors are explored, including external features, the cranium, dentition and dietary behavior, postcranial anatomy and locomotor behavior, sensory and nervous systems, and reproductive anatomy. The role of comparative anatomy in taxonomy, behavioral studies, and phylogenetic analyses is emphasized. Primate Communication ANTH-UA 57 Identical to ANST-UA 257. Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2). Offered periodically. 4 points. Increased   social and communicative complexity is one of the defining features of   humans compared to other mammals. Key insights into the evolution of   human communication can come from studying our most closely related   extant relatives, our fellow members of the Primate order. The present   course features a mixture of lectures and discussion classes to consider   contemporary topics in primate (including human) communication. Topics   covered include definitions of communication and consideration of its   major theoretical issues such as the difference between signals and   cues, signal honesty, and concepts of signal information content and   evolutionary signal design. Sections of the class focus on communication   in different sensory modalities\u2014olfactory, auditory, and visual, as   well as multimodal communication\u2014before discussing theories and issues   related to the evolution of language. The class finishes by considering   some of the most contemporary topics in primate communication.    Emerging Diseases    ANTH-UA 80 Disotell, Harrison. 4 points.   Integrates evolutionary biology, genetics, immunology, ecology, and behavioral ecology, along with sociocultural anthropology, politics, and economics, to better understand newly emerging and reemerging diseases as they affect human health. General evolutionary theory and an introduction to Darwinian medicine are provided before the course examines viral, bacterial, parasitic, and prion-based diseases along with their hosts, vectors, and other organisms. Particular attention is paid to how humans have purposely and inadvertently created both biological and cultural environments for the transmission of different diseases. Media representations and misrepresentations are examined throughout the course.    Human Ecology    ANTH-UA 90 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Crabtree. 4 points.   Investigates the degree to which variation in human biology and culture can be understood as adaptations to varying external conditions. Examines the relationship of human systems of action and the natural world to understand the various forms of human adaptation. Case studies of several living peoples, contemporary and past biological communities, and prehistoric cultures provide the material for interpretation and evaluation of theoretical positions.    Evolution of Language    ANTH-UA 240 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. 4 points.   Explores the various hypotheses offered for the evolution of language. Perspectives from different disciplines are discussed.

Introduction to Forensic Anthropology    ANTH-UA 326 Ant\u00f3n, Williams. 4 points.   Biological anthropology examines the evolutionary history and adaptability of humans and our ancestors. Forensic anthropology is an applied subfield of biological anthropology that provides expert analysis of the skeleton in a medicolegal setting by utilizing methods developed in skeletal biology, archaeology, and the forensic sciences. Forensic anthropologists play critical roles in identifying victims of mass fatalities (such as the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings), in investigating homicides (such as identifying the Russian tsar's family), and in distinguishing cause of death. The course examines how forensic anthropologists approach modern and historic crimes in the laboratory and the field. Students are introduced to the underlying theory and the applied techniques that forensic anthropologists use to recover and identify individuals and assess cause of death.

Economic, political, and family organizations and systems of thought, including religion, are covered with equal attention to \"primitive,\" traditional, and modern complex societies, particularly non-Western societies. ANTH-UA 2 Human Evolution Ant\u00f3n Investigates the evolutionary origins of humans. The study of human evolution is a multidisciplinary endeavor involving a synthesis of concepts, techniques, and research findings from a variety of different scientific fields, including evolutionary biology, paleontology, primatology, comparative anatomy, genetics, molecular biology, geology, and archaeology. Explores the different contributions that scientists have made toward understanding human origins and provides a detailed survey of the evidence used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of our own species. ANTH-UA 3 Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures Wright Introduces contemporary archaeology, its theories, practices, and early societies and cultures. Examines current methodological and theoretical viewpoints of archaeological scholarship within the discipline of anthropology. Focuses on key transformations in cultural evolution, such as the origins of modern humans, the emergence of food production, and the development of complex societies, urbanism, and early states. Explores gender roles, landscapes and settlements, technologies, art, cognitive systems, urbanism, and state formation. ANTH-UA 17 Anthropology of Language Das This course introduces students to linguistic anthropology, the study of human language and its use across diverse cultural and social contexts. Topics to be explored include language acquisition and socialization, pidgins and creoles, multilingualism, folklore, humor and racism, linguistic nationalism, literacy and other types of mediated communication, and multilingualism. We will also evaluate different methods of linguistic analysis used to examine communicative events across ethnographic contexts, focusing in particular on North America, the Pacific, and South Asia. Finally, we will explore popular debates about language and thought, language and identity, and language and power to understand how cultural and linguistic forms get reproduced and transformed through social interaction. ANTH-UA 35 Medical Anthropology Andersen How does culture influence health? How do new pharmaceuticals change social practices and values? What can epidemics of Ebola, tuberculosis, and influenza reveal about the ways that power and resources are distributed? Why are some mental illnesses found only in certain cultures? Medical anthropology examines these and other questions through ethnographically grounded research on the intertwining of cultural, environmental, political, economic, and biological processes. This course will track the \u201csocial lives\u201d of diseases and offer cultural perspectives on medical practices and technologies. ANTH-UA 48 Cultural Symbols Beidelman Surveys the various symbolic systems employed by the world's people, considering their use in myth, ritual, literature, and art and the kinds of anthropological theories applied to explain their power and forms. Approaches theory through case studies, providing a diverse view of world cultures. Uses materials from all continents; emphasizes non-Western, nonliterate societies, though some material from the West is also used. ANTH-UA 50 Fossil Evidence for Human Evolution Bailey An in-depth survey of the fossil record for human evolution. Traces the evolutionary history of the human lineage from its origin in the late Miocene of Africa up to the initial differentiation and diversification of anatomically modern humans. Explores debates about phylogenetic relationships, taxonomy, paleobiological interpretations, and models for the origin of human behavior. ANTH-UA 56 Comparative Biology of the Living Primates Harrison The study of the comparative anatomy of the primates, our closest living relatives, is fundamental to a sound understanding of human biology and evolution. This course surveys the anatomy and behavior of the living primates from a structural, functional and evolutionary perspective. The subject is reviewed topically by examining different anatomical systems and behaviors \u2013 external features, the cranium, dentition and dietary behavior, postcranial anatomy and locomotor behavior, sensory and nervous systems, and reproductive anatomy. The role of comparative anatomy in functional and behavioral studies, taxonomy, and phylogenetic analyses is emphasized. ANTH-UA 81 Global Cities: Anthropological Perspectives Rademacher This course explores urban processes in transnational and cross-cultural perspective. Drawing on theories of globalization, development, and migration, we will consider how the global context shapes debates about cities, and complicates our understanding of sociocultural life in urban places. As arenas of complex political and economic processes, twenty-first century cities host economic growth as well as economic disparity; they function in ways both politically liberating and politically limiting. In global context, cities may be seen as centers of commerce and cultural production, as places where social and spatial order are administered, and as sites of hope, struggle, creativity, and ingenuity. Anchoring our examination in ethnographies set in specific cities, we will analyze local, regional/national, and global perspectives on questions of urban equity, migration, violence, ecology, and citizenship. ANTH-101 Peoples of Sub-Saharan Africa Beidelman Surveys the societies and cultures of Africa. Divided between accounts of traditional ways of life, the history of colonial contact with Europe, and consideration of life in contemporary African states. Involves anthropological studies as well as historical works, novels, and autobiographies, many by African authors. African material is related to broader issues of social theory, ethnicity, social change, and the ties between culture, society, and values. ANTH-UA 102 Culture through Food Abercrombie TBA ANTH-UA 123 Anthropology of Media Strickland Examines the social and political life of media and how it makes a difference in the daily lives of people as a practice\u2014in production, reception, or circulation. Introduces some key concepts in social theory such as ideology, hegemony, the public sphere, and the nation, which have been critical to the study of the media across disciplines. Provides an overview of the increasing theoretical attention paid to the mass media by anthropologists and focuses on concrete ethnographic examples. Examines cross-culturally how the mass media have become the primary means for the circulation of symbolic forms across time and space and crucial to the constitution of subjectivities, collectivities, and histories in the contemporary world. Topics include the role of media in constituting and contesting national identities, in forging alternative political visions, in transforming religious practice, and in creating subcultures. ANTH-UA 210 Prehistoric Hunters and Gatherers Crabtree Prehistoric hunters and gatherers examines the archaeological record left by foraging peoples\u2013people who made their living by hunting, scavenging, gathering, and fishing\u2013in both the Eastern and Western hemispheres. This course will examine the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods in Africa and Eurasia, Australian prehistory, and the Paleoindian and Archaic periods in the Americas. In studying these hunter-gatherers, we will draw on perspectives derived from archaeology, cultural anthropology, and biological anthropology. ANTH-UA 211 First Cities and States Murphy Today we often take for granted the concept of a state. We all live in and are citizens of modern states with established bureaucracies, taxation systems, structures of leadership, and national ideologies. It wasn't always like this, however; so, how did we get here? During the last ten thousand years, human lifeways and societies have undergone tremendous change \u2013 from small hunter-gather communities to large-scale cities administered by centralized authorities and supplied by agricultural produce. In this course we will discuss the early manifestations of these processes of social change and the various explanations that have been proposed for the development of early cities and states. In addition, we will investigate actual archaeological case studies in order to assess the diversity of social complexity across time and space. Covering cultures in Mesopotamia, China, Central America, and South America, we will explore the ever-elusive concept of \u2018the\u2019 ancient state. ANTH-UA 212 Prehistoric Art and Symbolic Evolution White Examines prehistoric art forms, their interpretation, and their evolutionary and behavioral significance. Introduction to Stone Age art\u2014its form, contents, and chronological evolution. Also employs more recent prehistoric case studies. Reviews and assesses competing interpretive frameworks, with emphasis on understanding the social and ideological context within which the art was produced and comprehended. ANTH-UA 220 Religion and Media Zito Introduces students to the long-standing and complex connection between religious practices and various media. Analyzes how human hearing, vision, and the performing body have been used historically to express and maintain religious life through music, voice, images, words, and rituals. Examines more recent electronic media such as cassette, film, television, video, and the Internet. Students should note that an anthropological/historical perspective on studying religion is pursued in the course. ANTH-UA 320 Topical Seminar in Social and Cultural Anthropology: Ethnicity and Media Davila TBA ANTH-UA 332 Violence, Gender, and Law Merry This seminar explores the nature of violence as a concept that incorporates both physical harm and cultural meanings, using an anthropological perspective. The focus is on violence in gendered and non-gendered relationships and the role the law plays in controlling that violence. It examines law and violence in the context of non-state societies, colonialism, international law and human rights, and transitional justice. It focuses in particular on gender-based violence in a variety of forms, such as domestic violence, rape, sex trafficking, genocide, and wartime violence and considers legal strategies that attempt to deal with it. The course examines law as a system of ordering relations and controlling conflict in contexts as diverse as small bands and global institutions. It also theorizes law as a mode of maintaining state power and control over subordinate populations. ANTH-UA 400 Anthropology and Transnationalism Turnbull Examines what is considered \u201cnew\u201d in the ongoing reconstruction of world order and its accompanying disorder. Also examines how this changes the ways people earn their livelihoods; how cultures are transmitted and hybridized; how migrating populations maintain connections to their homelands; how group identities are constructed and asserted; and how social movements around newly politicized issues arise. Discusses changing roles of nation-states and the growing significance of transnational, diasporic, and globalized social relations and cultural forms. ANTH-UA 410 Culture through Food Abercrombie Like shelter, food is crucial to human life. It is not surprising therefore, that it has also been a central topicin anthropology. Whatever their diverse theoretical approaches, for cultural anthropology food is never \"just food\". Its significance can never be purely nutritional. Food is intimately tied up with social relations, including those of power, of inclusion and exclusion, as well as ideas about classification, the human body and human health. This course surveys a range of anthropological approaches to the study of food focusing on topics such as: the animality of eating; fermentation, cooking, rotting, digesting; food and the senses; food and talk; gastronomy and social hierarchy, feasts, fasts, and famine; food and religion; food and political economy; cannibalism and food taboos; food and the body; food and family; food and place (terroir); industrialization of food; the politics of globalization; and food security and sovereignty. Our ethnographic focus will be broad, and the range of readings eclectic. The course will include clips from feature and documentary film.

College Core Curriculum Courses CORE-UA 305 Natural Science II: Human Origins Disotell TBA CORE-UA 509 Cultures and Contexts: The Caribbean Khan Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and diverse mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today\u2019s globalization began some 500 years ago, and where the idea of \u201cmodernity\u201d took shape. Its sugar economy and colonial history of slave labor and indenture made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for four centuries, from Asia and the Middle East for two centuries, and, throughout, a sizeable influx of peoples from Europe. This course examines Caribbean colonial and postcolonial history and cultures, focusing on the relationship between processes of development and exploitation of the region. It also explores local ideas about race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality, which both justify and challenge these processes. We will tack between the past and the present, in order to better understand the relationship between historical forces and contemporary processes. Our coverage will be interdisciplinary, and range across English-speaking, Spanish-speaking, and French speaking territories. CORE-UA 516 Cultures and Contexts: India Ganti Utilizing a variety of sources\u2014novels, films, and academic scholarship\u2014students are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and contemporarily.
