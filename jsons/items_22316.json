Students can store and access their academic materials at anytime, from anywhere.   The initiative creates a secure, digital environment to store and archive student work, and allows for easy sharing, reviewing and commenting. It facilitates the organization of saved work across multiple classes, multiple projects, and multiple years of study. This, in turn, allows students, faculty and advisors to compare academic progress over a semester, a year, or an entire academic career.                Faculty   For faculty, Learning Portfolios can provide a more in-depth look at how students are performing by pulling together available learning data into one space that can help faculty when evaluating student-learning behavior and present an overall snapshot of how individual students are performing.                Students   For students, Learning Portfolios offer a chance to store all of their academic work in one online portfolio that stays with them and continues to grow throughout their academic career. It also offers students a chance to put together an academic resume that can be used when transitioning from school to the job market or to an advanced degree program.           Next Steps   Learning Portfolio will be further refined to integrate more functionality and learning insights from various NYU schools and departments. New technology capabilities will be included and further case studies will be added.     Please reference this site for regular updates about Learning Portfolio and how it will eventually be rolled out across NYU.

Students can store and access their academic materials at anytime, from anywhere.   The initiative creates a secure, digital environment to store and archive student work, and allows for easy sharing, reviewing and commenting. It facilitates the organization of saved work across multiple classes, multiple projects, and multiple years of study. This, in turn, allows students, faculty and advisors to compare academic progress over a semester, a year, or an entire academic career.                Faculty   For faculty, Learning Portfolios can provide a more in-depth look at how students are performing by pulling together available learning data into one space that can help faculty when evaluating student-learning behavior and present an overall snapshot of how individual students are performing.                Students   For students, Learning Portfolios offer a chance to store all of their academic work in one online portfolio that stays with them and continues to grow throughout their academic career. It also offers students a chance to put together an academic resume that can be used when transitioning from school to the job market or to an advanced degree program.           Next Steps   Learning Portfolio will be further refined to integrate more functionality and learning insights from various NYU schools and departments. New technology capabilities will be included and further case studies will be added.     Please reference this site for regular updates about Learning Portfolio and how it will eventually be rolled out across NYU.
