Applicants are admitted as freshmen and as transfer students. Candidates are  accepted on the basis of predicted success in the specific programs in which  they are interested. If the applicant meets formal course requirements, his or  her capacity for successful undergraduate work is measured through careful  consideration of secondary school and/or college records; recommendations from  guidance counselors, teachers, and others; scores on standardized tests; and  the personal essay.          Each  applicant is reviewed carefully to identify academic strength, potential for  intellectual growth and creativity, and promise of fully utilizing the special  offerings of the University and the city. Each applicant's record is considered  objectively and evaluated for participation in extracurricular and community  services, in addition to scholarly pursuits.          New  York University actively seeks students who are varied in interests, talents,  and goals, as well as in economic and social backgrounds. Particular attention  is paid to the degree to which candidates have made the effective use of opportunities  available to them, however great or limited those opportunities may have been.  Evidence of character and maturity are regarded as essential in potential  students who hope to benefit fully from the unique offerings of the University  and its urban environment. Participation in meaningful school and community  activities is an important factor.          Applicants  who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents should refer to this  section's heading \"applicants with international credentials.\"              RECOMMENDED  HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION      The  quality of an applicant's secondary school record is more important than a  prescribed pattern of courses. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools: four years of English, with heavy emphasis on writing; three to four  years of academic mathematics; three to four years of laboratory science; three  to four years of social studies; and two to three years of foreign language.  Students most competitive for admission will exceed these minimums. The admissions committee pays particular attention to the number of honors, AP, and  IB courses the applicant has completed in high school. It is strongly  recommended that all applicants take mathematics and language courses in the  senior year of high school.              THE  ADMISSIONS PROCESS      All  candidates for admission to the College must complete the Common Application  and the NYU Member Questions and Writing Supplement on the Common Application.  Applicants must apply online, as there is no paper version of the application  available. Any materials that a student or high school official is unable to  submit online may be sent to: Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York  University, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339.          A  complete application will include:      The Common Application and the NYU Member Questions     Official high school transcripts and/or college records for courses for which  academic credit has been earned (and General Educational Development test  scores, if applicable).     The Common Application School Report (for freshman applicants) or Registrar  Report (for transfer applicants).     All required testing should be completed and official results forwarded  electronically by one testing agency to NYU.     The NYU code for SAT and TOEFL scores is 2562; the code for ACT scores is 2838.     At least one Teacher Evaluation.     Personal statement/essay.          Candidates  are urged to complete and file their applications as soon as possible,  especially those seeking financial aid and/or housing. (See below for application  filing deadlines.) No admissions decision will be made without complete  information. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions reserves the right to  substitute or waive particular admissions requirements at the discretion of the admissions committee.          Applications  submitted after the filing deadline are unlikely to be considered by the  committee, except under special circumstances.          Freshman  candidates may choose between Early Decision, Early Decision II, and Regular  Decision admission for September admission. Depending on the notification plan,  applicants will receive an admissions decision on December 15, February 15, or  April 1. Transfer candidates for summer and September admission are notified  beginning in early to mid-May. Transfer candidates for January admission are  notified on a rolling basis, usually beginning on or around November 15.

Please contact the Office of  Undergraduate Admissions or call 212-998-4500 for information regarding program  availability.              CAMPUS  VISITS      All prospective students and their parents are invited to  visit the New York University campus. Opportunities to tour the University, to  meet students and faculty, and to attend classes are available to interested  students.          Both  high school and college students wishing to discuss the choice of a college,  the transfer process, or academic programs are invited to attend an information  session conducted by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at the Jeffrey S.  Gould Welcome Center located at 50 West Fourth Street. The Office of  Undergraduate Admissions holds daily information sessions and conducts campus  tours, Monday through Friday and many Saturdays, except during University  holidays. Visit the undergraduate admissions website or call 212-998-4524 to  make an appointment for an information session and tour.          Although  interviews are not available, a visit to the campus is strongly recommended. It  is suggested that reservations be made well in advance of your visit.          For  information about booking accommodations for your visit to NYU, please be sure  to check the \"visit us\" section of the admissions website.              STANDARDIZED  TESTS      NYU  seeks talented students from every corner of the globe. Applicants are expected  to demonstrate their talents and mastery of subject matter to support their  applications and to marshal their best case for admission to NYU. As a result,  NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university.          To  be eligible for admission, applicants are expected to submit results from one  of the following testing options:      The SAT Reasoning Test; or The ACT (with Writing Test); or     Three SAT Subject Test scores; or     Three AP exam scores; or     The International Baccalaureate Diploma; or     Three IB higher-level exam scores (if you are not an IB Diploma candidate); or     Students may instead elect to submit results from a nationally accredited exam  that is considered locally to signify the completion of secondary education and  is administered independently of the student's school.          Note: SAT Subject Test,  AP, or IB scores (for students not submitting an IB diploma) must be submitted  in the form of: one in literature or the humanities; one in math or science;  and one test of the student's choice in any subject.          The  following country-specific examinations are all accepted as admission  credentials; note, however, that only a few of them also carry advanced standing  credit (see details under \"credit by examination\" section, below):     Australia: Australian Capital Territory Year 12 Certificate, New South Wales Higher School Certificate (HSC), Northern Territory Certificate of Education and Training (NTCET), Queensland Certificate of Education (QCE), South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE), Tasmanian Certificate of Education (TCE), Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE), or Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE); in addition to Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) or Overall Position (OP) positioning Bangladesh: Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) Exams Bhutan: Bhutan Higher Secondary Education Certificate Examination (BHSEC) Brazil: Certificado de Conclusao de Ensino Medio + Vestibular (University Entrance Exam) or Exame Nacional do Ensino M\u00e9dio/Middle Education National Examination (ENEM) Brunei: Brunei Matriculation Examination Bulgaria: Matura Caribbean: Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination Chile: Prueba De Seleccion Universitaria China: Chinese National Higher Education Entrance Examination (Gao Kao) Colombia: Examen de Estado para Ingreso a la Educacion Superior (Saber 11) Costa Rica: Bachillera Nacional Cote D'Ivoire: Baccalaur\u00e9at Croatia: Matura Cyprus: \u03a0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 \u0395\u03be\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 (Pancyprian Examinations) Czech Republic: Maturitn\u00ed zkou\u0161ka Denmark: Students may submit either of the following exams: Studentereksamen H\u00f8jere Forberedelseseksamen Estonia: Riigieksamitunnistus Ethiopia: Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance Examination Europe: European Baccalaureate (EB) Finland: Ylioppilastutkintotodistus France: Baccalaur\u00e9at Germany: Abitur Greece: Apolytirion Hong Kong: Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Hungary: \u00c9rettsegi vizsga India: Indian School Certificate (ISC), All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) or Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC).

If you have a question as to whether  or not an examination offered in your country would meet our testing  requirements, please send an email to admissions.ops@nyu.edu and we will  confirm. You should not assume that any examinations will meet our testing  requirements unless they are listed above.         Submitting  Scores/   Examination Results          Test  scores or examination results should be submitted by the appropriate  application deadline. If final examination results are unavailable at the time  of application, predicted results may be sent (except in the case of SAT, SAT  Subject, ACT, or AP scores, which must be final when submitted). Predicted  results, which may be subject to additional verification, may only be submitted  by a school official, via one of the following methods:          Naviance/Common Application website;     Mailed on official school letterhead, in a sealed and signed envelope; or     E-mailed from a clearly identifiable school e-mail address.          If  predicted results are submitted in place of final results, NYU reserves the  right to withdraw an offer of admission if final results are not within close  range of the predicted results.          Students  are welcome to submit evidence of national or international academic  accomplishments that they feel may further support their application.          International  students applying to our campus in New York should also review NYU's English  language testing requirements at the Admissions website.          Official  test scores should be sent directly to NYU from the testing agencies. The NYU  code for the College Board (SAT Reasoning Test, SAT I, SAT II  Examinations/Subject Tests, and TOEFL) is 2562; the ACT code for NYU is 2838.

Some of the foreign language  examinations are offered both with and without a listening component; Core  exemption (and, if applicable, placement) scores are the same.      2 Scores in these  languages may only be used for Core exemption, not for placement. Students who  intend to register  for any of these languages at NYU must take the CAS placement examination.     3 Scores in these  languages may be used either for Core exemption or for placement in the proper  level of study. Consult the website of the relevant CAS language department or  the CAS Office of Academic Affairs, Silver 908; 212-998-8110.      4 A score of 650 or  better on either mathematics subject examination (or on the mathematics section  of the SAT general test) places students into Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or  Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) if they intend to register for these  courses.                  FINANCIAL  AID APPLICATION      After  the admissions decision is made and the appropriate financial aid applications  are submitted, a request for financial aid is considered.          All  freshman students applying for financial aid must file the Free Application for  Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service/Financial Aid  PROFILE (CSS PROFILE). We recommend that students apply electronically; see our  NYU website. There is no fee charged to file the FAFSA but a fee is associated  with the CSS PROFILE. When completing the CSS PROFILE, students will be  made aware by the form whether they qualify for a fee waiver. Students must  include the NYU federal school code number 002785 in the school section of the  FAFSA and CSS PROFILE to ensure that their submitted information is transmitted  by the processor to New York University. Transfer students applying for  financial aid need only complete the FAFSA.          New  York State residents should also complete the separate application for the  Tuition Assistance Program (TAP); for information, visit www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/financial-aid . Students from  other states may be required to complete separate applications for their state  programs if their state grants can be used at New York University.              EARLY  DECISION FOR ENTERING FRESHMEN      NYU  offers two Early Decision application options for freshman applicants who are  certain that NYU is their first-choice university. Students applying as Early  Decision candidates will receive their admission decision after December 15th  (Early Decision I) or after February 15th (Early Decision II).          An  Outline of NYU's Early Decision Philosophy and Process      NYU's  Early Decision programs are, in fact, binding agreements, whereby if an  applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that  enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously  submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer\u2014roughly within two to  three weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from  filing any new applications and are expected to withdraw any active  applications to other schools. Providing that a student has completed the CSS  PROFILE online, the student will be provided with a financial aid estimate soon  after the student is offered admission. Again, admitted students will have  roughly two to three weeks to review their financial aid package before  confirming their enrollment at NYU. The FAFSA becomes available on  January 1st and should be completed by admitted Early Decision candidates after  submitting an enrollment deposit.          We  believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is indeed to  provide an early decision ; for that reason,  we typically either admit or deny Early Decision candidates.          Early  Decision and Financial Aid      NYU  uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision  candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates.  Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply  for admission.          For Early Decision I candidates, we use information  students share with us via the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE online to provide  admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after December 15th.  For Early Decision II candidates, we use this information to provide admitted  students with an estimated financial aid package after February 15th. Students  are then provided with their official financial aid award in late April,  assuming students have completed their Free Application for Federal Student Aid  (FAFSA) by February 15th.          Students  will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if they believe their  estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must  be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial  aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will  be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision  program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for  students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to  apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.          Early  Decision Application Process      Complete the Common Application and NYU Supplement online, and check either the  Early Decision I or II option.         Download and sign the Early Decision Agreement from the Common Application  website. Secure the signature of your parent or guardian and your college  adviser/guidance counselor. When you apply online, the Early Decision Agreement  may be submitted along with your high school transcript. Alternatively,  it may be faxed to 212-995-4911 by your counselor.         Submit all supporting materials, such as transcripts and standardized test  scores, to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by the appropriate deadline.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS      A  student may be admitted by transfer from another college or university in  September, January, or May. (See \"the admission process,\" above.) Credit will  be granted for most collegiate work completed with a grade of C or better  within the last 10 years that satisfies degree requirements and that falls  within the residency requirement, with the exception of certain courses of a  vocational nature or courses not consistent with the educational objectives of  the College. Within these provisions, applicants from regionally accredited  colleges are eligible for admission.          Except  when specifically noted, the general procedures described for entering freshmen  apply to all applicants seeking to transfer from other two-year or four-year  regionally accredited institutions. Transfer applicants must submit official  credentials from all institutions attended, including secondary school  transcripts. Transfer applicants who took the SAT or ACT exams while in high  school should submit their test results as part of their application. Transfer  applicants who did not take these exams while in high school and have been in  college less than one year must follow the testing requirements listed on the admissions website. All transfer applicants are encouraged to submit scores  from two SAT Subject Tests if previously taken while in high school.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY      Students  who wish to transfer from one school to another within the University must file  an Internal Transfer Application available online prior to the application  deadline (November 1 for the spring term and March 1 for the summer or fall  term).              THE  ENROLLMENT PROCESS      To  be enrolled, an admitted undergraduate candidate must do the following:          Accept the University's offer of admission and pay the required nonrefundable  tuition deposit.         If applicable, pay the required nonrefundable housing deposit.         Have his or her high school and/or college forward a final transcript(s) to the  Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center.         File a medical report.         Make an appointment with the individual school or division for academic  advisement.         Pay balance of tuition and/or housing fees by the stipulated deadlines.     Register for classes when notified.              SPECIAL  (VISITING) STUDENTS      Undergraduate  matriculated students who are currently attending other regionally accredited  four-year colleges and maintaining good standing, both academic and  disciplinary, may be admitted on certification from their own schools. Such  students must be eligible to receive degree credit at their own schools for  courses taken at the University. The approval as a special undergraduate student  is for two terms only and cannot be extended. The Special Student Application  Form for undergraduate students may be obtained online. A $70 application fee  is required. Deadlines for applications are as follows:      Fall: August 1     Spring: December 1     Summer: April 1      All  special students must meet the regulations of the Faculty Committee on  Undergraduate Academic Standards regarding grades and program.              APPLICANTS  WITH INTERNATIONAL CREDENTIALS      Applicants  to New York University who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents of  the United States must complete the Application for Admission to Undergraduate  Study available online. Please indicate on the application for admission your  country of citizenship, and if you are currently residing in the United States,  your current visa status.          Freshman  applicants (those who are currently attending or who have previously completed  secondary school only) seeking to begin studies in the fall (September)  semester must submit applications and all required credentials on or before the  application deadline that corresponds to their selected notification plan  (November 1 for Early Decision I, and January 1 for Early Decision II and  Regular Decision). Transfer applicants (those who are currently attending or who  have previously attended university or tertiary school) must submit  applications and all required credentials on or before April 1. Transfer  candidates seeking admission for the spring (January) semester must submit  their applications and credentials on or before November 1. Applications will  not be processed until the Office of Undergraduate Admissions receives all  supporting credentials.          All  freshman applicants are required to submit official test results. Please visit  the Admissions website to learn about the admissions requirements.          If  the applicant's secondary education culminated in a maturity certificate  examination, he or she is required to submit an official copy of the grades  received in each subject. All documents submitted for review must be official;  that is, they must be either originals or copies certified by authorized  persons. A \"certified\" photocopy or other copy is one that bears either an  original signature of the registrar or other designated school officials or an  original impression of the institution's seal. Uncertified photocopies are not  acceptable. If these official documents are in a foreign language, they must be  accompanied by an official English translation.          In  addition, every applicant whose native language is not English must take the  Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English  Language Testing System (IELTS), or the Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE  Academic). Information concerning these examinations may be obtained by  visiting the website. Each student must request that his or her score on this  examination be sent to the NYU Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center, code  2562.          Applicants  residing in the New York area may elect to take the English proficiency test of  the University's American Language Institute, located at 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003. An appointment to take the test may be made by  calling 212-998-7040.          Financial  documentation is not required when filing an application. If the student is  accepted, instructions for completing the Application for Certificate of  Eligibility (AFCOE) online will be included in the acceptance packet.  Appropriate evidence of financial ability must be submitted with the AFCOE to  the Office for International Students and Scholars in order for the appropriate  visa document to be issued. If the applicant's studies are being financed by  means of his or her own savings, parental support, outside private or  government scholarships, or any combination of these, he or she must arrange to  send official letters or similar certification as proof of such support.          New  students may wish to view the multimedia tutorial for new international  students.              THE  AMERICAN LANGUAGE INSTITUTE      The American Language Institute of the School of  Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University offers intensive  courses in English for students with little or no proficiency in the language.  It also offers the Advanced Workshop Program in English for students with  substantial English proficiency but insufficient proficiency for undertaking a  full-time academic program. Qualified students in this program can often  combine English study with a part-time academic program. This combination may  constitute a full-time program of study. The institute also offers specialized  courses in accent reduction, grammar, and American business English.          Individuals  who wish to obtain additional information about the American Language Institute  are invited to visit the office of the American Language Institute weekdays throughout  the year between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. (Fridays until 5 p.m.). They  may also visit the website; contact The American Language Institute, School of  Continuing and Professional Studies, New York University, 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003; telephone: 212-998-7040; fax: 212-995-4135; or  e-mail: ali@nyu.edu .              STUDENT  VISAS AND ORIENTATION      Matters  pertaining to student visas and new student orientation are administered by the  Office of Global Services (OGS), 561 La Guardia Place, 1st Floor; 212-998-4720.  In addition, the staff of this office endeavors to aid international students  in taking full advantage of various social, cultural, and recreational  opportunities offered by the University and the city. Specific information on  programs and events can be found at www.nyu.edu/oiss .              READMISSION  OF FORMER STUDENTS      Any  former student who has been out of attendance for more than two consecutive  terms and who wishes to return to the College must apply for readmission.  Applications for readmission are available online. (See admission application  filing deadlines above.) Requests for readmission should be received by April 1  for the summer and fall terms and November 1 for the spring term, but will be  considered after those deadlines on a space available basis.      Students  who have attended another college or university since their last attendance at  New York University must complete the regular application for transfer  admission and submit an official transcript.              SPECIAL  (POSTGRADUATE) STUDENTS      Graduates  of accredited four-year colleges, including the College of Arts and Science and  other schools of New York University, may register as special students in  undergraduate courses for which they meet the prerequisites and that are still  open after matriculated students have registered. Such a student should submit  proof of his or her degree and an application for admission as a special  postgraduate student. The application form can be obtained online.          Deadlines  for applications are as follows:      Fall: August 1     Spring: December 1     Summer: April 1      Students  interested in the post-baccalaureate premedical program should contact the  Preprofessional Center, College of Arts and Science, New York University,  Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901, New York, NY 10003-6688;  212-998-8160.              NYU  SPRING IN NEW YORK      NYU  Spring in New York offers college students from other institutions an opportunity  to earn college credit and to experience academic life at New York University.  Spring in New York participants enroll in one of eight areas of study, in  courses with NYU students and taught by NYU faculty.          In  addition to classroom learning, NYU Spring in New York students have access to  the same opportunities and benefits as NYU students: library access, sports  center access, and program office events, including ticket discounts for  Broadway shows, concerts, and sporting events. They are also encouraged to  participate in planned excursions around the city.      The  program is offered to students currently matriculated and in good standing at  an accredited college or university (within the United States) with a  competitive grade point average. Students must have at least sophomore standing  in the academic year of participation.          Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/spring.in.ny .              NYU  JANUARY TERM      New  York University's January Term allows students more flexibility and new  scheduling options. NYU students, visiting students, and international students  have the opportunity to earn major/minor credit or explore a new interest.  During this time, students can take advantage of intensive study at one of the  foremost research and teaching universities in the United States, as well as  have a chance to enjoy New York City during a bustling and exciting time of  year.          Oftentimes,  the fall and spring semesters can be overly hectic for students, considering a  full-time course load, student club responsibilities, work, and internship  commitments. This busy time doesn't always allow the freedom to explore a new  academic interest or take advantage of the many  cultural resources that originally drew them to New York City. January Term  provides an array of courses enabling students to earn academic credit (major,  minor, or elective) in courses that are in high demand, to accelerate degree  completion, and to concentrate on personal interests.         Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/winter .              ADVANCED  STANDING      Credit  may be awarded for satisfactory work completed at another accredited college or  university. When a transfer applicant is admitted to the College, the  applicant's records are examined carefully to determine how much, if any,  advanced standing will be granted. Each individual course completed elsewhere  is evaluated. In granting advanced standing, the following are considered: the  content, complexity, and grading standards of courses taken elsewhere;  individual grades and grade averages attained by the applicant; the suitability  of courses taken elsewhere for the program of study chosen here; and the degree  of preparation that completed courses provide for more advanced study here.  Point credit toward the degree is given only for a grade of C or better and  provided that the credit fits into the selected program of study and courses  were completed within the past 10 years.          Quarter  hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits  transferable to NYU. Credits based on semester hours will be transferred at  face value to NYU.          As  with all other students, transfer students are required to fulfill the  residency requirement. All degree candidates are subject to the following  residency requirement: They must complete at least 64 consecutive points of  course work in residence at the College immediately preceding the date of  graduation and are permitted to transfer a maximum of 64 credits to NYU.          A  tentative statement of advanced standing is provided to each transfer student  upon notification of admission to the College. A final statement of advanced  standing is provided during the student's first semester of matriculation.  Requests for reevaluation of transfer credit must be made within the semester  during which the final statement of advanced standing is received. Thereafter,  a student's advanced standing credits may be changed only with the written  permission of the Office of the Dean.              CREDIT  BY EXAMINATION (INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL MATURITY EXAMS)      The  Advanced Placement (AP) Program (College Entrance Examination Board), the  International Baccalaureate (IB) Program, and the results of some foreign  maturity certificate examinations enable undergraduate students to receive  credit toward the bachelor's degree on the basis of performance in  college-level examinations or proficiency examinations related to the College's  degree requirements, subject to the approval of the College.          The  maximum number of credits allowed toward the degree requirements of the College  that are a result of any possible combination of nonresident special  examination programs (plus previous coursework, if applicable and approved)  shall not exceed a total of 32.          International  Baccalaureate (IB)      The  College recognizes, for advanced standing credit, higher-level examinations  passed with grades of 6 or 7. No credit is granted for standard-level  examinations. Official reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate  Admissions Processing Center for review. See the chart below concerning those  IB test scores for which credit is given.         Maturity  Certificate Examinations          The College will consider the results of certain foreign  maturity certificate examinations for advanced standing credit. They are:      A Levels and Cambridge Pre-U     Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at     German Abitur     Italian Maturit\u00e0 Federal Swiss Maturity Certificate (Matura)      CAS  does not award credit for any other maturity certificate examinations.          Official  reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate Admissions Processing  Center. These documents will be added to the student record, but advanced  standing credit for all examinations other than AP and IB will be awarded by  the College Advising Center, Silver 905; 212-998-8130.      See  the chart below for details on those A Level and Cambridge Pre-U test scores  for which credit is given. For the other maturity examinations, please note  that not every subject is awarded credit by the College. Creditworthy results  earn 8 points each (except for the Italian Maturit\u00e0, which is 4 points).          Minimum  scores for receiving credit are:      A Levels: B     Cambridge Pre-U: M2     CAPE: II (out of VII)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at: 12 (out of 20) with coefficient of 5 or better     German Abitur: 10 (out of 15). Credit is only awarded for written exams  (schr.), not for oral (mdl.)     Italian Maturit\u00e0: 7 (out of 10)     Swiss Matura: 4.5 (out of 6)              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT PROGRAM      The College participates in the Advanced Placement (AP)  Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. In accordance with New York  University policy, students may receive college credit toward their degree for  test results of 5 or 4, depending on the subject examination. Students  receiving credit toward their degree may not take the corresponding  college-level course for credit. If they do, they will lose the AP credit. See  the chart below concerning those AP test scores for which credit is given. The  chart also lists those tests for which College Core Curriculum equivalencies  are granted.          For  additional information, students should consult the Office of Undergraduate  Admissions online or by telephone at 212-998-4500.              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT CREDIT AND THE COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM      Note: a 4 or 5 on any foreign  language AP satisfies the Core language requirement. Note: the College also accepts a score of 5 (not 4) on the Russian Language and Culture Prototype AP examination for exemption from the foreign language requirement, but no credit is awarded and the score cannot be used for placement; scores of 4 or lower likewise award no credit and have no bearing on placement.

Applicants are admitted as freshmen and as transfer students. Candidates are  accepted on the basis of predicted success in the specific programs in which  they are interested. If the applicant meets formal course requirements, his or  her capacity for successful undergraduate work is measured through careful  consideration of secondary school and/or college records; recommendations from  guidance counselors, teachers, and others; scores on standardized tests; and  the personal essay.          Each  applicant is reviewed carefully to identify academic strength, potential for  intellectual growth and creativity, and promise of fully utilizing the special  offerings of the University and the city. Each applicant's record is considered  objectively and evaluated for participation in extracurricular and community  services, in addition to scholarly pursuits.          New  York University actively seeks students who are varied in interests, talents,  and goals, as well as in economic and social backgrounds. Particular attention  is paid to the degree to which candidates have made the effective use of opportunities  available to them, however great or limited those opportunities may have been.  Evidence of character and maturity are regarded as essential in potential  students who hope to benefit fully from the unique offerings of the University  and its urban environment. Participation in meaningful school and community  activities is an important factor.          Applicants  who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents should refer to this  section's heading \"applicants with international credentials.\"              RECOMMENDED  HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION      The  quality of an applicant's secondary school record is more important than a  prescribed pattern of courses. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools: four years of English, with heavy emphasis on writing; three to four  years of academic mathematics; three to four years of laboratory science; three  to four years of social studies; and two to three years of foreign language.  Students most competitive for admission will exceed these minimums. The admissions committee pays particular attention to the number of honors, AP, and  IB courses the applicant has completed in high school. It is strongly  recommended that all applicants take mathematics and language courses in the  senior year of high school.              THE  ADMISSIONS PROCESS      All  candidates for admission to the College must complete the Common Application  and the NYU Member Questions and Writing Supplement on the Common Application.  Applicants must apply online, as there is no paper version of the application  available. Any materials that a student or high school official is unable to  submit online may be sent to: Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York  University, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339.          A  complete application will include:      The Common Application and the NYU Member Questions     Official high school transcripts and/or college records for courses for which  academic credit has been earned (and General Educational Development test  scores, if applicable).     The Common Application School Report (for freshman applicants) or Registrar  Report (for transfer applicants).     All required testing should be completed and official results forwarded  electronically by one testing agency to NYU.     The NYU code for SAT and TOEFL scores is 2562; the code for ACT scores is 2838.     At least one Teacher Evaluation.     Personal statement/essay.          Candidates  are urged to complete and file their applications as soon as possible,  especially those seeking financial aid and/or housing. (See below for application  filing deadlines.) No admissions decision will be made without complete  information. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions reserves the right to  substitute or waive particular admissions requirements at the discretion of the admissions committee.          Applications  submitted after the filing deadline are unlikely to be considered by the  committee, except under special circumstances.          Freshman  candidates may choose between Early Decision, Early Decision II, and Regular  Decision admission for September admission. Depending on the notification plan,  applicants will receive an admissions decision on December 15, February 15, or  April 1. Transfer candidates for summer and September admission are notified  beginning in early to mid-May. Transfer candidates for January admission are  notified on a rolling basis, usually beginning on or around November 15.              ADMISSIONS  APPLICATION FILING DEADLINES      Freshman Applicants for Admission:   Notification  Plan Application  Deadline Notification  Date Early  Decision I November  1 December  15 Early  Decision II January  1 February  15 Regular  Decision January  1 April  1           For  entrance in January (transfer applicants only), applications for admission,  including all required supporting credentials, must be received by November 1.         For  entrance in the summer sessions (transfer applicants only), applications should  be received by April 1.          Applications  for admission received after these dates are unlikely to be considered for  admission except under special circumstances. Please contact the Office of  Undergraduate Admissions or call 212-998-4500 for information regarding program  availability.              CAMPUS  VISITS      All prospective students and their parents are invited to  visit the New York University campus. Opportunities to tour the University, to  meet students and faculty, and to attend classes are available to interested  students.          Both  high school and college students wishing to discuss the choice of a college,  the transfer process, or academic programs are invited to attend an information  session conducted by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at the Jeffrey S.  Gould Welcome Center located at 50 West Fourth Street. The Office of  Undergraduate Admissions holds daily information sessions and conducts campus  tours, Monday through Friday and many Saturdays, except during University  holidays. Visit the undergraduate admissions website or call 212-998-4524 to  make an appointment for an information session and tour.          Although  interviews are not available, a visit to the campus is strongly recommended. It  is suggested that reservations be made well in advance of your visit.          For  information about booking accommodations for your visit to NYU, please be sure  to check the \"visit us\" section of the admissions website.              STANDARDIZED  TESTS      NYU  seeks talented students from every corner of the globe. Applicants are expected  to demonstrate their talents and mastery of subject matter to support their  applications and to marshal their best case for admission to NYU. As a result,  NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university.          To  be eligible for admission, applicants are expected to submit results from one  of the following testing options:      The SAT Reasoning Test; or The ACT (with Writing Test); or     Three SAT Subject Test scores; or     Three AP exam scores; or     The International Baccalaureate Diploma; or     Three IB higher-level exam scores (if you are not an IB Diploma candidate); or     Students may instead elect to submit results from a nationally accredited exam  that is considered locally to signify the completion of secondary education and  is administered independently of the student's school.          Note: SAT Subject Test,  AP, or IB scores (for students not submitting an IB diploma) must be submitted  in the form of: one in literature or the humanities; one in math or science;  and one test of the student's choice in any subject.          The  following country-specific examinations are all accepted as admission  credentials; note, however, that only a few of them also carry advanced standing  credit (see details under \"credit by examination\" section, below):     Australia: Australian Capital Territory Year 12 Certificate, New South Wales Higher School Certificate (HSC), Northern Territory Certificate of Education and Training (NTCET), Queensland Certificate of Education (QCE), South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE), Tasmanian Certificate of Education (TCE), Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE), or Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE); in addition to Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) or Overall Position (OP) positioning Bangladesh: Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) Exams Bhutan: Bhutan Higher Secondary Education Certificate Examination (BHSEC) Brazil: Certificado de Conclusao de Ensino Medio + Vestibular (University Entrance Exam) or Exame Nacional do Ensino M\u00e9dio/Middle Education National Examination (ENEM) Brunei: Brunei Matriculation Examination Bulgaria: Matura Caribbean: Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination Chile: Prueba De Seleccion Universitaria China: Chinese National Higher Education Entrance Examination (Gao Kao) Colombia: Examen de Estado para Ingreso a la Educacion Superior (Saber 11) Costa Rica: Bachillera Nacional Cote D'Ivoire: Baccalaur\u00e9at Croatia: Matura Cyprus: \u03a0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 \u0395\u03be\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 (Pancyprian Examinations) Czech Republic: Maturitn\u00ed zkou\u0161ka Denmark: Students may submit either of the following exams: Studentereksamen H\u00f8jere Forberedelseseksamen Estonia: Riigieksamitunnistus Ethiopia: Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance Examination Europe: European Baccalaureate (EB) Finland: Ylioppilastutkintotodistus France: Baccalaur\u00e9at Germany: Abitur Greece: Apolytirion Hong Kong: Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Hungary: \u00c9rettsegi vizsga India: Indian School Certificate (ISC), All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) or Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC).

If you have a question as to whether  or not an examination offered in your country would meet our testing  requirements, please send an email to admissions.ops@nyu.edu and we will  confirm. You should not assume that any examinations will meet our testing  requirements unless they are listed above.         Submitting  Scores/   Examination Results          Test  scores or examination results should be submitted by the appropriate  application deadline. If final examination results are unavailable at the time  of application, predicted results may be sent (except in the case of SAT, SAT  Subject, ACT, or AP scores, which must be final when submitted). Predicted  results, which may be subject to additional verification, may only be submitted  by a school official, via one of the following methods:          Naviance/Common Application website;     Mailed on official school letterhead, in a sealed and signed envelope; or     E-mailed from a clearly identifiable school e-mail address.          If  predicted results are submitted in place of final results, NYU reserves the  right to withdraw an offer of admission if final results are not within close  range of the predicted results.          Students  are welcome to submit evidence of national or international academic  accomplishments that they feel may further support their application.          International  students applying to our campus in New York should also review NYU's English  language testing requirements at the Admissions website.          Official  test scores should be sent directly to NYU from the testing agencies. The NYU  code for the College Board (SAT Reasoning Test, SAT I, SAT II  Examinations/Subject Tests, and TOEFL) is 2562; the ACT code for NYU is 2838.

Some of the foreign language  examinations are offered both with and without a listening component; Core  exemption (and, if applicable, placement) scores are the same.      2 Scores in these  languages may only be used for Core exemption, not for placement. Students who  intend to register  for any of these languages at NYU must take the CAS placement examination.     3 Scores in these  languages may be used either for Core exemption or for placement in the proper  level of study. Consult the website of the relevant CAS language department or  the CAS Office of Academic Affairs, Silver 908; 212-998-8110.      4 A score of 650 or  better on either mathematics subject examination (or on the mathematics section  of the SAT general test) places students into Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or  Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) if they intend to register for these  courses.                  FINANCIAL  AID APPLICATION      After  the admissions decision is made and the appropriate financial aid applications  are submitted, a request for financial aid is considered.          All  freshman students applying for financial aid must file the Free Application for  Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service/Financial Aid  PROFILE (CSS PROFILE). We recommend that students apply electronically; see our  NYU website. There is no fee charged to file the FAFSA but a fee is associated  with the CSS PROFILE. When completing the CSS PROFILE, students will be  made aware by the form whether they qualify for a fee waiver. Students must  include the NYU federal school code number 002785 in the school section of the  FAFSA and CSS PROFILE to ensure that their submitted information is transmitted  by the processor to New York University. Transfer students applying for  financial aid need only complete the FAFSA.          New  York State residents should also complete the separate application for the  Tuition Assistance Program (TAP); for information, visit www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/financial-aid . Students from  other states may be required to complete separate applications for their state  programs if their state grants can be used at New York University.              EARLY  DECISION FOR ENTERING FRESHMEN      NYU  offers two Early Decision application options for freshman applicants who are  certain that NYU is their first-choice university. Students applying as Early  Decision candidates will receive their admission decision after December 15th  (Early Decision I) or after February 15th (Early Decision II).          An  Outline of NYU's Early Decision Philosophy and Process      NYU's  Early Decision programs are, in fact, binding agreements, whereby if an  applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that  enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously  submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer\u2014roughly within two to  three weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from  filing any new applications and are expected to withdraw any active  applications to other schools. Providing that a student has completed the CSS  PROFILE online, the student will be provided with a financial aid estimate soon  after the student is offered admission. Again, admitted students will have  roughly two to three weeks to review their financial aid package before  confirming their enrollment at NYU. The FAFSA becomes available on  January 1st and should be completed by admitted Early Decision candidates after  submitting an enrollment deposit.          We  believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is indeed to  provide an early decision ; for that reason,  we typically either admit or deny Early Decision candidates.          Early  Decision and Financial Aid      NYU  uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision  candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates.  Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply  for admission.          For Early Decision I candidates, we use information  students share with us via the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE online to provide  admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after December 15th.  For Early Decision II candidates, we use this information to provide admitted  students with an estimated financial aid package after February 15th. Students  are then provided with their official financial aid award in late April,  assuming students have completed their Free Application for Federal Student Aid  (FAFSA) by February 15th.          Students  will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if they believe their  estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must  be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial  aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will  be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision  program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for  students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to  apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.          Early  Decision Application Process      Complete the Common Application and NYU Supplement online, and check either the  Early Decision I or II option.         Download and sign the Early Decision Agreement from the Common Application  website. Secure the signature of your parent or guardian and your college  adviser/guidance counselor. When you apply online, the Early Decision Agreement  may be submitted along with your high school transcript. Alternatively,  it may be faxed to 212-995-4911 by your counselor.         Submit all supporting materials, such as transcripts and standardized test  scores, to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by the appropriate deadline.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS      A  student may be admitted by transfer from another college or university in  September, January, or May. (See \"the admission process,\" above.) Credit will  be granted for most collegiate work completed with a grade of C or better  within the last 10 years that satisfies degree requirements and that falls  within the residency requirement, with the exception of certain courses of a  vocational nature or courses not consistent with the educational objectives of  the College. Within these provisions, applicants from regionally accredited  colleges are eligible for admission.          Except  when specifically noted, the general procedures described for entering freshmen  apply to all applicants seeking to transfer from other two-year or four-year  regionally accredited institutions. Transfer applicants must submit official  credentials from all institutions attended, including secondary school  transcripts. Transfer applicants who took the SAT or ACT exams while in high  school should submit their test results as part of their application. Transfer  applicants who did not take these exams while in high school and have been in  college less than one year must follow the testing requirements listed on the admissions website. All transfer applicants are encouraged to submit scores  from two SAT Subject Tests if previously taken while in high school.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY      Students  who wish to transfer from one school to another within the University must file  an Internal Transfer Application available online prior to the application  deadline (November 1 for the spring term and March 1 for the summer or fall  term).              THE  ENROLLMENT PROCESS      To  be enrolled, an admitted undergraduate candidate must do the following:          Accept the University's offer of admission and pay the required nonrefundable  tuition deposit.         If applicable, pay the required nonrefundable housing deposit.         Have his or her high school and/or college forward a final transcript(s) to the  Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center.         File a medical report.         Make an appointment with the individual school or division for academic  advisement.         Pay balance of tuition and/or housing fees by the stipulated deadlines.     Register for classes when notified.              SPECIAL  (VISITING) STUDENTS      Undergraduate  matriculated students who are currently attending other regionally accredited  four-year colleges and maintaining good standing, both academic and  disciplinary, may be admitted on certification from their own schools. Such  students must be eligible to receive degree credit at their own schools for  courses taken at the University. The approval as a special undergraduate student  is for two terms only and cannot be extended. The Special Student Application  Form for undergraduate students may be obtained online. A $70 application fee  is required. Deadlines for applications are as follows:      Fall: August 1     Spring: December 1     Summer: April 1      All  special students must meet the regulations of the Faculty Committee on  Undergraduate Academic Standards regarding grades and program.              APPLICANTS  WITH INTERNATIONAL CREDENTIALS      Applicants  to New York University who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents of  the United States must complete the Application for Admission to Undergraduate  Study available online. Please indicate on the application for admission your  country of citizenship, and if you are currently residing in the United States,  your current visa status.          Freshman  applicants (those who are currently attending or who have previously completed  secondary school only) seeking to begin studies in the fall (September)  semester must submit applications and all required credentials on or before the  application deadline that corresponds to their selected notification plan  (November 1 for Early Decision I, and January 1 for Early Decision II and  Regular Decision). Transfer applicants (those who are currently attending or who  have previously attended university or tertiary school) must submit  applications and all required credentials on or before April 1. Transfer  candidates seeking admission for the spring (January) semester must submit  their applications and credentials on or before November 1. Applications will  not be processed until the Office of Undergraduate Admissions receives all  supporting credentials.          All  freshman applicants are required to submit official test results. Please visit  the Admissions website to learn about the admissions requirements.          If  the applicant's secondary education culminated in a maturity certificate  examination, he or she is required to submit an official copy of the grades  received in each subject. All documents submitted for review must be official;  that is, they must be either originals or copies certified by authorized  persons. A \"certified\" photocopy or other copy is one that bears either an  original signature of the registrar or other designated school officials or an  original impression of the institution's seal. Uncertified photocopies are not  acceptable. If these official documents are in a foreign language, they must be  accompanied by an official English translation.          In  addition, every applicant whose native language is not English must take the  Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English  Language Testing System (IELTS), or the Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE  Academic). Information concerning these examinations may be obtained by  visiting the website. Each student must request that his or her score on this  examination be sent to the NYU Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center, code  2562.          Applicants  residing in the New York area may elect to take the English proficiency test of  the University's American Language Institute, located at 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003. An appointment to take the test may be made by  calling 212-998-7040.          Financial  documentation is not required when filing an application. If the student is  accepted, instructions for completing the Application for Certificate of  Eligibility (AFCOE) online will be included in the acceptance packet.  Appropriate evidence of financial ability must be submitted with the AFCOE to  the Office for International Students and Scholars in order for the appropriate  visa document to be issued. If the applicant's studies are being financed by  means of his or her own savings, parental support, outside private or  government scholarships, or any combination of these, he or she must arrange to  send official letters or similar certification as proof of such support.          New  students may wish to view the multimedia tutorial for new international  students.              THE  AMERICAN LANGUAGE INSTITUTE      The American Language Institute of the School of  Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University offers intensive  courses in English for students with little or no proficiency in the language.  It also offers the Advanced Workshop Program in English for students with  substantial English proficiency but insufficient proficiency for undertaking a  full-time academic program. Qualified students in this program can often  combine English study with a part-time academic program. This combination may  constitute a full-time program of study. The institute also offers specialized  courses in accent reduction, grammar, and American business English.          Individuals  who wish to obtain additional information about the American Language Institute  are invited to visit the office of the American Language Institute weekdays throughout  the year between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. (Fridays until 5 p.m.). They  may also visit the website; contact The American Language Institute, School of  Continuing and Professional Studies, New York University, 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003; telephone: 212-998-7040; fax: 212-995-4135; or  e-mail: ali@nyu.edu .

In addition, the staff of this office endeavors to aid international students  in taking full advantage of various social, cultural, and recreational  opportunities offered by the University and the city. Specific information on  programs and events can be found at www.nyu.edu/oiss .              READMISSION  OF FORMER STUDENTS      Any  former student who has been out of attendance for more than two consecutive  terms and who wishes to return to the College must apply for readmission.  Applications for readmission are available online. (See admission application  filing deadlines above.) Requests for readmission should be received by April 1  for the summer and fall terms and November 1 for the spring term, but will be  considered after those deadlines on a space available basis.      Students  who have attended another college or university since their last attendance at  New York University must complete the regular application for transfer  admission and submit an official transcript.              SPECIAL  (POSTGRADUATE) STUDENTS      Graduates  of accredited four-year colleges, including the College of Arts and Science and  other schools of New York University, may register as special students in  undergraduate courses for which they meet the prerequisites and that are still  open after matriculated students have registered. Such a student should submit  proof of his or her degree and an application for admission as a special  postgraduate student. The application form can be obtained online.

NYU  SPRING IN NEW YORK      NYU  Spring in New York offers college students from other institutions an opportunity  to earn college credit and to experience academic life at New York University.  Spring in New York participants enroll in one of eight areas of study, in  courses with NYU students and taught by NYU faculty.          In  addition to classroom learning, NYU Spring in New York students have access to  the same opportunities and benefits as NYU students: library access, sports  center access, and program office events, including ticket discounts for  Broadway shows, concerts, and sporting events. They are also encouraged to  participate in planned excursions around the city.      The  program is offered to students currently matriculated and in good standing at  an accredited college or university (within the United States) with a  competitive grade point average. Students must have at least sophomore standing  in the academic year of participation.          Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/spring.in.ny .              NYU  JANUARY TERM      New  York University's January Term allows students more flexibility and new  scheduling options. NYU students, visiting students, and international students  have the opportunity to earn major/minor credit or explore a new interest.  During this time, students can take advantage of intensive study at one of the  foremost research and teaching universities in the United States, as well as  have a chance to enjoy New York City during a bustling and exciting time of  year.          Oftentimes,  the fall and spring semesters can be overly hectic for students, considering a  full-time course load, student club responsibilities, work, and internship  commitments. This busy time doesn't always allow the freedom to explore a new  academic interest or take advantage of the many  cultural resources that originally drew them to New York City. January Term  provides an array of courses enabling students to earn academic credit (major,  minor, or elective) in courses that are in high demand, to accelerate degree  completion, and to concentrate on personal interests.         Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/winter .              ADVANCED  STANDING      Credit  may be awarded for satisfactory work completed at another accredited college or  university. When a transfer applicant is admitted to the College, the  applicant's records are examined carefully to determine how much, if any,  advanced standing will be granted. Each individual course completed elsewhere  is evaluated. In granting advanced standing, the following are considered: the  content, complexity, and grading standards of courses taken elsewhere;  individual grades and grade averages attained by the applicant; the suitability  of courses taken elsewhere for the program of study chosen here; and the degree  of preparation that completed courses provide for more advanced study here.  Point credit toward the degree is given only for a grade of C or better and  provided that the credit fits into the selected program of study and courses  were completed within the past 10 years.          Quarter  hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits  transferable to NYU. Credits based on semester hours will be transferred at  face value to NYU.          As  with all other students, transfer students are required to fulfill the  residency requirement. All degree candidates are subject to the following  residency requirement: They must complete at least 64 consecutive points of  course work in residence at the College immediately preceding the date of  graduation and are permitted to transfer a maximum of 64 credits to NYU.          A  tentative statement of advanced standing is provided to each transfer student  upon notification of admission to the College. A final statement of advanced  standing is provided during the student's first semester of matriculation.  Requests for reevaluation of transfer credit must be made within the semester  during which the final statement of advanced standing is received. Thereafter,  a student's advanced standing credits may be changed only with the written  permission of the Office of the Dean.              CREDIT  BY EXAMINATION (INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL MATURITY EXAMS)      The  Advanced Placement (AP) Program (College Entrance Examination Board), the  International Baccalaureate (IB) Program, and the results of some foreign  maturity certificate examinations enable undergraduate students to receive  credit toward the bachelor's degree on the basis of performance in  college-level examinations or proficiency examinations related to the College's  degree requirements, subject to the approval of the College.          The  maximum number of credits allowed toward the degree requirements of the College  that are a result of any possible combination of nonresident special  examination programs (plus previous coursework, if applicable and approved)  shall not exceed a total of 32.          International  Baccalaureate (IB)      The  College recognizes, for advanced standing credit, higher-level examinations  passed with grades of 6 or 7. No credit is granted for standard-level  examinations. Official reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate  Admissions Processing Center for review. See the chart below concerning those  IB test scores for which credit is given.         Maturity  Certificate Examinations          The College will consider the results of certain foreign  maturity certificate examinations for advanced standing credit. They are:      A Levels and Cambridge Pre-U     Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at     German Abitur     Italian Maturit\u00e0 Federal Swiss Maturity Certificate (Matura)      CAS  does not award credit for any other maturity certificate examinations.          Official  reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate Admissions Processing  Center. These documents will be added to the student record, but advanced  standing credit for all examinations other than AP and IB will be awarded by  the College Advising Center, Silver 905; 212-998-8130.      See  the chart below for details on those A Level and Cambridge Pre-U test scores  for which credit is given. For the other maturity examinations, please note  that not every subject is awarded credit by the College. Creditworthy results  earn 8 points each (except for the Italian Maturit\u00e0, which is 4 points).          Minimum  scores for receiving credit are:      A Levels: B     Cambridge Pre-U: M2     CAPE: II (out of VII)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at: 12 (out of 20) with coefficient of 5 or better     German Abitur: 10 (out of 15). Credit is only awarded for written exams  (schr.), not for oral (mdl.)     Italian Maturit\u00e0: 7 (out of 10)     Swiss Matura: 4.5 (out of 6)              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT PROGRAM      The College participates in the Advanced Placement (AP)  Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. In accordance with New York  University policy, students may receive college credit toward their degree for  test results of 5 or 4, depending on the subject examination. Students  receiving credit toward their degree may not take the corresponding  college-level course for credit. If they do, they will lose the AP credit. See  the chart below concerning those AP test scores for which credit is given. The  chart also lists those tests for which College Core Curriculum equivalencies  are granted.          For  additional information, students should consult the Office of Undergraduate  Admissions online or by telephone at 212-998-4500.              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT CREDIT AND THE COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM      Note: a 4 or 5 on any foreign  language AP satisfies the Core language requirement. Note: the College also accepts a score of 5 (not 4) on the Russian Language and Culture Prototype AP examination for exemption from the foreign language requirement, but no credit is awarded and the score cannot be used for placement; scores of 4 or lower likewise award no credit and have no bearing on placement.

Terracottas figurines with representations of musicians are a privileged field of investigation in understanding the importance of music in both its production and performative contexts. Figurines of male and female musicians are emblematic of the close link between musical practice and the sacred and ritual spheres. They contribute not only to the reconstruction of what music and the production of music meant for ancient societies, but also provide information concerning the relationship of performance to the deities, and about which musical instruments were best suited to the particulars of diverse ritual occasions, including sacred and funerary contexts.    The analysis of terracotta figurines will take into account the presence and characteristics of different musical instruments, gestures, positions, and the clothing of both male and female musicians. The goal is to understand the status of the musicians and to interpret their musical and symbolic significance. Additionally, the terracottas will be analyzed in relation to the development of musical culture and their wider historical and social context.    These topics will be addressed through contributions by scholars working in various fields: archaeology, art history, musicology, history of religion, and anthropology.

This rythmical sung and ritual cursus can be highlighted in the reading of a \u00abpartheneion\u00bb song composed by the poet Alcman in Sparta and performed by a choral group of young women.

They provide excellent information on the shape and construction technique of these instruments. Their archaeological context are unknown and their function and meaning unclear: they may have been dedicated to the gods by musician votaries wishing to leave their mark; or by non musicians, in order to perpetuate the celebration of rituals accompanied by such musical instruments.     Most of these plaques, obtained from one mold pressed on the fresh clay, depict the figures seen in profile, in conformity with standard Mesopotamian iconography. A smaller group, however, show a figure seen en face, a common visual device for the depiction of supra human, magical figures. Not only is the head, but the whole body is presented in front view, each leg extending outwards, knees flexed, boldly displaying the sexual parts. The proportions of the different components of the body, the overlarge large head, the shortened, distorted legs, are diagnostic traits of nanism, or dwarfs, who are rumored in popular belief to possess extra natural sexual power. In the visual arts of the ancient world, these traits have been borrowed for the depiction of such fantastic figures as the wild man Humbaba in Mesopotamia, Bes in Egypt and the Levant, Gorgon in Greece. A significant number of these terracotta dwarf figures of Mesopotamia and Elam are musicians: they are engaged in playing a lute, while their bent legs are shown to represent a dancing movement, an illustration of the Biblical passage where David danced before the Ark, flexing his knees (II Samuel 6, 15).     These dwarf figures are early illustration of the ambiguous status, both positive and repulsive enjoyed by music and musicians in the ancient world, examples of which are to be found in later grotesque musician figures from the Graeco-Roman world.

They came to the attention of European archeologists Sven Hedin and Aurel Stein at the turn of the twentieth century, during their explorations of the southern oases of the Tarim basin. Most often exposed by the spring floods from the archeological layers of what had been the capital of the kingdom, Yotkan, and sold by local peddlers in the bazaar, some of these figures may once have served ritualistic functions, particularly in the case of monkeys engaged in explicit sexual games, and those playing various musical instruments (several types of drums, short-necked lutes, and panpipes).      This paper argues that, while actual monkeys were never found in the Tarim basin, the musical dimension of these small figurines strengthens the existing theory that the Khotan terracottas have a direct correspondence to Gandharan art, the Hellenistic-Buddhist synthesis created early in the first millennium CE in the cultural spheres of the Kushan Empire. On the one hand, the monkey motif seems to relate to Buddhist Jakata stories, hence harkening back to a possible Indian origin. On the other hand, most of the musical instruments these protagonists handle, particularly the short-necked lute and certain types of drums, are characteristic not of the Indian, but the Gandharan musical repertoire disseminated throughout the Kushan empire. As such, &ldquo;the monkeys of Yotkan&rdquo; stand witness to the intense cultural cosmopolitanism that marked the history of the Tarim basin in the first part of the millennium CE.   Gabriela Currie is Associate Professor of Musicology at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Her research interests encompass a broad range of subjects including medieval music thought in the Latin, Byzantine, and Islamic worlds; the intersection of music, religion, philosophy, science, and visual arts in pre- and early-modern European cultures; and pre- and early-modern Byzantine and Eurasian music iconography. She is the author of The Play of Meanings: Aribo's De musica and the Hermeneutics of Musical Thought and of numerous articles that appeared in scholarly journals as well as edited collections. Current work includes a monograph study on mathematics, natural philosophy, theories of sound, and musical cosmologies at the crossroads of late scholastic thought; and several projects under the theoretical umbrella of pre-modern global intersections and patterns of Eurasian intercultural exchange.

It was situated in Ionian region in antiquity. The establishment of the sanctuary lays back to 13th century BC and it was used continuously up to the late Roman period. The sanctuary which was dedicated to Apollo, the god of oracle, had received in large quantities of figurines as votive offerings from Sub-Mycenean Period until Hellenistic Period. Among those figurines, the representations carrying stringed instruments on the left hand have a special importance. The so-called instruments are called lyra, kithara and barbitos. On the other hand, the figurine groups which are serial productions reflect a stylistic progress within themselves. Eventually, they should have an important role in the cult activies of the sanctuary from the second half of the 6th century BC to the Hellenistic period. The three instruments which differ from each other by means of their function and structure indicate the different cults as well. In this study, the icongraphic and stilistic meanings of the figurines will be discussed, the difference of the instruments will be displayed and the functions of the figurines in the context of the sanctuary will be examined.

It is our intention to study them keeping in mind three issues. First, we will describe the instruments represented and the body gestures that entail the practice of performing music with certain instruments. Secondly, we will contextualise them (chronology and place of finding) to offer a comprehensive approach in order to shed some light into both the presence of music in rituals and their possible use when performing rites. Thirdly, we want to recall our attention to their gender as they are mostly feminine. We will argue that playing music is an empowerment activity for some Phoenician and Punic women.

These female musicians with big almond-shaped eyes are nude or half-nude, show their long curled hair and wear most often jewellery. When the lower body and the legs are preserved, the figurines&rsquo; decorated girdles can be seen and their multiple anklets that are supposed to accentuate the rhythm of the drums by a dancing gesture. The pubic region is strongly emphasized. The female musicians are typologically identical, but their concrete appearance and the quality of the clay differ. To the south of the Rabbath-Ammon region (Wadi ath-Thamad, Karak) similar or identical female musicians have been found that were attached on both sides of the entrance of ceramic shrine models. This fact proves the cultic function of these figurines. Their significance has still to be explained, yet, it is highly probable that they were linked to the cult of the god El.

Although flying Nikai and Erotes are among the most popular terracottas in the late Classical and Hellenistic period, this particular class of statuettes has not received closer attention. Since most are found in tombs, the paper will examine how the figure of Eros as a musician operates within the general framework of depictions of musical performance and dance in a funerary context.     Kyriaki Karoglou is Assistant Curator of Greek and Roman Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Previously, she hold internships at the Getty Museum, The Princeton Art Museum, and the Athens Acropolis Museum and participated in numerous excavations and surveys in the Mediterranean.

The Moche inhabited the north coast of Peru during the Andean Early Intermediate Period (0 - 700 A.D). One of the most distinctive features of Moche ritual pottery is the depiction of highly ranked individuals usually described as priests, warriors, deities and supernatural beings. They are mainly present in Middle Moche Period vessels (100 \u2013 400 A.D) which were probably produced in a context of deep social and political transformation. Supposedly, a time marked by the rise of some of the southern moche valley&rsquo;s elites. It was precisely during this period that a large amount of musicians, playing a great variety of sound instruments, were recurrently depicted in artifacts such as figurines, whistles, stirrup spout bottles and jars. Interestingly, in many cases, they appear carrying the same power attributes of high status individuals or garments of important supernatural beings. The similarity of the attributes carried by musicians and empowered individuals are easily recognized in the iconography of the ceramic archaeological vessels or in funerary contexts.     Detailed iconographic analysis shows us that the musicians are present in most of the important ritual and political themes of the Moche iconography. They seem to maintain a very close relationship with the protagonists of the visual narratives of the moche world, such as the Presentation Theme , the Bicephalus Arch Theme , The Burial Theme , etc.\u00a0 In this communication we intend to present iconographic data showing musicians who play panpipes, drums and rattles, comparing them to highly ranked characters depicted Moche art, in order to identify the instrument players&rsquo; respective social roles in Moche society.          Daniela La Chioma Silvestre Villalva is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Archaeology of the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. She holds a graduation in History (2007) and a Master&rsquo;s in Archaeology (2012) in the same University, in the area of Pre-Columbian Studies, namely Andean Art and Archaeology. Her research focuses on iconographic representations of sound, music and its players in Andean Art, emphasizing their social, political and religious roles and the symbolic meaning of the instruments in Andean and Amerindian cosmovisions. One of the iconographic analysis of Nasca musicians turned into a chapter in Stockli &amp; Both&rsquo;s &ldquo;Flower World: Music Archaeology of the Americas \u2013 Volume II&rdquo; (2013), published in Berlin. In her PHd research she is currently studying the political-religious roles of musicians in the northern coast of Peru, specifically in the Middle Moche period, based on a databank of more than 800 images of musicians, all depicted in Moche pottery. She has been doing fieldwork in Peruvian archaeological projects and studies of Peruvian Museum&rsquo;s collections since 2007, as well as participating in Seminars and Conferences in Brazil, Europe and Peru.

All these architectural terracottas present a similar iconography: a banquet of reclining banqueters entertained by standing musicians and dancers who face those being entertained. These motifs are associated with clay representations of military themes, such as soldiers standing or on horseback, an iconography that finds its origins in Greek and Near Eastern terracottas from the Orientalizing period (720 \u2013 580 BCE). These were widely disseminated in the Mediterranean and found fertile ground in Etruria, which became the main recipient of Greek culture in all its different forms in Italy.      The purpose of this paper is to investigate the forms and the loci where these representations appeared in Etruscan culture. Through comparisons with paintings found in the associated necropoleis, the prevalent forms in which the theme was diffused will be shown, along with the role of musicians in Etruscan culture, identifying the continuity and the differences in respect to the Greek models.      Ultimately, this highlights how the representations of musicians were absorbed by Etruscans in the late Orientalizing period and affirmed in the Archaic period. Yet this will also show how the Etruscans, even with their propensity for the imitation of Greek models, unconsciously made changes to the theme of the musician due to their different cultural background.

Terracotta Lyre-Players in Etruscan Votive Deposits                This paper discusses terracotta figurines of the Hellenistic period representing lyre-players in southern Etruria, with special regard given to the sacred contexts where they were found. At Caere, lyre-players alone or with accompanying auloi-players are at times represented in connection with scenes of sacrifice and goddesses; in these cases the musicians are presumably to be interpreted as human assistants taking part in a ritual context. It is worth noting that according to the classical literary sources the Etruscans accompanied every such activity with music. In other cases, single figures of lyre-players have been interpreted as representations of Apollo. The variant representing a nude youth holding a lyre in his left hand and a pick in his right is widespread in Veii, Falerii (a seated version appears at Santa Marinella), and a less common type wearing a mantle on his hips and a bulla is known at Caere and Vulci. One might wonder whether these figurines always represent the god, or at times show worshippers as musicians, possibly assimilated to Apollo himself. Moreover, other visual sources show that the lyre was also considered a tool for divination in Etruria, fit for mythological prophets. It is therefore possible that in votive contexts such figurines allude to local divinatory practices. Finally, the paper will briefly address the occurrence of terracotta figurines representing turtles in Etruria, often in connection with cults of Apollo, as at Pyrgi and Veii. Scholars usually consider this animal associated with Greek female deities, and in particular Aphrodite. It is more likely, however, that the dedication of terracotta turtles in Etruria alluded to the myth of the invention of the lyre which involved Apollo and Hermes, considering the finding of turtle-shells among votive offerings in Etruscan tombs and sacred places.

Towards the end of the second millennium BC, Cyprus seems to have suffered less from the crisis that swept most other regions in the Eastern Mediterranean. Thus, the island retained its centrality in sea-routes and cultural exchange networks, particularly with the West, as well as a high degree of continuity in institutions, economy and religion. Cypriot musical culture also remained prosperous; coroplastic products dating to the Early Iron Age, in particular, provide rare insights into an early horizon of musical activity in a period when other Mediterranean cultures were experiencing a &ldquo;Dark Age&rdquo;, or the initial recovery from it.    The present paper provides an overview of Cypro-Geometric and Cypro-Archaic coroplastic (and other) representations of musical performance, exploring the different types of musicians, musical instruments, playing techniques and contexts of music making. A special focus is placed on the continuities and discontinuities from the Bronze Age, the connections to the contemporary East and West, and the intertwining of musical practices with war, the human body and the supernatural. Overall, Cypriot musical practices are placed in the wider context of strategies for the construction of social identities and the legitimation of political authority in the formative period of the historic kingdoms of Cyprus     Manolis Mikrakis is a lecturer in Ancient and Medieval Art at the School of Architecture, National Technical University of Athens. He has collaborated on archaeological excavations in the Aegean and Cyprus as well as in the development of exhibitions focusing on Aegean interactions with the Eastern Mediterranean. After studying Archaeology, History of Art and Ancient History at the Universities of Athens, Vienna and Cambridge, he received his PhD in Classical Archaeology from the University of Heidelberg in 2006 with a thesis on Bronze Age and Early Iron Age representations of musical instruments in the Aegean and Cyprus. For his research, he received grants from the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, and the Society of the Friends of Music, Athens. His publications are focused on the late second and early first millennium BC cultures of the Aegean and Cyprus, their interactions with Egypt and the Near East, and the role of music and related practices of performance and feasting in these cultures. Manolis has also been active in the field of digital cultural heritage, working for the Directorate of the National Archive of Monuments at the Greek Ministry of Culture and for the Department of Antiquities, Cyprus on the development of information systems for the digitization of antiquities.

Beneath this arc of fruit and musical instruments, a female figure and the goat-god Pan prance together over rocky ground. She holds a cornucopia laden with cakes and produce of the earth. He clasps a volute crater of impressive dimension laden, no doubt, with wine. Why did the artisan include the musical instruments in an image that was to be cast in clay, mechanically, over and over again, in order to provide the residents of Metaponto with affordable terracotta reliefs to serve as votive gifts to the deities whose shrines punctuated the urban and rural landscape of this Italiote city-state in late fourth and early third centuries BCE?           In formulating a response to this question, attention focuses first on the possible significance of the musical instruments within the pictorial narrative of the dancing couple represented in the terracotta plaques and then moves on to an examination of the varied contexts of public and private rite where the plaques were employed by the local population. Consideration is given to not only how the reliefs themselves served as instruments in the performance of a ritual act, but also how their imagery may allude to (1) the performance of other rites and (2) associated mythic narratives within the context of the cults where the plaques served a religious purpose.\u00a0 An investigation of the larger system of ritual acts and underlying myths casts penetrating light on the deeper meaning of the tympanon and syrinx at Metaponto and may better illuminate the local artisan&rsquo;s motives for fashioning the musical instruments in the midst of a grape arbor that shades a mythic dancing floor.

BCE         Lipara, on the the largest of the Aeolian islands, settled in c. 580 BCE by colonists from Cyprus and Rhodes, was the last among the Sicilian apoikiai to be founded. Thanks to the work of Luigi Bernab\u00f2 Brea and Madeleine Cavalier, who extensively surveyed and excavated the island after World War II, this polis has become one of the most studied among the Western Greek colonies, and one of the most important sites for Mediterranean prehistory and protohistory. In addition to significant examples of figured pottery, important findings from the Liparean necropolis at contrada Diana include miniature clay theatrical masks and statuettes directly inspired by theatrical performances. These are unique in the ancient world for their quantity and quality. Among the burial goods from Lipara, the subject matter of the theatrical votive coroplastic objects can often be identified, and in some cases, especially for the tragic masks, linked to a specific drama. This raises important questions about the nature of the theatrical performances that took place in Lipari in the fourth to third centuries BCE. Furthermore, the excavations by Bernab\u00f2 Brea and Cavalier near contrada Diana uncovered the remains of a suburban sanctuary, which they tentatively attributed to Demeter and Kore. The votive pits found there revealed a large number of terracottas related to theater, as well as a large quantity of pottery bearing religious subjects. Among these are many thousands of votive pinakes depicting female figures holding or playing both aulos and tympanon. These pinakes, together with the other terracottas and figured pottery with musical subject from Contrada Diana, raise the question of what type of music was performed in the small but thriving Doric colony of Lipara, which, as a firm ally of Syracuse and strategically located for control of the straits of Messina, twice resisted attack by the Athenian fleet during the Peloponnesian War.     Alessandro Pagliara received his qualification as professor of ancient history in 2012. He teaches Roman history at Tuscia University, Viterbo, and history of Sicily and Magna Graecia at the American University of Rome. He is currently working as a research scholar for Sapienza University in Rome on a project involving ancient theater. Having received his degree in Greek history in 1993 from Sapienza, he went on to earn a Ph.D. in ancient history in 2000 from the University of Perugia and another in ancient, medieval, and Renaissance studies in 2012 from the Italian Institute of Human Sciences in Florence. He has collaborated with Luigi Bernab\u00f2 Brea and the Regional Aeolian Archeological Museum of Lipari (1993-1999), and has been teaching and/or researching at the universities of Macerata (2000-2008), Sydney (2005), Columbia, NYU (2005), Roma Tre (2009-2011), and Turin (2012-2014).

Ancient Near Eastern Clay Plaques Displaying Musicians and their Socio-Cultural Role       Considering the importance of music in the Ancient Near East, archaeological and textual remains help to visualize the manifold aspects of musical life in both private and public domains, as well as in the secular and religious-cultural realms. Musicians and singers (Sumerian NAR, Akkadian n\u00e2ru ) were in the service of the palace or temple and played an important role in the oral transmission of literary texts, including epics, hymns, or prayers. This paper will address the wide range of the musicians&rsquo; social status including the privileged royal singers as well as the less privileged musicians of temple households and those living at the fringes of society.      Observations made thanks to the rich textual evidence of the ancient Near East from the third to the first millennium BCE will be compared with and linked to the information drawn from the archaeological artifacts themselves. This paper will specifically focus on the numerous ancient Near Eastern clay plaques, some of which show musicians together with animals that have been interpreted as an allegory for unprofitable art. Special emphasis will be given to musicians represented as, and together with, monkeys, a topos with a long literary tradition in Mesopotamia that has provoked a number of modern interpretations. The image of the &ldquo;poor musician&rdquo; is also reflected in the cuneiform sources drawn from different literary genres, which provide a fascinating insight into the lives of less privileged musicians and singers. Apart from their functional properties in everyday life, this paper will address more closely the social positions of singers in ancient Near Eastern society including their organization and relationship to other professional groups.

While many Classical terracotta figurines represent musicians playing idiophones, such as crotals or castanets, the presence of the Greco-Roman sistrum seems very specific. It appears in the coroplastical repertoire as an exclusively divine attribute, never played by a human being, unlike other instruments such as the harp or the aulos. However, archeological data (about 200 objects or amulets) has confirmed that the sistrum, derived from a Pharaonic prototype, was a real and audible item used by individuals in Isiac ceremonies during the Hellenistic and Roman periods.      It is of interest to note that no word in ancient Greek or Latin refers to a &ldquo;sistrum player&rdquo; as a musician. The latter is more often named as a &ldquo;sistrum holder.&rdquo; Yet, is this individual a musician, a priest, or a simple devotee? The coroplastic corpus only presents a specific vision of it in the domestic context\u2014a part of Isis&rsquo; image\u2014but it is not sufficient to understand the sistrum as a musical instrument in ancient society.      An exploration of other types of sources is clearly necessary to understand the status of the sistrum player and his perception by Greco-Roman society. Without being a musical instrument per se, the sistrum embodies a dimension of sound that exceeds the simple reproduction of the Goddess&rsquo;s image. According to iconographic and literary sources, the object seems rather to be understood more as a marker of identity than as a normal instrument.     Arnaud Saura-Ziegelmeyer is currently a Ph.D. student in Sciences de l\u2019Antiquit\u00e9 (supervised by Pr. Laurent Bricault) at the University of Toulouse Jean Jaur\u00e8s, where he has studied history and sociology. He also studied musicology at the Regional Conservatory of Toulouse. His thesis focuses on the Isiac sistrum, an idiophone used in the Greco-Roman world during the ceremonies of Isis, goddess native of Egypt. For this purpose, the typology and organology of this instrument, its meanings, and its ancient and modern interpretations are all taken into account. More generally, his researches focus on ancient music, but also on the links between antiquity and eighteenth to twentieth centuries musical history.

In the National Archaeological Museum in Athens are housed terracotta figurines of musicians from Attica, Euboea, Boeotia and various regions in Greece as well as from the site of ancient Myrina in western Asia Minor, modern Turkey. Examples include Eros figurines with lyres or cymbals, female figurines with harps, kitharas, tambourines and other. They are dated in the late Classical and Hellenistic periods. These figurines can be studied in a number of ways. Their connection to graves or sanctuaries underscores popular religious beliefs and occasionally illustrates stories from myth. Their study also helps us gain insights into the standard types of string, wind and percussion musical instruments used in various regions in these periods, as well as of garment types preferred to by figures of divine or mortal musicians.      In this poster a first presentation of some figurine types found in central Greece and Asia Minor grouped per site contexts and musical instruments will be attempted with the purpose of gaining information on aspects of music as performed and enjoyed by the ancients, especially as part of cultic and communal activities. Excavation and site information will be supplied, where available, to help distinguish types of figurines found in graves, sanctuaries or domestic spaces. A final part of the presentation will focus on aspects of music education in antiquity. This subject is illustrated, among other instances, by a number of terracotta figurine groups of the National Archaeological Museum that were found in graves in Euboea and other Greek sites.      As a whole this presentation aims at a first selective examination of terracotta figurine types of musicians found in central Greece and parts of Asia Minor that are dated from the late 4th to the early 1st century BC.     Maria Chidiroglou was born in Istanbul, Turkey. She is an archaeologist of the Greek Archaeological Service since 1994. She holds a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree on History and Archaeology from the University of Athens and a Ph.D. degree from the same University. Her Ph.D. thesis &ldquo;Ancient Karystia in Euboea \u2013 A contribution to the history and archaeology of the region from Geometric to Roman Imperial times&rdquo; is a synopsis of data gathered during salvage excavations and survey work she conducted in southern Euboea in the years from 1994 to 2005, when she worked in the relevant Ephorate of Antiquities. From 2005 to 2010 she worked in the Department of Archaeological Sites, Monuments and Archaeological Research of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture in Athens. As of 2010 she works in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens.      Her main research interests include terracotta figurines, pottery of the Archaic to the Hellenistic period and topographical issues of the ancient cities of Euboea. She has participated (2005-2015) in a number of joint Archaeological Research Programs in Southern Euboea. She has presented papers in Greek, English and French in a number of Archaeological Conferences in Greece and abroad (Italy, France, Turkey and Austria) and published articles in journals and Conference Proceedings on archaeological finds of Euboea, including articles on terracotta figurines in the National Archaeological Museum.

Despite the significance of Phrygian music, it is known almost entirely through Greek and Roman texts and iconography, which give the impression that the aulos was preferred to such an extent that stringed instruments were excluded. The archaeological discovery of tortoise shell lyres in a house from the first quarter of the 7th century B.C.E. at the Phrygian capital Gordion clarifies the sound and instrumentation of music in Phrygia. Stone figurines in related contexts prompt the further conclusion that lyres accompanied domestic worship of the goddess Matar, the Phrygian predecessor of Cybele. More finds of lyre fragments in residential zones of the site suggest that the household was a key environment for musical development in Phrygia. In comparison to the common mold-made figurine type of Cybele with a tympanum, which is known from a house at Gordion during the Hellenistic period, we may infer some continuity of domestic music ritual for Cybele at Gordion despite changes in instrumentation and the materiality of figurines over a 500-year period.             Sam Holzman is a graduate student in the Ph.D. program in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World (AAMW) at the University of Pennsylvania.

These are statuettes featuring a woman playing the aulos or tympanon, as well as small pinakes with three standing figures, often interpreted as nymphs, also portrayed in the act of playing an instrument. The circumstances of the discovery of a number of these terracottas remain unknown. Their assumed origin from the ancient town of Adranon is likely but not certain.      There is only one pinax coming from a sufficiently documented context. It was part of a votive deposit related to the cult of Demeter and Kore found, between December 1913 and January 1914, in the courtyard of the former Monastery of Jesus and Mary near the main square of the modern town. This pinax is now in the Paolo Orsi Regional Archaeological Museum in Syracuse.      Finally, another related group of terracottas comes from excavations carried out in recent decades in the area of the ancient settlement itself. This set of materials provides the most interesting information towards a proper contextualization of the terracottas as a whole.      This poster is therefore aimed at updating scholarship on the Adranon terracotta corpus, presenting some unpublished samples coming from the excavations of 1995. At the same time, analyzing the known and supposed contexts of discovery, one can establish the possible relationships between this class of terracotta figurines and the cults practiced at ancient Adranon.           Gioconda Lamagna began her career at the Archaeological Superintendency of Salerno, Avellino, and Benevento, dealing with the protection and the investigation of several Samnite centers, including ancient Caudium.After being transferred to the Cultural Heritage Superintendency of Catania, she was in charge of managing the regional museum of Adrano for many years, including its recent, new installation.During her years at the Superintendency of Catania she has also dealt with the protection and the scientific investigation of several sites in the province of Catania, supervising excavation campaigns in the Simeto valley (Greek city of Adranon, archaic indigenous centres of Mendolito, and Civita di Paternt) and in the Caltagirone area (Caltagirone, Monte Balchino, Piano dei Casazzi).She has taken part in various scientific seminars\u2014both at the national and the international level\u2014publishing extensively in scientific journals. She has also participated in multimedia publications, promoting also the realization of the official website for Adrano's regional museum.

This iconography may be interpreted as a female musician, similar to those who, playing the tympanum, the aulos, or the cymbals, took part in the rites honoring the goddess Cybele that were widespread in ancient Italy. According to the myth, it was Dionysus himself who invented this musical instrument, in order to produce ecstasy in those who danced at its rhythm. The tympanum was used along with the cymbals in the cult of the Magna Mater. Important attestations come from the sanctuary of Bitalemi, at Gela, from that of Malophoros, at Selinunte, and from the Palatine. The cult of Cybele was likely present also at Elea. To understand the importance of the tympanum in these rites, the ancient literary sources are helpful, as is Catullus ( Carmina docta , 63). It appears that both tympanum and cymbals were instrumental in giving a Dionysian character to these rites. In particular, the Hellenistic clay figurines attest that the words of ancient authors are correct in stating that the tympanum was the &ldquo;instrument of ecstasy&rdquo; par excellence.
