Continuing in the tradition of artists such as Marvin Gaye, Billie Holiday, and Tupac Shakur, the Suite paints a musical picture of the current state of social inequality and injustice in the United States.   Centered in the belief that there is a soundtrack to every revolution, the vision for this piece is that it will foster dialogue on social justice issues throughout the world, contribute to the powerful growing movement on behalf of black lives around the country, and empower all people\u2013especially youth\u2014to make their voices heard.
