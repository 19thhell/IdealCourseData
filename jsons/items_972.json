This guide may also be helpful for those looking to connect their research in other disciplines to the study of religion as a social scientific category.   Need More Info? Please see the above tabs for more information about various information and resources. Specific information is provided about the major approaches to religion&mdash;just select one of the approaches from the dropdown menu labeled \"Approaches to Religion.\" You'll also find information about important dictionaries and encyclopedias, indexes, and browsable journals, as well tips for finding books and some suggestions for further reading.   Development of 'Religion' &ldquo;Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion&rdquo; traces the development of the study of the phenomenon of religion as a social scientific category, from the Enlightenment to more contemporary approaches. Similarly, this research guide will provide resources to some of the most important themes, theories, and methods that have shaped the way religion has been understood and interpreted as an object of study in the West. Such frameworks include sociological, psychological, anthropological, and phenomenological approaches.    Defining and Redefining The course&mdash;along with much scholarship on religion in the secular academy&mdash;proceeds from the assumption that religion is not a static entity with a universal definition, but rather is a term born of comparison and study, and one that is open to frequent reinterpretation, contestation, and redefinition. In his essay, &ldquo;Religion, Religions, Religious,&rdquo; eminent scholar Jonathan Z. Smith provides a history of the many ways in which the term \"religion&rdquo; has been defined and redefined. This essay can be found in Critical Terms for Religious Studies , edited by Mark Taylor, available both as an online reference material and as a physical book.

The anthropology of religion has often centered on those sociocultural elements that are frequently identified as religious: myths, rituals, magic, beliefs about gods and divine beings, taboos, and symbols.   Introducing the Anthropology of Religion The history and theory of a number of movements in the anthropology of religion&mdash;including the theories of Marx, Freud, Weber, and Durkheim&mdash;are detailed in Brian Morris &rsquo;s Anthropological Studies of Religion: An Introductory Text . It may be useful to investigate writings by some of the other major anthropologists of religion that Morris discusses in his book, including Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss , who critiqued studies of totemism and developed theories of myth; E.E. Evans-Pritchard , who argued that &ldquo;religion&rdquo; could not be understood apart from its social milieu; Mary Douglas , who discussed the ways in which cleanliness and uncleanliness reflected the structure of a culture; and Victor Turner , who developed famous theories about the ways in which rites of passage help to regulate cultures. Other introductory texts in anthropology of religion include Fiona Bowie 's The Anthropology of Religion: An Introduction and Michael Lambeck 's A Reader in the Anthropology of Religion .   Religion as an Anthropological Category In the early 1970s, noted anthropologist Clifford Geertz used symbolic anthropology and his own interpretive anthropological method to develop what he considered to be a universal theory of religion. Some twenty years later, anthropologist Talal Asad famously critiqued Geertz&rsquo;s theory, and further declared that because &ldquo;religion&rdquo; itself is a product of specific Western discourses, there can be no transhistorical, transcultural definition of a sui generis phenomena called &ldquo;religion.&rdquo; This view is widely held by secular scholars of religion today.   Critique of Ritual Theory Another highly notable critique, Catherine Bell &rsquo;s Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice , proposed the discarding of &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; as a unique phenomenon, sugggesting instead that &ldquo;rituals&rdquo;&mdash;and, logically, &ldquo;religions&rdquo;&mdash;be considered instead as part of the wider continuum of human discourses and practices. In developing her own theory of embodied, \"ritualized\" human behavior, Bell drew upon a number of important social theorists, including Pierre Bourdieu and Michel Foucault . Bell&rsquo;s work is one of the most significant attempts to bridge the gap between &ldquo;reductive&rdquo; social and anthropological approaches, and approaches that attempt to take &ldquo;religious&rdquo; or &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; phenomena on their own terms.

The approach considers religion to be an irreducible phenomenon existing transculturally and transhistorically.   Early Thinkers One of the progenitors of this approach was German Protestant theologian Friederich Schleiermacher . In the early nineteenth century, Schleiermacher argued in a series of speeches that religion was best understood as a kind of sensory awareness of the infinitude of being. Later in the nineteenth century, philosopher and psychologist William James argued that religion was an irreducible phenomenon&mdash;that there was such a thing as &ldquo;religion as such&rdquo; of which Christianity was a manifestation. For James, religious experiences involve a shift in consciousness&mdash;a shift for which James fully allows the possibility of supernatural involvement. In the twentieth century, Protestant theologian Rudolf Otto developed a phenomenological theory in The Idea of the Holy (1917). Otto identified a sensory experience of something he called &ldquo;the numinous&rdquo;&mdash;an awestruck feeling of the &ldquo;wholly other&rdquo;&mdash;as the basis for not just Christian, but all religious, belief and practice.   Mircea Eliade and the 'Sacred' Arguably the most significant figure in the phenomenological approach is Mircea Eliade , who in such works as The Sacred and the Profane identified a transcultural, transhistorical &ldquo;sacred&rdquo; to which humans seek to connect themselves in creating and practicing religions. Part of what later scholars have critiqued in Eliade&rsquo;s work is his identification of &ldquo;the sacred&rdquo; as a kind of independent variable&mdash;unchanging and timeless even though manifest in completely different times and cultures. Other Eliade works of note include The Myth of the Eternal Return and Patterns in Comparative Religion .   Critiques of the Approach Scholar Richard King offers an important critique of the phenomenological school of thought. In Orientalism and Religion , King draws upon Edward Said, Christian church history, and his own scholarship on India to connect the idea of mysticism to a distinctly Western and colonial genealogy. Following Said, King warns against seeing the &ldquo;mystic East&rdquo; as a site of a purer &ldquo;spirituality,&rdquo; and in so doing exhorts the discipline of religious studies to be more self-reflexive about its heritage and assumptions. In Religious Experience , Wayne Proudfoot critiques Schleiermacher&rsquo;s theories, in particular the idea that there could be such a thing as a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; religious experience or language that is unmediated by cultural circumstances.

Comments (0)                                         Psychological Approach                 The psychology of religion emerged as a discipline in the nineteenth century, just as various other approaches to religion as an object of study were similarly gaining traction. While other theorists (such as Marx, Durkheim, and Weber) were interested in religion as a social phenomenon, the primary focus of the psychological approach to religion is the way in which religion operates in the mind of the individual .   Freud: Religion and Psychoanalysis The major figure in this approach is, of course, Sigmund Freud , who followed Enlightenment patterns in mapping religion as a kind of &ldquo;neurosis,&rdquo; a &ldquo;primitive,&rdquo; deeply unconscious impulse reflecting humans&rsquo; buried fears and anxieties. Freud lays out this psychoanalytic philosophy of religion in Future of an Illusion . In this critique, Freud discusses his view of the function of civilization as well as the need for humanity to rid itself of the &ldquo;neurotic illusion&rdquo; of religion, and thus to bring itself to greater psychological health. Freud&rsquo;s other important works on religion include Civilization and Its Discontents , Moses and Monotheism , and Totem and Taboo .   Other Psychological Approaches Another major figure in the psychology of religion is William James , who took a much more sympathetic view of religious phenomena. James focused on the primacy of the role that \"religious experience\" plays in the mind of the believer or convert. (See the Phenomenological tab for more information on James.) Another important thinker, Carl Jung , had been a disciple of Freud's but took a sharply different direction, arguing that religious experience could play a positive role in human psychological health. Many scholars consider Jung's work to be theological in its own right; as such, he was influential upon the thought of noted phenomenologist of religion Mircea Eliade (see the Phenomenological tab for more information on Eliade). Humanistic psychology and religion were brought together by such thinkers as Viktor Frankl and Abraham Maslow , both of whom sought to find ways in which religion provided meaning and growth for the individual. Moreover, a number of psychoanalytic thinkers who followed Freud, such as Erik Erikson , wrote about the ways in which they saw religion as fostering human development and psychological health.

Sociologists have sought to deduce the social basis for beliefs and practices determined to be religious; religion, according to this approach, is taken to be a primarily social, rather than theological or psychological, phenomenon. This approach would later come under strong critique from theologians, anthropologists, and phenomenologists (among others) for its explanation of religion in strictly social terms.   Marx's Dialectics Marx &mdash;drawing on some of the views of his contemporary, Ludwig Feuerbach, and Romantic philosophers such as Hegel&mdash;saw religion as a force that alienated human beings from their truest nature, causing them to give to gods what they should be giving to themselves. He viewed religion as part of the larger struggle for human beings to liberate themselves from various forms of social bonds, and saw religion disappearing as the ideologies (or &ldquo;false consciousness&rdquo;) of class and commodities were gradually eliminated through a historical process that he called \"dialectical.\"   Durkheim: Religion as Society Writ Large For Durkheim , &ldquo;society&rdquo; was the root of all religious expression and devotion. As he argued in Elementary Forms of the Religious Life , the impetus for religious worship was the collective emotional experience provided by the power and structure of society ; religion, in other words, is society symbolized and writ large. For him, the most &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; form of this collective emotional experience was to be found in the totemism of tribes of Australia.   Weber and Rationalization Weber is one of the most important figures in considering both Western religious phenomena and the emerging set of knowledges and attitudes known collectively as &ldquo;modernity.&rdquo; For Weber, an increasingly bureaucratic, industrial society moves toward what he called &ldquo;rationalization&rdquo;&mdash;that is, away from worship of &ldquo;otherworldy&rdquo; gods and beings and toward activity that is \"this-worldly.\" In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism , Weber outlined his thesis that Western society&rsquo;s ethos of free markets and work actually derives from a movement in Christianity, wherein believers were increasingly removed from God and responsible for ascertaining salvation on their own.   Religion as 'Sacred Canopy' Writing in the twentieth century, sociologist Peter Berger incorporated ideas from all three of these figures in his important study, The Sacred Canopy , in which he argued that religion is a social product that provides humans with all-encompassing structures of meaning and practice. In it, Berger advanced the famous (and famously discredited) &ldquo;secularization thesis,&rdquo; in which he predicted the demise of religions in the modern world as theodicies (explanations for religion meant to counter realities of evil and death) were increasingly &ldquo;debunked.&rdquo;            Comments (0)                                              close                                                                            Resources                   Principal Writings on Religion - David Hume Call Number: B1493 .D52 1993 ISBN: 9780199251889 This volume includes Hume's \"Natural History of Religion.\"   Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals, and What Is Enlightenment - Immanuel Kant Call Number: B2766.E6 B4 1990 ISBN: 0023078251   The Second Treatise of Government, and a Letter Concerning Toleration - John Locke Call Number: JC153 .L85 2002 ISBN: 0486424642            Comments (0)                                         Theoretical/Methodological Approaches                 Use the drop-down box under \"Approaches to Religion\" to find more information and some reading suggestions for each of the major approaches to the study of religion. These include Sociological, Psychological, Anthropological, and Phenomenological approaches. Also, see the paragraphs below and the resources at left for more information about the Enlightenment, when important thinkers reworked the intellectual understanding of religion. It may prove useful to consider these intellectual reformulations as you develop your own research.   The Enlightenment During the Enlightenment, the study of religion took an important step. No longer strictly a matter of theological and devotional study, it became an object of consideration for philosophers and scientists seeking to uncover &ldquo;positive knowledge&rdquo; of the human motivations for engaging in beliefs and behavior that was increasingly found to be irrational. The Enlightenment paradigm&mdash;whereby religion would fade away as empirical knowledge about nature increased&mdash;set much of the tone for various other social scientific approaches to religion, and indeed for much of social science as a whole. It fostered a series of new epistemologies focused on knowledge of various aspects of human life&mdash;social, psychological, and political&mdash;that were increasingly being divorced from earlier theological forms of knowledge.     David Hume is arguably the most important Enlightenment figure in the study of religion; his Natural History of Religion advanced the thesis that polytheism predated theism, and that religious impulses were initially the product of negative emotions, such as fear and insecurity. Of chief import in Hume&rsquo;s argument is the idea that religious phenomena are human creations. Other important figures in religion include Immanuel Kant (whose writings include &ldquo;What Is Enlightenment?&rdquo;) and John Locke (whose &ldquo;Letter Concerning Toleration&rdquo; is one of the major texts in religious studies, philosophy, and political science).

International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences This online resource provides more than 4,000 entries on many topics covering all the social and behavioral sciences. Many topics on religion are covered in great detail, making this (along with the above Encyclopedia of Religion) one of the top initial resources when considering topics in religion and the social sciences. Dictionary of the Social Sciences This online dictionary is likely to be another key resource: It contains entries on many important topics relevant to social scientific approaches to religious studies, including anthropology, sociology, political science, economics, human geography, cultural studies, and Marxism. Blackwell Companion to the Study of Religion This digital volume features introductory articles on major approaches (anthropology, sociology, etc.) and major topics (body, myth, pilgrimage, ritual) in religious studies. Routledge Companion to the Study of Religion Provides introductory essays on many areas within religious studies, including anthropology, phenomenology, psychology, and sociology of religion, as well as specialized topics such as \"religion and geography\" or \"religion and the environment.\" Guide to the Study of Religion This volume, found in Bobst's first-floor reference area, takes a novel approach for a reference work in religious studies. Sections are not based on the usual theoretical or methodological approaches, but on major themes in the discourse and study of religion; these include Description (with subthemes including Definition and Classification), Explanation (with subthemes including Cognition, Experience, Myth, and Ritual) and Location (with subthemes including Culture, Colonialism, and Ideology). HarperCollins Dictionary of Religion This print volume, edited with the support of the American Academy of Religion, supplies definitions of a wide variety of terms in the field of religious studies. Encyclopedia of Cultural Anthropology This contains lengthy essays on a variety of cultural anthropology topics; it is found in Bobst's Reference Area on the first floor. Routledge encyclopedia of social and cultural anthropology This digital title contains many entries on sociocultural anthropological topics, with suggestions for further reading. Dictionary of Cultural Theorists This print volume contains entries on many of the cultural thinkers (Judith Butler, Edward Said, the Frankfurt School, etc.) that are relevant to most social sciences and humanities disciplines taught at NYU, and as such may be invaluable in understanding some of the references made to these theorists in articles and books about religion.

Indexes                 Here you'll find links to a number of important indexes, which are large databases that catalog scholarly literature. These indexes can be extremely useful when you're trying to get the broadest possible overview of the scholarly work on a given topic. Though NYU does not hold all of the journals that these indexes catalog, you can almost always get other articles through Interlibrary Loan. If NYU does hold the article, you'll often see an \"NYU\" button next to the article's title. Click on this button, and you'll be able to see how to access to the article.  NYU Bobst Library Religion Page  ATLA Religion Database This extensive index dates from 1949 to the present and covers many facets of theological and religious scholarship.

One thing to keep in mind is that JSTOR does not typically provide the most recent three to five years of journal coverage. Project MUSE This is another high-quality interdisciplinary index that is particularly strong in the area of literary and critical theory, so if your project relates the study of religion to one of these areas, Project MUSE is a good potential source.

A Few More Details The first five journals listed below&mdash; History of Religions , Journal of the American Academy of Religion , Journal of Religion , Religion , and Religion Compass &mdash;are all generalist journals, in that they seek to cover a wide range of disciplinary foci, methodological approaches, traditions, cultures, and time periods.

Comments (0)                                         Searching for Books in Bobst                 If you&rsquo;re looking for books that deal with theories about religion, or about the construction of religion as an intellectual category, here are five key suggestions to keep in mind.   Search for a Specific Theorist: First, you can do a search for the name of a specific theorist along with the word &ldquo;religion.&rdquo; For example, searching Bobcat for &ldquo;Emile Durkheim&rdquo; and &ldquo;religion&rdquo; will yield books by Durkheim about religion, as well as those that deal with Durkheim and religion as a subject.    Use an Earlier Search to Narrow or Deepen: In addition, it&rsquo;s helpful to look at the left of the screen (under &ldquo;Refine My Results&rdquo;) after you&rsquo;ve done a search. For example, doing the previous search (&ldquo;Emile Durkheim&rdquo; and &ldquo;religion&rdquo;) will give you a range of subjects to choose from, one of which is &ldquo;Religion and Sociology.&rdquo; Clicking on this link will give you more books about this topic. What&rsquo;s more, farther down on the screen you can click &ldquo;Durkheim, E&rdquo; to choose all the library&rsquo;s holdings by Durkheim himself.   Start Broad, Then Narrow It Down: You can also enter a broad topic into the search screen and set the drop box at the right to &ldquo;Subject.&rdquo; Such a search will then enable you to use the Subject search (again, under the &ldquo;Refine My Results&rdquo; section) to narrow your topic. For example, if you follow these instructions to do a search on &ldquo;Religion&rdquo; and set the lefthand drop box to &ldquo;Subject,&rdquo; one of the topics that will come up for refinement is also &ldquo;Religion.&rdquo; Click on it, and you&rsquo;ll see a further series of subtopics that deal with the subject of religion itself: &ldquo;Religion--Philosophy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Religion--History,&rdquo; &ldquo;Religion--Study and teaching,&rdquo; and so on.    Do a Subject Search: You can use any one of the broad intellectual approaches (Anthropology, Enlightenment, Phenomenology, Psychology, Sociology) in a subject search. In the Bobcat search box, type in (for example) &ldquo;religion anthropology,&rdquo; and set the right-hand drop box to &ldquo;Subject.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll then be able to either look at the books that come up, or (again) &ldquo;Refine Your Results&rdquo; by subject using the left-hand column.   Use the Subject Tags from a Known Book: Finally, you can choose any of the books mentioned in this research guide that interest you, locate the book in Bobcat, and look at the book's subject tags to try to find other similar books. To do so, find the book in Bobcat and then click \"Details\" underneath the book's title. For instance, if you search for &ldquo;The Sacred Canopy&rdquo; by Peter Berger (call number Bl60 .B42), you&rsquo;ll see that it is tagged with the subject &ldquo;Religion and sociology&rdquo;; clicking on this link will help you find other books with the same subject. Similarly, &ldquo;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&rdquo; yields an array of interesting topics, including &ldquo;Capitalism--Religious aspects--Christianity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Christian sociology,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christian ethics.&rdquo;            Comments (0)                                              close                                                                                                          Further Reading                                                                                  Further Reading                 Here are some more books on the subject of religion as an intellectual category that may prove useful in your thinking and/or research.
