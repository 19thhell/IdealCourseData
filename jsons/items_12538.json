These instruments, including equities, fixed income securities, options, and other derivative securities become vehicles for exploring various financial markets and the utilization of these markets by managers in different kinds of financial institutions to enhance return and manage risk. The course includes a segment on the use and application of computer-based quantitative technology for financial modeling purposes.                                                                    Introduction to Marketing - MKTG-UB 9001 - 4 points                               Evaluates, from the management point of view, marketing as a system for the satisfaction of human wants and as a catalyst of business activity. Deals with the subject at all levels from producer to consumer and emphasizes the planning required for the efficient use of marketing tools in the development and expansion of markets. Concentrates on the principles, functions, and tools of marketing, including quantitative methods. Utilizes cases and projects to develop a problem-solving ability in dealing with specific areas.                              College Core Curriculum                                                  Cultures and Contexts: Spain \u0097At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America - CORE-UA 9544 - 4 points                               Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

This course has a strong emphasis on place-based learning methods. This course consists of two components during the fall semester. The first part will be an introduction to Spanish society and the second will focus on research methods to facilitate the experiential learning process in both the fall and spring semesters.   Sample Syllabus                                History                                                  Transatlantic Empire - HIST-UA 9175 or SPAN-UA 9951 - 4 points                               For 400 years, Spain was at the center of a vast tricontinental empire that stretched from Spain to the Caribbean islands, across the Andes to the Pacific coast and the Phillipines. As has often been noted, Spanish colonialism was significantly different from the later colonial endeavours of Northern European nations. Taking full advantage of our location in Madrid, this seminar will introduce students to key texts, debates, and events in the cultural and political history of Spain in its relationship to Spanish America and the Caribbean. The readings are organized around some of the key events and issues that emerged in this long and complex history: the moment of \u201cdiscovery,\u201d the debates about conquest and the rights of indigenous populations in the 16th century, the emergence of new forms of racialization in the context of Atlantic slavery, anticolonial insurgencies in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the collapse of empire in 1898. We will also ask how our understanding of the Spanish Empire and its politics relates to some more contemporary preocupations and polemics. How was the moment of \u201cdiscovery\u201d remembered in Spain and in the Americas? What is the \u201cblack legend\u201d of Spanish history and what are the objections to it? Are there alternative visions of Spanish history? Can we trace modern forms of racialization to the Spanish Empire? Were the core concepts of political debate during Spanish colonial rule significantly different from those we deploy today, or can we, to the contrary, traces these concepts back to debates that first took place in the Spanish empire?   Most of the discussion will be based on primary sources, though we will also read some of the canonical historiography. Depending on logistics and availability of funds, we will schedule visits to local museums (i.e. Museo de las Am\u00e9ricas), collections, and archives in Madrid, Simancas, or, if possible, Sevilla. Students are encouraged to do the reading of primary sources in Spanish, but translations will be made available to those who do not read Spanish.

Through readings, film viewings, walking tours, and the production of their own documentary shorts, students will have an opportunity to explore, engage with, and document aspects of this protean city. The course, moreover, will provide an introduction to documentary theory, tradition and practice, will encourage students to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out stories that deepen their understanding of Madrid and Spain.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.

Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.

A study of Spain and its integration into the European Common Market. The historical background examines Europe in the aftermath of World War II, Spain under Franco's dictatorship and its relationship to other European countries, as well as the events leading up to the actual foundation of the European Economic Community (EEC). Emphasis is on the negotiations leading to Spain's incorporation into the EEC, and a detailed analysis is given of the present-day European Common Market and its goals for the future.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

As has often been noted, Spanish colonialism was significantly different from the later colonial endeavours of Northern European nations. Taking full advantage of our location in Madrid, this seminar will introduce students to key texts, debates, and events in the cultural and political history of Spain in its relationship to Spanish America and the Caribbean. The readings are organized around some of the key events and issues that emerged in this long and complex history: the moment of \u201cdiscovery,\u201d the debates about conquest and the rights of indigenous populations in the 16th century, the emergence of new forms of racialization in the context of Atlantic slavery, anticolonial insurgencies in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the collapse of empire in 1898. We will also ask how our understanding of the Spanish Empire and its politics relates to some more contemporary preocupations and polemics. How was the moment of \u201cdiscovery\u201d remembered in Spain and in the Americas? What is the \u201cblack legend\u201d of Spanish history and what are the objections to it? Are there alternative visions of Spanish history? Can we trace modern forms of racialization to the Spanish Empire? Were the core concepts of political debate during Spanish colonial rule significantly different from those we deploy today, or can we, to the contrary, traces these concepts back to debates that first took place in the Spanish empire?   Most of the discussion will be based on primary sources, though we will also read some of the canonical historiography. Depending on logistics and availability of funds, we will schedule visits to local museums (i.e. Museo de las Am\u00e9ricas), collections, and archives in Madrid, Simancas, or, if possible, Sevilla. Students are encouraged to do the reading of primary sources in Spanish, but translations will be made available to those who do not read Spanish.

Through readings, film viewings, walking tours, and the production of their own documentary shorts, students will have an opportunity to explore, engage with, and document aspects of this protean city. The course, moreover, will provide an introduction to documentary theory, tradition and practice, will encourage students to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out stories that deepen their understanding of Madrid and Spain.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Political Economy of Developing Countries - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               Millions of lives around the world are impacted by natural disaster, war and other crises every year. Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Spain and the European Union: Political and Economic Issues - POL-UA 9595 - 4 points                               No Prerequisites if taught in English.

A study of Spain and its integration into the European Common Market. The historical background examines Europe in the aftermath of World War II, Spain under Franco's dictatorship and its relationship to other European countries, as well as the events leading up to the actual foundation of the European Economic Community (EEC). Emphasis is on the negotiations leading to Spain's incorporation into the EEC, and a detailed analysis is given of the present-day European Common Market and its goals for the future.     Sample Syllabus                              Spanish Studies                                                  Madrid Stories: Engaging with the City Through Documentary Film - SPAN-UA 9661 & JOUR-UA 9204 - 4 points                               The city of Madrid will be the primary object of study in this course: its history, its architecture, its people, its neighborhoods, and its place in the Spanish imaginary. Through readings, film viewings, walking tours, and the production of their own documentary shorts, students will have an opportunity to explore, engage with, and document aspects of this protean city. The course, moreover, will provide an introduction to documentary theory, tradition and practice, will encourage students to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out stories that deepen their understanding of Madrid and Spain.                                                                      Transatlantic Empire - HIST-UA 9175 or SPAN-UA 9951 - 4 points                               For 400 years, Spain was at the center of a vast tricontinental empire that stretched from Spain to the Caribbean islands, across the Andes to the Pacific coast and the Phillipines. As has often been noted, Spanish colonialism was significantly different from the later colonial endeavours of Northern European nations. Taking full advantage of our location in Madrid, this seminar will introduce students to key texts, debates, and events in the cultural and political history of Spain in its relationship to Spanish America and the Caribbean. The readings are organized around some of the key events and issues that emerged in this long and complex history: the moment of \u201cdiscovery,\u201d the debates about conquest and the rights of indigenous populations in the 16th century, the emergence of new forms of racialization in the context of Atlantic slavery, anticolonial insurgencies in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the collapse of empire in 1898. We will also ask how our understanding of the Spanish Empire and its politics relates to some more contemporary preocupations and polemics. How was the moment of \u201cdiscovery\u201d remembered in Spain and in the Americas? What is the \u201cblack legend\u201d of Spanish history and what are the objections to it? Are there alternative visions of Spanish history? Can we trace modern forms of racialization to the Spanish Empire? Were the core concepts of political debate during Spanish colonial rule significantly different from those we deploy today, or can we, to the contrary, traces these concepts back to debates that first took place in the Spanish empire?   Most of the discussion will be based on primary sources, though we will also read some of the canonical historiography. Depending on logistics and availability of funds, we will schedule visits to local museums (i.e. Museo de las Am\u00e9ricas), collections, and archives in Madrid, Simancas, or, if possible, Sevilla. Students are encouraged to do the reading of primary sources in Spanish, but translations will be made available to those who do not read Spanish.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

As has often been noted, Spanish colonialism was significantly different from the later colonial endeavours of Northern European nations. Taking full advantage of our location in Madrid, this seminar will introduce students to key texts, debates, and events in the cultural and political history of Spain in its relationship to Spanish America and the Caribbean. The readings are organized around some of the key events and issues that emerged in this long and complex history: the moment of \u201cdiscovery,\u201d the debates about conquest and the rights of indigenous populations in the 16th century, the emergence of new forms of racialization in the context of Atlantic slavery, anticolonial insurgencies in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the collapse of empire in 1898. We will also ask how our understanding of the Spanish Empire and its politics relates to some more contemporary preocupations and polemics. How was the moment of \u201cdiscovery\u201d remembered in Spain and in the Americas? What is the \u201cblack legend\u201d of Spanish history and what are the objections to it? Are there alternative visions of Spanish history? Can we trace modern forms of racialization to the Spanish Empire? Were the core concepts of political debate during Spanish colonial rule significantly different from those we deploy today, or can we, to the contrary, traces these concepts back to debates that first took place in the Spanish empire?   Most of the discussion will be based on primary sources, though we will also read some of the canonical historiography. Depending on logistics and availability of funds, we will schedule visits to local museums (i.e. Museo de las Am\u00e9ricas), collections, and archives in Madrid, Simancas, or, if possible, Sevilla. Students are encouraged to do the reading of primary sources in Spanish, but translations will be made available to those who do not read Spanish.

Through readings, film viewings, walking tours, and the production of their own documentary shorts, students will have an opportunity to explore, engage with, and document aspects of this protean city. The course, moreover, will provide an introduction to documentary theory, tradition and practice, will encourage students to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out stories that deepen their understanding of Madrid and Spain.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Political Economy of Developing Countries - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               Millions of lives around the world are impacted by natural disaster, war and other crises every year. Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Spain and the European Union: Political and Economic Issues - POL-UA 9595 - 4 points                               No Prerequisites if taught in English.   When Taught in Spanish: Prerequisite of SPAN-UA 100 or to be taken concurrently with SPAN-UA 9100 with permission of the director.     A study of Spain and its integration into the European Common Market. The historical background examines Europe in the aftermath of World War II, Spain under Franco's dictatorship and its relationship to other European countries, as well as the events leading up to the actual foundation of the European Economic Community (EEC). Emphasis is on the negotiations leading to Spain's incorporation into the EEC, and a detailed analysis is given of the present-day European Common Market and its goals for the future.     Sample Syllabus                              Spanish Studies                                                  Madrid Stories: Engaging with the City Through Documentary Film - SPAN-UA 9661 & JOUR-UA 9204 - 4 points                               The city of Madrid will be the primary object of study in this course: its history, its architecture, its people, its neighborhoods, and its place in the Spanish imaginary. Through readings, film viewings, walking tours, and the production of their own documentary shorts, students will have an opportunity to explore, engage with, and document aspects of this protean city. The course, moreover, will provide an introduction to documentary theory, tradition and practice, will encourage students to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out stories that deepen their understanding of Madrid and Spain.                                                                      Transatlantic Empire - HIST-UA 9175 or SPAN-UA 9951 - 4 points                               For 400 years, Spain was at the center of a vast tricontinental empire that stretched from Spain to the Caribbean islands, across the Andes to the Pacific coast and the Phillipines. As has often been noted, Spanish colonialism was significantly different from the later colonial endeavours of Northern European nations. Taking full advantage of our location in Madrid, this seminar will introduce students to key texts, debates, and events in the cultural and political history of Spain in its relationship to Spanish America and the Caribbean. The readings are organized around some of the key events and issues that emerged in this long and complex history: the moment of \u201cdiscovery,\u201d the debates about conquest and the rights of indigenous populations in the 16th century, the emergence of new forms of racialization in the context of Atlantic slavery, anticolonial insurgencies in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the collapse of empire in 1898. We will also ask how our understanding of the Spanish Empire and its politics relates to some more contemporary preocupations and polemics. How was the moment of \u201cdiscovery\u201d remembered in Spain and in the Americas? What is the \u201cblack legend\u201d of Spanish history and what are the objections to it? Are there alternative visions of Spanish history? Can we trace modern forms of racialization to the Spanish Empire? Were the core concepts of political debate during Spanish colonial rule significantly different from those we deploy today, or can we, to the contrary, traces these concepts back to debates that first took place in the Spanish empire?   Most of the discussion will be based on primary sources, though we will also read some of the canonical historiography. Depending on logistics and availability of funds, we will schedule visits to local museums (i.e. Museo de las Am\u00e9ricas), collections, and archives in Madrid, Simancas, or, if possible, Sevilla. Students are encouraged to do the reading of primary sources in Spanish, but translations will be made available to those who do not read Spanish.
