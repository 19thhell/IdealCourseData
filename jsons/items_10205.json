In the new location, students have the opportunity to benefit from the numerous cultural, artistic, and academic institutions of this celebrated neighborhood, as well as to get to know the city through faculty-led visits and walking tours. The program offers regular day trips to places outside of the city, such as Chantilly, Giverny, and Versailles, and weekend excursions to locations that have included Avignon, the Loire Valley, Mont-Saint-Michel, and La Rochelle. These trips allow students to further embrace the richness, depth, and diversity of French history and civilization.   Studying at NYU Paris   Paris: city of revolution, exhilarating tumult of art and spectacle, cosmopolitan crossroads, capital of the world. French romanticist George Sand thought Parisians were \u201cthe most admirable people in the universe \u2013 grand, sublime, na\u00efve, and generous.\u201d Students who come to Paris join a long line of visitors to the city who contribute to its fervent mix\u2014its arts, its history, its politics\u2014and make the city their own. \u201cParis is a veritable ocean,\u201d Balzac wrote. \u201cDiscover it, describe it\u2026\u201d At NYU Paris, the city is your classroom.   The curriculum at NYU Paris focuses on the language, arts, history, literature, and politics of France and its relationships with the wider world. A world-class faculty provides context and support for students\u2019 academic work. Students with a limited background in French enroll in Program I, where all courses except for language are taught in English. Students proficient in French participate in Program II, which features a variety of courses taught in French. All students take a French language course appropriate to their level.   Coursework is enhanced by faculty-led trips in and around Paris, to world-renowned museums such as the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e Picasso or to smaller galleries and exhibits, as well as to the opera, ballet, and theatre. Students receive a University of Paris student card and may take courses at the University of Paris or at the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques (Sciences Po). All students are carefully advised upon their arrival in Paris; students who opt to take courses in the French university system receive additional individualized in-house tutorial assistance.   Masters level graduate programs in French Literature, French Language &amp; Civilization, Museum Studies, and Teaching French as a Foreign Language also contribute to the overall academic quality of the Paris academic center.

NYU Paris housing staff will review your responses to questions from the application, consider your program of study, and also the availability of styles of housing before making assignments.   Placement   Once housing assignments are finalized, typically about two weeks before arrival in Paris, NYU Paris will inform students via email of their assignment.   Housing Check-in and Payment   Residence Montsouris or R\u00e9publique Apartments: If you are assigned to live in the Montsouris student residence, or in the R\u00e9publique apartments, you will be instructed to go directly to the building from the airport to check in. Housing charges will appear on the NYU Bursar bill in US dollars. Scholarships and aid awards in excess of tuition and fees will credit against the cost of housing. Payments are to be made to the University Bursar in the e-suite online payment tool.   Homestay or Privately Owned Apartment: If you are assigned to live in a homestay or a privately owned apartment, you will be informed of an address of a hotel where you should proceed from the airport. The cost of the hotel is paid for by NYU on your behalf. Within a few days of your arrival, you will meet individually with a member of the NYU Paris staff to receive the exact address of your housing assignment. You will be given an appointment to meet your French host or to see your apartment. This assignment is final and cannot be changed. (Note: housing details will NOT be communicated to students before this occasion). Before moving in, you will be required to complete a written agreement with your landlord concerning rent, utilities, security deposit, payment methods accepted by your landlord, and the length of your stay.   Note regarding security deposits: In accordance with French law, you will be required upon move-in to give a security deposit equivalent to one month\u2019s rent and the first month's rent in its entirety. Please plan to have access to this amount of funds upon arrival. Note: French bank accounts will not yet be available when you move in. You will be advised as to how to exchange traveler's checks during orientation.                NYU Paris Housing FAQ's:       Students who live in the Montsouris residence will live with other students enrolled at NYU Paris, have kitchen and bathroom facilities in the room, and will receive support from live-in NYU student resident assistants. NYU graduate and undergraduate students serve as resident assistants.&amp;nbsp;   The R\u00e9publique building offers single studios to NYU students but the majority of residents are local French or international students enrolled in the French university system. The apartments have equipped kitchenettes and bathrooms. NYU graduate and undergraduate students serve as resident assistants.     Students who live in homestays and privately owned apartments must understand that NYU does not control these units. Rather, NYU Paris puts students in contact with independent Parisian landlords, and hosts whom have rented to NYU students in the past and are willing to rent their apartments or rooms on a short-term basis. NYU Paris has no financial relationship with landlords/home owners. NYU Paris receives no financial gain in exchange.   The NYU Paris housing coordinator serves as an intermediary between the residence manager, property owners, and students. All accommodations have been visited and approved by NYU Paris staff.   Homestays and privately owned apartments are located in neighborhoods in all twenty arrondissements of Paris and its immediate suburbs. Average commute time from these student housing types to the NYU Paris academic center and Parisian universities ranges from 30 to 50 minutes.   There is no &quot;average&quot; room. Every apartment, homestay, etc. differs in size and prices range from $600 to $1,400 or more per student per month.   According to French law, rent for all months in which a unit is occupied is due in its entirety and landlords may legally keep security deposits for up to two months after the student vacates the housing. The charge for living in Montsouris or the R\u00e9publique apartments is constant for fall and spring semester, whereas the cost to live in a homestay or a privately owned apartment is greater in the spring semester due to the extra length of the spring semester academic calendar.

The Creative Writing Program now occupies a lovely townhouse on West 10th Street in the same Greenwich Village neighborhood where so many writers have lived and worked. The Lillian Vernon Creative Writers House allows writers--established and emerging--to share their work in an inspiring setting.

In the new location, students have the opportunity to benefit from the numerous cultural, artistic, and academic institutions of this celebrated neighborhood, as well as to get to know the city through faculty-led visits and walking tours. The program offers regular day trips to places outside of the city, such as Chantilly, Giverny, and Versailles, and weekend excursions to locations that have included Avignon, the Loire Valley, Mont-Saint-Michel, and La Rochelle. These trips allow students to further embrace the richness, depth, and diversity of French history and civilization.   Studying at NYU Paris   Paris: city of revolution, exhilarating tumult of art and spectacle, cosmopolitan crossroads, capital of the world. French romanticist George Sand thought Parisians were \u201cthe most admirable people in the universe \u2013 grand, sublime, na\u00efve, and generous.\u201d Students who come to Paris join a long line of visitors to the city who contribute to its fervent mix\u2014its arts, its history, its politics\u2014and make the city their own. \u201cParis is a veritable ocean,\u201d Balzac wrote. \u201cDiscover it, describe it\u2026\u201d At NYU Paris, the city is your classroom.   The curriculum at NYU Paris focuses on the language, arts, history, literature, and politics of France and its relationships with the wider world. A world-class faculty provides context and support for students\u2019 academic work. Students with a limited background in French enroll in Program I, where all courses except for language are taught in English. Students proficient in French participate in Program II, which features a variety of courses taught in French. All students take a French language course appropriate to their level.   Coursework is enhanced by faculty-led trips in and around Paris, to world-renowned museums such as the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e Picasso or to smaller galleries and exhibits, as well as to the opera, ballet, and theatre. Students receive a University of Paris student card and may take courses at the University of Paris or at the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques (Sciences Po). All students are carefully advised upon their arrival in Paris; students who opt to take courses in the French university system receive additional individualized in-house tutorial assistance.   Masters level graduate programs in French Literature, French Language &amp; Civilization, Museum Studies, and Teaching French as a Foreign Language also contribute to the overall academic quality of the Paris academic center.

Living in NYU Paris assigned housing is a condition of enrollment. All students will complete an online housing application where they will express their interest in the type of housing assignment that is preferred. Housing assignments will be made based on availability of each housing type and may take into consideration if the student is enrolled in the Program II (Francophone) coursework or not. Keep in mind that assignments may not be the top preference but a placement in NYU approved housing is guaranteed. Housing options include:     Residence Montsouris     Homestays   Apartments                                           Housing Assignments            Online Housing Application   During the pre-departure process the NYU Paris adviser will direct you to an online housing application. The application will allow you to submit your preference for an assignment in the type of housing that is available. NYU Paris housing staff will review your responses to questions from the application, consider your program of study, and also the availability of styles of housing before making assignments.   Placement   Once housing assignments are finalized, typically about two weeks before arrival in Paris, NYU Paris will inform students via email of their assignment.   Housing Check-in and Payment   Residence Montsouris or R\u00e9publique Apartments: If you are assigned to live in the Montsouris student residence, or in the R\u00e9publique apartments, you will be instructed to go directly to the building from the airport to check in. Housing charges will appear on the NYU Bursar bill in US dollars. Scholarships and aid awards in excess of tuition and fees will credit against the cost of housing. Payments are to be made to the University Bursar in the e-suite online payment tool.   Homestay or Privately Owned Apartment: If you are assigned to live in a homestay or a privately owned apartment, you will be informed of an address of a hotel where you should proceed from the airport. The cost of the hotel is paid for by NYU on your behalf. Within a few days of your arrival, you will meet individually with a member of the NYU Paris staff to receive the exact address of your housing assignment. You will be given an appointment to meet your French host or to see your apartment. This assignment is final and cannot be changed. (Note: housing details will NOT be communicated to students before this occasion). Before moving in, you will be required to complete a written agreement with your landlord concerning rent, utilities, security deposit, payment methods accepted by your landlord, and the length of your stay.   Note regarding security deposits: In accordance with French law, you will be required upon move-in to give a security deposit equivalent to one month\u2019s rent and the first month's rent in its entirety. Please plan to have access to this amount of funds upon arrival. Note: French bank accounts will not yet be available when you move in. You will be advised as to how to exchange traveler's checks during orientation.                NYU Paris Housing FAQ's:       Students who live in the Montsouris residence will live with other students enrolled at NYU Paris, have kitchen and bathroom facilities in the room, and will receive support from live-in NYU student resident assistants. NYU graduate and undergraduate students serve as resident assistants.&amp;nbsp;   The R\u00e9publique building offers single studios to NYU students but the majority of residents are local French or international students enrolled in the French university system. The apartments have equipped kitchenettes and bathrooms. NYU graduate and undergraduate students serve as resident assistants.     Students who live in homestays and privately owned apartments must understand that NYU does not control these units. Rather, NYU Paris puts students in contact with independent Parisian landlords, and hosts whom have rented to NYU students in the past and are willing to rent their apartments or rooms on a short-term basis. NYU Paris has no financial relationship with landlords/home owners. NYU Paris receives no financial gain in exchange.   The NYU Paris housing coordinator serves as an intermediary between the residence manager, property owners, and students. All accommodations have been visited and approved by NYU Paris staff.   Homestays and privately owned apartments are located in neighborhoods in all twenty arrondissements of Paris and its immediate suburbs. Average commute time from these student housing types to the NYU Paris academic center and Parisian universities ranges from 30 to 50 minutes.   There is no &quot;average&quot; room. Every apartment, homestay, etc. differs in size and prices range from $600 to $1,400 or more per student per month.   According to French law, rent for all months in which a unit is occupied is due in its entirety and landlords may legally keep security deposits for up to two months after the student vacates the housing. The charge for living in Montsouris or the R\u00e9publique apartments is constant for fall and spring semester, whereas the cost to live in a homestay or a privately owned apartment is greater in the spring semester due to the extra length of the spring semester academic calendar.
