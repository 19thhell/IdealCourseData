The NYU College of Nursing Elder Care Program, is an extension of the NYUCN Nursing Faculty Practice, and has a special emphasis on expanding access to primary care for older adults. The program also collaborates with the NYU College of Dentistry. This unique partnership gives patients the benefit of having their oral and general healthcare needs met under one roof, should they choose.   What Services does the Eldercare Program Provide?   At the NYU College of Nursing\u2019s Elder Care Program, patients will receive a comprehensive evaluation by a Gerontological Nurse Practitioner. Care may include vaccinations for influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, screening and assessment of cognitive and functional status, diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, ordering of appropriate lab work and diagnostic tests, and coordination of care with specialists.   Patients are evaluated for chronic conditions and for conditions associated with aging such as an unsteady gait creating a risk for falls. Aging produces a decline in the function of many organ systems, such as the kidneys and the cardiovascular system, making the older adult more vulnerable to sudden changes from an acute illness or the effects of polypharmacy. The purpose of care by a Geriatric Nurse Practitioner is to provide an individualized, culturally sensitive assessment and care plan. We also work closely with family members and other caregivers to provide support and coordination of care when necessary. Our goal is to diagnose and manage illnesses while maintaining function and quality of life.

The NYU College of Nursing Elder Care Program, is an extension of the NYUCN Nursing Faculty Practice, and has a special emphasis on expanding access to primary care for older adults. The program also collaborates with the NYU College of Dentistry. This unique partnership gives patients the benefit of having their oral and general healthcare needs met under one roof, should they choose.   What Services does the Eldercare Program Provide?   At the NYU College of Nursing\u2019s Elder Care Program, patients will receive a comprehensive evaluation by a Gerontological Nurse Practitioner. Care may include vaccinations for influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, screening and assessment of cognitive and functional status, diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, ordering of appropriate lab work and diagnostic tests, and coordination of care with specialists.   Patients are evaluated for chronic conditions and for conditions associated with aging such as an unsteady gait creating a risk for falls. Aging produces a decline in the function of many organ systems, such as the kidneys and the cardiovascular system, making the older adult more vulnerable to sudden changes from an acute illness or the effects of polypharmacy. The purpose of care by a Geriatric Nurse Practitioner is to provide an individualized, culturally sensitive assessment and care plan. We also work closely with family members and other caregivers to provide support and coordination of care when necessary. Our goal is to diagnose and manage illnesses while maintaining function and quality of life.
