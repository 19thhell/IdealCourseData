STARS, the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System, is a new program that measures and encourages sustainability in all aspects of higher education.   NYU President John Sexton said, \u201cIt is an honor for NYU to receive a Gold Rating for its sustainability efforts, but perhaps not a surprise: seldom have I seen an initiative unite and motivate our campus more than our green efforts. From declines in electrical consumption to increases in recycling, from our new co-gen plant\u2019s reductions in greenhouse emissions to expansion of bicycle riding, the commitment to meeting the challenges of climate change is not only an institutional priority at NYU, but a widespread and very personal one as well.\u201d   NYU has been deeply involved in STARS since the system was first proposed, having carried out internal institution-wide environmental assessment efforts since 2005. The university participated as a STARS Pilot Program member soon after becoming a charter and leadership circle member of the ACUPCC, launching a NYU Sustainability Task Force, and setting in motion a host of green initiatives on campus including:   \u00b7   Achieving a reduction in carbon emissions by more than 40%--seven years before the committed completion date of 2017 \u2013 as part of the NYC Mayoral Challenge;   \u00b7   Producing a comprehensive Climate Action Plan, NYU\u2019s commitment to sustainability with the goal of becoming climate neutral by 2040;   \u00b7   Renovating the cogeneration power plant: The new cogen plant produces twice the power and reduces greenhouse gas emission by 23%, in addition to avoiding the combustion of 500,000 gallons of fuel oil and 280,000 therms of natural gas per year;   \u00b7   Creating NYUnplugged, an annual student energy-saving challenge which, last fall helped save tens of thousands of kilowatt-hours of electricity;   \u00b7   Instituting a campus-wide Mixed Recycling program and enhancing NYU\u2019s e-waste technoscrap program;   \u00b7   Striving for local, organic, and Fair Trade certifications for food served in dining halls and catered events, with nearly 1/3 of all expenditures on food sourced within 250 miles;   \u00b7   Implementing the NYU Bike Share Program--the first free bicycle-sharing program in New York City;   \u00b7   Upgrading NYU\u2019s Bus Fleet by phasing out diesel-powered buses and replacing them with hybrid electric buses.   NYU is committed to high standards of excellence in environmental reporting, and helped to draft the \"Open Letter to Sustainability Evaluating Organizations,\" which established clear expectations from the higher education community for rating systems' quality and fairness going forward. More than 75 institutions have since signed the letter.   AASHE\u2019s STARS program is the only one of its kind that involves publicly reporting comprehensive information related to a college or university\u2019s sustainability performance. Participants report achievements in three overall areas: 1) education &amp; research, 2) operations, and 3) planning, administration &amp; engagement.   NYU's received the highest score in the Operations area of any rated institution to date.   \"We're pleased to be recognized for the strong effort we've put in to reduce NYU's environmental footprint, including cutting NYU's greenhouse gas emissions 40% over a four-year period\", said Cecil Scheib, Director of Energy and Sustainability. \"We look forward to improving our rating in the future as we not just reduce our impact, but also set and achieve environmental performance goals.\"   \u201cSTARS was developed by the campus sustainability community to provide high standards for recognizing campus sustainability efforts,\u201d said AASHE Executive Director Paul Rowland. \u201cNYU has demonstrated a substantial commitment to sustainability by achieving a STARS Gold Rating and is to be congratulated for their efforts.\u201d   Unlike other rating or ranking systems, this program is open to all institutions of higher education in the U.S. and Canada, and the criteria that determine a STARS Rating are transparent and accessible to anyone. Because STARS is a program based on credits earned, it allows for both internal comparisons as well as comparisons with similar institutions.   \u201cSTARS is the most comprehensive, transparent, and flexible framework for measuring the performance and documenting the steps taken to transform higher education into a sustainable sector of society,\u201d said Jeremy Friedman, NYU\u2019s manager of sustainability. We are very proud to have achieved a STARS Gold Rating for our sustainability accomplishments. NYU will continue to aspire to serve as an exemplar and a leader in the movement for sustainability in higher education.\u201d     About New York University:   Founded in 1831, New York University is the largest private university in the United States.

STARS, the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System, is a new program that measures and encourages sustainability in all aspects of higher education.   NYU President John Sexton said, \u201cIt is an honor for NYU to receive a Gold Rating for its sustainability efforts, but perhaps not a surprise: seldom have I seen an initiative unite and motivate our campus more than our green efforts. From declines in electrical consumption to increases in recycling, from our new co-gen plant\u2019s reductions in greenhouse emissions to expansion of bicycle riding, the commitment to meeting the challenges of climate change is not only an institutional priority at NYU, but a widespread and very personal one as well.\u201d   NYU has been deeply involved in STARS since the system was first proposed, having carried out internal institution-wide environmental assessment efforts since 2005. The university participated as a STARS Pilot Program member soon after becoming a charter and leadership circle member of the ACUPCC, launching a NYU Sustainability Task Force, and setting in motion a host of green initiatives on campus including:   \u00b7   Achieving a reduction in carbon emissions by more than 40%--seven years before the committed completion date of 2017 \u2013 as part of the NYC Mayoral Challenge;   \u00b7   Producing a comprehensive Climate Action Plan, NYU\u2019s commitment to sustainability with the goal of becoming climate neutral by 2040;   \u00b7   Renovating the cogeneration power plant: The new cogen plant produces twice the power and reduces greenhouse gas emission by 23%, in addition to avoiding the combustion of 500,000 gallons of fuel oil and 280,000 therms of natural gas per year;   \u00b7   Creating NYUnplugged, an annual student energy-saving challenge which, last fall helped save tens of thousands of kilowatt-hours of electricity;   \u00b7   Instituting a campus-wide Mixed Recycling program and enhancing NYU\u2019s e-waste technoscrap program;   \u00b7   Striving for local, organic, and Fair Trade certifications for food served in dining halls and catered events, with nearly 1/3 of all expenditures on food sourced within 250 miles;   \u00b7   Implementing the NYU Bike Share Program--the first free bicycle-sharing program in New York City;   \u00b7   Upgrading NYU\u2019s Bus Fleet by phasing out diesel-powered buses and replacing them with hybrid electric buses.   NYU is committed to high standards of excellence in environmental reporting, and helped to draft the \"Open Letter to Sustainability Evaluating Organizations,\" which established clear expectations from the higher education community for rating systems' quality and fairness going forward. More than 75 institutions have since signed the letter.   AASHE\u2019s STARS program is the only one of its kind that involves publicly reporting comprehensive information related to a college or university\u2019s sustainability performance. Participants report achievements in three overall areas: 1) education &amp; research, 2) operations, and 3) planning, administration &amp; engagement.   NYU's received the highest score in the Operations area of any rated institution to date.   \"We're pleased to be recognized for the strong effort we've put in to reduce NYU's environmental footprint, including cutting NYU's greenhouse gas emissions 40% over a four-year period\", said Cecil Scheib, Director of Energy and Sustainability. \"We look forward to improving our rating in the future as we not just reduce our impact, but also set and achieve environmental performance goals.\"   \u201cSTARS was developed by the campus sustainability community to provide high standards for recognizing campus sustainability efforts,\u201d said AASHE Executive Director Paul Rowland. \u201cNYU has demonstrated a substantial commitment to sustainability by achieving a STARS Gold Rating and is to be congratulated for their efforts.\u201d   Unlike other rating or ranking systems, this program is open to all institutions of higher education in the U.S. and Canada, and the criteria that determine a STARS Rating are transparent and accessible to anyone. Because STARS is a program based on credits earned, it allows for both internal comparisons as well as comparisons with similar institutions.   \u201cSTARS is the most comprehensive, transparent, and flexible framework for measuring the performance and documenting the steps taken to transform higher education into a sustainable sector of society,\u201d said Jeremy Friedman, NYU\u2019s manager of sustainability. We are very proud to have achieved a STARS Gold Rating for our sustainability accomplishments. NYU will continue to aspire to serve as an exemplar and a leader in the movement for sustainability in higher education.\u201d     About New York University:   Founded in 1831, New York University is the largest private university in the United States.
