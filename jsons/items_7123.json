The forms taken by stories since the Industrial Revolution changed in tandem with shifts in the organization of work and leisure. Melodrama and realism, the major genres/styles of this period, have often been seen as antagonistic toward each other. In this class, however, we\u2019ll follow up on recent suggestions that both modes always co-exist even though melodramatic and realistic texts so clearly differ in ostensible purpose, effect, and audience. Melodrama, for example, promotes conventionality but subversively celebrates the felt over the known and thereby speaks an otherwise unspeakable truth. Realism, in contrast, was developed to criticize a world that can be known and articulated, and yet the form tends to isolate the individual while failing to promote collectivity. Class readings will enable us to consider melodrama and realism as responses to or consequences of the key changes said to characterize Western modernity: the loss of common belief in the universal and metaphysical; the newfound role of the machine in relation to art; shifts in the political meaning of race, class, gender, and sexuality; and the philosophical arguments that emerged from the tension between the \u201cAge of Enlightenment\u201d and \u201cDiscovery of the Unconscious.\u201d The syllabus, in addition to a few basic critical works on this topic (James Baldwin, Linda Williams, Lauren Berlant), may include: early examples of melodramatic plays and fiction; examples of sensation fiction and plays; Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s\u00a0 Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin \u00a0, Henrik Ibsen\u2019s\u00a0 Hedda Gabler \u00a0; Fannie Hurst\u2019s\u00a0 Imitation of Life \u00a0and Douglas Sirk\u2019s film version; a comparative analysis of Sirk\u2019s\u00a0 All that Heaven Allows \u00a0, Rainer Werner Fassbinder\u2019s\u00a0 Ali: Fear Eats the Soul, \u00a0and Todd Haynes\u2019s\u00a0 Far from Heaven. \u00a0Students will have the opportunity to propose other texts as our ideas develop.

The forms taken by stories since the Industrial Revolution changed in tandem with shifts in the organization of work and leisure. Melodrama and realism, the major genres/styles of this period, have often been seen as antagonistic toward each other. In this class, however, we\u2019ll follow up on recent suggestions that both modes always co-exist even though melodramatic and realistic texts so clearly differ in ostensible purpose, effect, and audience. Melodrama, for example, promotes conventionality but subversively celebrates the felt over the known and thereby speaks an otherwise unspeakable truth. Realism, in contrast, was developed to criticize a world that can be known and articulated, and yet the form tends to isolate the individual while failing to promote collectivity. Class readings will enable us to consider melodrama and realism as responses to or consequences of the key changes said to characterize Western modernity: the loss of common belief in the universal and metaphysical; the newfound role of the machine in relation to art; shifts in the political meaning of race, class, gender, and sexuality; and the philosophical arguments that emerged from the tension between the \u201cAge of Enlightenment\u201d and \u201cDiscovery of the Unconscious.\u201d The syllabus, in addition to a few basic critical works on this topic (James Baldwin, Linda Williams, Lauren Berlant), may include: early examples of melodramatic plays and fiction; examples of sensation fiction and plays; Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s\u00a0 Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin \u00a0, Henrik Ibsen\u2019s\u00a0 Hedda Gabler \u00a0; Fannie Hurst\u2019s\u00a0 Imitation of Life \u00a0and Douglas Sirk\u2019s film version; a comparative analysis of Sirk\u2019s\u00a0 All that Heaven Allows \u00a0, Rainer Werner Fassbinder\u2019s\u00a0 Ali: Fear Eats the Soul, \u00a0and Todd Haynes\u2019s\u00a0 Far from Heaven. \u00a0Students will have the opportunity to propose other texts as our ideas develop.
