For further information, please click here       The  M.A. in Spanish and Latin American Linguistic, Literary, and Cultural Studies is  a one-year program offered at NYU Madrid by NYU\u2019s Graduate School of Arts and  Sciences. With courses taught entirely in Spanish.      The program takes full advantage of the vast range of cultural activities and events in Madrid, which form an integral part of the curriculum. Students have access to some of the most resourceful libraries and archives in the world and also benefit from membership to the historic Instituto Internacional and its excellent library. Depending on their interests and career goals, students choose one of two concentrations: Literary and Cultural Studies: Spain and Latin America or Applied Linguistics: Spain and Latin America . The capstone M.A. project allows students to develop an original scholarly work with the guidance of a faculty advisor, and to present a portion of this work at the Graduate Research Conference. The M.A. program is designed to encourage students to immerse themselves linguistically and culturally in Madrid life. All students are provided with a Madrid Cultura y Arte membership card to attend events, screenings, talks, shows, and exhibitions of their choice throughout the year. An integral part of the core curriculum and orientation program, visits and study trips give students the unique opportunity to investigate Spanish culture in situ. Whether studying urban space in Bilbao, transatlantic trade in Seville, or Roman architecture in Segovia, students are guided by faculty experts. Concentration in Literary and Cultural Studies: Spain and Latin America Students with a concentration in Literary and Cultural Studies develop their interests in literary and critical theory, peninsular and Latin American literature, and the arts and culture of both regions. While most students who choose this option are interested in pursuing a doctoral degree and/or teaching at the college or university level, others go on to careers in secondary education or in other fields in which they can use their thorough knowledge and understanding of the Spanish-speaking world. Concentration in Applied Linguistics: Spain and Latin America The concentration in Applied Linguistics emphasizes three main research areas within the historical, political, and cultural context of the Spanish-speaking world: general linguistics, psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic theories, second language teaching and acquisition, and translation studies. The program is designed for students interested in pursuing a doctoral degree in these fields or others related to Applied Linguistics, as well as for those whose professions (primary or secondary education, business, community service, government, international affairs, etc.) would benefit from advanced training. The concentration is not designed for students who wish to go on to a Ph.D. degree in literature. Why choose NYU Madrid? The unique one-year M.A. program offers graduate students rigorous academic training to develop their own research interests and approaches to debates in linguistic, literary, and cultural studies, often cutting across disciplinary boundaries. The design of the program aims to foster student responsibility and independence when exploring and generating new areas of knowledge in dialogue with the academic community at large, and beyond. NYU Madrid draws from the diverse expertise of its faculty within a local and global network of universities, research institutions, and cultural centers and museums, at the very core of our graduate students\u2019 experience in Madrid. Our challenge to students to develop their own goals for the program, met with the flexibility of its design and faculty encouragement to pursue independent research, has made for a successful combination. The M.A. program has served as a platform for students who wish to pursue a doctoral degree in their chosen field of studies and for those who aim to use their linguistic and cultural knowledge of the Spanish-speaking world for the benefit of their professions. Attracting students from diverse backgrounds in the United States and abroad, the M.A. program provides a forum to exchange ideas and explore new critical perspectives in which academic pursuits are inseparable from vital experience.

These courses introduce aspects of one particular region\u2019s cultural development to help students understand societies that have long histories and enormous diversity within themselves\u2014societies and cultures that intersect across the globe. \u201cCulture\u201d is broadly defined as including, but not being limited to, the historical, philosophical, artistic, political, and social dimensions of the region. Course materials stress primary over secondary sources and may include multimedia. In their first year, students choose from one of the Global Cultures courses described below.  African Cultures This course is an introduction to modern African history and culture. The configurations and problems of modern African society are examined in the context of, and as a product of, a rich history and tradition. The social, political, economic, and intellectual dimensions of African life are approached through a wide variety of readings from the disciplines of history, political science, anthropology, and literature. Middle Eastern Cultures This is a general, inter-disciplinary introduction to the societies, cultures, politics and history of the contemporary Middle East and Islamic North Africa. Texts on sociological, historical and political topics, as well as artistic expressions, films and literary works, may be utilized to examine the region's rich historical legacy and current complexity. Topics may include the historical and cultural relations between the Middle East and the West and the impact of historical, economic, and political change on the region's cultures, societies and contemporary problems. East Asian Cultures This course surveys the civilizations of Japan and China, concentrating on their last 200 years and their position in today\u2019s world. Each country\u2019s unique culture and civilization provides the backdrop against which modern events are viewed. Major topics include the imperialist conquests of the 19th century, the nationalist movements and revolutions of the 20th century, and the impact of modernization on traditional Asian societies. South Asian Cultures This course examines the historical and cultural roots of political and social change in 19th- and 20th-century South Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal). The course explores the complex interaction of ancient traditions, colonialism, and independence movements. It also examines a number of post-independence issues such as development and modernization, hierarchy and democracy, and continuing religious strife. Latin American Cultures This course examines major literary texts in the context of political and social change in post-independence Latin America. Genres including the novel, the essay, and poetry are read in light of the emerging nations\u2019 quest to consolidate their identities vis-\u00e0-vis Spain, Europe, and 20th-century United States. The course explores how Latin American texts address the challenges of establishing viable politics across class and racial divides; the transition from monocultural and agricultural economies to industrialization and mass urbanization; responses to economic and ideological neocolonialism; the opportunities and crises created by integration into a global economy; the impact of the global media; and the struggle for civil rights.  Advanced Global Cultures Students take an Advanced Global Cultures course in either fall or spring semester at their global sites. These courses, which concern a wide variety of topics, connect the site experience with wider regional, national, or global phenomena; for instance, a student in Paris might choose a course on France and Islam, while a student at Buenos Aires might choose one on Latin American cinema. Students take an two-semester experiential learning sequence to immerse them in the current and historical character of the site; as a component of the class, they pursue an independent internship or equivalent with an on-site faculty director and work online with a GLS faculty member and students with similar interests from different sites to craft an independent research project, an important preparation for the senior thesis. Junior year also features foreign language courses in each term, and electives geared toward the particular academic emphases and geographic advantages of the site. Students thus attain a thorough working knowledge of the historical and contemporary culture and society of the site at which they study.
