Launched in Fall 2008, the ACT-Institute is designed to explore concepts such as diversity, social justice, identity and inclusion particularly as they relate to the work administrators engage with students and colleagues. Participants will gain both insights and practical tools to inform their personal lens, which we believe will assist efforts to impact institutional, cultural and individual practices. Participants can be nominated to apply by colleagues or self-apply.    The Foundations seminar is the first in the series and serves as a required prerequisite in order to enroll in any of the other seminars. Foundations offers a broad overview of the complexities of diversity issues in higher education and provides common language and shared theoretical frameworks for analyzing these issues. Foundations will be offered twice: Friday, October 17, 2014, 1-4pm and Friday, November 7, 2014, 1-4pm. Participants need only attend ONE of these sessions. For professionals who attended Foundations last year, the prerequisite requirement has been met and they are therefore eligible to attend any of the subsequent seminars. However, pre-registration is always required for participation in ALL ACT-I seminars.    Content seminars will more closely examine selected areas of diversity and social justice in higher education and NYU specifically, with special attention given to the Global Network University. Lunch is provided at all ACT-I seminars. Selected seminars are scheduled for the these dates:       December 5, 2014, 1-4pm: Religion, Faith and Spirituality in Higher Education     January 30, 2015, 1-4pm: Race, Ethnicity and Culture at NYU and Beyond     February 20, 2015, 1-4pm: Socio-economic Diversity-Meeting the Opportunities and Challenges Through Student Affairs     March 7, 2015 1-4pm: Undocumented Students     March 27, 2015, 1-4pm: Gender and Sexuality in Colleges and Universities     April 3, 2015, 1-4pm: The Global/International Experience for Student and Professional     May 1, 2015, 1-4pm: The Wrap-Up, Best Practices and Practical Application **Mandatory for all those seeking certification**      The NYU Human Resources Department recognizes the ACT-Institute as a certified professional development training. New participants who complete the prerequisite Foundations &amp; Wrap-Up seminars and any three specialized seminars during the 2014-15 series will receive Basic Cultural Competency certification. For those new or returning participants who complete or have completed the prerequisite Foundations &amp; Wrap-Up seminar and at least five of the six selected content seminars during this or last year\u2019s series will receive a certificate from NYU Human Resources indicating completion of formal training requirements for Advanced Cultural Competency. Advanced Cultural Competency holders will also be recognized at the NIA Awards, sponsored by The Center for Multicultural Education and Programs and the Hallmark Awards sponsored by the Division of Student Affairs at NYU.    Space is limited to 45 participants so early registration is encouraged. Location of seminars will be given after notification of enrollment.

Launched in Fall 2008, the ACT-Institute is designed to explore concepts such as diversity, social justice, identity and inclusion particularly as they relate to the work administrators engage with students and colleagues. Participants will gain both insights and practical tools to inform their personal lens, which we believe will assist efforts to impact institutional, cultural and individual practices. Participants can be nominated to apply by colleagues or self-apply.    The Foundations seminar is the first in the series and serves as a required prerequisite in order to enroll in any of the other seminars. Foundations offers a broad overview of the complexities of diversity issues in higher education and provides common language and shared theoretical frameworks for analyzing these issues. Foundations will be offered twice: Friday, October 17, 2014, 1-4pm and Friday, November 7, 2014, 1-4pm. Participants need only attend ONE of these sessions. For professionals who attended Foundations last year, the prerequisite requirement has been met and they are therefore eligible to attend any of the subsequent seminars. However, pre-registration is always required for participation in ALL ACT-I seminars.    Content seminars will more closely examine selected areas of diversity and social justice in higher education and NYU specifically, with special attention given to the Global Network University. Lunch is provided at all ACT-I seminars. Selected seminars are scheduled for the these dates:       December 5, 2014, 1-4pm: Religion, Faith and Spirituality in Higher Education     January 30, 2015, 1-4pm: Race, Ethnicity and Culture at NYU and Beyond     February 20, 2015, 1-4pm: Socio-economic Diversity-Meeting the Opportunities and Challenges Through Student Affairs     March 7, 2015 1-4pm: Undocumented Students     March 27, 2015, 1-4pm: Gender and Sexuality in Colleges and Universities     April 3, 2015, 1-4pm: The Global/International Experience for Student and Professional     May 1, 2015, 1-4pm: The Wrap-Up, Best Practices and Practical Application **Mandatory for all those seeking certification**      The NYU Human Resources Department recognizes the ACT-Institute as a certified professional development training. New participants who complete the prerequisite Foundations &amp; Wrap-Up seminars and any three specialized seminars during the 2014-15 series will receive Basic Cultural Competency certification. For those new or returning participants who complete or have completed the prerequisite Foundations &amp; Wrap-Up seminar and at least five of the six selected content seminars during this or last year\u2019s series will receive a certificate from NYU Human Resources indicating completion of formal training requirements for Advanced Cultural Competency. Advanced Cultural Competency holders will also be recognized at the NIA Awards, sponsored by The Center for Multicultural Education and Programs and the Hallmark Awards sponsored by the Division of Student Affairs at NYU.    Space is limited to 45 participants so early registration is encouraged. Location of seminars will be given after notification of enrollment.
