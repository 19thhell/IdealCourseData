The purpose of these fellowships is to promote research and curriculum development in subjects related to legal issues in these areas. The fellowships broadly define social enterprise as the use of business strategies to solve intractable social problems and advance a social mission. It encompasses topics including but not limited to start-up social ventures, corporate social responsibility, impact investing, and microfinance. The Fellowship is open to third year law students and recent law school graduates with the strongest credentials and the most exciting ideas that have the potential to impact the fast-growing field of social entrepreneurship.   The Law and Social Enterprise Fellowships are being administered by NYU School of Law under the auspices of the Jacobson Leadership Program in Law and Business. Fellows are expected to produce a substantial piece of work during their time at the Law School. A proposed plan for the Fellowship year \u2014 specifying the need for the project, goals to be met by the project, how the goals will further the field of law and social enterprise, and a timeline \u2014 will provide the basis for applications. Fellows will work on their project and participate in activities of the Jacobson Leadership Program and other faculty workshops and colloquia.   The Fellows will benefit from the mentorship of Jacobson Leadership Program Faculty Directors Helen S. Scott, Professor of Law, and Gerald Rosenfeld, Distinguished Scholar in Residence and Senior Lecturer, Business Clinical Professor of Business at NYU Stern and Vice Chairman of US Investment Banking and Strategic Advisor at Lazard Ltd. Fellows receive a stipend, anticipated to be approximately $50,000 for the coming academic year, as well as health insurance and a space to work in the Law School. The Directors will select the fellows. Projects will be selected for funding based upon the potential of their research to enable a more robust and nuanced understanding of the relationships between law and social enterprise.    Fellows will be chosen on the basis of their demonstrated academic excellence, their commitment to social enterprise, and the quality and feasibility of the proposed project.   The application cycle for the Social Enterprise Fellowship is currently open and will close on February 27th at midnight. The Fellowship will last for one year, from September 2015 through August 2016. Applications should include: a short statement describing prior experiences that demonstrate applicant\u2019s interest in law and social entrepreneurship, and aspirations for future work in this area, as well as the Project proposal and plan.
