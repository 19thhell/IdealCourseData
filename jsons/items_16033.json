On the north side of the entrance to Coles Sports Center, a weedy lawn was removed to make way for a flower border.

Ever since, Manhattan has been steadily developed into one of the world\u2019s most altered landscapes. Few vestiges remain of the forests, grasslands, wetlands, and streams that once combined to form a uniquely varied ecosystem on the island. Coinciding with the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Hudson, Wildlife Conservation ecologist Dr. Eric Sanderson has digitally established The \u201cMannahatta Project,\u201d an educational program which aims to reconstruct what is known about the ecology of Manhattan as it existed before European settlement.     The NYU Native Woodland Garden in Schwartz Plaza, on the east face of NYU\u2019s Bobst Library, was the first planting to be done in association with the Mannahatta Project. The garden features a variety of plant species identified by Dr. Sanderson as likely to have been present on the day Henry Hudson first sailed by the island. Native trees, shrubs, and perennials were planted among the existing non-native trees to mimic the natural process of ecological species succession. As stated by the garden designer Darrel Morrison in his design proposal, the design brings a \u201cmicrocosmic and stylized version of the botanic diversity and aesthetic character of a native New York woodland into a highly urban environment.\u201d                         CONTACT US   If you have any service requests relating to the Garden Shop, please contact the NYU Client Services Center.

Some of the plants featured in the garden were Sedum \u2018Autumn Joy,\u2019 Liatris spicata, Zinnia, Cornus alba \u2018Bailhalo,\u2019 Heuchera \u2018Amber Waves.\u2019 Begonia \u2018Sinbad,\u2019 Asclepias curassivica, Coleus \u2018Alabama Sunset\u2019 Pennisetum (Purple Fountain Grass), Cuphea \u2018David\u2019 and Torenia. The plants were selected according to the flower beds' different micro climates. The eastern end of the flower bed, close to Mercer street, features plants that tolerate high moisture. Plants on the western end, closer to Coles Sports Center, were selected for their tolerance of drier soil and more sunlight.   On the north side of the entrance to Coles Sports Center, a weedy lawn was removed to make way for a flower border. Some of the plantings within the garden included Brillantaisia subulugarica (Giant Sage), Ruellia elegans, Euphorbia, Ipomea batatas (Sweet Potato Vine), Rudbeckia \u2018Cherokee Sunset,\u2019 Zinnia \u2018Profusion,\u2019 Helichrysum petiolaris, Coleus \u2018Alabama Sunset,\u2019 Caladium, Gazania, Centaurea, and Scaevola.   Both gardens remain colorful throughout most of the fall season. A mixture of annuals, perennials, and shrubs were planted to these areas for year round interest.

Ever since, Manhattan has been steadily developed into one of the world\u2019s most altered landscapes. Few vestiges remain of the forests, grasslands, wetlands, and streams that once combined to form a uniquely varied ecosystem on the island. Coinciding with the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Hudson, Wildlife Conservation ecologist Dr. Eric Sanderson has digitally established The \u201cMannahatta Project,\u201d an educational program which aims to reconstruct what is known about the ecology of Manhattan as it existed before European settlement.     The NYU Native Woodland Garden in Schwartz Plaza, on the east face of NYU\u2019s Bobst Library, was the first planting to be done in association with the Mannahatta Project. The garden features a variety of plant species identified by Dr. Sanderson as likely to have been present on the day Henry Hudson first sailed by the island. Native trees, shrubs, and perennials were planted among the existing non-native trees to mimic the natural process of ecological species succession. As stated by the garden designer Darrel Morrison in his design proposal, the design brings a \u201cmicrocosmic and stylized version of the botanic diversity and aesthetic character of a native New York woodland into a highly urban environment.\u201d                         CONTACT US   If you have any service requests relating to the Garden Shop, please contact the NYU Client Services Center.
