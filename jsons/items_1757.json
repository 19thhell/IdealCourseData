At least two of these must be chosen from the department\u2019s four designated core courses: Political Theory (POL-UA 100) Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300) Comparative Politics (POL-UA 500) International Politics (POL-UA 700) At least one course must be taken in three of the department\u2019s five fields: Analytical Politics Political Theory American Government and Politics Comparative Politics International Politics Only courses with a POL-UA number can be counted toward the politics major. The following internship and reading and research courses do not count toward the major in politics: Internships in Politics and Government I , II (POL-UA 970, 971) and Readings and Research (POL-UA 990).   The department also administers the Major in International Relations. For a description of this major, see the section on International Relations in this Bulletin.      Honors Program For admission to and completion of the department\u2019s honors program, students must have a GPA of 3.65 both overall and in the major. The deadline for applying to the honors program is March 1 in the spring of the junior year. To be eligible for application to the honors program, students must have completed, or must be currently enrolled in, Quantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800). In addition, they must have completed, or must be currently enrolled in, either Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) or Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2).   Once admitted to the honors program, students register for Senior Honors I (POL-UA 950), to be taken in the Fall of their senior year. In this course, honors students prepare a research proposal for their thesis, which they write in the Spring of their senior year while taking Senior Honors II (POL-UA 951). The thesis must be approved by both the instructor teaching Senior Honors II and the second reader of the thesis, including approval of an oral defense. Successful completion of all honors requirements permits students to graduate with honors in politics. Detailed information about the program may be obtained from the department.     Minor   The minor requires five 4-point courses (20 points) in the department, chosen in consultation with politics departmental advisers and completed with a grade of C or better. A minor program may reflect a special emphasis in one of the department\u2019s four fields or subfields. No special emphasis on a particular subfield is required for the minor, however, nor is a choice of subfield reflected on a student\u2019s academic record or transcript. Only courses with a POL-UA number not also counted toward another major or minor can be counted toward the politics minor.    Prelaw   Although law schools do not require any particular major or course of study, political science is an especially useful field for students planning legal study and a career in law. For this reason, it is not surprising that, over the years, more law students have majored in this field than in any other. The Association of American Law Schools has suggested that among the areas of importance in prelegal education are the study of the political organization of societies, the democratic processes of Western societies, the freedom of individuals, and the art of peaceful, orderly adaptation to change. The association also suggests that students develop the power to think both creatively and analytically. We recommend that students interested in a prelaw course of study choose courses in consultation with the College of Arts and Science prelaw adviser in Silver Center, Room 901; 212-998-8160."}]},

Information on all children is recorded by the National Data Evaluation Center, in Columbus, Ohio, and is analyzed and reported by the Reading Recovery Project. In addition to providing the districts with the standardized evaluation results and other data related to program implementation, the Reading Recovery Project at New York University publishes the research findings, geared toward the general educational community. The most recent reports available from NYU's Reading Recovery Project's (or online in PDF format), summarize results for Reading Recovery students in New York City and New Jersey for the school year 2007-2008. The reported results demonstrate that:       1. NYU-affiliated districts provide quality instruction and efficient implementation of Reading Recovery, as evidenced by a high proportion of at-risk students who successfully complete the program. 2. Reading Recovery children catch up with their peers scoring within the classroom average on various literacy measures, and being able to read texts of appropriate level of difficulty (using an Observation Survey of Early Literacy Achievement, Clay (2002).          3. Reading Recovery is cost effective, as it reduces rates of retention, or referral and placement to special education for Reading Recovery children, when compared to other at-risk students.    4. Reading Recovery children maintain their literacy gains beyond the first grade, and achieve similar results on standardized tests as their classroom peers.       The New York City and New Jersey reports corroborate earlier research which demonstrates that Reading Recovery has a substantial positive impact on children's literacy development. Reviews of Reading Recovery research by Pinnell (1995) and by Askew et al. (1998) provide excellent sources for research findings on various aspects of the program such as teaching and learning, teacher development, program implementation, as well as comprehensive evidence on program success and cost-effectiveness, culled from the extensive body of state-wide and international research spanning the last three decades.    Researchers with the Reading Recovery Project have also explored some important aspects of program implementation. Ashdown and Simic (1998) reported on the link between daily delivery of Reading Recovery lessons and success in reading, emphasizing the intensive nature of Reading Recovery instruction as a key to accelerated learning. Ashdown and Simic (1999) have also reported data from a large sample of students in the metropolitan area, which suggest that Reading Recovery also provides an appropriate solution to reading problems for students whose native language is not English. Currently in preparation are studies focusing on cost-effectiveness, and on factors influencing program effectiveness in diverse settings.

Look for events, postings and photos as we share our rich history and success.    Reading Recovery &reg; is an effective early literacy intervention that provides a second chance for students who do not get off to a good start in literacy learning. In 1989, NYU became the first Reading Recovery Teacher Leader Training site in the Northeast. 'Recovery' means getting back onto a successful learning path after a slow or difficult start and Reading Recovery is a short-term intervention designed to accelerate progress and lift achievement levels for the lowest performing first grade students. Students receive 30 minutes of daily, one-on-one instruction from a highly-trained Reading Recovery teacher for 12 to 20 weeks. In conjunction with good classroom instruction, Reading Recovery assists students who initially struggle with early literacy learning to reach grade-level performance in reading and writing in a remarkably short period of time and significantly reduces the number of children requiring additional services.    NYU now serves as the primary teacher leader training site for Reading Recovery in New York and New Jersey. Fairfax County, Virginia and Souderton, Pennsylvania are also affiliated to NYU. Since 1999, approximately 119,000 children have been served throughout the NYU site. NYU prepares teacher leaders who, following a year of graduate level coursework, are qualified to train Reading Recovery teachers in their local school districts or regions. The project is a cooperative venture between the university and a school district or a consortium of districts that have made the required long-term committment to implement Reading Recovery.    Descubriendo La Lectura (DLL) is the Spanish version of Reading Recovery. DLL works with the lowest performing first grade Spanish speaking students in reading and writing. The goal of this program is to enable these students to read and write within the average band of their bilingual classrooms. Because Reading Recovery instruction is in Spanish, teachers receive specific training in order to provide DLL services to children.      Read More Tributes to M.
