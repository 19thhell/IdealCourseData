Students will understand the role of the various participants in the capital markets, including but not limited to the issuer, underwriter, financial advisor, legal counsel, rating agency, insurer and investor. Specific case studies and assignments will explore important events in the municipal market that have resulted in significant change in participant behaviors and market volatility.      Students will become familiar with standard market calculations and analysis including bond sizing and structuring, net present value analysis and credit/risk analysis.
