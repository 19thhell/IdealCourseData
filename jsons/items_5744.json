Just by being a parent and a student, you have already proven that nothing is unreachable, and that you have great strength and determination. Below you will find a number of resources that may be helpful to you as you balance both these roles.   NYU Family Care   NYU Family Care is working to support NYU's working parents with children aged newborn through school-age. Many of the initiatives are also available to student parents. These include access to the NYU Babysitting Registry , Nursing Mother and Lactation Rooms , Parenting Education Programs, NYU Parents Network , and school and child care options.

We are committed to clinical training in both pathways emphasizing a well balanced, hands-on experience in pediatrics that prepares residents equally well for careers as pediatric generalists or pediatric subspecialists.   Our pediatric training program is fully accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.
