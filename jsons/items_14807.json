Anticipate that all costs related to study at NYU will increase approximately 5% for the 2015-2016 academic year and every subsequent year. This increase may be reflected on the I-20 or DS-2019 you receive and therefore may not match precisely the amounts listed below. If you have questions about exact fees, check the NYU Bursar's Office website at www.nyu.edu/bursar .   Find your school at NYU in the column on the left. The columns to the right indicate the 2014-2015 full-time tuition of 24 credits (one academic year) plus service fees, estimated living expenses and health insurance. The total estimated expense plus any additional dependent expenses is what you must document for issuance of the I-20 or DS-2019. Full payment of tuition and fees is due upon registration for classes, which takes place in August/September for the fall semester and January for the spring semester.   Students must demonstrate that they have sufficient liquid assets to cover tuition and living expenses for at least one year of study.

Supporting documents may include but are not limited to:     Personal funds, a current financial statement, printed on letterhead and signed by a bank official, dated within six months.   A personal loan, a pre-approval letter confirming amount for which the loan is approved. A loan application is not sufficient.   An individual sponsor, the OGS Affidavit of Support plus a bank statement and/or letter from employer confirming annual salary and sponsor's position. (The sponsor's annual salary should be at least 3 times the amount of money they are providing to the student).   If you will be staying somewhere where you will receive free room and board, you need to provide a letter from who you are staying with indicating the amount of support they will provide for you and the duration of time you will stay with them. The in-kind value of room and board is estimated to be $10,000 per year.    An organizational sponsor, a copy of an award letter from a sponsoring organization specifying the amount of the award, its duration, and the terms of renewal, or  NYU funding, a copy of an NYU award letter for an NYU scholarship, assistantship, or fellowship.     All financial documentation must be in English or have certified English translations attached to the original and must be dated from within the last six months.     We don't accept income tax documents or personal property deeds such as ownership of property, a car, jewelry, etc. as evidence of acceptable financial documentation.

Anticipate that all costs related to study at NYU will increase approximately 5% for the 2015-2016 academic year and every subsequent year. This increase may be reflected on the I-20 or DS-2019 you receive and therefore may not match precisely the amounts listed below. If you have questions about exact fees, check the NYU Bursar's Office website at www.nyu.edu/bursar .   Find your school at NYU in the column on the left. The columns to the right indicate the 2014-2015 full-time tuition of 24 credits (one academic year) plus service fees, estimated living expenses and health insurance. The total estimated expense plus any additional dependent expenses is what you must document for issuance of the I-20 or DS-2019. Full payment of tuition and fees is due upon registration for classes, which takes place in August/September for the fall semester and January for the spring semester.   Students must demonstrate that they have sufficient liquid assets to cover tuition and living expenses for at least one year of study.
