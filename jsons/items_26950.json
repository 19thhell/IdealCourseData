Dance Admissions FAQ Prospective Undergraduate Student FAQ  Are DVD auditions accepted? Auditioning in person is highly recommended - however, for certain situations (such as for international students unable to travel to the U.S. or professional dancers on tour) DVD submissions will be considered in the place of an in-person audition. Please contact the Dance Department in order to be granted permission to submit a DVD. The following guidelines will apply for those applicants granted permission to submit a DVD audition. 1) Please be sure to clearly identify yourself so that the Admissions Committee can easily follow you on the DVD. Your DVD should include the following in this order: An abbreviated ballet barre, adagio, and contemporary technique movement across the floor (these three portions should total approximately 20 minutes), and a short solo lasting 2-3 minutes in the dance form of your preference. International students must also include a brief verbal presentation in English addressing their interest in the Tisch Dance program. DVDs along with all supplemental materials (8\"X10\" full-body photo, dance resume, and completed Audition Information Form) should be submitted directly to the Department of Dance. Do not send these materials to the Office of Admissions. 2) DVD auditions that do not adhere to these guidelines will be deemed incomplete and will not be considered for admission. top Can I have a double major or minor if enrolled in the dance program? (BFA only) Yes! If you choose to do so, Dance will be considered your primary major - this means that you'll need to discuss with an advisor how and if the additional courses required in order to complete your 2nd major (or minor) will fit into the Dance Department's schedule. In some cases, students may require an additional semester or year to complete the academic requirements of their 2nd major. top How do I apply to the program? / How do I sign up for an audition? Prospective dance majors should apply via the Common Application. Please see the ' Admissions ' tab for complete information. Once you've completed your Common Application and it has been processed by Undergraduate Admissions, you will receive information on how to sign up for an audition.  top I'm interested in visiting Tisch Dance. How do I arrange a visit? The Tisch Department of Dance holds formal student-led tours most Thursday mornings at 9:45 a.m. throughout the Fall and Spring semesters. Visit the Tisch Dance Department Tours page for exact dates and to schedule a tour! Please note that the Dance Department is regretfully unable to accommodate walk-in visits. top I am also interested in another program in Tisch School of the Arts. Can I apply to multiple programs within Tisch? For prospective BFA undergraduate students, the answer is no - you are only allowed to apply for one program at a time through Tisch School of the Arts. For prospective MFA graduate students, it may be possible to apply for more than one program at a time but note that a separate application and fee must be submitted for each program you apply for. top I am interested in jazz/tap/musical theater dance. Does your program offer these techniques? Our program focuses on ballet and contemporary technique - however, there are many opportunities to explore other styles, particularly through contemporary classes and via the many showings you'll have an opportunity to perform in and/or choreograph during your time at Tisch Dance. Outside classes at various New York City dance and theater institutions are also readily available. top I am interested in transferring to your dance program. What is the process? Submit an application to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions - note that while the transfer application deadline is April 1st, the Dance Department strongly recommends that your application be submitted no later than February 10th in order to ensure an in-person audition. If accepted, you'll begin the program as a first year student. Also note that any dance credits you have earned from other institutions will not transfer to our program; Admissions will determine which academic credits (for example, humanities, social sciences, etc.) transfer based on their requirements. top I am interested in your program but do not have much contemporary dance experience. Should I still apply? Absolutely. We realize that not all dancers have been exposed to a wide range of dance aesthetics - that said, the dance faculty is seeking applicants who are technically strong dancers. You should be familiar with and able to navigate a technique class in both contemporary and ballet. Overall, we seek dancers that are able to absorb all styles of dance as well as show a willingness to try new styles.                                          top If not accepted, will faculty provide feedback? Regrettably, no - while you are more than welcome to reapply the following year, the faculty is unable to provide feedback on the audition. top Is it possible to minor in Dance? No - Tisch Dance does not offer a minor in Dance. Interested students should contact Open Arts to inquire about minoring in dance within their department. top Is there financial assistance available for international students? As there are a very limited number of tuition scholarships and graduate financial aid for international students (F-1 and J-1 visas). International applicants are urged to seek aid from their home country's government and other outside sources. For more information on financial aid for international students, visit the NYU Financial Aid Web Site: http://www.nyu.edu/financial.aid/international.html   top What should I bring to the audition?    Dance r\u00e9sum\u00e9    (1) 8\u201dX10\u201d full body dance photo (in dance wear, no particular dance pose)    Prepared solo (2-3 minutes) in dance style of your choice    Ipod or CD with music for the solo Audition Information Form (which will be sent to you after you've signed up for an audition) top What style of contemporary do you teach? There is no one style of contemporary taught at Tisch Dance - a typical student will have the opportunity to take class with many different contemporary instructors over the course of their study, each of whom come from a diverse background and teach a different style of contemporary dance. top What will take place at the audition? Auditions will consist of an abbreviated ballet class (including a full ballet barre and center) as well as an abbreviated contemporary class (including contemporary combinations in the center and across the floor). At this point, the faculty will make a determination on which students will be invited to show their prepared solo (approximately 2-3 minutes long) and conduct a one-on-one interview with a faculty member. The audition will last approximately two hours.
