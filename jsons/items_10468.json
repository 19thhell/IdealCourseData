Once the doctor was asked to make a house call by a woman who believed her daughter might be dying. On his arrival, the physician finds a beautiful 20 year old woman named Alexandra who is feverish and initially unconscious. Although fully aware how ill she is, he nonetheless promises everyone that she will survive. He is immediately infatuated with the woman and spends days and nights at her home caring for this single patient. As Alexandra's condition worsens and she becomes convinced her death is imminent, she professes love for the doctor satisfying a basic need to experience love before she dies. Just before her death, the doctor lies about their relationship to Alexandra's mother. Later the doctor marries an \"ill-tempered woman\" who sleeps all day.

His tale also addresses three other intriguing issues--the duties and personal lives of doctors, lying, and the physician-patient relationship. Doctor Ivanitch comments early in the story that a physician's duty comes before everything else. His private life seems shallow and overshadowed by his responsibilities as a physician. He shares his feelings of inadequacy and helplessness even as members of the patient's family are demonstrating unwavering confidence in his ability. The doctor's lying is disturbingly frequent. He lies to his patient, her mother, and possibly to himself. How accurate or even factual is the doctor's account? When is it appropriate (beneficial or at least humane) to lie to a patient or their family?

The course has a goal to describe and discuss the development of the Marxist thought on art in Russia before and after the October revolution. It begins with the writings by Plekhanov on the Marxist aesthetics and follows its evolution through Russian avant-garde and Proletkult up to the theories of the theories of the Socialist Realism of the 1930s. In the framework of the seminar we will be reading also the authors relevant for the Russian Marxist art critique like Lukacs, Brecht and Adorno.    Tolstoy vs. Dostoevsky    RUSSN-GA 2208 Lounsbery. 4 points. 2013-14.

Chekhov    RUSSN-GA 2210 Lounsbery. 4 points. 2013-14. Critical introduction to Chekhov's work. Examination of Chekhov's creative art, with emphasis on the evolution of the thematic and formal elements in his prose. Chekhov's place within the Russian literary tradition is assessed.

The novel has been for a long time understood by its theorists as the genre par excellence of truthlessness. This course attempts to reevaluate this view, proposing that the 19th-century novel in particular should be understood as responding to the emerging tendency to view truth as inseparable from, rather than opposed to, time. This tendency, then, can be said to account for the specific shape and the remarkable \"success\" of the 19th-century European novel. It is in these novels that narrative's essential relation to time achieves its most dramatic fruition. Readings from Goethe, Hegel, Balzac, Stendhal, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Henry James, Bakhtin, Koj\u00e8ve, Peter Brooks.

Readings from Goethe, Balzac, Constant, Dostoevsky, Goncharov, Flaubert, Lermontov, Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Turgenev.    Malevich    RUSSN-GA 2290 Seminar. Groys. 4 points. 2013-14.

Once the doctor was asked to make a house call by a woman who believed her daughter might be dying. On his arrival, the physician finds a beautiful 20 year old woman named Alexandra who is feverish and initially unconscious. Although fully aware how ill she is, he nonetheless promises everyone that she will survive. He is immediately infatuated with the woman and spends days and nights at her home caring for this single patient. As Alexandra's condition worsens and she becomes convinced her death is imminent, she professes love for the doctor satisfying a basic need to experience love before she dies. Just before her death, the doctor lies about their relationship to Alexandra's mother. Later the doctor marries an \"ill-tempered woman\" who sleeps all day. Did he marry for love, convenience, money, or penance?                                   Commentary              Turgenev's story highlights the requirement that all people have for love no matter how imperfect or tragic. His tale also addresses three other intriguing issues--the duties and personal lives of doctors, lying, and the physician-patient relationship. Doctor Ivanitch comments early in the story that a physician's duty comes before everything else. His private life seems shallow and overshadowed by his responsibilities as a physician. He shares his feelings of inadequacy and helplessness even as members of the patient's family are demonstrating unwavering confidence in his ability. The doctor's lying is disturbingly frequent. He lies to his patient, her mother, and possibly to himself. How accurate or even factual is the doctor's account? When is it appropriate (beneficial or at least humane) to lie to a patient or their family? This short story explores the subject of romantic involvement between physicians and patients and raises some interesting questions about the concept of desire. The doctor's confession to a stranger reveals the vexing situations that physicians sometimes find themselves in.

Welcome to the Desert of the Real: Literature, Film, and the Politics of Everyday Life  COLIT-UA 300 Instructor: Sonia Werner Day/Time: M/T/W 3:30-5:40 pm At a moment when popular culture is obsessed with reality television and   new technology permits \u201creal time\u201d access to current events, this   course examines the concept of reality in literary, philosophical and   cinematic contexts. What is reality and how can we know it? How can we   grasp the ideological and political dimensions of what constitutes the   real? How can we understand the concept of \u201ceveryday life?\u201d We begin the   course by reading excerpts from Plato\u2019s Republic and viewing The   Matrix, as well as evaluating key writings by Karl Marx and Henri   Lefebvre alongside Charlie Chaplin\u2019s Modern Times to approach the notion   of \u201ceveryday life.\u201d We will then unpack the aesthetics of realist   literature, magical realism and surrealism by engaging short writings by   authors such as Nikolai Gogol, Herman Melville, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez,   Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Charles Baudelaire and Andr\u00e9 Breton. Lastly we will   evaluate popular culture and the force of the photographic and cinematic   image by turning to the critical writings of Walter Benjamin, Roland   Barthes, Susan Sontag, Jean Baudrillard and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek. Here our   primary texts will range from the photography of contemporary artists   and documentary films to commercial advertisements. This is an active   learning course that sets out to make sense of our lived experience.   Assignments will range from the conventional to the creative, and   dynamic classroom participation is required. Contact the instructor at saw343@nyu.edu with further questions.  Shortcuts: The Aesthetics of Brevity COLIT-UA 132 Instructor: Kevin Goldstein Day/Time: M/T/W 6-8:10 pm For sale: baby shoes, never worn.     Ernest Hemingway Novel, n. A short story padded.     Ambrose Bierce, The Devil\u2019s Dictionary This course examines concision both as a formal element of literature, music, and film, and as a window into a host of genres and artistic movements. From Bash\u014d to the Ramones, artists have prized concision, variously associating it with clarity, ambiguity, memorability, purity, or evocative simplicity. Yet brevity is frequently associated with the marginal and the ephemeral. For much of its history, the lyric poem was relegated to the status of minor genre vis-\u00e0-vis the epic. Likewise, novels and feature-length films perennially overshadow short stories and films. Throughout the course, we will posit brevity as constitutive of a qualitatively distinct aesthetic experience. Is the short story, for example, fundamentally different from the novel? Are short works more memorable? What features do haiku share with Borscht Belt jokes, biblical parables with advertising slogans? How does the length of a work reflect the aesthetic, economic, and even political circumstances of its creation?  We will analyze (and produce some of our own) short stories and films, flash or microfiction, one-act plays, vignettes, blog and twitter posts, fragments, parables, fables, aphorisms, jokes, haiku, lyric poems, ghazals, slogans, koans, obituaries, epitaphs, radically reductive translations, pop and punk songs. We will end the course by placing brevity in conversation with an analogous phenomenon, minimalism, in music, architecture, art and design, considering the work of Agnes Martin, Donald Judd, Frank Stella, La Monte Young, Phillip Glass, among others.
