Thomas      Associate Professor of Fine Arts    B.A. 1980, Bryn Mawr College; M.A. 1982, New York University; PhD 1990, New York University       I teach and conduct research across the fields of Late Antique, Byzantine, and Eastern Christian art. My current research focusing on textile furnishings, portraits of the Egyptian desert fathers, and monastic dress in Late Antiquity, has led me to investigate social and ritual space, even as it has renewed my interest in developments of ancient traditions during Late Antiquity, and the reception of Late Antique art in modern times. I remain concerned with issues of craft and reuse, especially as they involve perception of the artwork, particular circumstances of commission and production and, more generally, art commerce all along the chronological continuum from Late Antiquity until the present day. My work in Eastern Christian art, especially, addresses the movement of materials, artworks, motifs, concepts, artisans, and consumers of art across diverse cultural territories. Although functionally technilliterate, expert assistance helps me as I continue to explore the growing utility of digital tools and resources for documentation, research, and the presentation of research.

Yet, perhaps surprisingly, there is little explicit evidence of parental grief over such deaths: ancient burial grounds offer at best ambiguous evidence for children's commemoration, and letters and speeches directed at those who had suffered bereavement encourage stoic self-possession in the face of tragedy.\u00a0Late ancient Christians differed little from their Jewish and Greco-Roman contemporaries in these regards; if anything, the focus on an all-knowing Deity intensified calls for parental equanimity in theological treatises. Beneath these elite conversations about childhood mortality, however, lurks a broader if quieter stratum of discourses surrounding families facing grief and loss. This lecture examines the treatment of biblical characters who had suffered (or expected to suffer) the death of a child in late ancient homilies and liturgical writings.\u00a0 By expounding, inventing, and valorizing parental bereavement in the patriarchs and prophets of the Hebrew Scriptures, late ancient writers could give voice to their and their audiences' experiences of loss, outrage, despair, and need for consolation in ways that shaped conversations about the death of children for centuries to come.    --Reception to follow    Maria E. Doerfler received her Ph.D. from Duke in 2013 and has since served as Assistant Professor of the History of Christianity at Duke Divinity School. A historian of exegesis, her research interests range from the Syriac East to the Latin West. \u00a0Her particular focus lies with the deployment of texts and their interpretation in situations of personal or communal crisis. \u00a0Her dissertation monograph, currently under review with a university press, seeks to address the interplay between philosophical, exegetical, and Roman legal discourses in monastic settings at the turn of the fifth century. \u00a0Other recent publications include articles on the rhetorical construction of Judaism in Ambrose of Milan ( Church History ), North African approaches to ascetic exegesis ( Journal of Early Christian Studies ), Trinitarian developments in early Christian interpretations of Genesis 18 ( Journal of Ecclesiastical History ), and the death of children in Eastern Patristic literature ( Le Mus\u00e9on ).\u00a0 During her time at ISAW, she will begin to lay the groundwork for her second book, a study of Christian responses to childhood and infant mortality in late antiquity. The monograph will orient itself around a set of commonly deployed passages from the Hebrew Scriptures and, to a lesser extent, the New Testament, by which Christians sought to lament, console the grieving, reason about death, and even indict God over the untimely passing of children.
