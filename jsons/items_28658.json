They may take the form of University scholarships, federal or state grants, or outside scholarships.   For most undergraduates, eligibility for a merit-based and/or need-based scholarship is determined upon entrance to the University based on prior academic strengths and, if you apply for financial aid , your demonstrated financial need. Typically you will continue to receive for subsequent academic years the amount of scholarship you received for your first year (subject to the availability of funds), as long as the following criteria are met:       You are a full-time student (at least 12 points).   You applied for financial aid on time.   You are meeting the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards.   You have approximately the same amount of financial need that you had in prior years.       New York University Scholarships   Descriptions of University-Wide and School-Based scholarships at NYU for which you may qualify are provided in the Undergraduate Admissions area of the NYU website. All admitted undergraduate students are automatically considered for these programs based on academic merit. Except where noted, no separate application form is required.   Graduate students are usually offered scholarships for each separate academic year as determined by their individual schools within NYU.   Note: If your eligibility for any federal aid you receive is jeopardized for reasons other than financial need or academic merit (e.g. if you are in default on a federal loan, or if you did not respond to the University's requests for tax information and income verification ), then your NYU scholarship may also be affected.       Federal Grant Programs                                                  FEDERAL PELL GRANT                               The Federal Pell Grant Program provides assistance to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need according to economic criteria and program requirements established by the federal government. To be eligible, you must enroll in a degree program and be matriculated for your first bachelor's degree. (You are not eligible if you have already completed a bachelor's degree.) An estimated award will be listed in your award package if we think you will be eligible. Your Student Aid Report (SAR) contains the official evaluation of your eligibility from the U.S. Department of Education. When you review your SAR, follow the instructions to make changes if necessary\u2014including updating your record to reflect actual tax figures if you used estimated data in order to meet the NYU application deadline\u2014and then save the final SAR for your records. You may also review and make changes to your SAR in the &quot;FAFSA Follow-up&quot; area of the FAFSA Web site .                                                              TEACHER EDUCATION ASSISTANCE FOR COLLEGE AND HIGHER EDUCATION (TEACH) GRANT (Steinhardt students only)                               Through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, Congress created the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program that provides grants of up to $3,965* per year to students who intend to teach in a public or private elementary or secondary school that serves students from low-income families.     Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen.   Be enrolled as an undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, or graduate student in a postsecondary educational institution that has chosen to participate in the TEACH Grant Program.   Be enrolled in course work that is necessary to begin a career in teaching or plan to complete such course work. Such course work may include subject area courses (e.g., math courses for a student who intends to be a math teacher).   Meet certain academic achievement requirements (generally, scoring above the 75th percentile on a college admissions test or maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 3.25).   Complete an online TEACH Grant Entrance Counseling session each eligible year.   Sign a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve each eligible year.     * Per federal mandate, the maximum amount for TEACH Grant awards for academic year 2013-2014 (first disbursed on or after 10/1/13 and before 10/1/14) is $3,965. The maximum amount for TEACH Grant awards for academic year 2014-2015 (first disbursed on or after 10/1/14 and before 10/1/15) is $3,708.                                                              FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY GRANTS (FSEOG)                               The FSEOG program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education and administered by New York University to provide assistance to students with exceptional financial need. All students who qualify are automatically considered for this grant. However, our funds from this program are very limited.                                                              VETERANS BENEFITS                               The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs offers education grant assistance to qualified U.S. military service members and their families.   &gt; more                        State Scholarship and Grant Programs   New York State offers a wide variety of grants and scholarships to residents, subject to the annual availability of funds. Although application is made directly to the state and grants are awarded by the state, the amount each student is expected to receive is estimated and taken into account by NYU when assembling the student's financial aid package.                                                  NEW YORK STATE TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (TAP)                               Legal residents of the state of New York who are enrolled in a full-time or part-time degree program may be eligible for awards under this program. The award varies, depending on income and tuition cost. A separate application is necessary. &gt; more                                                              AID FOR PART-TIME STUDY (APTS)                               A financial aid program to help New York State residents pursuing part-time undergraduate degree study offers awards in amounts of up to $2,000 per academic year. To be eligible, the student must have filed a FAFSA and demonstrate financial need, must not have exhausted their TAP eligibility, must be otherwise eligible for financial aid, and must be enrolled for 3 to 11 credit points per term. A separate application is necessary, and is available here .                                                              ADDITIONAL NEW YORK STATE SCHOLARSHIPS AND GRANTS                               Additional New York State programs are listed at www.hesc.com . For complete information and application instructions, contact the New York Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC) toll-free at 1-888-697-4372.                                    Some students from outside New York State may qualify for funds from their own state scholarship programs that can be used at New York University. Contact your state financial aid agency (call 1-800-433-3243 to obtain contact information) to ask about program requirements and application procedures. When you receive an eligibility notice from your state program, you should submit it immediately to the NYU Office of Financial Aid.          Scholarships and Grants from Other Organizations   In addition to the sources of gift aid described above, you may also be eligible for a private scholarship or grant from an outside organization or agency. Some sources to explore are employers, unions, professional organizations, and community and special interest groups.   Many extensive scholarship search services are available free online, and a representative sample is included on the drop menu below. The scholarships and information presented by such services are not verified or endorsed by NYU. You must notify the Office of Financial Aid if you receive funds from any outside organization.

Outside scholarships are considered a financial aid resource and must be added to a student's financial aid award. The Office of Financial Aid first applies the outside scholarship to a student's unmet need that is not already covered by financial aid. In some cases, loans not based on financial need may be reduced (private loans, Federal Unsubsidized Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Graduate PLUS). If the student's need is already met by need-based aid, then that aid is replaced with the outside scholarship. Need-based loans are first replaced. If the outside scholarship exceeds the loan amounts, work-study and need-based grants are the next to be replaced. In most cases it is not necessary to reduce an NYU scholarship. Total aid (including outside assistance) cannot exceed the cost of attendance.

ELIGIBILITY: Preferred consideration is given to the dependents and spouses of uniformed members of the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY), the New York Police Department (NYPD), the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD), and other emergency response workers who died at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. (The dependents of other victims of 9/11 are not eligible.) There is no New York State residency requirement. Students must apply and be admitted to a four-year undergraduate degree program at New York University under normal admission standards.    Transfer students from other undergraduate programs are also eligible.    Students in graduate, professional, non-degree, or non-credit programs are not eligible for these scholarships.    Students must maintain full-time matriculation during each semester in which they receive scholarship funds and they must maintain satisfactory academic progress to continue to be eligible. Students may receive scholarship funds for up to eight semesters at NYU.     HOW TO APPLY: Once admitted, eligible students must first submit the FAFSA and also apply for the New York State World Trade Center Memorial Scholarship . NYU scholarship funds will then be used to accommodate any remaining need, up to the full cost of education at New York University.     COSTS COVERED: Scholarship awards may be used to support tuition, registration fees, and room and board (for NYU housing only), but not health services or other activity and support fees.

They may take the form of University scholarships, federal or state grants, or outside scholarships.   For most undergraduates, eligibility for a merit-based and/or need-based scholarship is determined upon entrance to the University based on prior academic strengths and, if you apply for financial aid , your demonstrated financial need. Typically you will continue to receive for subsequent academic years the amount of scholarship you received for your first year (subject to the availability of funds), as long as the following criteria are met:       You are a full-time student (at least 12 points).   You applied for financial aid on time.   You are meeting the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards.   You have approximately the same amount of financial need that you had in prior years.       New York University Scholarships   Descriptions of University-Wide and School-Based scholarships at NYU for which you may qualify are provided in the Undergraduate Admissions area of the NYU website. All admitted undergraduate students are automatically considered for these programs based on academic merit. Except where noted, no separate application form is required.   Graduate students are usually offered scholarships for each separate academic year as determined by their individual schools within NYU.   Note: If your eligibility for any federal aid you receive is jeopardized for reasons other than financial need or academic merit (e.g. if you are in default on a federal loan, or if you did not respond to the University's requests for tax information and income verification ), then your NYU scholarship may also be affected.       Federal Grant Programs                                                  FEDERAL PELL GRANT                               The Federal Pell Grant Program provides assistance to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need according to economic criteria and program requirements established by the federal government. To be eligible, you must enroll in a degree program and be matriculated for your first bachelor's degree. (You are not eligible if you have already completed a bachelor's degree.) An estimated award will be listed in your award package if we think you will be eligible. Your Student Aid Report (SAR) contains the official evaluation of your eligibility from the U.S. Department of Education. When you review your SAR, follow the instructions to make changes if necessary\u2014including updating your record to reflect actual tax figures if you used estimated data in order to meet the NYU application deadline\u2014and then save the final SAR for your records. You may also review and make changes to your SAR in the &quot;FAFSA Follow-up&quot; area of the FAFSA Web site .                                                              TEACHER EDUCATION ASSISTANCE FOR COLLEGE AND HIGHER EDUCATION (TEACH) GRANT (Steinhardt students only)                               Through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, Congress created the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program that provides grants of up to $3,965* per year to students who intend to teach in a public or private elementary or secondary school that serves students from low-income families.     Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen.   Be enrolled as an undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, or graduate student in a postsecondary educational institution that has chosen to participate in the TEACH Grant Program.   Be enrolled in course work that is necessary to begin a career in teaching or plan to complete such course work. Such course work may include subject area courses (e.g., math courses for a student who intends to be a math teacher).   Meet certain academic achievement requirements (generally, scoring above the 75th percentile on a college admissions test or maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 3.25).   Complete an online TEACH Grant Entrance Counseling session each eligible year.   Sign a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve each eligible year.     * Per federal mandate, the maximum amount for TEACH Grant awards for academic year 2013-2014 (first disbursed on or after 10/1/13 and before 10/1/14) is $3,965. The maximum amount for TEACH Grant awards for academic year 2014-2015 (first disbursed on or after 10/1/14 and before 10/1/15) is $3,708.                                                              FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY GRANTS (FSEOG)                               The FSEOG program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education and administered by New York University to provide assistance to students with exceptional financial need. All students who qualify are automatically considered for this grant. However, our funds from this program are very limited.                                                              VETERANS BENEFITS                               The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs offers education grant assistance to qualified U.S. military service members and their families.   &gt; more                        State Scholarship and Grant Programs   New York State offers a wide variety of grants and scholarships to residents, subject to the annual availability of funds. Although application is made directly to the state and grants are awarded by the state, the amount each student is expected to receive is estimated and taken into account by NYU when assembling the student's financial aid package.                                                  NEW YORK STATE TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (TAP)                               Legal residents of the state of New York who are enrolled in a full-time or part-time degree program may be eligible for awards under this program. The award varies, depending on income and tuition cost. A separate application is necessary. &gt; more                                                              AID FOR PART-TIME STUDY (APTS)                               A financial aid program to help New York State residents pursuing part-time undergraduate degree study offers awards in amounts of up to $2,000 per academic year. To be eligible, the student must have filed a FAFSA and demonstrate financial need, must not have exhausted their TAP eligibility, must be otherwise eligible for financial aid, and must be enrolled for 3 to 11 credit points per term. A separate application is necessary, and is available here .                                                              ADDITIONAL NEW YORK STATE SCHOLARSHIPS AND GRANTS                               Additional New York State programs are listed at www.hesc.com . For complete information and application instructions, contact the New York Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC) toll-free at 1-888-697-4372.                                    Some students from outside New York State may qualify for funds from their own state scholarship programs that can be used at New York University. Contact your state financial aid agency (call 1-800-433-3243 to obtain contact information) to ask about program requirements and application procedures. When you receive an eligibility notice from your state program, you should submit it immediately to the NYU Office of Financial Aid.          Scholarships and Grants from Other Organizations   In addition to the sources of gift aid described above, you may also be eligible for a private scholarship or grant from an outside organization or agency. Some sources to explore are employers, unions, professional organizations, and community and special interest groups.   Many extensive scholarship search services are available free online, and a representative sample is included on the drop menu below. The scholarships and information presented by such services are not verified or endorsed by NYU. You must notify the Office of Financial Aid if you receive funds from any outside organization.

Outside scholarships are considered a financial aid resource and must be added to a student's financial aid award. The Office of Financial Aid first applies the outside scholarship to a student's unmet need that is not already covered by financial aid. In some cases, loans not based on financial need may be reduced (private loans, Federal Unsubsidized Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Graduate PLUS). If the student's need is already met by need-based aid, then that aid is replaced with the outside scholarship. Need-based loans are first replaced. If the outside scholarship exceeds the loan amounts, work-study and need-based grants are the next to be replaced. In most cases it is not necessary to reduce an NYU scholarship. Total aid (including outside assistance) cannot exceed the cost of attendance.

ELIGIBILITY: Preferred consideration is given to the dependents and spouses of uniformed members of the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY), the New York Police Department (NYPD), the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD), and other emergency response workers who died at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. (The dependents of other victims of 9/11 are not eligible.) There is no New York State residency requirement. Students must apply and be admitted to a four-year undergraduate degree program at New York University under normal admission standards.    Transfer students from other undergraduate programs are also eligible.    Students in graduate, professional, non-degree, or non-credit programs are not eligible for these scholarships.    Students must maintain full-time matriculation during each semester in which they receive scholarship funds and they must maintain satisfactory academic progress to continue to be eligible. Students may receive scholarship funds for up to eight semesters at NYU.     HOW TO APPLY: Once admitted, eligible students must first submit the FAFSA and also apply for the New York State World Trade Center Memorial Scholarship . NYU scholarship funds will then be used to accommodate any remaining need, up to the full cost of education at New York University.     COSTS COVERED: Scholarship awards may be used to support tuition, registration fees, and room and board (for NYU housing only), but not health services or other activity and support fees.

This 8-week course is open to all NYU undergraduate students, facilitated by graduate students or NYU professionals, and takes place in the Fall and Spring semester.   The IGD model is designed to promote positive intergroup relations among students, staff, and faculty and improve the campus climate at NYU. The model focuses specifically on intergroup dynamics within the context of an institution of higher education while promoting awareness and change in intergroup relations at the individual, cultural, and institutional levels. The guiding assumption is that diversity is an institutional asset and can be used to enhance growth of the NYU community while also achieving specific educational outcomes.   Past IGD sections include: Race, Gender, Bi/Multiracial, Spirituality, Sexuality, Jewish/Muslim, Arts based Race, Faith and Sexuality, and Jewish/Black.

IGD was one the best experiences I'\u0080\u0099ve had and definitely the best class. I'\u0080\u0099m glad I took this class and got to meet such wonderful individuals and facilitators.&quot;     &quot;I felt challenged- left every session with a headache, which is a good thing. I'\u0080\u0099m excited to pursue actions from the things I'\u0080\u0099ve learned, continue with my sociology major, and take IGD again in the future. I'\u0080\u0099ve become more proud that I attend NYU.&quot;                                                    NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.
