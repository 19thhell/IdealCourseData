Mr. Ferrara is also president of the firm that bears his name, and is considered a leading contract manufacturer of designer clothing in New York City. For the past 24 years, Ferrara Manufacturing has employed hundreds of high-skilled dressmakers and tailors, making some of the finest clothes in the world. Mr. Ferrara believes manufacturing is a sustainable activity in an urban environment and that it is a critical resource platform supporting New York's design community.    Mr. Ferrara is a strong supporter of fashion entrepreneurship in New York City and is an active advisor and investor for startup companies. As a board member of New York Angels, one of the largest and most active angel investment groups in the country, Mr. Ferrara is a strong supporter of emerging businesses in e-commerce and branding concepts. He currently serves on the Boards of several social media, conferencing, and e-tailing businesses relating to the fashion industry. Mr. Ferrara also serves as a business mentor and coach for the CFDA Fashion Incubator and for the NYU business plan competition. Mr. Ferrara earned his degree at NYU Stern and served on the adjunct faculty teaching financial statement analysis for several years. While Mr. Ferrara holds varied interests across a range of sectors, the fashion industry remains his priority since it is dominated by entrepreneurship at every point in the value chain from design, to manufacturing, to distribution. Mr. Ferrara is a strong believer that a sustainable role for manufacturing is essential to keep entrepreneurship thriving in New York City.

Departments:         Music and Performing Arts Professions                Dr. Ferrara is an author and/or co-author of books and contributions to peer-reviewed journals on music theory, keyboard harmony and improvisation, philosophy of music, research methodologies, and medical issues for musical performers. For example, regarding Dr. Ferrara's critically acclaimed book, Philosophy and the Analysis of Music: Bridges to Musical Sound, Form and Reference , reviewers have written:   &bull; \"He brings to this enterprise an accomplished analytical technique...In a tour de force, Ferrara leads us through Bartok's Improvisation No. 3 Opus 20 in an eclectic analysis par excellence...the writing and presentation are often quite brilliant, i.e., lucidly conceived and written with distinct literary skills...I think this is the great merit of Ferrara's method: he works from within both the musical and philosophical experience and is expert in both.\" (F. Joseph Smith, founding editor-in-chief of The Journal of Musicological Research );   &bull; \"One could read the chapters on phenomenology and hermeneutics, nearly a third of the book, and benefit from Ferrara's unusual ability to explain a difficult tradition in modern philosophy...One could read the chapters on referential meaning and the phenomenological analysis of music and gain an excellent sense of the issues and contributions in these areas...for his expositions are invariably clear, comprehensive, and judicious...that Ferrara undertakes all these methodically and in detail testifies to the seriousness of his undertaking and that he does it so well reveals the unusual breadth of his competence.\" (Arnold Berleant, review in The Canadian Review of Philosophy );   &bull; \"Lawrence Ferrara is a consummate philosopher who brings to his philosophizing both the special interpretive skills of the performer and those of the musicologist...The outcome is an excellent study, pioneering in the best sense and rewarding.\" (Jose Huertas-Jourda, Department of Philosophy, Wilfred Laurier University, review in the journal, Phenomenology and the Human Sciences );   &bull; \"Ferrara's book represents a truly exemplary case, from more than one perspective...The air that one breathes throughout this book is that of a new synthesis that would harmonize sense and technique...here there is a characteristic depth of discussion and thorough attention to the critical traditions that engage each successive issue as it appears. This demonstrates a rarely seen competence on both the musicological and philosophical planes...conclusively confirming the merits of Lawrence Ferrara's text....\" (Giovanni Piana, Department of Philosophy, University of Milan, written in Italian in the journal, Axiomathes );   &bull; \"Ferrara's book is bold and scholarly...Its range and its quality are impressive...It is rich in its references. It is a very good book.\" (Thomas F.

                                                   Lawrence Ferrara    Professor of Music and Music Education; Director Emeritus              Phone: (212) 998-9412    Email: lf2@nyu.edu         Departments:         Music and Performing Arts Professions                Dr. Ferrara is an author and/or co-author of books and contributions to peer-reviewed journals on music theory, keyboard harmony and improvisation, philosophy of music, research methodologies, and medical issues for musical performers. For example, regarding Dr. Ferrara's critically acclaimed book, Philosophy and the Analysis of Music: Bridges to Musical Sound, Form and Reference , reviewers have written:   &bull; \"He brings to this enterprise an accomplished analytical technique...In a tour de force, Ferrara leads us through Bartok's Improvisation No. 3 Opus 20 in an eclectic analysis par excellence...the writing and presentation are often quite brilliant, i.e., lucidly conceived and written with distinct literary skills...I think this is the great merit of Ferrara's method: he works from within both the musical and philosophical experience and is expert in both.\" (F. Joseph Smith, founding editor-in-chief of The Journal of Musicological Research );   &bull; \"One could read the chapters on phenomenology and hermeneutics, nearly a third of the book, and benefit from Ferrara's unusual ability to explain a difficult tradition in modern philosophy...One could read the chapters on referential meaning and the phenomenological analysis of music and gain an excellent sense of the issues and contributions in these areas...for his expositions are invariably clear, comprehensive, and judicious...that Ferrara undertakes all these methodically and in detail testifies to the seriousness of his undertaking and that he does it so well reveals the unusual breadth of his competence.\" (Arnold Berleant, review in The Canadian Review of Philosophy );   &bull; \"Lawrence Ferrara is a consummate philosopher who brings to his philosophizing both the special interpretive skills of the performer and those of the musicologist...The outcome is an excellent study, pioneering in the best sense and rewarding.\" (Jose Huertas-Jourda, Department of Philosophy, Wilfred Laurier University, review in the journal, Phenomenology and the Human Sciences );   &bull; \"Ferrara's book represents a truly exemplary case, from more than one perspective...The air that one breathes throughout this book is that of a new synthesis that would harmonize sense and technique...here there is a characteristic depth of discussion and thorough attention to the critical traditions that engage each successive issue as it appears. This demonstrates a rarely seen competence on both the musicological and philosophical planes...conclusively confirming the merits of Lawrence Ferrara's text....\" (Giovanni Piana, Department of Philosophy, University of Milan, written in Italian in the journal, Axiomathes );   &bull; \"Ferrara's book is bold and scholarly...Its range and its quality are impressive...It is rich in its references. It is a very good book.\" (Thomas F. Cloonan, review in Journal of Phenomenological Psychology )   At NYU, Dr. Ferrara has taught undergraduate and graduate classes in music theory and analysis, music history, research methods in music, keyboard harmony and improvisation, philosophy of music and the arts, music performance practices, and music copyright.
