Although most research regarding teacher-student relationships investigate the elementary years of schooling, teachers have the unique opportunity to support students&rsquo; academic and social development at all levels of schooling (Baker et al., 2008; Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 1998; McCormick, Cappella, O&rsquo;Connor, &amp; McClowry, in press). Aligned with attachment theory (Ainsworth, 1982; Bowlby, 1969), positive teacher-student relationships enable students to feel safe and secure in their learning environments and provide scaffolding for important social and academic skills (Baker et al., 2008; O&rsquo;Connor, Dearing, &amp; Collins, 2011; Silver, Measelle, Armstron, &amp; Essex, 2005). Teachers who support students in the learning environment can positively impact their social and academic outcomes, which is important for the long-term trajectory of school and eventually employment (Baker et al., 2008; O&rsquo;Connor et al., 2011; Silver et al., 2005).    When teachers form positive bonds with students, classrooms become supportive spaces in which students can engage in academically and socially productive ways (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Positive teacher-student relationships are classified as having the presence of closeness, warmth, and positivity (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Students who have positive relationships with their teachers use them as a secure base from which they can explore the classroom and school setting both academically and socially, to take on academic challenges and work on social-emotional development (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). This includes, relationships with peers, and developing self-esteem and self-concept (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Through this secure relationship, students learn about socially appropriate behaviors as well as academic expectations and how to achieve these expectations (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Students in low-income schools can especially benefit from positive relationships with teachers (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005).    Students in high-poverty urban schools may benefit from positive teacher-student relationships even more than students in high-income schools, because of the risks associated with poverty (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). Risk outcomes associated with poverty include high rates of high school dropout, lower rates of college applications, low self-efficacy, and low self-confidence (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). There are several factors that can protect against the negative outcomes often associated with low-income schooling, one of which is a positive and supportive relationship with an adult, most often a teacher (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). Low-income students who have strong teacher-student relationships have higher academic achievement and have more positive social-emotional adjustment than their peers who do not have a positive relationship with a teacher (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005).    There is substantial research on the importance of teacher-student relationships in the early elementary years (Pianta, 1992; Hamre &amp; Pianta 2001). However, little is known about the effects of teacher-student relationships on high school students. Studies show that early teacher-student relationships affect early academic and social outcomes as well as future academic outcomes (Pianta 1992; Hamre &amp; Pianta 2001), but few researchers have looked at the effects of teacher-student relationships in later years of schooling. Researchers who have investigated teacher-student relationships for older students have found that positive teacher-student relationships are associated with positive academic and social outcomes for high school students (Alexander, Entwisle, &amp; Horset, 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009). Academic Outcomes Although many studies focus on the importance of early teacher-student relationships, some studies have found that teacher-student relationships are important in transition years; the years when students transition from elementary to middle school or middle to high school (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009; Midgley, Feldlaufer, &amp; Eccles, 1989). Studies of math competence in students transitioning from elementary to middle school have found that students who move from having positive relationships with teachers at the end of elementary school to less positive relationships with teachers in middle school significantly decreased in math skills (Midgley et al., 1989). For students who are considered at high risk for dropping out of high school, math achievement is significantly impacted by the perception of having a caring teacher (Midgley et al., 1989). Furthermore, students who went from low teacher closeness to high teacher closeness significantly increased in math skills over the transition year, from elementary to middle school (Midgley et al., 1989). These studies show that relationships with teachers in the later years of schooling can still significantly impact the academic achievement trajectories of students (Midgley et al., 1989). Another example of the importance of teacher-student relationships in high school students stems from intervention studies aimed at improving academic outcomes for low-income students (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). In one intervention study that aimed to increase positive relationships between low-income high school students and their teachers, results showed that students who participated in the intervention significantly improved their GPA over the course of five months (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). Such research shows that positive teacher-student relationships can improve academic skills in students as early as middle school and as late as high school (Midgley et al., 1989; Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). In addition to positive teacher-student relationships, students&rsquo; motivation to learn is another factor that influences social and academic outcomes.    A possible reason for the association between academic improvement and positive teacher-student relationships is students&rsquo; motivation and desire to learn (Wentzel, 1998). Motivation may play a key role in the relationship between teacher-student relationships and academic outcomes (Bandura, 1997; Fan &amp; Willams, 2010; Pajares &amp; Graham, 1996; Ryan, Stiller, &amp; Lynch, 1994; Wentzel, 2003; Zimmerman, Bandura, &amp; Martinez-Pons, 1992). Motivational theorists suggest that students&rsquo; perception of their relationship with their teacher is essential in motivating students to perform well (Bandura, 1997; Fan &amp; Willams, 2010; Pajares &amp; Graham, 1996; Ryan, Stiller, &amp; Lynch, 1994; Wentzel, 2003; Zimmerman, Bandura, &amp; Martinez-Pons, 1992). Students who perceive their relationship with their teacher as positive, warm and close are motivated to be more engaged in school and to improve their academic achievement (Hughes, Cavell, &amp; Jackson, 1999). Students&rsquo; motivation to learn is impacted positively by having a caring and supportive relationship with a teacher (Wentzel, 1998).    Motivation is closely linked to student&rsquo;s perceptions of teacher expectations. Studies of middle and high school students have shown that students shape their own educational expectations from their perceptions of their teachers&rsquo; expectations (Muller, Katz, &amp; Dance, 1999). Students who perceive that their teachers have high expectations of their academic achievement are more motivated to try to meet those expectations and perform better academically than their peers who perceive low expectations from their teachers (Muller et al., 1999). Due to the influence of expectations on motivation, expectations can be an important factor on a students&rsquo; academic achievement.    Furthermore, teacher-student relationships have an impact on the academic self-esteem of students (Ryan et al., 1994). High-poverty students often have low academic self-esteem and low confidence in their academic and vocational futures (Wentzel, 2003). Thus, positive relationships with teachers are important in supporting higher levels of self-esteem, higher academic self-efficacy, and more confidence in future employment outcomes (Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Self-confidence and future aspirations have a significant impact on students&rsquo; interest in school, their academic self-efficacy and in turn, their academic achievement (Wentzel, 2003). In addition to academic achievement, positive teacher-student relationships provide important social outcomes for students. Social Outcomes Although there is more research regarding the academic effects of positive teacher-student relationships for older students, there are notable social outcomes as well. Teachers are an important source of social capital for students (Muller, 2001). Social capital in a classroom setting is defined as caring teacher-student relationships where students feel that they are both cared for and expected to succeed (Muller, 2001). Social capital from positive teacher-student relationships can manifest itself in many different ways. For high school students, positive teacher-student relationships can reduce rates of dropping out by nearly half, help explore options for college, and provide support for further academic or vocational aspirations (Dika &amp; Singh, 2002). Common reasons for dropping out include low levels of family support, low academic achievement, poor relationships with peers and adults, and low interest in academics (Henry, Knigh, &amp; Thornberry, 2012). Positive teacher-student relationships can impact students social and academic outcomes, and thus reduce drop-out rates (Dika &amp; Singh, 2002; Wentzel, 2003). Low-income students often have neither the support they need to complete high school nor access to the information they need to pursue education beyond high school (Dika &amp;Singh, 2002). It is important for low-income students who experience academic difficulties and negative social outcomes to gain social capital from their teachers, because research shows they can benefit from the guidance and support (Croninger &amp; Lee, 2001). Further, teacher-student relationships can impact peer relationships in schools.    Teacher-student relationships can have a significant effect on the peer acceptance of students. Teachers&rsquo; interactions with students can affect classmates&rsquo; perceptions of individual students, in turn affecting which students classmates choose to interact with and accept (Hughes et al., 1999). Conflicting interactions between teachers and students may convey a lack of acceptance, causing other students to also reject the student involved in the conflict with the teacher (Hughes et al., 1999). Peer rejection significantly impacts self-esteem of students leading to several negative social outcomes (Hughes et al., 1999).    As mentioned earlier, students with high self-esteem are more likely to be self-efficacious and set higher goals (Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Self-esteem also affects students socially (Orth, Robins, &amp; Widaman, 2012). Students with high self-esteem are more likely to have positive relationships with peers as well as with adults (Orth et al., 2012). Self-esteem also affects students&rsquo; mental health outcomes including reducing anxiety and symptoms of depression (Orth et al., 2012). Self-esteem is especially important during adolescence and helps students develop a positive sense of self (Orth et al., 2012). A positive sense of self in adolescence leads to future outcomes including relationship satisfaction, job satisfaction, occupational status, emotional regulation, and physical health (Orth et al., 2012). The support of positive teacher-student relationships for self-esteem and related social outcomes affects students during schooling as well as in their future educational and occupational outcomes (Orth et al., 2012). Conclusion and Limitations    Although there is extensive research on the positive effects of teacher-student relationships on elementary school students, there is little research on middle and high school students. Middle and high school is when students begin to think about their academic futures, which are informed by academic achievement and social capital in elementary years (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009; Dika &amp; Singh, 2002; Muller, 2001). Early high school is usually when students dedicate themselves to graduating or decide to drop out (Henry et al., 2012). Currently, high school dropout rates are high, and improving teacher-student relationships for students at this stage may decrease dropout rates (Henry et al., 2012). Similarly, high school is when students decide if they plan to attend college or stop their education (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Henry et al., 2012). Therefore, it is important to develop positive teacher-student relationships during this time.    Empirical evidence does show that teacher-student relationships are very important for high school students (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Dika &amp;Singh, 2002; Hughes et al., 1999; Midgley et al., 1989; Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Studies that have investigated older students&rsquo; relationships with teachers have found that students improve both academically and socially from positive teacher-student relationships (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Dika &amp;Singh, 2002; Hughes et al., 1999; Midgley et al., 1989; Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). However, much of this research is dated. Due to the ever-changing nature of the American educational system and the increasingly diverse student body, more current studies are needed to look at the effects of teacher-student relationships for this changing population. It is important to learn more about teacher-student relationships for low-income students to decrease high school dropout, and improve students&rsquo; social-emotional development. Conducting research on the relationship between high school students and teachers may be essential in improving the outcomes of low-income middle and high school students, and can potentially inform future interventions to help older students perform better both academically and socially.

Studies show that early teacher-student relationships affect early academic and social outcomes as well as future academic outcomes (Pianta 1992; Hamre &amp; Pianta 2001), but few researchers have looked at the effects of teacher-student relationships in later years of schooling. Researchers who have investigated teacher-student relationships for older students have found that positive teacher-student relationships are associated with positive academic and social outcomes for high school students (Alexander, Entwisle, &amp; Horset, 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009). Academic Outcomes Although many studies focus on the importance of early teacher-student relationships, some studies have found that teacher-student relationships are important in transition years; the years when students transition from elementary to middle school or middle to high school (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009; Midgley, Feldlaufer, &amp; Eccles, 1989). Studies of math competence in students transitioning from elementary to middle school have found that students who move from having positive relationships with teachers at the end of elementary school to less positive relationships with teachers in middle school significantly decreased in math skills (Midgley et al., 1989). For students who are considered at high risk for dropping out of high school, math achievement is significantly impacted by the perception of having a caring teacher (Midgley et al., 1989). Furthermore, students who went from low teacher closeness to high teacher closeness significantly increased in math skills over the transition year, from elementary to middle school (Midgley et al., 1989). These studies show that relationships with teachers in the later years of schooling can still significantly impact the academic achievement trajectories of students (Midgley et al., 1989). Another example of the importance of teacher-student relationships in high school students stems from intervention studies aimed at improving academic outcomes for low-income students (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). In one intervention study that aimed to increase positive relationships between low-income high school students and their teachers, results showed that students who participated in the intervention significantly improved their GPA over the course of five months (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). Such research shows that positive teacher-student relationships can improve academic skills in students as early as middle school and as late as high school (Midgley et al., 1989; Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). In addition to positive teacher-student relationships, students&rsquo; motivation to learn is another factor that influences social and academic outcomes.    A possible reason for the association between academic improvement and positive teacher-student relationships is students&rsquo; motivation and desire to learn (Wentzel, 1998). Motivation may play a key role in the relationship between teacher-student relationships and academic outcomes (Bandura, 1997; Fan &amp; Willams, 2010; Pajares &amp; Graham, 1996; Ryan, Stiller, &amp; Lynch, 1994; Wentzel, 2003; Zimmerman, Bandura, &amp; Martinez-Pons, 1992). Motivational theorists suggest that students&rsquo; perception of their relationship with their teacher is essential in motivating students to perform well (Bandura, 1997; Fan &amp; Willams, 2010; Pajares &amp; Graham, 1996; Ryan, Stiller, &amp; Lynch, 1994; Wentzel, 2003; Zimmerman, Bandura, &amp; Martinez-Pons, 1992). Students who perceive their relationship with their teacher as positive, warm and close are motivated to be more engaged in school and to improve their academic achievement (Hughes, Cavell, &amp; Jackson, 1999). Students&rsquo; motivation to learn is impacted positively by having a caring and supportive relationship with a teacher (Wentzel, 1998).    Motivation is closely linked to student&rsquo;s perceptions of teacher expectations. Studies of middle and high school students have shown that students shape their own educational expectations from their perceptions of their teachers&rsquo; expectations (Muller, Katz, &amp; Dance, 1999). Students who perceive that their teachers have high expectations of their academic achievement are more motivated to try to meet those expectations and perform better academically than their peers who perceive low expectations from their teachers (Muller et al., 1999). Due to the influence of expectations on motivation, expectations can be an important factor on a students&rsquo; academic achievement.    Furthermore, teacher-student relationships have an impact on the academic self-esteem of students (Ryan et al., 1994). High-poverty students often have low academic self-esteem and low confidence in their academic and vocational futures (Wentzel, 2003). Thus, positive relationships with teachers are important in supporting higher levels of self-esteem, higher academic self-efficacy, and more confidence in future employment outcomes (Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Self-confidence and future aspirations have a significant impact on students&rsquo; interest in school, their academic self-efficacy and in turn, their academic achievement (Wentzel, 2003). In addition to academic achievement, positive teacher-student relationships provide important social outcomes for students. Social Outcomes Although there is more research regarding the academic effects of positive teacher-student relationships for older students, there are notable social outcomes as well. Teachers are an important source of social capital for students (Muller, 2001). Social capital in a classroom setting is defined as caring teacher-student relationships where students feel that they are both cared for and expected to succeed (Muller, 2001). Social capital from positive teacher-student relationships can manifest itself in many different ways. For high school students, positive teacher-student relationships can reduce rates of dropping out by nearly half, help explore options for college, and provide support for further academic or vocational aspirations (Dika &amp; Singh, 2002). Common reasons for dropping out include low levels of family support, low academic achievement, poor relationships with peers and adults, and low interest in academics (Henry, Knigh, &amp; Thornberry, 2012). Positive teacher-student relationships can impact students social and academic outcomes, and thus reduce drop-out rates (Dika &amp; Singh, 2002; Wentzel, 2003). Low-income students often have neither the support they need to complete high school nor access to the information they need to pursue education beyond high school (Dika &amp;Singh, 2002). It is important for low-income students who experience academic difficulties and negative social outcomes to gain social capital from their teachers, because research shows they can benefit from the guidance and support (Croninger &amp; Lee, 2001). Further, teacher-student relationships can impact peer relationships in schools.    Teacher-student relationships can have a significant effect on the peer acceptance of students. Teachers&rsquo; interactions with students can affect classmates&rsquo; perceptions of individual students, in turn affecting which students classmates choose to interact with and accept (Hughes et al., 1999). Conflicting interactions between teachers and students may convey a lack of acceptance, causing other students to also reject the student involved in the conflict with the teacher (Hughes et al., 1999). Peer rejection significantly impacts self-esteem of students leading to several negative social outcomes (Hughes et al., 1999).    As mentioned earlier, students with high self-esteem are more likely to be self-efficacious and set higher goals (Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Self-esteem also affects students socially (Orth, Robins, &amp; Widaman, 2012). Students with high self-esteem are more likely to have positive relationships with peers as well as with adults (Orth et al., 2012). Self-esteem also affects students&rsquo; mental health outcomes including reducing anxiety and symptoms of depression (Orth et al., 2012). Self-esteem is especially important during adolescence and helps students develop a positive sense of self (Orth et al., 2012). A positive sense of self in adolescence leads to future outcomes including relationship satisfaction, job satisfaction, occupational status, emotional regulation, and physical health (Orth et al., 2012). The support of positive teacher-student relationships for self-esteem and related social outcomes affects students during schooling as well as in their future educational and occupational outcomes (Orth et al., 2012). Conclusion and Limitations    Although there is extensive research on the positive effects of teacher-student relationships on elementary school students, there is little research on middle and high school students. Middle and high school is when students begin to think about their academic futures, which are informed by academic achievement and social capital in elementary years (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009; Dika &amp; Singh, 2002; Muller, 2001). Early high school is usually when students dedicate themselves to graduating or decide to drop out (Henry et al., 2012). Currently, high school dropout rates are high, and improving teacher-student relationships for students at this stage may decrease dropout rates (Henry et al., 2012). Similarly, high school is when students decide if they plan to attend college or stop their education (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Henry et al., 2012). Therefore, it is important to develop positive teacher-student relationships during this time.    Empirical evidence does show that teacher-student relationships are very important for high school students (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Dika &amp;Singh, 2002; Hughes et al., 1999; Midgley et al., 1989; Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Studies that have investigated older students&rsquo; relationships with teachers have found that students improve both academically and socially from positive teacher-student relationships (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Dika &amp;Singh, 2002; Hughes et al., 1999; Midgley et al., 1989; Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). However, much of this research is dated. Due to the ever-changing nature of the American educational system and the increasingly diverse student body, more current studies are needed to look at the effects of teacher-student relationships for this changing population. It is important to learn more about teacher-student relationships for low-income students to decrease high school dropout, and improve students&rsquo; social-emotional development. Conducting research on the relationship between high school students and teachers may be essential in improving the outcomes of low-income middle and high school students, and can potentially inform future interventions to help older students perform better both academically and socially.

It was founded by Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury in the Jefferson and Madison administrations. Gallatin aimed to establish \" in this immense and fast - growing city ,&rdquo; as he put it , &ldquo; a system of rational and practical education fitting for all and graciously opened to all .\" He was inspired in part by the founders of the University of London , with whom he communicated . As they did , he envisioned a university inspired by and imbued with the intense activity and energy of city life and city commerce. He spoke of NYU as being &ldquo;in and of the city,&rdquo; but even then a city linked with other parts of the world.    In 1890, at a time of immense ferment in American schooling, and mass immigration to New York City, NYU opened the first university-based graduate school dedicated to the advanced education of teachers and school administrators. Thus NYU implicitly rejected what was then the prevailing idea &ndash; namely, that universities are not essential to the education of educators, that practical knowledge alone, rather than integrated practical and theoretical knowledge, is sufficient input for learning to teach.    Called the School of Pedagogy, the new school was the forerunner of today&rsquo;s Steinhardt School, which remains the NYU home of teacher education. Over the course of the twentieth century, the School also became the NYU home of graduate and undergraduate professional education in media, applied psychology, physical and occupational therapy, nutrition, music, and the visual arts. All of these programs emerged from an initial focus on the learning needs of pre-collegiate youth.    Today, NYU teacher education spans many program areas and three Steinhardt departments: the Department of Teaching and Learning ; the Department of Art and Arts Professions ; and the Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions . At the same time, the NYU Teacher Education Program as a whole has a general pedagogical core, including a set of core courses and faculty communities of practice overseeing them; an organizational core comprised of a Teacher Education Council and Teacher Education Working Group; and five core values described below that derive from its history, as well as its ambition to meet the contemporary challenges of teacher education.    The NYU Teacher Education Program is fully accredited by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council.    Core Values       To be in and of the city and engage deeply in New York schools    To value content knowledge (disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and inter-professional), and also pedagogical knowledge as crucial for effective teaching    To integrate theory and practice proactively rather than expect students to do it on their own    To promote intercultural openness as a tool for teaching - and in this sense to be in and of the world    To engage habitually in organizational self-scrutiny, and in the process to contribute to the knowledge base for effective teaching and teacher education       To be in and of the city and engaged deeply in New York schools.    The orientation to the city accounts for NYU&rsquo;s successful efforts over the last decade to build a large network of partnership schools serving some of New York City&rsquo;s poorest neighborhoods. This orientation also accounts for the emphasis across the program&rsquo;s core courses and fieldwork on the role that even the poorest communities can play as resources for children, youth, families, and teachers. Finally, it accounts for how NYU discharges its obligations under accreditation by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council to educate teachers to be caring professionals.    To value content knowledge (disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and inter-professional), and also pedagogical knowledge as crucial for effective teaching.    The attention NYU pays to both content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge -- evident in the 1890 launch of teacher education at NYU &ndash; has continued to shape it in the century since. In 2004, for example, NYU established a university-wide oversight committee for teacher education called the Teacher Education Council. It is co-chaired by the Dean of Steinhardt and the Dean of the College of Arts and Science, and includes members of the Teacher Education Faculty, the Faculty of Arts and Science, and faculty from other Steinhardt programs which contribute to teacher education &ndash; for example, programs in the arts, in psychology, and in the history of education.    To integrate theory and practice pro-actively rather than expect students to do it on their own.    The third core value of NYU Teacher Education holds that it is not enough to give equal attention to content and pedagogy. Good programs must also help students integrate what they are learning in these areas. This value accounts for the extensive emphasis at NYU on well-scaffolded fieldwork, including field-based courses and seminars; and on maintaining a faculty whose members across ranks include both those with deep connections to practice, and those with rich experience in content and content research.    To promote intercultural openness as a tool for teaching &ndash; and in this sense to be in and of the world.    The fourth value - NYU&rsquo;s promotion of intercultural openness as a tool for teaching - accounts for the recent development of cross-national programs at NYU in the teaching of Spanish, Chinese, and French ; for an increase in the number of international teacher candidates; for study-abroad opportunities in teacher education ; and for increased efforts across program areas to ensure that NYU teacher candidates gain proficiency in teaching English language learners . It also accounts for efforts across the program core and program areas to ensure that NYU teacher candidates acquire an ethic of cultural respect in the face of probable cultural mismatch between their own backgrounds and the backgrounds of increasing numbers of their students. Today&rsquo;s NYU candidates launch their teaching careers amid the greatest mass migration of peoples and contact among cultures the world has ever known. Being &ldquo;in and of the city&rdquo; of New York, the city of immigrants, gives NYU a unique position for helping future teachers develop global competence within and beyond US borders.    To engage habitually in organizational self - scrutiny , and in the process to contribute to the knowledge base for effective teaching and teacher education .    Finally, the fifth core value of teacher education at NYU &ndash; the emphasis on data-based self-scrutiny and rigorous research &ndash; accounts for NYU&rsquo;s active efforts to be accountable for its impact on its students and on their students. The inventive Center for Research on Teaching and Learning is central to these efforts. This value also accounts for the faculty&rsquo;s many contributions to teacher education elsewhere also.    Today, as non-university teacher education programs proliferate, NYU remains an outspoken advocate of the important role that research universities can play in the education of teachers. NYU faculty are now studying how children learn science, how games can be used to teach science, how students transition to high school, how teacher management and teacher care co-mingle in classrooms, how schools manage discipline, how young black men progress through elementary and middle school years, how school-university partnerships function, how the learning of English language learners may best be assessed, how mathematics disability intersects or not with reading disability, and much more of great usefulness to the world.

Although most research regarding teacher-student relationships investigate the elementary years of schooling, teachers have the unique opportunity to support students&rsquo; academic and social development at all levels of schooling (Baker et al., 2008; Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 1998; McCormick, Cappella, O&rsquo;Connor, &amp; McClowry, in press). Aligned with attachment theory (Ainsworth, 1982; Bowlby, 1969), positive teacher-student relationships enable students to feel safe and secure in their learning environments and provide scaffolding for important social and academic skills (Baker et al., 2008; O&rsquo;Connor, Dearing, &amp; Collins, 2011; Silver, Measelle, Armstron, &amp; Essex, 2005). Teachers who support students in the learning environment can positively impact their social and academic outcomes, which is important for the long-term trajectory of school and eventually employment (Baker et al., 2008; O&rsquo;Connor et al., 2011; Silver et al., 2005).    When teachers form positive bonds with students, classrooms become supportive spaces in which students can engage in academically and socially productive ways (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Positive teacher-student relationships are classified as having the presence of closeness, warmth, and positivity (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Students who have positive relationships with their teachers use them as a secure base from which they can explore the classroom and school setting both academically and socially, to take on academic challenges and work on social-emotional development (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). This includes, relationships with peers, and developing self-esteem and self-concept (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Through this secure relationship, students learn about socially appropriate behaviors as well as academic expectations and how to achieve these expectations (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Students in low-income schools can especially benefit from positive relationships with teachers (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005).    Students in high-poverty urban schools may benefit from positive teacher-student relationships even more than students in high-income schools, because of the risks associated with poverty (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). Risk outcomes associated with poverty include high rates of high school dropout, lower rates of college applications, low self-efficacy, and low self-confidence (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). There are several factors that can protect against the negative outcomes often associated with low-income schooling, one of which is a positive and supportive relationship with an adult, most often a teacher (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). Low-income students who have strong teacher-student relationships have higher academic achievement and have more positive social-emotional adjustment than their peers who do not have a positive relationship with a teacher (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005).    There is substantial research on the importance of teacher-student relationships in the early elementary years (Pianta, 1992; Hamre &amp; Pianta 2001). However, little is known about the effects of teacher-student relationships on high school students. Studies show that early teacher-student relationships affect early academic and social outcomes as well as future academic outcomes (Pianta 1992; Hamre &amp; Pianta 2001), but few researchers have looked at the effects of teacher-student relationships in later years of schooling. Researchers who have investigated teacher-student relationships for older students have found that positive teacher-student relationships are associated with positive academic and social outcomes for high school students (Alexander, Entwisle, &amp; Horset, 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009). Academic Outcomes Although many studies focus on the importance of early teacher-student relationships, some studies have found that teacher-student relationships are important in transition years; the years when students transition from elementary to middle school or middle to high school (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009; Midgley, Feldlaufer, &amp; Eccles, 1989). Studies of math competence in students transitioning from elementary to middle school have found that students who move from having positive relationships with teachers at the end of elementary school to less positive relationships with teachers in middle school significantly decreased in math skills (Midgley et al., 1989). For students who are considered at high risk for dropping out of high school, math achievement is significantly impacted by the perception of having a caring teacher (Midgley et al., 1989). Furthermore, students who went from low teacher closeness to high teacher closeness significantly increased in math skills over the transition year, from elementary to middle school (Midgley et al., 1989). These studies show that relationships with teachers in the later years of schooling can still significantly impact the academic achievement trajectories of students (Midgley et al., 1989). Another example of the importance of teacher-student relationships in high school students stems from intervention studies aimed at improving academic outcomes for low-income students (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). In one intervention study that aimed to increase positive relationships between low-income high school students and their teachers, results showed that students who participated in the intervention significantly improved their GPA over the course of five months (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). Such research shows that positive teacher-student relationships can improve academic skills in students as early as middle school and as late as high school (Midgley et al., 1989; Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). In addition to positive teacher-student relationships, students&rsquo; motivation to learn is another factor that influences social and academic outcomes.    A possible reason for the association between academic improvement and positive teacher-student relationships is students&rsquo; motivation and desire to learn (Wentzel, 1998). Motivation may play a key role in the relationship between teacher-student relationships and academic outcomes (Bandura, 1997; Fan &amp; Willams, 2010; Pajares &amp; Graham, 1996; Ryan, Stiller, &amp; Lynch, 1994; Wentzel, 2003; Zimmerman, Bandura, &amp; Martinez-Pons, 1992). Motivational theorists suggest that students&rsquo; perception of their relationship with their teacher is essential in motivating students to perform well (Bandura, 1997; Fan &amp; Willams, 2010; Pajares &amp; Graham, 1996; Ryan, Stiller, &amp; Lynch, 1994; Wentzel, 2003; Zimmerman, Bandura, &amp; Martinez-Pons, 1992). Students who perceive their relationship with their teacher as positive, warm and close are motivated to be more engaged in school and to improve their academic achievement (Hughes, Cavell, &amp; Jackson, 1999). Students&rsquo; motivation to learn is impacted positively by having a caring and supportive relationship with a teacher (Wentzel, 1998).    Motivation is closely linked to student&rsquo;s perceptions of teacher expectations. Studies of middle and high school students have shown that students shape their own educational expectations from their perceptions of their teachers&rsquo; expectations (Muller, Katz, &amp; Dance, 1999). Students who perceive that their teachers have high expectations of their academic achievement are more motivated to try to meet those expectations and perform better academically than their peers who perceive low expectations from their teachers (Muller et al., 1999). Due to the influence of expectations on motivation, expectations can be an important factor on a students&rsquo; academic achievement.    Furthermore, teacher-student relationships have an impact on the academic self-esteem of students (Ryan et al., 1994). High-poverty students often have low academic self-esteem and low confidence in their academic and vocational futures (Wentzel, 2003). Thus, positive relationships with teachers are important in supporting higher levels of self-esteem, higher academic self-efficacy, and more confidence in future employment outcomes (Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Self-confidence and future aspirations have a significant impact on students&rsquo; interest in school, their academic self-efficacy and in turn, their academic achievement (Wentzel, 2003). In addition to academic achievement, positive teacher-student relationships provide important social outcomes for students. Social Outcomes Although there is more research regarding the academic effects of positive teacher-student relationships for older students, there are notable social outcomes as well. Teachers are an important source of social capital for students (Muller, 2001). Social capital in a classroom setting is defined as caring teacher-student relationships where students feel that they are both cared for and expected to succeed (Muller, 2001). Social capital from positive teacher-student relationships can manifest itself in many different ways. For high school students, positive teacher-student relationships can reduce rates of dropping out by nearly half, help explore options for college, and provide support for further academic or vocational aspirations (Dika &amp; Singh, 2002). Common reasons for dropping out include low levels of family support, low academic achievement, poor relationships with peers and adults, and low interest in academics (Henry, Knigh, &amp; Thornberry, 2012). Positive teacher-student relationships can impact students social and academic outcomes, and thus reduce drop-out rates (Dika &amp; Singh, 2002; Wentzel, 2003). Low-income students often have neither the support they need to complete high school nor access to the information they need to pursue education beyond high school (Dika &amp;Singh, 2002). It is important for low-income students who experience academic difficulties and negative social outcomes to gain social capital from their teachers, because research shows they can benefit from the guidance and support (Croninger &amp; Lee, 2001). Further, teacher-student relationships can impact peer relationships in schools.    Teacher-student relationships can have a significant effect on the peer acceptance of students. Teachers&rsquo; interactions with students can affect classmates&rsquo; perceptions of individual students, in turn affecting which students classmates choose to interact with and accept (Hughes et al., 1999). Conflicting interactions between teachers and students may convey a lack of acceptance, causing other students to also reject the student involved in the conflict with the teacher (Hughes et al., 1999). Peer rejection significantly impacts self-esteem of students leading to several negative social outcomes (Hughes et al., 1999).    As mentioned earlier, students with high self-esteem are more likely to be self-efficacious and set higher goals (Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Self-esteem also affects students socially (Orth, Robins, &amp; Widaman, 2012). Students with high self-esteem are more likely to have positive relationships with peers as well as with adults (Orth et al., 2012). Self-esteem also affects students&rsquo; mental health outcomes including reducing anxiety and symptoms of depression (Orth et al., 2012). Self-esteem is especially important during adolescence and helps students develop a positive sense of self (Orth et al., 2012). A positive sense of self in adolescence leads to future outcomes including relationship satisfaction, job satisfaction, occupational status, emotional regulation, and physical health (Orth et al., 2012). The support of positive teacher-student relationships for self-esteem and related social outcomes affects students during schooling as well as in their future educational and occupational outcomes (Orth et al., 2012). Conclusion and Limitations    Although there is extensive research on the positive effects of teacher-student relationships on elementary school students, there is little research on middle and high school students. Middle and high school is when students begin to think about their academic futures, which are informed by academic achievement and social capital in elementary years (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009; Dika &amp; Singh, 2002; Muller, 2001). Early high school is usually when students dedicate themselves to graduating or decide to drop out (Henry et al., 2012). Currently, high school dropout rates are high, and improving teacher-student relationships for students at this stage may decrease dropout rates (Henry et al., 2012). Similarly, high school is when students decide if they plan to attend college or stop their education (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Henry et al., 2012). Therefore, it is important to develop positive teacher-student relationships during this time.    Empirical evidence does show that teacher-student relationships are very important for high school students (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Dika &amp;Singh, 2002; Hughes et al., 1999; Midgley et al., 1989; Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Studies that have investigated older students&rsquo; relationships with teachers have found that students improve both academically and socially from positive teacher-student relationships (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Dika &amp;Singh, 2002; Hughes et al., 1999; Midgley et al., 1989; Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). However, much of this research is dated. Due to the ever-changing nature of the American educational system and the increasingly diverse student body, more current studies are needed to look at the effects of teacher-student relationships for this changing population. It is important to learn more about teacher-student relationships for low-income students to decrease high school dropout, and improve students&rsquo; social-emotional development. Conducting research on the relationship between high school students and teachers may be essential in improving the outcomes of low-income middle and high school students, and can potentially inform future interventions to help older students perform better both academically and socially.

It was founded by Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury in the Jefferson and Madison administrations. Gallatin aimed to establish \" in this immense and fast - growing city ,&rdquo; as he put it , &ldquo; a system of rational and practical education fitting for all and graciously opened to all .\" He was inspired in part by the founders of the University of London , with whom he communicated . As they did , he envisioned a university inspired by and imbued with the intense activity and energy of city life and city commerce. He spoke of NYU as being &ldquo;in and of the city,&rdquo; but even then a city linked with other parts of the world.    In 1890, at a time of immense ferment in American schooling, and mass immigration to New York City, NYU opened the first university-based graduate school dedicated to the advanced education of teachers and school administrators. Thus NYU implicitly rejected what was then the prevailing idea &ndash; namely, that universities are not essential to the education of educators, that practical knowledge alone, rather than integrated practical and theoretical knowledge, is sufficient input for learning to teach.    Called the School of Pedagogy, the new school was the forerunner of today&rsquo;s Steinhardt School, which remains the NYU home of teacher education. Over the course of the twentieth century, the School also became the NYU home of graduate and undergraduate professional education in media, applied psychology, physical and occupational therapy, nutrition, music, and the visual arts. All of these programs emerged from an initial focus on the learning needs of pre-collegiate youth.    Today, NYU teacher education spans many program areas and three Steinhardt departments: the Department of Teaching and Learning ; the Department of Art and Arts Professions ; and the Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions . At the same time, the NYU Teacher Education Program as a whole has a general pedagogical core, including a set of core courses and faculty communities of practice overseeing them; an organizational core comprised of a Teacher Education Council and Teacher Education Working Group; and five core values described below that derive from its history, as well as its ambition to meet the contemporary challenges of teacher education.    The NYU Teacher Education Program is fully accredited by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council.    Core Values       To be in and of the city and engage deeply in New York schools    To value content knowledge (disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and inter-professional), and also pedagogical knowledge as crucial for effective teaching    To integrate theory and practice proactively rather than expect students to do it on their own    To promote intercultural openness as a tool for teaching - and in this sense to be in and of the world    To engage habitually in organizational self-scrutiny, and in the process to contribute to the knowledge base for effective teaching and teacher education       To be in and of the city and engaged deeply in New York schools.    The orientation to the city accounts for NYU&rsquo;s successful efforts over the last decade to build a large network of partnership schools serving some of New York City&rsquo;s poorest neighborhoods. This orientation also accounts for the emphasis across the program&rsquo;s core courses and fieldwork on the role that even the poorest communities can play as resources for children, youth, families, and teachers. Finally, it accounts for how NYU discharges its obligations under accreditation by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council to educate teachers to be caring professionals.    To value content knowledge (disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and inter-professional), and also pedagogical knowledge as crucial for effective teaching.    The attention NYU pays to both content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge -- evident in the 1890 launch of teacher education at NYU &ndash; has continued to shape it in the century since. In 2004, for example, NYU established a university-wide oversight committee for teacher education called the Teacher Education Council. It is co-chaired by the Dean of Steinhardt and the Dean of the College of Arts and Science, and includes members of the Teacher Education Faculty, the Faculty of Arts and Science, and faculty from other Steinhardt programs which contribute to teacher education &ndash; for example, programs in the arts, in psychology, and in the history of education.    To integrate theory and practice pro-actively rather than expect students to do it on their own.    The third core value of NYU Teacher Education holds that it is not enough to give equal attention to content and pedagogy. Good programs must also help students integrate what they are learning in these areas. This value accounts for the extensive emphasis at NYU on well-scaffolded fieldwork, including field-based courses and seminars; and on maintaining a faculty whose members across ranks include both those with deep connections to practice, and those with rich experience in content and content research.    To promote intercultural openness as a tool for teaching &ndash; and in this sense to be in and of the world.    The fourth value - NYU&rsquo;s promotion of intercultural openness as a tool for teaching - accounts for the recent development of cross-national programs at NYU in the teaching of Spanish, Chinese, and French ; for an increase in the number of international teacher candidates; for study-abroad opportunities in teacher education ; and for increased efforts across program areas to ensure that NYU teacher candidates gain proficiency in teaching English language learners . It also accounts for efforts across the program core and program areas to ensure that NYU teacher candidates acquire an ethic of cultural respect in the face of probable cultural mismatch between their own backgrounds and the backgrounds of increasing numbers of their students. Today&rsquo;s NYU candidates launch their teaching careers amid the greatest mass migration of peoples and contact among cultures the world has ever known. Being &ldquo;in and of the city&rdquo; of New York, the city of immigrants, gives NYU a unique position for helping future teachers develop global competence within and beyond US borders.    To engage habitually in organizational self - scrutiny , and in the process to contribute to the knowledge base for effective teaching and teacher education .    Finally, the fifth core value of teacher education at NYU &ndash; the emphasis on data-based self-scrutiny and rigorous research &ndash; accounts for NYU&rsquo;s active efforts to be accountable for its impact on its students and on their students. The inventive Center for Research on Teaching and Learning is central to these efforts. This value also accounts for the faculty&rsquo;s many contributions to teacher education elsewhere also.    Today, as non-university teacher education programs proliferate, NYU remains an outspoken advocate of the important role that research universities can play in the education of teachers. NYU faculty are now studying how children learn science, how games can be used to teach science, how students transition to high school, how teacher management and teacher care co-mingle in classrooms, how schools manage discipline, how young black men progress through elementary and middle school years, how school-university partnerships function, how the learning of English language learners may best be assessed, how mathematics disability intersects or not with reading disability, and much more of great usefulness to the world.

          Teachers for a New Era Final Report            The Effects of Multiple-Perspective Assessment Upon Student Teachers and Their Pupils    TNE Mini-grant Contract 3571-00/EOC 6820    Final Report - July 31, 2007    I. BACKGROUND    Overview ThisTNE mini-grant was used to address the demand for accountability of traditional teacher education programs (Darling-Hammond and Bransford, 2005) and the related pressure for value-added evidence of their efficacy in terms of a direct benefit to teacher development and an indirect impact on pupil achievement. One of the main principles of the Teachers for a New Era (TNE) Learning Network calls for &ldquo;grounding all elements of the teacher education program on strong evidence, including measurement of pupil learning gains&rdquo;. This inquiry builds upon ongoing research at NYU&rsquo;s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development on ways to enhance the efficacy of student teaching and methods to assess its impact on teacher education students and their pupils.    In 2003, the Steinhardt School&rsquo;s Center for Research on Teaching and Learning (CRTL) began a research and development effort focused on the assessment of teacher quality and the linkages between measures of teacher performance and pupil learning. This research is rooted in self inquiry that is designed to build an evidence base to inform continuous program improvement and to strengthen program accountability. The work supported by this mini-grant focused on expanding and linking two key components of this research: the assessment of the developing proficiency of teacher education students and longitudinal follow-up of their success as beginning teachers.    Assessment of Teaching Proficiency In spring 2004, CRTL developed and piloted an early version of the Domain Referenced Student Teacher Observation Scale&mdash;Revised (DRSTOS-R), an observation protocol used to assess the developing proficiency of student teachers that was adapted from the work of Charlotte Danielson as presented in her book, Enhancing Professional Practice: A Framework for Teaching (Danielson, 1996). Danielson identified four domains of teachers&rsquo; professional practice: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities. The DRSTOS-R is designed to assess the ability of teacher education students to understand and integrate their classroom experiences and apply that learning to their own practice as student teachers. Between fall 2004 and spring 2006, CRTL revised and refined the original 29-item protocol into the current 20-item version, trained 16 student-teacher supervisors to use the scale, assessed its validity and inter-rater reliability, and collected DRSTOS-R supervisor ratings for 258 Steinhardt student teachers. DRSTOS-R data were featured prominently in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Teacher Education Accreditation Council Inquiry Brief , which resulted in the full accreditation of all of its teacher education programs in January, 2007.    Longitudinal Follow-Up of Steinhardt Graduates As an additional strand of inquiry into the efficacy of Steinhardt&rsquo;s teacher education programs, CRTL began a multi-phase, longitudinal study of the graduates of these programs in spring 2005. In the first phase, CRTL sent an electronic file of the social security numbers of 2,151 graduates from the classes of 2001 through fall 2005 to the State Education Departments of New York, Connecticut, and Florida to be matched to the teacher databases for these states. A series of matches identified almost 1,200 graduates who were teaching in the public schools of the three states during the 2003-04 and/or 2004-05 school years. Using data from these matches, CRTL has been studying the characteristics of the graduates who entered the teaching profession, the demographic and performance characteristics of the schools in which they taught, and patterns of retention and attrition. In the second phase of the research, which was undertaken in 2006-07, the follow-up file was updated for graduates from the classes of 2005 and 2006 through a match to the New York City Department of Education human resources data system and surveys were sent to a sample of 391 of these graduates who were teaching in New York City public elementary and middle schools. The survey used an adaptation of the DRSTOS-R that was designed to obtain the self-perceptions of practicing teachers about their teaching practice. The third phase involves obtaining the standardized test scores in English language arts and mathematics for the pupils of these graduates and using value-added modeling (VAM) methods to assess the impact of the graduates on the growth in academic achievement of their pupils.    II. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK    This mini-grant was used to build upon CRTL&rsquo;s ongoing research on teacher education program accountability and teacher quality in several ways. First, mini-grant funds were used to expand the use of DRSTOS-R by Steinhardt student-teacher supervisors and, for the first time, by cooperating teachers who serve as mentors to the student teachers. In addition, two other forms were developed to obtain the self-perceptions of students and practicing teachers. In the process of developing these new forms of the protocol and training faculty, school staff, and students to use them, CRTL studied the dynamics of using a common set of standards to describe effective teaching upon the efficacy of the student teaching practicum. In this way, we were able to examine our thesis that a multi-perspective paradigm with a common language, standards, and shared idea of entry-level proficiency would lead to a more coherent and effective student teaching experience. Second, funds were used to support the collection of data for CRTL&rsquo;s ongoing follow-up study, including the merger of data from the pre-service DRSTOS-R with data from the ongoing longitudinal study of Steinhardt graduates, including pupil standardized achievement test scores. In this way, CRTL is examining the empirical, predictive validity of the DRSTOS-R against a criterion of growth in pupil learning. Finally, and perhaps most important, the activities supported by this grant are part of an ongoing effort to create a culture of accountability among teacher education faculty, staff, and students. This work is part of a larger effort to create an evidence base for setting goals and standards, assessing the success of our programs, and guiding program planning. Dissemination of the results of this research and conversations with faculty are aimed at fostering an attitude of self-inquiry.    III. ACTIVITIES PERFORMED UNDER THE MINI-GRANT    In this section, we describe the activities that were financed through the mini-grant during the 2006-07 academic year. Consistent with the conceptual framework described above, these activities supported and were embedded in the major ongoing research and development projects in Steinhardt&rsquo;s teacher education programs.    DRSTOS-R Supervisor Training As of July 2007, thirty student-teacher supervisors with anywhere from 3-12 student teachers each, and representing both content-area-specific secondary school domains and childhood educators, have been trained and are using the protocol in the field. We continued this academic year to collect supervisors&rsquo; summative scores of their student teachers&rsquo; growth in their fieldwork. During the past academic year, TNE funds allowed us to train eight supervisors at NYU, and two additional supervisors were trained at a partnership high school, alongside three cooperating teachers. In July, we conducted another intensive training for five more participating supervisors. Accordingly, mini-grant funds enabled us to almost double the number of supervisors trained in DRSTOS-R and expand training to cooperating teachers for the first time.    Conversations at these professional meetings are centered around trying to establish inter-rater reliability based on video-taped sample lessons. Conversations around the domains and ratings assigned by the different supervisors also facilitate further validation of the instrument itself. In the winter, the main conversation was the contribution of the DRSTOS-R to establishing common definitions around important educational concepts, such as &ldquo;assessment.&rdquo; The summer training had an extensive conversation about whether or not there can be a one-size-fits-all document, or whether it needs to be modified for content areas and/or grade levels.    DRSTOS-R Multi-Perspective Case Study Our research with the DRSTOS-R has reinforced the importance of considering context in the assessment process. In order to examine the use of the DRSTOS-R within a specific context, NYU researchers developed a small case study. The goal was to learn about similarities and differences in the ways in which cooperating teachers and supervisors assessed student teachers and the extent to which using a common framework would bring enhance the consistency of their respective assessments. Below is a summary of the study.    Methods and Procedures Supervisors and cooperating teachers from a New York City high school that is engaged in a partnership initiative with NYU were invited to participate in the study.       Three cooperating teachers and two supervisors volunteered and were trained to administer the DRSTOS-R together in a single session at the high school.    During the training, inter-rater agreement was assessed by having each participant use the protocol to rate video-taped lessons purchased through ETS.    End-of-semester DRSTOS-R scores were collected from all trained cooperating teachers and supervisors.    Surveys from both DRSTOS-R-trained and untrained cooperating teachers from the high school were collected at the end of the semester. The surveys focused on the specific standards that the cooperating teachers used to assess their student teachers.    Follow-up interviews were conducted with cooperating teachers to obtain their experiences using the DRSTOS-R and their perceptions about its usefulness for assessing student teachers and providing a common framework for mentoring.       Summary of Findings To begin, self-selected high school teachers (serving as cooperating, or host teachers to student teachers) and secondary student teacher supervisors were trained in the DRSTOS-R protocol. Specifically, one cooperating teacher and supervisor were a pair, meaning the supervisor would be assessing the student teacher in this particular teacher&rsquo;s classroom. There was one &ldquo;non-match&rdquo;&mdash;a cooperating teacher and a supervisor who would not have any interaction with a given student teacher. And then there was a &ldquo;half-match,&rdquo; indicating that a cooperating teacher was trained, but her supervisor was not.    The intent of this training is much like the others: to assess the protocol&rsquo;s validity and establish inter-rater reliability in an effort to have a protocol that reliably depicts student teacher development in the four domains. The multiple perspectives provided by combining both cooperating teachers and university supervisors, some of whom had student teachers in common to which they apply the DRSTOS-R protocol, provided a dialogue about the variability of the vision of entry-level proficient teaching. In general terms, the differences were often attributable to perspective or role: (cooperating) teacher or supervisor.    At the end of the semester, each person present at the training was asked to complete a summative DRSTOS-R for each student teacher for whom they were responsible. In addition, cooperating teachers&mdash;the three trained as well as three non-trained who volunteered to participate&mdash;were given a survey necessitating an overall rating and a paragraph explaining that number.    Review of the data, especially through an informal conversation facilitated by a member of the research team revealed compelling trends. Cooperating teachers see themselves and their classrooms as models for student teachers, framing the student teachers more as guests than as participants. While they do think pre- and post-lesson conversations are important, the lesson itself is often not completely the student teacher&rsquo;s own. If a teacher or school has curricular goals planned in advance, then a student teacher may be able to contribute individual lessons that fit within predetermined unit plans. In terms of controlling the amount of time the student teacher has as a lead-teacher rather than helper or observer, cooperating teachers rely on their own assessment of the student teachers&mdash;daily interaction, lesson plans&mdash;as means by which to decide how much input and opportunity to teach the student teachers should have.    Another major theme of the conversation concerned the breadth of the DRSTOS-R. A significant example of elements cooperating teachers found worthy of further conversation was those related to Classroom Environment. The teachers consider classroom set up and the establishment of classroom routines a major component of their job, and that the foundations for these, and most kinds of classroom management, are essential parts of the beginning of each school year. Given that, a full assessment is not possible because the student teacher does not get the full teaching experience.    A further perspective provided by the cooperating teachers is the involvement of their pupils in informally assessing the student teacher, and informing the classroom teachers&rsquo; decisions about how to use the student teacher. The cooperating teachers perceived the supervisor as an &ldquo;as-needed&rdquo; liaison the university, rather than an integral part of the triad. Further, cooperating teachers often and informally elicit pupils&rsquo; responses to student teachers&rsquo; lessons, or gauge the success of the lesson based on the level of student work.    Linkages to Longitudinal Follow-Up Study Mini-grant funds, in combination with funds from a Steinhardt Challenge Grant, supported a major expansion of Steinhardt&rsquo;s ongoing longitudinal follow-up study of its teacher education graduates. The purpose of the expansion is to conduct a study of the success of Steinhardt graduates in obtaining teaching positions, remaining in these positions and in the field, and in educating their pupils as measured through value-added-modeling (VAM) analyses of pupil growth in standardized test scores. In addition, this study will include an assessment of the predictive validity of the DRSTOS-R using the follow-up success measures as validity criteria. The work of this study accomplished during 2006-07 is described below.       The researchers sent an Excel file of 3,036 teacher education graduates from the classes of 2001 through 2006 to NYCDOE for matching to the human resources file.    A total of 1,507 (49.6%) graduates matched the file, indicating that they had worked as a teacher in a NYC public school at some point in time.    As of spring 2007, 1,005 (66.7% of the 1,507) were still teaching full-time in NYC, 24 (1.6%) were working in NYC in other positions, such as assistant principals, guidance counselors, and literacy coaches, and 60 (4.0%) were on leaves of absence. A total of 415 (27.5%) were no longer employed by the NYC public schools. (See Table 1.)    Of the 1,005 graduates who were teaching, 631 (63.1%) served in elementary or middle schools, 342 (34.2%) in high schools, and 27 (2.7%) in special education schools. (See Table 2.)    In order to select teachers for the value-added modeling (VAM) analysis, the researchers examined the subjects and grade levels taught by the 631 graduates who were teaching in elementary and middle schools. Since VAM is going to be applied to growth in English language arts and math test scores, only graduates who were teaching these subjects in grades 4 - 8, grades for which pupils would have test scores for two consecutive years, were selected for the next phase of the study. A sample of 392 graduates who had teaching assignments that fit the criteria were selected as the VAM sample, more than 70% of whom were in a Common Branches elementary school assignment. (See Table 3.)    The VAM sample graduates are highly diverse with respect to the schools in which they are teaching and their teaching experience. They teach in a total of 249 schools in every one of New York City&rsquo;s 32 geographical school districts. While most schools in the sample have only one graduate teaching, some have high concentrations, with 13 schools employing five or more. There is considerable variability in the sample&rsquo;s total years of teaching experience in New York City (M = 3.3 years, SD = 2.4), ranging from a minimum of 1 month to a maximum of 15.4 years.    A total of 64 graduates had DRSTOS-R protocol scores from their final semester of student teaching    The next step is to obtain the ELA and math achievement test scores for the pupils of sample graduates for the 2005-06 and 2006-07 school years. These data are currently being compiled by the NYC Department of Education. These data will be used in VAM analyses, one of which will assess the linkages between the DRSTOS-R and pupil growth. This work will be performed during fall 2007 and winter of 2008.

DISSEMINATION AND COLLABORATION    Conferences AACTE Annual Meeting in New York City, February 2007 In February CRTL shared its ongoing DRSTOS-R work at the American Association of College Teacher Educators (AACTE). We chose to present in an interactive workshop because we very much wanted this to be as much about institutional sharing as about dissemination.  Among the 25 attendees, multiple perspectives from the field of teacher education were represented, including supervisors of student teachers, directors of small teacher education programs, faculty on program design committees, and fieldwork development professionals.  By far the most critical concept emerging from the activity&mdash;a modified version of the training we normally do, with a special focus on small group conversation about coming to consensus on domain choices and scores&mdash;was that student teacher assessment is a critical topic. Some institutions have begun to tackle its challenges, and responded to the conversation sharing their policies; others left the session with new insights into issues facing their program. For our part, CRTL understood that this topic is part of larger professional conversation, and that varied institutions conceptualize and carry out fieldwork in myriad ways. The structure of a teacher education program has a significant influence on how it assesses its student teachers.    In addition to the workshop on DRSTOS-R, CRTL&rsquo;s Director gave a PowerPoint presentation at TNE Learning Network panel session on the assessment of pupil learning growth. The PowerPoint was posted to the TNE website.    NYU Coursework CRTL followed up the success and richness of the AACTE presentation by piloting the assessment protocol in a graduate-level NYU class, and found similar responses. In both groups, domains, rather than scores, were the harder to agree on. Personal perceptions and definitions of different words and actions can be highly varied and thus influence both the domain to which they assign a certain action and the score they attach. This conversation, in both settings, emphasized the importance of the summative nature of this assessment, rather than the &ldquo;point in time&rdquo; purpose of some observation protocols. Context is essential to the understanding of the subjective nature of teaching and teaching assessment, which points to the importance of shared understandings and ongoing relationships, such as supervisors looping with the student teacher, in the student teachers&rsquo; education.    AERA Annual Meetings Together with faculty from the Departments of Teaching and Learning and Applied Psychology, CRTL&rsquo;s Director delivered a paper presentation on the longitudinal follow-up studies and VAM analyses at the Annual Meeting of AERA in Chicago in April, 2007 and has submitted a proposal to report new findings from the study at the Annual Meeting in New York in April, 2008.  TNE Regional Network The work on DRSTOS-R was presented at a TNE Regional Network at Montclair State University in May, 2007. Member institutions agree to continue sharing progress on teacher education student assessment at future meetings.    Partnerships Work on the DRSTOS-R and the VAM longitudinal study has been incorporated into the agenda of the Partnership for Teacher Education, (PTE) a collaborative venture to improve education and induction in New York City between the New York City Department of Education, NYU, and CUNY. The school-university partnerships that have been fostered through PTE have provided a culture of collaboration that has facilitated the research and provided practical applications for the lessons learned. In addition, PTE will provide some financial support to sustain the work that has been seeded by the TNE mini-grant.    V. LESSONS LEARNED    This grant has supported two strands of work. The first is research and development on a student teacher assessment that has deep and wide-ranging implications for the ways that we train teachers and the second is research on the impact of our programs on our students and their pupils which will have a strong effect on program accountability. While these two strands are certainly related, they are also instructive individually. Often the fieldwork component of a teacher education program is a capstone or cumulative experience. Given its importance, its assessment needs considerable attention so that it does not become a lost portion of a teachers&rsquo; development. The case study we conducted gives us a lens into select classrooms within a progressive urban high school, but not into all high schools, not even to all progressive or urban schools. Understanding the disconnect between the subjective nature of the student teacher&rsquo;s experience, and the objective nature of (even the most well-meaning observational) assessment highlights the importance of the differences.    A general conclusion from this case study is the importance of the limitations of the student teaching assessment endeavor. The field has long acknowledged the variability of the student teaching experience; what is essential in this next era of research is to understand the importance of that variability&mdash;how the student teaching experience impacts a given student teacher in a particular context. In turn, that knowledge can deeply inform the development of assessments. In its attempt to understand the cooperating teachers&rsquo; conceptualization of student teaching, and their role within that concept, the ways in which we assess student teaching can become more cognizant of giving voice to multiple perspectives and the uniqueness of experience.    The lesson learned from the follow-up study is a hopeful one. While it is difficult to maintain contact with students once they leave the institution, technology provides new ways to keep track of students, and a culture of mutual accountability has resulted in greater willingness for institutions to cooperate and share information. We still must make sure that we are measuring the right constructs with instruments that are reliable and valid for the inferences we wish to make. However, we don&rsquo;t feel quite so lonely in this daunting endeavor&mdash;partnership is crucial to success.    V. EFFECTS UPON THE INSTITUTION    The effects of this project can be witnessed not only in Steinhardt, but also in its relationships with partner institutions. This kind of inquiry, with strands connecting practicing and pre-service teachers in the public schools, teacher education curricular decisions, and faculty research, results in growth in each area. First, it creates a culture of accountability, where academic goals are tied to practice, and where needs of the NYC public schools have their prominent place in the teacher education program. Ongoing data collection from each component of the research will necessitate continued communication, and meaningful use of data. For example, as NYU grows its partnership with schools, the role of NYU graduates mentoring current NYU pre-service teacher candidates can grow. As a result, NYU departments receive frequent and relevant feedback. Further, as more matches are made with past students, the more the institution will be able to monitor and revise its programs to meet the needs of the pupils we serve. As our ability to communicate with practicing teachers increases, so does what we are able to use as comparative data. What is most representative of the TNE research is the quality of questions and conversations it has engendered, and the direction in which it points our further work.    REFERENCES    Danielson, C.

Although most research regarding teacher-student relationships investigate the elementary years of schooling, teachers have the unique opportunity to support students&rsquo; academic and social development at all levels of schooling (Baker et al., 2008; Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 1998; McCormick, Cappella, O&rsquo;Connor, &amp; McClowry, in press). Aligned with attachment theory (Ainsworth, 1982; Bowlby, 1969), positive teacher-student relationships enable students to feel safe and secure in their learning environments and provide scaffolding for important social and academic skills (Baker et al., 2008; O&rsquo;Connor, Dearing, &amp; Collins, 2011; Silver, Measelle, Armstron, &amp; Essex, 2005). Teachers who support students in the learning environment can positively impact their social and academic outcomes, which is important for the long-term trajectory of school and eventually employment (Baker et al., 2008; O&rsquo;Connor et al., 2011; Silver et al., 2005).    When teachers form positive bonds with students, classrooms become supportive spaces in which students can engage in academically and socially productive ways (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Positive teacher-student relationships are classified as having the presence of closeness, warmth, and positivity (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Students who have positive relationships with their teachers use them as a secure base from which they can explore the classroom and school setting both academically and socially, to take on academic challenges and work on social-emotional development (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). This includes, relationships with peers, and developing self-esteem and self-concept (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Through this secure relationship, students learn about socially appropriate behaviors as well as academic expectations and how to achieve these expectations (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Students in low-income schools can especially benefit from positive relationships with teachers (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005).    Students in high-poverty urban schools may benefit from positive teacher-student relationships even more than students in high-income schools, because of the risks associated with poverty (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). Risk outcomes associated with poverty include high rates of high school dropout, lower rates of college applications, low self-efficacy, and low self-confidence (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). There are several factors that can protect against the negative outcomes often associated with low-income schooling, one of which is a positive and supportive relationship with an adult, most often a teacher (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). Low-income students who have strong teacher-student relationships have higher academic achievement and have more positive social-emotional adjustment than their peers who do not have a positive relationship with a teacher (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005).    There is substantial research on the importance of teacher-student relationships in the early elementary years (Pianta, 1992; Hamre &amp; Pianta 2001). However, little is known about the effects of teacher-student relationships on high school students. Studies show that early teacher-student relationships affect early academic and social outcomes as well as future academic outcomes (Pianta 1992; Hamre &amp; Pianta 2001), but few researchers have looked at the effects of teacher-student relationships in later years of schooling. Researchers who have investigated teacher-student relationships for older students have found that positive teacher-student relationships are associated with positive academic and social outcomes for high school students (Alexander, Entwisle, &amp; Horset, 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009). Academic Outcomes Although many studies focus on the importance of early teacher-student relationships, some studies have found that teacher-student relationships are important in transition years; the years when students transition from elementary to middle school or middle to high school (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009; Midgley, Feldlaufer, &amp; Eccles, 1989). Studies of math competence in students transitioning from elementary to middle school have found that students who move from having positive relationships with teachers at the end of elementary school to less positive relationships with teachers in middle school significantly decreased in math skills (Midgley et al., 1989). For students who are considered at high risk for dropping out of high school, math achievement is significantly impacted by the perception of having a caring teacher (Midgley et al., 1989). Furthermore, students who went from low teacher closeness to high teacher closeness significantly increased in math skills over the transition year, from elementary to middle school (Midgley et al., 1989). These studies show that relationships with teachers in the later years of schooling can still significantly impact the academic achievement trajectories of students (Midgley et al., 1989). Another example of the importance of teacher-student relationships in high school students stems from intervention studies aimed at improving academic outcomes for low-income students (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). In one intervention study that aimed to increase positive relationships between low-income high school students and their teachers, results showed that students who participated in the intervention significantly improved their GPA over the course of five months (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). Such research shows that positive teacher-student relationships can improve academic skills in students as early as middle school and as late as high school (Midgley et al., 1989; Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). In addition to positive teacher-student relationships, students&rsquo; motivation to learn is another factor that influences social and academic outcomes.    A possible reason for the association between academic improvement and positive teacher-student relationships is students&rsquo; motivation and desire to learn (Wentzel, 1998). Motivation may play a key role in the relationship between teacher-student relationships and academic outcomes (Bandura, 1997; Fan &amp; Willams, 2010; Pajares &amp; Graham, 1996; Ryan, Stiller, &amp; Lynch, 1994; Wentzel, 2003; Zimmerman, Bandura, &amp; Martinez-Pons, 1992). Motivational theorists suggest that students&rsquo; perception of their relationship with their teacher is essential in motivating students to perform well (Bandura, 1997; Fan &amp; Willams, 2010; Pajares &amp; Graham, 1996; Ryan, Stiller, &amp; Lynch, 1994; Wentzel, 2003; Zimmerman, Bandura, &amp; Martinez-Pons, 1992). Students who perceive their relationship with their teacher as positive, warm and close are motivated to be more engaged in school and to improve their academic achievement (Hughes, Cavell, &amp; Jackson, 1999). Students&rsquo; motivation to learn is impacted positively by having a caring and supportive relationship with a teacher (Wentzel, 1998).    Motivation is closely linked to student&rsquo;s perceptions of teacher expectations. Studies of middle and high school students have shown that students shape their own educational expectations from their perceptions of their teachers&rsquo; expectations (Muller, Katz, &amp; Dance, 1999). Students who perceive that their teachers have high expectations of their academic achievement are more motivated to try to meet those expectations and perform better academically than their peers who perceive low expectations from their teachers (Muller et al., 1999). Due to the influence of expectations on motivation, expectations can be an important factor on a students&rsquo; academic achievement.    Furthermore, teacher-student relationships have an impact on the academic self-esteem of students (Ryan et al., 1994). High-poverty students often have low academic self-esteem and low confidence in their academic and vocational futures (Wentzel, 2003). Thus, positive relationships with teachers are important in supporting higher levels of self-esteem, higher academic self-efficacy, and more confidence in future employment outcomes (Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Self-confidence and future aspirations have a significant impact on students&rsquo; interest in school, their academic self-efficacy and in turn, their academic achievement (Wentzel, 2003). In addition to academic achievement, positive teacher-student relationships provide important social outcomes for students. Social Outcomes Although there is more research regarding the academic effects of positive teacher-student relationships for older students, there are notable social outcomes as well. Teachers are an important source of social capital for students (Muller, 2001). Social capital in a classroom setting is defined as caring teacher-student relationships where students feel that they are both cared for and expected to succeed (Muller, 2001). Social capital from positive teacher-student relationships can manifest itself in many different ways. For high school students, positive teacher-student relationships can reduce rates of dropping out by nearly half, help explore options for college, and provide support for further academic or vocational aspirations (Dika &amp; Singh, 2002). Common reasons for dropping out include low levels of family support, low academic achievement, poor relationships with peers and adults, and low interest in academics (Henry, Knigh, &amp; Thornberry, 2012). Positive teacher-student relationships can impact students social and academic outcomes, and thus reduce drop-out rates (Dika &amp; Singh, 2002; Wentzel, 2003). Low-income students often have neither the support they need to complete high school nor access to the information they need to pursue education beyond high school (Dika &amp;Singh, 2002). It is important for low-income students who experience academic difficulties and negative social outcomes to gain social capital from their teachers, because research shows they can benefit from the guidance and support (Croninger &amp; Lee, 2001). Further, teacher-student relationships can impact peer relationships in schools.    Teacher-student relationships can have a significant effect on the peer acceptance of students. Teachers&rsquo; interactions with students can affect classmates&rsquo; perceptions of individual students, in turn affecting which students classmates choose to interact with and accept (Hughes et al., 1999). Conflicting interactions between teachers and students may convey a lack of acceptance, causing other students to also reject the student involved in the conflict with the teacher (Hughes et al., 1999). Peer rejection significantly impacts self-esteem of students leading to several negative social outcomes (Hughes et al., 1999).    As mentioned earlier, students with high self-esteem are more likely to be self-efficacious and set higher goals (Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Self-esteem also affects students socially (Orth, Robins, &amp; Widaman, 2012). Students with high self-esteem are more likely to have positive relationships with peers as well as with adults (Orth et al., 2012). Self-esteem also affects students&rsquo; mental health outcomes including reducing anxiety and symptoms of depression (Orth et al., 2012). Self-esteem is especially important during adolescence and helps students develop a positive sense of self (Orth et al., 2012). A positive sense of self in adolescence leads to future outcomes including relationship satisfaction, job satisfaction, occupational status, emotional regulation, and physical health (Orth et al., 2012). The support of positive teacher-student relationships for self-esteem and related social outcomes affects students during schooling as well as in their future educational and occupational outcomes (Orth et al., 2012). Conclusion and Limitations    Although there is extensive research on the positive effects of teacher-student relationships on elementary school students, there is little research on middle and high school students. Middle and high school is when students begin to think about their academic futures, which are informed by academic achievement and social capital in elementary years (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009; Dika &amp; Singh, 2002; Muller, 2001). Early high school is usually when students dedicate themselves to graduating or decide to drop out (Henry et al., 2012). Currently, high school dropout rates are high, and improving teacher-student relationships for students at this stage may decrease dropout rates (Henry et al., 2012). Similarly, high school is when students decide if they plan to attend college or stop their education (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Henry et al., 2012). Therefore, it is important to develop positive teacher-student relationships during this time.    Empirical evidence does show that teacher-student relationships are very important for high school students (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Dika &amp;Singh, 2002; Hughes et al., 1999; Midgley et al., 1989; Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Studies that have investigated older students&rsquo; relationships with teachers have found that students improve both academically and socially from positive teacher-student relationships (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Dika &amp;Singh, 2002; Hughes et al., 1999; Midgley et al., 1989; Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). However, much of this research is dated. Due to the ever-changing nature of the American educational system and the increasingly diverse student body, more current studies are needed to look at the effects of teacher-student relationships for this changing population. It is important to learn more about teacher-student relationships for low-income students to decrease high school dropout, and improve students&rsquo; social-emotional development. Conducting research on the relationship between high school students and teachers may be essential in improving the outcomes of low-income middle and high school students, and can potentially inform future interventions to help older students perform better both academically and socially.

Although most research regarding teacher-student relationships investigate the elementary years of schooling, teachers have the unique opportunity to support students&rsquo; academic and social development at all levels of schooling (Baker et al., 2008; Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 1998; McCormick, Cappella, O&rsquo;Connor, &amp; McClowry, in press). Aligned with attachment theory (Ainsworth, 1982; Bowlby, 1969), positive teacher-student relationships enable students to feel safe and secure in their learning environments and provide scaffolding for important social and academic skills (Baker et al., 2008; O&rsquo;Connor, Dearing, &amp; Collins, 2011; Silver, Measelle, Armstron, &amp; Essex, 2005). Teachers who support students in the learning environment can positively impact their social and academic outcomes, which is important for the long-term trajectory of school and eventually employment (Baker et al., 2008; O&rsquo;Connor et al., 2011; Silver et al., 2005).    When teachers form positive bonds with students, classrooms become supportive spaces in which students can engage in academically and socially productive ways (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Positive teacher-student relationships are classified as having the presence of closeness, warmth, and positivity (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Students who have positive relationships with their teachers use them as a secure base from which they can explore the classroom and school setting both academically and socially, to take on academic challenges and work on social-emotional development (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). This includes, relationships with peers, and developing self-esteem and self-concept (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Through this secure relationship, students learn about socially appropriate behaviors as well as academic expectations and how to achieve these expectations (Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001). Students in low-income schools can especially benefit from positive relationships with teachers (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005).    Students in high-poverty urban schools may benefit from positive teacher-student relationships even more than students in high-income schools, because of the risks associated with poverty (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). Risk outcomes associated with poverty include high rates of high school dropout, lower rates of college applications, low self-efficacy, and low self-confidence (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). There are several factors that can protect against the negative outcomes often associated with low-income schooling, one of which is a positive and supportive relationship with an adult, most often a teacher (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). Low-income students who have strong teacher-student relationships have higher academic achievement and have more positive social-emotional adjustment than their peers who do not have a positive relationship with a teacher (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005).    There is substantial research on the importance of teacher-student relationships in the early elementary years (Pianta, 1992; Hamre &amp; Pianta 2001). However, little is known about the effects of teacher-student relationships on high school students. Studies show that early teacher-student relationships affect early academic and social outcomes as well as future academic outcomes (Pianta 1992; Hamre &amp; Pianta 2001), but few researchers have looked at the effects of teacher-student relationships in later years of schooling. Researchers who have investigated teacher-student relationships for older students have found that positive teacher-student relationships are associated with positive academic and social outcomes for high school students (Alexander, Entwisle, &amp; Horset, 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009). Academic Outcomes Although many studies focus on the importance of early teacher-student relationships, some studies have found that teacher-student relationships are important in transition years; the years when students transition from elementary to middle school or middle to high school (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009; Midgley, Feldlaufer, &amp; Eccles, 1989). Studies of math competence in students transitioning from elementary to middle school have found that students who move from having positive relationships with teachers at the end of elementary school to less positive relationships with teachers in middle school significantly decreased in math skills (Midgley et al., 1989). For students who are considered at high risk for dropping out of high school, math achievement is significantly impacted by the perception of having a caring teacher (Midgley et al., 1989). Furthermore, students who went from low teacher closeness to high teacher closeness significantly increased in math skills over the transition year, from elementary to middle school (Midgley et al., 1989). These studies show that relationships with teachers in the later years of schooling can still significantly impact the academic achievement trajectories of students (Midgley et al., 1989). Another example of the importance of teacher-student relationships in high school students stems from intervention studies aimed at improving academic outcomes for low-income students (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). In one intervention study that aimed to increase positive relationships between low-income high school students and their teachers, results showed that students who participated in the intervention significantly improved their GPA over the course of five months (Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). Such research shows that positive teacher-student relationships can improve academic skills in students as early as middle school and as late as high school (Midgley et al., 1989; Murray &amp; Malmgren, 2005). In addition to positive teacher-student relationships, students&rsquo; motivation to learn is another factor that influences social and academic outcomes.    A possible reason for the association between academic improvement and positive teacher-student relationships is students&rsquo; motivation and desire to learn (Wentzel, 1998). Motivation may play a key role in the relationship between teacher-student relationships and academic outcomes (Bandura, 1997; Fan &amp; Willams, 2010; Pajares &amp; Graham, 1996; Ryan, Stiller, &amp; Lynch, 1994; Wentzel, 2003; Zimmerman, Bandura, &amp; Martinez-Pons, 1992). Motivational theorists suggest that students&rsquo; perception of their relationship with their teacher is essential in motivating students to perform well (Bandura, 1997; Fan &amp; Willams, 2010; Pajares &amp; Graham, 1996; Ryan, Stiller, &amp; Lynch, 1994; Wentzel, 2003; Zimmerman, Bandura, &amp; Martinez-Pons, 1992). Students who perceive their relationship with their teacher as positive, warm and close are motivated to be more engaged in school and to improve their academic achievement (Hughes, Cavell, &amp; Jackson, 1999). Students&rsquo; motivation to learn is impacted positively by having a caring and supportive relationship with a teacher (Wentzel, 1998).    Motivation is closely linked to student&rsquo;s perceptions of teacher expectations. Studies of middle and high school students have shown that students shape their own educational expectations from their perceptions of their teachers&rsquo; expectations (Muller, Katz, &amp; Dance, 1999). Students who perceive that their teachers have high expectations of their academic achievement are more motivated to try to meet those expectations and perform better academically than their peers who perceive low expectations from their teachers (Muller et al., 1999). Due to the influence of expectations on motivation, expectations can be an important factor on a students&rsquo; academic achievement.    Furthermore, teacher-student relationships have an impact on the academic self-esteem of students (Ryan et al., 1994). High-poverty students often have low academic self-esteem and low confidence in their academic and vocational futures (Wentzel, 2003). Thus, positive relationships with teachers are important in supporting higher levels of self-esteem, higher academic self-efficacy, and more confidence in future employment outcomes (Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Self-confidence and future aspirations have a significant impact on students&rsquo; interest in school, their academic self-efficacy and in turn, their academic achievement (Wentzel, 2003). In addition to academic achievement, positive teacher-student relationships provide important social outcomes for students. Social Outcomes Although there is more research regarding the academic effects of positive teacher-student relationships for older students, there are notable social outcomes as well. Teachers are an important source of social capital for students (Muller, 2001). Social capital in a classroom setting is defined as caring teacher-student relationships where students feel that they are both cared for and expected to succeed (Muller, 2001). Social capital from positive teacher-student relationships can manifest itself in many different ways. For high school students, positive teacher-student relationships can reduce rates of dropping out by nearly half, help explore options for college, and provide support for further academic or vocational aspirations (Dika &amp; Singh, 2002). Common reasons for dropping out include low levels of family support, low academic achievement, poor relationships with peers and adults, and low interest in academics (Henry, Knigh, &amp; Thornberry, 2012). Positive teacher-student relationships can impact students social and academic outcomes, and thus reduce drop-out rates (Dika &amp; Singh, 2002; Wentzel, 2003). Low-income students often have neither the support they need to complete high school nor access to the information they need to pursue education beyond high school (Dika &amp;Singh, 2002). It is important for low-income students who experience academic difficulties and negative social outcomes to gain social capital from their teachers, because research shows they can benefit from the guidance and support (Croninger &amp; Lee, 2001). Further, teacher-student relationships can impact peer relationships in schools.    Teacher-student relationships can have a significant effect on the peer acceptance of students. Teachers&rsquo; interactions with students can affect classmates&rsquo; perceptions of individual students, in turn affecting which students classmates choose to interact with and accept (Hughes et al., 1999). Conflicting interactions between teachers and students may convey a lack of acceptance, causing other students to also reject the student involved in the conflict with the teacher (Hughes et al., 1999). Peer rejection significantly impacts self-esteem of students leading to several negative social outcomes (Hughes et al., 1999).    As mentioned earlier, students with high self-esteem are more likely to be self-efficacious and set higher goals (Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Self-esteem also affects students socially (Orth, Robins, &amp; Widaman, 2012). Students with high self-esteem are more likely to have positive relationships with peers as well as with adults (Orth et al., 2012). Self-esteem also affects students&rsquo; mental health outcomes including reducing anxiety and symptoms of depression (Orth et al., 2012). Self-esteem is especially important during adolescence and helps students develop a positive sense of self (Orth et al., 2012). A positive sense of self in adolescence leads to future outcomes including relationship satisfaction, job satisfaction, occupational status, emotional regulation, and physical health (Orth et al., 2012). The support of positive teacher-student relationships for self-esteem and related social outcomes affects students during schooling as well as in their future educational and occupational outcomes (Orth et al., 2012). Conclusion and Limitations    Although there is extensive research on the positive effects of teacher-student relationships on elementary school students, there is little research on middle and high school students. Middle and high school is when students begin to think about their academic futures, which are informed by academic achievement and social capital in elementary years (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi &amp; KewallRamani, 2009; Dika &amp; Singh, 2002; Muller, 2001). Early high school is usually when students dedicate themselves to graduating or decide to drop out (Henry et al., 2012). Currently, high school dropout rates are high, and improving teacher-student relationships for students at this stage may decrease dropout rates (Henry et al., 2012). Similarly, high school is when students decide if they plan to attend college or stop their education (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Henry et al., 2012). Therefore, it is important to develop positive teacher-student relationships during this time.    Empirical evidence does show that teacher-student relationships are very important for high school students (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Dika &amp;Singh, 2002; Hughes et al., 1999; Midgley et al., 1989; Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). Studies that have investigated older students&rsquo; relationships with teachers have found that students improve both academically and socially from positive teacher-student relationships (Alexander et al., 1997; Cataldi et al., 2009; Dika &amp;Singh, 2002; Hughes et al., 1999; Midgley et al., 1989; Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 2003). However, much of this research is dated. Due to the ever-changing nature of the American educational system and the increasingly diverse student body, more current studies are needed to look at the effects of teacher-student relationships for this changing population. It is important to learn more about teacher-student relationships for low-income students to decrease high school dropout, and improve students&rsquo; social-emotional development. Conducting research on the relationship between high school students and teachers may be essential in improving the outcomes of low-income middle and high school students, and can potentially inform future interventions to help older students perform better both academically and socially.

It was founded by Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury in the Jefferson and Madison administrations. Gallatin aimed to establish \" in this immense and fast - growing city ,&rdquo; as he put it , &ldquo; a system of rational and practical education fitting for all and graciously opened to all .\" He was inspired in part by the founders of the University of London , with whom he communicated . As they did , he envisioned a university inspired by and imbued with the intense activity and energy of city life and city commerce. He spoke of NYU as being &ldquo;in and of the city,&rdquo; but even then a city linked with other parts of the world.    In 1890, at a time of immense ferment in American schooling, and mass immigration to New York City, NYU opened the first university-based graduate school dedicated to the advanced education of teachers and school administrators. Thus NYU implicitly rejected what was then the prevailing idea &ndash; namely, that universities are not essential to the education of educators, that practical knowledge alone, rather than integrated practical and theoretical knowledge, is sufficient input for learning to teach.    Called the School of Pedagogy, the new school was the forerunner of today&rsquo;s Steinhardt School, which remains the NYU home of teacher education. Over the course of the twentieth century, the School also became the NYU home of graduate and undergraduate professional education in media, applied psychology, physical and occupational therapy, nutrition, music, and the visual arts. All of these programs emerged from an initial focus on the learning needs of pre-collegiate youth.    Today, NYU teacher education spans many program areas and three Steinhardt departments: the Department of Teaching and Learning ; the Department of Art and Arts Professions ; and the Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions . At the same time, the NYU Teacher Education Program as a whole has a general pedagogical core, including a set of core courses and faculty communities of practice overseeing them; an organizational core comprised of a Teacher Education Council and Teacher Education Working Group; and five core values described below that derive from its history, as well as its ambition to meet the contemporary challenges of teacher education.    The NYU Teacher Education Program is fully accredited by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council.    Core Values       To be in and of the city and engage deeply in New York schools    To value content knowledge (disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and inter-professional), and also pedagogical knowledge as crucial for effective teaching    To integrate theory and practice proactively rather than expect students to do it on their own    To promote intercultural openness as a tool for teaching - and in this sense to be in and of the world    To engage habitually in organizational self-scrutiny, and in the process to contribute to the knowledge base for effective teaching and teacher education       To be in and of the city and engaged deeply in New York schools.    The orientation to the city accounts for NYU&rsquo;s successful efforts over the last decade to build a large network of partnership schools serving some of New York City&rsquo;s poorest neighborhoods. This orientation also accounts for the emphasis across the program&rsquo;s core courses and fieldwork on the role that even the poorest communities can play as resources for children, youth, families, and teachers. Finally, it accounts for how NYU discharges its obligations under accreditation by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council to educate teachers to be caring professionals.    To value content knowledge (disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and inter-professional), and also pedagogical knowledge as crucial for effective teaching.    The attention NYU pays to both content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge -- evident in the 1890 launch of teacher education at NYU &ndash; has continued to shape it in the century since. In 2004, for example, NYU established a university-wide oversight committee for teacher education called the Teacher Education Council. It is co-chaired by the Dean of Steinhardt and the Dean of the College of Arts and Science, and includes members of the Teacher Education Faculty, the Faculty of Arts and Science, and faculty from other Steinhardt programs which contribute to teacher education &ndash; for example, programs in the arts, in psychology, and in the history of education.    To integrate theory and practice pro-actively rather than expect students to do it on their own.    The third core value of NYU Teacher Education holds that it is not enough to give equal attention to content and pedagogy. Good programs must also help students integrate what they are learning in these areas. This value accounts for the extensive emphasis at NYU on well-scaffolded fieldwork, including field-based courses and seminars; and on maintaining a faculty whose members across ranks include both those with deep connections to practice, and those with rich experience in content and content research.    To promote intercultural openness as a tool for teaching &ndash; and in this sense to be in and of the world.    The fourth value - NYU&rsquo;s promotion of intercultural openness as a tool for teaching - accounts for the recent development of cross-national programs at NYU in the teaching of Spanish, Chinese, and French ; for an increase in the number of international teacher candidates; for study-abroad opportunities in teacher education ; and for increased efforts across program areas to ensure that NYU teacher candidates gain proficiency in teaching English language learners . It also accounts for efforts across the program core and program areas to ensure that NYU teacher candidates acquire an ethic of cultural respect in the face of probable cultural mismatch between their own backgrounds and the backgrounds of increasing numbers of their students. Today&rsquo;s NYU candidates launch their teaching careers amid the greatest mass migration of peoples and contact among cultures the world has ever known. Being &ldquo;in and of the city&rdquo; of New York, the city of immigrants, gives NYU a unique position for helping future teachers develop global competence within and beyond US borders.    To engage habitually in organizational self - scrutiny , and in the process to contribute to the knowledge base for effective teaching and teacher education .    Finally, the fifth core value of teacher education at NYU &ndash; the emphasis on data-based self-scrutiny and rigorous research &ndash; accounts for NYU&rsquo;s active efforts to be accountable for its impact on its students and on their students. The inventive Center for Research on Teaching and Learning is central to these efforts. This value also accounts for the faculty&rsquo;s many contributions to teacher education elsewhere also.    Today, as non-university teacher education programs proliferate, NYU remains an outspoken advocate of the important role that research universities can play in the education of teachers. NYU faculty are now studying how children learn science, how games can be used to teach science, how students transition to high school, how teacher management and teacher care co-mingle in classrooms, how schools manage discipline, how young black men progress through elementary and middle school years, how school-university partnerships function, how the learning of English language learners may best be assessed, how mathematics disability intersects or not with reading disability, and much more of great usefulness to the world.
