To prepare students who can use evidence-based research to facilitate the initiation, development, and management of programs related to the prevention and intervention efforts for psychological, social, educational, and health problems.       The MA in Human Development and Social Intervention offers a distinct curriculum that explicitly emphasizes the practical skills of research design and methods , grant writing and grant management , and program development and evaluation from a community psychology perspective. The curriculum is firmly rooted in the traditions and lexicon of community, social, personality, and developmental psychology. You will learn how issues such as poverty, race, gender, and culture influence the daily lives of individuals. Hands-on research and grant writing skills will aid your efforts to apply social interventions to these issues.    The program is designed for college graduates with backgrounds in the social sciences, including psychology, social work, sociology, anthropology, and race, gender or ethnic studies, as well as those who have work or volunteer experiences in non-profit organizations, schools, health facilities, and community centers and seek to further or change the direction of their careers.    All students in this program will receive training in:       Theories of human development;    Theories and techniques of preventive and promotive interventions;    Theories and concepts of the influence of culture and context in various settings;    Conceptualization and analysis of individual and social change;    Research methodology including program management and evaluation and grant preparation and grant management.       In addition to a core of research methodology and psychology courses, students will also pursue one of the following three areas of study:       Developmental Psychology : Students will examine classical as well as contemporary literature on developmental changes in emotional, social, and cognitive areas, with specific attention to the roles of culture and context (e.g., family, school, community) in these processes.    Health : Students will examine the individual level, socioecological, and sociopolitical factors that shape physical and mental health outcomes for individuals, families, and communities.    Methodology : Students will gain expertise in research design and in the use of various methods of quantitative and qualitative reasoning and analysis of data.       By the end of the MA program, students will be able to:       Identify and analyze the social, cognitive, emotional, and health development across the lifespan as well as the psychological, cultural, and socioecological factors that influence the contexts and systems in which people develop (e.g., families, schools, and neighborhoods).    Apply evidence-based research to facilitate the initiation, development, and management of programs related to the prevention and intervention efforts for psychological, social, educational, and health problems.    Demonstrate the practical skills of research design and methods, grant writing and grant management, and program development and evaluation from a community psychology perspective.    Integrate the traditions and lexicon of community, social, personality, and developmental psychology into their work.    Describe and analyze how issues such as poverty, race, gender, and culture influence the daily lives of individuals.

The MA in Human Development and Social Intervention offers a distinct curriculum that explicitly emphasizes the practical skills of research design and methods , grant writing and grant management , and program development and evaluation from a community psychology perspective. The curriculum is firmly rooted in the traditions and lexicon of community, social, personality, and developmental psychology. You will learn how issues such as poverty, race, gender, and culture influence the daily lives of individuals. Hands-on research and grant writing skills will aid your efforts to apply social interventions to these issues.    The program is designed for college graduates with backgrounds in the social sciences, including psychology, social work, sociology, anthropology, and race, gender or ethnic studies, as well as those who have work or volunteer experiences in non-profit organizations, schools, health facilities, and community centers and seek to further or change the direction of their careers.    All students in this program will receive training in:       Theories of human development;    Theories and techniques of preventive and promotive interventions;    Theories and concepts of the influence of culture and context in various settings;    Conceptualization and analysis of individual and social change;    Research methodology including program management and evaluation and grant preparation and grant management.       In addition to a core of research methodology and psychology courses, students will also pursue one of the following three areas of study:       Developmental Psychology : Students will examine classical as well as contemporary literature on developmental changes in emotional, social, and cognitive areas, with specific attention to the roles of culture and context (e.g., family, school, community) in these processes.    Health : Students will examine the individual level, socioecological, and sociopolitical factors that shape physical and mental health outcomes for individuals, families, and communities.    Methodology : Students will gain expertise in research design and in the use of various methods of quantitative and qualitative reasoning and analysis of data.       By the end of the MA program, students will be able to:       Identify and analyze the social, cognitive, emotional, and health development across the lifespan as well as the psychological, cultural, and socioecological factors that influence the contexts and systems in which people develop (e.g., families, schools, and neighborhoods).    Apply evidence-based research to facilitate the initiation, development, and management of programs related to the prevention and intervention efforts for psychological, social, educational, and health problems.    Demonstrate the practical skills of research design and methods, grant writing and grant management, and program development and evaluation from a community psychology perspective.    Integrate the traditions and lexicon of community, social, personality, and developmental psychology into their work.    Describe and analyze how issues such as poverty, race, gender, and culture influence the daily lives of individuals.

NYUPSI on Twitter                  PSI MISSION STATEMENT The mission of the Doctoral Training Program in Psychology and Social Intervention at the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development (Department of Applied Psychology) at New York University is to train action scientists prepared to work in a variety of settings in order to understand, transform, and improve the contexts and systems in which humans develop across the life span. The program places a strong emphasis on: (a) understanding and assessing social settings, systems, and policies; (b) creating/improving, implementing and evaluating prevention and intervention programs; and (c) understanding various forms of diversity and structural inequality among individuals, institutions, communities, and societies. Ours is a research intensive program with a strong quantitative training component. Program faculty study a wide range of ecologies (e.g., families, schools, neighborhoods, policy contexts, programs) and preventive and policy interventions (e.g., psychological, social, educational and health programs), locally, nationally and internationally. Our faculty also conducts research on how cultural factors and identities influence and interact with experiences of these ecologies and interventions. Our New York City location provides an ideal urban setting for studying many kinds of communities, combined with gateways to the world at large. About Our Program Students work collaboratively with faculty mentors on a range of activities in these research areas, including study design, data collection and analysis, manuscript preparations, conference presentations, policy briefs, and evaluation activities. Program faculty collaborate closely with one another, as well as with other social, behavioral, health and policy scientists at NYU, other universities, and service, community and policy organizations. Program faculty also direct or co-direct affiliated institutes and centers at NYU, including the Institute for Human Development and Social Change, the Center for Health, Identity, Behavior, &amp; Prevention Studies, the Child and Family Policy Center, and the Center for Research on Culture, Development, and Education. PSI Program Goals &amp; Objectives       Build content knowledge base to understand and improve human development in social context.    Develop methodological skills that enable analysis of change over time and within and across levels of human ecology.    Acquire abilities to apply psychological and social science principles to the understanding of social settings, social/cultural contexts, and social and policy interventions.    Develop abilities to conceptualize, interpret, evaluate and disseminate evidence-based social and policy interventions; and develop the ethical, interpersonal, organizational, and technical capacities to undertake high-quality professional work in psychology and social intervention.
