Brian Ray  is a third-year doctoral student in American Studies who works in the transnational history of capitalism and social movements, queer studies, science studies, and transnational religion studies. He holds a BA in Women's Studies and Philosophy from the University of Georgia. His dissertation project is a transdisciplinary study of gay conservative activism and thought in the U.S. and Mexico. Tentatively, he conceives of gay conservatism as a post-WWII political \"third-way\" movement that poses interesting questions regarding left/right political identification, subjectivity, and the structure of history. Drawing on immanent critique and biopolitical frameworks, his project is in conversation with reconfigurations of Thomas Frank's infamous \"What's the matter with Kansas?\", like Bethany Moreton's reversal \"What matters to Arkansas?\" As such, his project explores how some counterintuitive or seemingly frustrated political identifications, like gay conservatives, are made possible by mapping the ethical substance of self-proclaimed post-partisan politics. Without psychologizing them, neither right nor left, what motivates these political actors? In this endeavor, particular attention is given to transnational material formations that have inaugurated and facilitated gay conservative movements in particular but that speak questions of subjectivity and progress in broader ways. A few include: narco trafficking, aesthetics, atheistic and theistic Satanisms, BDSM, contemporary science, the HIV/AIDS crisis, prosperity gospel, and the rise of neoliberalism in the Americas.  James Rodriguez entered NYU's American Studies PhD program in 2012 following his graduation from Brooklyn College, where he obtained a BA in both English and Psychology.

Most recently, he worked as a contributor to the Advertising Educational Foundation and The Smithsonian Institution's online exhibition, Race, Ethnicity, and Advertising in America 1890-1900.  Stuart Schrader is a sixth-year PhD candidate in American Studies. His dissertation is entitled \"American Streets, Foreign Territory: How Counterinsurgent Knowledge Militarized Policing and Criminalized Color,\" for which he was awarded the Mellon/American Council of Learned Societies Dissertation Completion Fellowship. The dissertation examines transformations in policing that occurred in response to 1960s political struggles in the United States. These transformations, often characterized as the War on Crime and the rise of the carceral state, relied, the dissertation argues, on transnational networks of social scientists and policing and counterinsurgency experts. He has published in American Quarterly, Social Text: Periscope, CITY: Analysis of Urban Trends, NACLA Report on the Americas, Brooklyn Rail, and Maximum Rocknroll.   Jackson Smith is a first-year doctoral student in American Studies. He is broadly concerned with how practices of dispossession shape urban futures. As an undergraduate he conducted original archival research on the squatters\u2019 movement on the gentrifying Lower East Side. This research culminated with his article in Perspectives on Anarchist Theory, as well as his participation from 2011 to 2014 with the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space (MoRUS), a storefront museum about squatting and community gardening in the East Village. He was the co-founder and curator of the MoRUS Film Fest in 2013 and 2014. Although continuing to research urban redevelopment by asking how international investment practices materially transform the city, Jackson has recently taken up dispossession as a socio-legal problem. He is devising a research project on civil asset forfeiture, a legal device that enables law enforcement to seize currency and other property outside of criminal proceedings. Civil forfeiture is premised upon the legal culpability of objects rather than people and effectively terminates the due process rights of the liberal subject. His research on the phenomenon will chart its legal formation during the 1970s and 1980s and ethnographically investigate its utilization to seize homes in contemporary Philadelphia.          Jennifer Flores Sternad \u2019s work as an academic, curator and writer focuses on militant art, performance, and artistic practices aligned with left social movements in the Americas.

Sam Markwell is a first-year PhD student with an MA in American Studies from the University of New Mexico. His work is situated in the fields of historical materialism, anthropology, geography, Native studies, settler colonial studies, and ethnic studies. His research investigates the array of concepts and apparatuses of \"security\" that animate U.S. and Israeli settler colonial projects, specifically focusing on contestations over food and water infrastructures. By critiquing the roles played by the U.S. and Israel in shaping life in these regions, he aims to reorient the study of security away from the priorities and frameworks of the settler nation-state to alternative political and ethical geographies of the Americas and West Asia. He locates the specific questions of this research in conversation with general questions of the reciprocal relations between material processes of urbanization and colonization; structures and dynamics of biological, psychical, and social life; and international formations of solidarity and accountability. His publications include essays in La Jicarita: An Online Magazine of Environmental Politics in New Mexico ; a chapter, \u201cGreenwashing and the Scrubbing of United States and Israeli Settler Colonialisms\u201d, in the anthology Queer After Homonationalism and Pinkwashing , under review by Duke University Press, and an article \u201cThe Colonial Hydropolitics of Infrastructure in the Middle Rio Grande Valley\u201d, forthcoming from WIREs Water .

Brian Ray  is a third-year doctoral student in American Studies who works in the transnational history of capitalism and social movements, queer studies, science studies, and transnational religion studies. He holds a BA in Women's Studies and Philosophy from the University of Georgia. His dissertation project is a transdisciplinary study of gay conservative activism and thought in the U.S. and Mexico. Tentatively, he conceives of gay conservatism as a post-WWII political \"third-way\" movement that poses interesting questions regarding left/right political identification, subjectivity, and the structure of history. Drawing on immanent critique and biopolitical frameworks, his project is in conversation with reconfigurations of Thomas Frank's infamous \"What's the matter with Kansas?\", like Bethany Moreton's reversal \"What matters to Arkansas?\" As such, his project explores how some counterintuitive or seemingly frustrated political identifications, like gay conservatives, are made possible by mapping the ethical substance of self-proclaimed post-partisan politics. Without psychologizing them, neither right nor left, what motivates these political actors? In this endeavor, particular attention is given to transnational material formations that have inaugurated and facilitated gay conservative movements in particular but that speak questions of subjectivity and progress in broader ways. A few include: narco trafficking, aesthetics, atheistic and theistic Satanisms, BDSM, contemporary science, the HIV/AIDS crisis, prosperity gospel, and the rise of neoliberalism in the Americas.  James Rodriguez entered NYU's American Studies PhD program in 2012 following his graduation from Brooklyn College, where he obtained a BA in both English and Psychology.

Most recently, he worked as a contributor to the Advertising Educational Foundation and The Smithsonian Institution's online exhibition, Race, Ethnicity, and Advertising in America 1890-1900.  Stuart Schrader is a sixth-year PhD candidate in American Studies. His dissertation is entitled \"American Streets, Foreign Territory: How Counterinsurgent Knowledge Militarized Policing and Criminalized Color,\" for which he was awarded the Mellon/American Council of Learned Societies Dissertation Completion Fellowship. The dissertation examines transformations in policing that occurred in response to 1960s political struggles in the United States. These transformations, often characterized as the War on Crime and the rise of the carceral state, relied, the dissertation argues, on transnational networks of social scientists and policing and counterinsurgency experts. He has published in American Quarterly, Social Text: Periscope, CITY: Analysis of Urban Trends, NACLA Report on the Americas, Brooklyn Rail, and Maximum Rocknroll.   Jackson Smith is a first-year doctoral student in American Studies. He is broadly concerned with how practices of dispossession shape urban futures. As an undergraduate he conducted original archival research on the squatters\u2019 movement on the gentrifying Lower East Side. This research culminated with his article in Perspectives on Anarchist Theory, as well as his participation from 2011 to 2014 with the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space (MoRUS), a storefront museum about squatting and community gardening in the East Village. He was the co-founder and curator of the MoRUS Film Fest in 2013 and 2014. Although continuing to research urban redevelopment by asking how international investment practices materially transform the city, Jackson has recently taken up dispossession as a socio-legal problem. He is devising a research project on civil asset forfeiture, a legal device that enables law enforcement to seize currency and other property outside of criminal proceedings. Civil forfeiture is premised upon the legal culpability of objects rather than people and effectively terminates the due process rights of the liberal subject. His research on the phenomenon will chart its legal formation during the 1970s and 1980s and ethnographically investigate its utilization to seize homes in contemporary Philadelphia.

The theme of this year\u2019s conference is MOVEMENT. We have received a number of wonderful session proposals, and we are now accepting titles and abstracts for individual papers and presentations. The deadline for submissions of paper titles and abstracts is 28 February 2015. Abstracts should be submitted to me at at pc4[at]nyu[dot]edu.   Any questions should be directed to Pam Crabtree at pc4[at]nyu[dot]edu. We look forward to seeing you all in May.   Overview   The Theoretical Archaeology Group began in the U.K. in 1979 as gathering of archaeologists interested in exploring the intersection of archaeology with frontiers in critical theory, philosophy, and anthropology. Since that time, an annual meeting has been held in the U.K. A sibling branch was established in Scandinavia in 2000. In 2008, the TAG-USA group was formed and an inaugural conference held at Columbia University. The conference has grown each year and now provides a vibrant link between American and European archaeologists. TAG conferences have sparked some of the most inventive archaeological articles published in venues such as Archaeological Dialogues, Antiquity, and Social Archaeology. Each year, a different institution takes responsibility for organizing the conference and serving as primary host. Dr. Pam Crabtree of the Department of Anthropology, New York University, serves on the national board and has committed to organizing the 2015 meeting in New York.   2015 Theme: Movement   Each year the organizing committee picks a new theme for the conference.\u00a0 These themes are broad in order to encourage participants to challenge participants to think of their work in new theoretical ways and to draw connections between disparate views and methodologies.   Taking inspiration from the itinerant nature of the meetings themselves, the theme for 2015\u2019s conference is \u201cmigration.\u201d Whether it is the movement of technologies, peoples, or ideas, archaeologists are interested in how migrations occur and what makes them fail or succeed. Migrations are such a fundamental aspect of archaeological research that it can be easy to take for granted the theoretical arguments underpinning these interpretations. In light of this, the theme is intended to call attention to migrations in archaeology, and explore how far our theoretical understandings of them have come.   Perhaps it is no mistake that a conference on migration should take place in New York, a long-time port of call for people from all over the world, each group bringing with them new cultures, ideas, and ways of seeing the world.\u00a0\u00a0 We hope that such a setting will stimulate participants to think about theme in varied and exciting ways. Migrations in archaeology don\u2019t just exist as an explanatory tool of the past, but also take place in theoretical movements across time and space. Archaeologists and archaeology is a mobile profession, and as such, migrations play a role not just in our understanding of the past but also in our very practice. Moreover, current trends in social media and publishing are changing the movement of ideas and theory throughout the archaeological world. We hope that sessions will explore the full-range of migrations in archaeology and are excited to see the full creative potential migrations provide!
