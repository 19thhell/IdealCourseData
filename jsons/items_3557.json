The new building will fulfill important academic space needs for NYU under a plan that was overwhelmingly approved by the City Council in 2012. The facility\u2019s many uses will include classrooms, teaching spaces for performing arts, a state-of-the-art sports facility, and student and faculty housing.   Collectively, the team chosen by NYU is responsible for an extraordinary roster of high profile commissions, including: the 9/11 Memorial Museum, the U.S. Embassy in London, the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture, and the 1983-2006 restoration and expansion of the New York Public Library. In higher education, the two firms have collectively worked on projects at Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, Yale, the University of Chicago, Princeton, Cornell, UNC-Charlotte, UCLA, UC San Diego, among many others, as well as NYU.   Among the design team\u2019s first steps will be a process of consultation involving many stakeholders in the University community and its neighbors. Feedback from these sessions will inform an iterative design process.   Alison Leary , NYU\u2019s Executive Vice President for Operations, said, \u201cWe chose this superb team for several reasons. First and foremost, we chose them for their reputation for design excellence.   \u201cNYU understands it will be held to a high standard for architectural excellence, and we believe we have selected the right team for this important project. These firms have won some of the most prestigious awards in the fields of architecture and design, and the exceptional quality of their work has earned them some of the most prominent commissions of our day.   \u201cNYU has a strong commitment to sustainability, and this team has an established track-record of integrating sustainability into their design process from inception, resulting in LEED Platinum and Gold buildings throughout the U.S. and in Europe. And their wide experience working with many of the top institutions of higher learning means that they understand not only the unique academic needs, but also the consultative and collaborative manner in which universities go about their business.\u201d   The Davis Brody Bond and KieranTimberlake team was chosen through an RFQ/RFP process, which launched summer 2014 with 16 initial firms. The criteria that guided the selection process included:     Reputation for professional excellence   Architectural design excellence   Successful experience in designing a functional and integrated building with multiple uses   Experience in delivering complex projects on schedule and budget   High environmental standards of sustainability   Sensitivity to environmental and cultural context   Sensitivity to community and historical environment       Successful experience in designing in a dense urban environment   Experience in responsiveness to diverse stakeholders   Experience across varying program typologies   Relevant size and capacity   A New York City presence   Experience with academic institutions     \u201cA building that will serve so many purposes and so many campus and community constituencies needs to be informed by a wide range of perspectives from our community. So, I would like to thank the Superblock Stewardship Advisory Committee \u2013 which is composed of faculty, students, and administrators from across the NYU community \u2013 and its chair, Tisch Professor Laurence Maslon, for their guidance and feedback at every stage of the selection process,\u201d added Leary.   \u201cWe would like to express our sincere appreciation to New York University for selecting our team and entrusting us with this important project,\u201d stated William H. Paxson , AIA, Partner at Davis Brody Bond. \u201cWe are well aware of the significance of the project for NYU and for the neighborhood. A terrific amount of work by the NYU community has already gone into developing the program, goals and design principles of this new building. Our goal will be to build upon that effort, and to help make this building a vibrant extension of a great urban campus and a sensitive addition to one of New York's most cherished neighborhoods.\u201d   \u201cWe are delighted by the chance to work on this extremely important project, and look forward to the wonderful opportunities it can offer the University and the community,\u201d stated James Timberlake , FAIA, Partner at KieranTimberlake. \u201cWe are committed to an open and inclusive process with NYU, Davis Brody Bond, and our talented consultant team to realize an extraordinary outcome for an engaging mixed use building that contributes mightily to the neighborhood.\u201d   The Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court ruled in favor of NYU and the City of New York in October 2014, upholding NYU\u2019s plans for building on the superblocks and with the facility to be built on the site of the current Coles Sports Center. The petitioners appealed that ruling to the New York State Court of Appeals this month.
