Lawrence Fellowship       Selected Events       Summer Classical Voice Intensive       Featured Students       Read about our current students              The Steinhardt School&rsquo;s program in Vocal Performance offers classical singers the opportunity to study in the finest of performance settings. Our training is designed to prepare young singers for professional careers in recital and concert performance as well as opera. Our goal is that each singer leave our program with a solid foundation of healthy vocal technique combined with the freedom of musical and dramatic expression. Upon this foundation, graduates of this program have built successful careers in the world of opera, music theatre and popular music.    The Classical Voice curriculum requires extensive training in private voice, acting, diction for singers, song repertoire, and movement as well as the core courses for the serious study of music: music theory, aural comprehension, keyboard skills, and music history. Students in Vocal Performance have the opportunity to perform in fully-staged productions under the guidance of professional directors, musical directors, conductors, composers, choreographers, and designers.    Our voice faculty is drawn from New York&rsquo;s top professional singers: a community of working professionals from the worlds of opera, recital and concert singing, and music theatre. In addition to their strong commitment to teaching, our faculty members pursue active professional careers. Their knowledge combined with their active performance experience helps to create a unique learning opportunity for each student.    The Department's acclaimed programs of study in Music Business (B.M., M.A.), Music Technology (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Jazz (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Music Composition (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), and Music Education (B.M., M.A., Ph.D.) provide a rich and valuable array of elective courses for music performance majors that prepare them for an ever-changing music industry and musical climate. Undergraduate and graduate students also benefit from the extraordinary opportunities available through the diverse offerings of a major university in the cultural capital of the world, New York City.
