How does it arise, why      does it take different forms, why does it vary in     degree across societies, what are the components     that add up to gender inequality, how do various     institutions and practices contribute to it, and how      does it change? The course will emphasize the history of gender     inequality in the United States.     While we focus on gender     inequality, we will also    seek to understand social causation more generally. We will explore    the diverse ways social causation works and how we can identify the causes    behind important social phenomena.

Table of Contents                              Description \u2013 Scope, Organization, and Access:      The Scope of the Topics and Materials.      We know a lot about gender inequality \u2013 its history, how people     experience it in their lives, the ways it varies in intensity and form     across time and place, the beliefs that make it seem natural, and much     more. The outpouring of research and commentary on gender     inequality over the past half century has been extraordinary.      Unfortunately, despite all this, our understanding of what causes     gender inequality remains troubled. Both ordinary people and experts     (such as scholars) commonly fluctuate between simplistic explanations     that founder under close scrutiny and throwing up their hands in     frustration over what can seem an enigma beyond human     comprehension. Here we will seek to surmount this dilemma.      We will explore diverse facets of gender inequality and varied ideas     about what causes might be decisive. We will also look carefully     at the ways we can identify and verify the causes of social     phenomena. Through these efforts we will aim both to enhance our     understanding of what produces gender inequality and to improve our     general ability to do causal social analyses effectively.      The class     organization and goals. In this class, each week's work will     be organized around an analytical task, as well as a set of     readings. Rather than focusing on discussion of the readings,     the analytical tasks involve attempting a causal analysis of some     aspect of gender inequality related to the week's issue, building on     the materials we read (in brief papers of a couple pages). The     approach in this class seeks to develop analytical skills as well as     understandings of the relevant literature by stressing doing actual     analyses of gender inequality. (Note: this class does not have an exam     nor a final paper.)      All class meetings are organized as discussions. Part of our     class discussions will be on the common readings and part on students'     efforts to explore the analytical tasks each week. We will     adjust the time devoted to these two goals according to our     experiences over the class. Every week, students will initiate     discussions on readings and papers. To make this work, each week's     papers will be exchanged (electronically) with enough lead time that     we can all read all the papers prior to the class meetings.      Each topic below includes \u2013 beside the common readings \u2013     three other subsections. These are: an analytical task ,     recommended readings , and related readings . The analytical task is the writing     assignment for the week. Everyone should read the common     readings while doing the analytical task (and be prepared to     discuss them). In each of these papers \u2013 always brief      papers \u2013 students will try out causal ideas related to the week's     topic. Recommended and     related readings are optional      materials useful for those who want to dig deeper into a topic.      To simplify navigating through the syllabus, these subsections are     hidden until the viewer clicks on the subsection heading, then they     will appear.      Most of our readings will be articles available for downloading.      The links will appear in the online version of the course     syllabus. Excerpts from Down So Long . . .: The Puzzling     Persistence of Gender Inequality (book manuscript by RMJ not yet     published) will similarly be available for downloading from the class web     site. (As we will read selections from Jackson's book Destined     for Equality [Harvard U Press] throughout the course, you might     want to buy it or borrow it.)      Any student unfamiliar with the study of gender, can (and probably     should) pick up the basics from a standard textbook in the area \u2013 I     recommend Michael Kimmel's Gendered Society (which I use in my     basic general undergraduate class on gender, so used copies should be     easy to find).      For further relevant sources, my reading lists/syllabi for two     graduate courses might be valuable. The one most directly     related is      What Causes Gender Inequality:     Analytical Foundations ; a more general class,           What Causes Inequality: Analytical     Foundations , may provide materials for broader     questions about different kinds of inequalities and how to think about     gender inequality in relationship to them.       A note      on the \"hidden\" material below : Each section of     this guide includes \u2013 beside the common readings \u2013 three     subsections, one for an analytical task , one for recommended     readings , and one for related readings . To     simplify navigating through the course guide, only the headings for     these subsections are initially visible. The contents of all     these subsections are hidden (so that the beginning appearance of the     page is similar to a standard syllabus) until the viewer clicks on a     subsection heading, then its contents will appear. While this     organization is helpful for negotiating the page most of the time, it     can become an obstacle if we want to search the page (for example, for     a particular article) as searches will ignore the hidden material     (that is, if you search a page you are viewing in an internet browser,     the search will only examine what is shown on the page at that time).      To overcome this limitation, you can \"open\" all the hidden sections to     show everything on the page by clicking the \u00a7 symbol at the top of the     page. (To restore the page to the normal condensed view, simply     reload the page which will collapse all the \"hidden\" sections to their     usual look). The table of contents at the top of this page will     aid speedy navigation to any topic, which is particularly helpful if     you reveal all the \"hidden\" material.                              The Topics                I. Introduction. What    do we mean by gender inequality?     To analyze the causes of gender     inequality, we need to know what we mean by gender     inequality. How can we conceive of and talk about     gender inequality in ways that are general enough to apply across the     range of relevant phenomena, consistent enough to minimize conceptual     ambiguities, and precise enough to be analytically effective?      Gender inequality has been extraordinarily diverse and wide     spread. Women and men are unequal in every conceivable way in     endless circumstances, both immediate and enduring, by both objective     criteria and subjective experience. So, what counts as gender     inequality? Can we characterize it in ways that let us confidently and     impartially assess when there is more or less of it?          Analytical     Task                 No task for the introductory meeting.

II. Causality - What are causes,    mechanisms, and the like?     We casually refer to causes and effects in normal   interactions all the time. We all conduct our lives \u2013 choosing actions,   making decisions, trying to influence others \u2013 based on theories about why   and how things happen in the world. From the early stages of childhood   we attribute causes, building a vision of the social (and physical) world   that makes it understandable. Every action, every choice about what to   do, is based on our anticipation of its effects, our understandings of   consequences. Analytical and scientific reasoning has a similar form,   but requires that we approach causation more systematically and   self-consciously.          Analytical     Task                 The general      analytical problem . In this and other societies,      women and men commonly dress differently. Prepare a      causal analysis that seeks to explain why women and men dress      differently .              Our analytical task this week is to attempt a \"simple\"       causal analysis of a gender difference that is obvious but not       often questioned - the way we dress. The purpose of this       exercise is to get us thinking about causality.        To the degree that we can, we want to try to think of       different kinds of causes based on varied ways of framing the       causal question. Realistically, one could easily write a       book about all the possible ways of interpreting this causal       question and answering it. We are just trying to develop       some sensible insights in a couple pages.                   Thinking Tools .       The starting point of most causal analyses is a comparison.       When we start with the general question \"what causes X?\" we turn      it into possible comparisons to produce an answer. Examples      of such questions might be \"why do people in group A do X more      than those in group B?,\" \"why does X occur more often in summer      than winter?,\" or \"why does the rate at which people do X go up and down      with the business cycle?\" The underlying idea is simple but      powerful. If we are trying to explain some phenomenon, X,      then we need to identify variations in the likelihood of X or the      rate of X, and look for potential causes that (1) vary across the      relevant circumstances in a way that could explain X and (2) that      we can connect to the outcomes for X in some way. For      example, with the gender distinctive clothing question, some ways      to better specify the question and look at it through comparisons      are:              What causes individual       conformity to the cultural pattern? What       induces women and men to conform to the expectations for       dressing differently? Whenever we observe a consistent       pattern of social behavior, some common conditions or       processes must be inducing people to act in a similar       way. Figuring out what encourages conformity and       discourages deviance allows us to provide a causal       explanation. Think about what happens to people who do       not conform to the expectations about male and female       appropriate clothing. And, just as important, ask why it       is that people punish nonconformists. Here the basic       comparison is between people who conform and those who do not,       or between the reactions of people to conformity and       nonconformity.        What causes differences       in dress \"codes\" across cultures? What circumstances       could exist across societies that consistently produce gender       differences in modes of dress? The clothing       characteristic of each sex varies greatly across societies       (and time). Clothing differs between \"primitive\"       cultures and modern ones, between warm and cold climates, and       between different parts of the world. But seemingly       everywhere men and women dress differently. How can we       explain this pattern? Here the primary comparison is       between cultures that have different clothing.        Why do the expectations       about clothing differences vary by context ? Why       are gender differences in dress greater in some circumstances       than in others? For example, both women and men may wear       similar coveralls in a factory, but women and men generally       wear dramatically different clothing to formal dances.        Our efforts to find causes behind any phenomena are improved       by looking at variations. If male and female clothing is       just a little different in some contexts but greatly different       in others, we can usefully focus on what might produce this       variance in gender differences. Here the primary       comparison is between contexts with greater differences in the       expected clothing and contexts with lesser differences.                   Thinking Tools 2 .       While considering how to explain the differences in the ways      women and men dress, it can also be helpful to think through       ways that this pattern could be considered an example of a       larger pattern. The explanation for the broader pattern       may be different or easier to develop. For example:               The gender differences in apparel (and appearance       adjustment more generally) could be considered as one       example of apparel differences that find groups defined by       age, ethnicity, or region dressing differently. That       is to say, it is not only women and men who consistently       dress differently. Different ways of dressing also       distinguish other groups. If we think about those       other groups, does it give us insights into explaining the       difference between women's and men's clothing?        The gender differences in dress could be considered as one       example of a wider range of behavioral differences between       women and men such as rules of proper decorum, speech       patterns, or displays of sexuality. That is, we can       point to other presentational differences between women and       men. If we think about the range of these       presentational differences, do they suggest ideas that might       help explain differences in apparel?

How is gender inequality    symbolized and reproduced in everyday life?     To start our investigation of the causes of gender   inequality, we will consider how people experience and act out gender in   their day to day lives. We want to think about the most basic   questions. Why and when do women and men act differently? Why   and when do people respond differently to women than men? How do all   these private individual actions when taken together over time influence the   understanding of gender in a culture and gender inequality?          Analytical     Task                  The general       analytical problem . Using a typical setting       where women and men meet, assess how Ridgeway's framing       approach helps explain the role of gender in these       interactions and where it might fall short.               For this task, we choose some familiar (to us) setting        or type of interaction where women and men typically        engage each other. For example, this could be a        workplace, a bar, interactions between buyers and sellers,        or parties. We use this as our source of empirical        data and focus our argument on explaining gender        interactions there.         First, we need to read Ridgeway's argument        carefully. Then we try to apply her argument to the        setting we have chosen.         We want to assess how much we believe people's actions (in        the context we chose) fit the expectations we can derive        from her argument and when they might not. As we        work on our analyses, we are evaluating Ridgeway's        approach as a tool. The right tool allows us to construct        a better edifice with less effort; the wrong tool does        not.                      Thinking tools .       The remaining notes for this analytical task look at some       analytical steps that allow us to think through this problem       effectively.               Systematic steps in        the analysis . Doing this kind of thought        experiment, we want our thinking to be as systematic as        possible. For all systematic causal analyses, we        want to consider how the phenomenon being examined varies        in regular or predictable ways across conditions,        settings, types of people, places, or the like. Then, we        ask what conditions or events typically precede or occur        along with the outcomes that could plausibly influence        those outcomes.                 For example, first, we simply consider possible         differences between men's and women's actions.          Then we consider how their actions might differ         between opposite-sex and same-sex encounters.          We can broaden the range of the examples we use to         think about these differences by considering other         characteristics that might affect interactions, such         as the age or race of the people, whether the         interaction is cordial or unfriendly, how well the         people know each other, and so on.          We want to ask ourselves if the gender aspect of the         interaction will be influenced by these other         circumstances that seem relevant to interactions. For         example, does gender influence cordial interactions         differently from the ways it influences confrontations         in our setting? If we believe the answer         is yes, then we consider how and why.          Analogously, we want to think about the ways that         people's goals in gendered interactions vary in these         kinds of circumstances, and how these goals influence         their actions. For example, in the same setting,         a person seeking sex will commonly act differently         than someone trying to curry favor or sell a product.                  When we apply a systematic logic to the analysis, we         usually do not want to write about all the         possibilities we think about. Instead, we use         the ones that we find telling. But we will not         identify those telling possibilities unless we         systematically work through all the relevant possible         influences.                         Gender context .        We can take the analysis of interactions another step by        considering how the influence of gender on these        interactions is potentially affected by conditions like:                 the presence or absence of onlookers (i.e., the         relative privacy of the interaction) or          the gender distribution of other people present         (i.e., mostly male, mostly female, or mixed)                         Conformity .         Whenever we try to explain patterns like this, we want to        consider the exceptions. When will people violate        the implications of gender expectations and what follows        when they do? Are there circumstances that make it        more likely people will depart from conventional        behavior? Violations of norms or common expectations        are valuable for causal analyses because cracks in the        veneer of social order can reveal its structure and        dynamics.                      Bring it       together . After working through the steps       above, we try to assess when Ridgeway's approach does a good       job explaining how gender influences behavior in our chosen       setting, and when her approach seems to fall short. Do       we see ways that her approach neglects or misunderstands       important causes influencing the gender character of behavior       in the context we examine? Our central goal here is to       explain how and why gender organizes interactions in our       chosen example. We are not attempting a general evaluation of       Ridgeway's ideas, but a focused assessment of their       effectiveness in the setting we have selected to try them out.

And how does    explaining the \"origins\" of gender inequality relate to explaining the    \"persistence\" of gender inequality?     Although some scholars may question if    women have been subordinate in all societies, all agree that men have been   dominant in most societies although the degree of dominance varies   greatly. This raises the very tricky question, how do we explain the   prevalence of male dominance? This exceedingly elusive question   continues to elude any answer that will evoke a consensus.          Analytical     Task                  Analytical Task       Alternative 1: An analytical critique . As most       of us lack the substantive knowledge needed to develop even       simple analyses of gender inequality's possible origins, we       will explore the causal possibilities by responding to the       arguments of people who are knowledgeable.               Please read the \" Basics of Causal        Descriptions \" on a separate page for some simple,        beginning ideas about describing a causal analysis.         Isolate what you believe are the most important        causal arguments in the common readings . Give        a critical assessment of their different approaches .         In doing this, try to pay attention to what it is that        makes you find the causal arguments more or less        persuasive. The recommended and related readings        provide a range of material that you can look at as you        need to deepen and sharpen your arguments.                       It can be helpful to look back at the material from        Topic II, especially Gerring's list of criteria for causal        arguments.                      Analytical Task       Alternative 2: A hypothetical scenario . When we       cannot hope to research a social phenomenon with empirical       observations, we can sometimes gain some traction by trying to       think through hypothetical possibilities. Here is an       example.               Assume that sometime in the near future we launch a        rocket into space with a crew of 1,000. This crew is        evenly divided between women and men, the women and men        have similar credentials and accomplishments, and the two        sexes are about equally represented at each level of        authority. The crew members' cultural understandings        are similar to those of college students today.         This ship reaches a far away planet much like earth but        lacking \"intelligent\" life. Unfortunately, the        ship's engines have become unstable and the crew must        abandon it. So they must start life on this new        planet. While they possess much advanced knowledge,        they have no technology. They must start from        scratch, producing food, organizing themselves into a        community, pairing off to reproduce, slowly building        toward some kind of technological development over        generations. [Note: If the distant planet scenario        seems unnerving, we could have the same effect by dropping        a 1,000 people on a remote island that is isolated as a        social experiment.]         Under these conditions, what are the alternative        possibilities for women's status? What might decide        which alternative occurs?

What determines men's and    women's roles and positions within families?     Family and kinship are potentially relevant to gender   inequality in varied ways and a lot of work had pursued such issues.    Probably the two most important general issues involve the ways that women   and men are unequal within families and the ways that family organization   both contributes to and is influenced by gender inequality beyond the family   institution. We will just touch the surface of these issues this week.          Analytical     Task                  The general       analytical problem . We want to provide an       integrated analytical overview of the principal causal       arguments about gender inequality and family organization that       appear in the common readings.        Each of the readings has various causal arguments about       family organization, some directly about gender inequality,       some relevant to gender inequality but not directly exploring       it. Some of the causal questions may receive different       causal analyses by these authors. Sometimes two or more       authors may use a similar causal approach to explain different       causal problems. Our goal is to sort this out.        Our overviews should be organized around the causal       arguments, not        a series of summaries of what each author wrote (see Thinking       Tools).        Thinking tools .               We want to use one of the following two possible ways to        organize the causal assessment (unless one of us has a        better way). The first organizes around what is to        be explained, the second around the causes.                 First approach .          We start by identifying the principal causal problems         addressed by the group of papers. That is, we         figure out what they suggest needs to be         explained. Then, we organize these causal         problems in a sensible order (including consideration         of some problems potentially being secondary or         sub-problems of others). Under each causal         problem, we summarize and assess all the relevant         explanations found in the readings.          Second approach .          We start by identifying the principal causal         frameworks used in the papers. That is, we         figure out what they suggest are the conditions or         processes that have the most important influence over         the outcomes. Then, we organize these causal         frameworks in a sensible order, taking into account         which are entirely different and which might be         variations of a similar theme, and which are competing         versus complementary. For each of these, after         summarizing the causal logic of the framework, we show         how it has been used by these authors, describing the         range of outcomes the framework is supposed to         determine and how it has such effects.          Note that         regardless which way we organize our analysis of         competing causal arguments, it can be valuable to         think about not only what is          considered by the authors being examine, but also         which theoretical questions and which causal         frameworks seem relevant but absent.                         Please reread the \" Basics of Causal        Descriptions \" on the starting point for describing a        causal analysis.                      Bringing it       together . In short, our aim is to produce a       critical overview of the principal causal arguments concerning       the family and gender inequality, starting with the ideas       present in the common readings for this week. To do this       effectively, we need to identify all the relevant causal       arguments, deduce the logical structure of each causal       argument and determine how to present that clearly (even if       the original source is inconsistent or ambiguous), detect how       the causal arguments (from different sources) relate to each       other and present them in a way that makes those relations       clear, and, where possible, summarize the important analytical       strengths and weaknesses of each argument (or facet to an       argument).       (We should start with the understanding that this kind of       analytical overview is rather easy to do poorly and very       demanding to do well and thoroughly. At this stage we       are not aspiring to a professional job but hoping to achieve       a reasonable, if basic, analysis.)                             Common Readings           Andrew J.

What is the role of    sexuality?     Sexuality has been evoked in     multiple ways in the study of gender inequality. Some have     considered it as a possible motivating cause for inequality, others have     explored how gender inequality can mold the experience and practice of     sexuality, and others have tried to theoretically incorporate     sexuality as a peculiar tension between women and men that mediates     both the causes and effects of gender inequality. Essentially,     everyone recognizes sexuality is critically important to gender     inequality, but we lack agreement or clarity on how it matters.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical      problem . Our central task this week is to propose a      causal account that plausibly explains the relationship between one      aspect of sexuality and gender inequality.              Everyone who analyzes gender inequality considers sexuality       important, but they have highly varied ideas about what       matters and why. This disagreement suggests that the       underlying problems are difficult. We cannot       hope to solve them in this brief effort. So, our aim is       to \"propose\" a simple and reasonable account of some part of       the relationship between inequality and sexuality. We are        not trying to develop a full, professional analysis.        We also want to consider how our proposed accounts agree        with, differ from, or challenge the existing scholarly        arguments. Again, our goal here is limited. The        aim is to give a reasonable first sense of how the proposed        account fits (or does not fit).                   Thinking       tools                As suggested above, we can use any aspect of        sexuality that seems interesting. However, it may        help if the selected facet of sexuality:                 has a relationship to gender inequality that at         least some writers think is important. Which way         it is important is wide open. The role of the         chosen sexuality characteristic relative to gender         inequality may be cause, effect, catalyst, or whatever         else seems causally relevant.          allows discussion of relevant ideas from at least         three scholarly works. These may be part of the         common readings, any of the other readings recommended         here, or another legitimate source. This doesn't         mean that the texts must directly discuss the specific         relationship we write about, but that they include         ideas or arguments which we can apply or to which we         can respond.                         A basic approach to the task presentation might have the        following three parts:                 First, we lay out the causal, explanatory         problem. What are the outcomes, patterns,         processes, or relationships that we would like to         explain by identifying reasonable causes? And         why is this important enough to merit attention? (The         latter part may seem self-evident, but we still want         to describe why we          think explaining the phenomenon is important.)          Second, we provide the causal analysis. We         want to be as complete as possible within reasonable         space limits. And, we want to be clear, simple,         and direct.          Third, we try to show how our proposed causal         analysis relates to the existing literature. For         our purposes, we can limit ourselves to considering a         couple theories or perspectives that would support or         compliment our approach and a couple that would be         likely to question our proposed causal analysis.          (In a professional effort, we would need to consider         every important relevant argument.) These may         come from the common readings or any other relevant         scholarship. When discussing those who might         disagree, we want to be as specific as possible about         what criticism we would expect from each of these         \"opponents\" and how we might respond.                                      Bringing it       together . In short, our aim is to construct a       basic causal argument seeking to understand how some aspect of       sexuality is related to gender inequality, and to assess how       that causal argument relates to the existing literature (as       represented in our readings).

Attempts to explain gender inequality at all levels are   haunted by essentialism . Essentialist arguments impute   distinctive attributes to women and men and attribute the social differences   between women's and men's activities, opportunities, statuses, and roles to   these distinct attributes. Even theoretical analyses of gender   inequality that expressly reject the possibility of consequential, inherent   sex differences, commonly build their explanations of inequality on   gender differences. To complicate matters, essentialist arguments   proclaiming superior attributes for women exist alongside of the arguments   proclaiming women inferior. Moreover, while for some, essentialism   always means a difference based in biology or genetics, for others it   includes cultural differences that are embodied in women and men.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical problem .      To investigate how essentialist arguments work, we will      examine how different kinds of essentialist arguments might be      applied to explain some aspect of gender inequality, in contrast      to a non-essentialist argument. We aim to see both the      attraction of essentialist arguments and the possibilities for      alternatives.             Select one form or facet of gender inequality that you will       try to explain for this task. This instance or aspect of       gender inequality should be sufficiently important,       widespread, and enduring or recurring to merit thoughtful       theory and explanation. It should also be narrow or       specific enough that the goal of explaining it is       plausible. For example, the facet might be that wives       commonly defer to husbands.        For the selected type or aspect of gender inequality, you       will suggest five alternative explanations, each one       representing a different approach to explaining such social       phenomena. The explanations should be succinct but       clear. They should also be plausible to the extent that       a reasonable person might make such an argument. Plausible       does not mean true, of course. Rather, we are trying to       imagine an argument that would seem plausible to people who       are advocates for each of the perspectives.                   The five types of explanation .       Attempt to devise the best explanations you can for the relevant      facet of inequality from each of the following      perspectives. Explanations may be categorized in many      ways. The five perspectives defined here are meant to engage      different responses to the problem of essentialism.              Direct biological - Devise an explanation claiming       that some biological difference between the sexes produces the       relevant aspect of inequality by making women and men act       differently. For example, an argument might be that men       are stronger than women so men dominate women as a simple       result of superior strength. (More complex biological       explanations might be derived from evolutionary       psychology.) This type of explanation is usually purely       essentialist. Note that this type of explanation can be       divided further into those relying on real biological       differences and those imputing fictional biological       differences. Let us stress biological differences that       are at least potentially real here, leaving the fictitious       ones for below.        Indirect biological - Formulate an explanation       claiming some biological difference does not directly       produce the inequality, but the biological difference has       important effects or implications of some sort, and those       effects that make likely or unavoidable the emergence or       persistence of the selected aspect of gender inequality.        For example, someone might argue that women's child bearing       makes them anxious about the welfare of their children, and       that anxiety makes them feel weak and in want of a protector,       leading them to defer to husbands. Or, others might       suggest that women's biologically induced child rearing       orientation encourages both women and men to make men       responsible for warfare, and that men's resulting skill at       combat, their possession of weapons, and men's organization       around mutual defense leaves wives typically in their       husbands' control. The key for this type of explanation       is that the relevant biological differences do not directly       cause the gender inequality being explained, but have effects       on social behavior and social organization that lead to gender       inequality. These types of explanations have       essentialist origins in a biological difference, but the       explanation as a whole may invoke mediating causal influences       that reduce the essentialist quality, sometimes greatly.        Non-biological sex difference - Suggest how       some socially constructed difference between women and men \u2013       one that is neither biological nor a direct result of       biological differences \u2013 initiates or preserves the aspect of       gender inequality being explained. This will usually be       an enduring individual characteristic (a difference that       people carry with them, not a difference in their       circumstances). For example, one might claim that women       are fearful and dependent because of socialization processes       (that have no biological basis), and this psychological       condition induces wives to defer to their husbands. Or,       one might argue that childhood sports available only to boys       result in a higher competitive drive that accounts for adult       men's greater success in business. This type of       explanation claims a real difference exists between women and       men (in the society or social context where the inequality       being explained occurs; the relevant sex difference need not       exist in all or any other society or social context), but this       difference is a social construction. This type of       explanation often becomes redundantly circular: each aspect of       inequality exists as a result of inequality, and that overall       inequality is constituted by the various aspects.        Fictitious sex difference - An imputed sex       difference that does not really exist is claimed to play a       significant role in producing the selected facet of gender       inequality. For example, someone might suggest that       although women have no better capacity for child rearing,       people commonly assume they do because women bear children,       and that this false expectation produces a division of labor       and power favoring men. This type of explanation focuses       on the consequences of beliefs, relying on the observation       that beliefs can organize behavior even if they are false       beliefs. While such fictitious differences are commonly       assumed to be biological, they need not be.        Causes independent of sex differentiation - A       causal process that does not involve any difference between       the sexes is argued to produce the inequality being       considered. For example, some might argue that for       families to fulfill their social functions effectively, they       need one spouse/parent to perform the critical emotional       actions needed and the other spouse/parent to perform the       practical and leadership actions (this is essentially a       well-know idea of Talcott Parsons). This role       differentiation can then result in spouse inequality, as an       indirect and unintended consequence. This category       includes highly diverse explanations, the one critical       similarity among them being that they do not rely on a sex       difference in their central causal argument. It may be       worth noting that one reason explanations based on sex       differences (including all the preceding perspectives) are       more common is that formulating a plausible analysis that       forgoes the mechanism of sex differences is often a hard task.                         (Note, in this task we are aiming to produce explanations that      those advocating each of the above types of explanation would      think are reasonable. It is often hardest to conceive good      explanations from the points of view we find unconvincing or      unappealing, but the capacity to do this is a valuable skill.)       Bringing it together .       The point of this exercise is to examine how it is possible to      devise a range of alternative causal explanations of gender      inequality stressing some mechanism of sex differences, while      developing alternative theories that do not rely on sex      differences is rather hard. The difference arguments run the      full range from being directly and fully biological to relying on      non-biological or fictitious differences in indirect ways.       The arguments that exclude not only biology but all dependence on      sex differences commonly derive from another theoretical approach,      such as functionalism or conflict theories. The challenge      with these approaches is not only to make the immediate causal      process eschew differences, but to avoid relying on sex      differences one or two steps earlier in the causal chain.

What is the role of     violence and intimidation in the relationships between men and     women?     Most theoretical approaches to gender inequality   suggest that violence between women and men plays a role in sustaining   inequality; some also point toward violence as an initial    cause. A recurring issue concerns the degree to which violence is an   expression or result of gender inequality or, alternatively, is a cause of   inequality. The separate roles of rape, harassment, and domestic   violence, and their relationships to each other are another critical   question. Much research and argument has also been focused on the   question of women's aggressive impulses and actions.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task 1:      Explain why women do not engage in sexual harassment or sexual      violence at anything like the rates that men do? Our      strategy is to reverse the usual way people approach the problem      of gender violence.              When people refer to the patterns of violence between women       and men (in modern societies), they are usually referring to       several distinctive patterns including sexual violence       (particularly rape), sexual harassment, and intimate partner       violence (which includes wife battering). These       categories implicitly distinguish patterns of aggression based       on several criteria: the degree to which the aggressive acts       involve sexuality, the severity of the aggressive acts, and       the relationship between the man and woman. These       aggressive actions in these categories are all related to       gender inequality both in that inequality engenders them and       that they reinforce gender inequality. They are       particularly linked in their contributions to women\u2019s fear and       sense of physical vulnerability. And that fear is       crucial. For it is the prospect of possible violence       that induces women to restrict their behavior, to seek male       protectors, and to heed men\u2019s wishes.        Here, to simplify our task, we will set aside the question       of intimate partner violence.        To begin, you might consider what determines the actions of       women that do or do not lead to violence and how those       immediate determinants differ from the determinants for       men. Men vary greatly, so you must decide if you will       abstract away all that variation (to talk of \"men\" in the most       generic or abstract possible manner) or if you feel that some       variations (e.g. wealth or age) require consideration.        Remember that you can restrict the scope of your analysis.               Potential determinants include beliefs, resources,        opportunities, the anticipated consequences of alternative        actions         Another way to look at it is the old detective's script:        motives, means, opportunity         It is commonly useful to start your reasoning        concretely, using what you know best. Think about        the kinds of people you know best, either through personal        experience or from studying them. Try to explain        concretely why the women do not engage in sexual        harassment or sexual violence more. This gives you a        starting point.               Expect to develop your argument backwards from the concrete       beginnings. This means that after you assemble your       first round explanation of what directly influences women's       actions, you take those explanatory conditions as the problem       to explain in the second. For example, if you used       women's beliefs about violence as an immediate cause of their       restrained violence, then you next need to consider why they       have different beliefs from men. You want to produce at       least two levels of the causal analysis, and see if you can do       three.        Please take the time to look over the lists of Recommended       and Related Readings. You are likely to find some work       there what will shorten the time needed to complete this task.                              Analytical Task 2 : Try      to develop a clear causal analysis of the role played in      gender inequality by a fear of violence.                    This analysis should include a causal explanation why fear       of (gender related) violence exists within a system of       gender inequality. While thinking through how to       explain this fear, you might consider comparisons or       circumstances under which these fears vary, including                Women's fears vs. men's fears         The circumstances under which women experience greater        fear and those where they feel safe         Differences in the amount of fear typical amongst        groups or categories of women according to their age,        affluence, location, companions, or any other relevant        social condition         Differences in the distribution of fear across        societies distinguished by such conditions as forms of        economic and political organization, degree of        development, prevailing religious or cultural        institutions and the like                       This analysis should also include a causal explanation of       the consequences for gender inequality of the distribution       of fears of violence. In what ways do fears of       violence influence the behavior of women or the       relationships between women and men? Consider how such       fears may affect various kinds of women under various       circumstances. But remember to return to aggregate       effects \u2013 it is the impact of these fears on the pattern of       women's experiences and behavior that affects gender       inequality writ large.        Avoid the analytic temptation to argue as if equality       might imply an absence of discord and aggression.        Realistically, equality between two groups by itself only       leads us to expect that acts of aggression will occur with       equal frequency and effect between members of the two       groups. Removing inequality as a source of discord       should reduce one kind of frustrations that motivate       aggression. Other sources of discord still exist,       however, and some forms of aggression that would be       suppressed by inequality might even rise.        Try to introduce appropriate connections between the       argument(s) you present and the readings. Consider not       only the common readings from this week, but also past       readings and optional ones from this week that seem       particularly relevant.        The causal arguments should try to conform to the       standards for a good causal argument that we have read about       and discussed. Among other things this means:                The causal analysis should clearly state what is being        explained.         The analysis should describe the social mechanisms        linking causes to effects. It should show what        happens in the world that produces the outcomes, what        kinds of people or organizations behave in manner, what        circumstances arise that induce the relevant behavior,        and so forth. This may be abstract at the level of        the causal model.         The analysis should consider why the decisive        causes exist and take the form that they do. That        is, the causal analysis should push back at least one        step past the causes being invoked to ask what causes        them.         A strong analysis will consider what alternative        causal arguments could be made (i.e., how the causal        processes could be different from what you describe) and        show what evidence or logic favors the argument you have        presented. A thorough causal analysis will        recognize that other causal models might be considered        plausable, and try to compare the causal model being        promoted to the alternatives.         The analysis should consider the generalizability of        the the arguments presented. It should consider to        what periods, places, types of societies, parts of        society, kinds of social relationships or interactions        do the arguments apply?         Most will find it difficult to do all of the above        effectively, so consider it suggestions about what would        be ideal, then apply your judgment about allocating your        time and effort.

How has the economy    influenced men's and women's positions in society?     Analyses of gender inequality attribute great   importance to the economy. Gender inequality appears everywhere   embedded in economic inequality, in the sense that a critical aspect of   gender inequality involves unequal access to economic resources and   positions. This relationship becomes clearer in more \"advanced\"   societies where economic organization has become institutionally   differentiated from kinship and political organization. Sometimes this   unequal economic access is understood as an expression of gender inequality,   sometimes a cause of gender inequality, sometimes a result. Many analyses   consider it all three.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task       1: Develop a causal analysis of economic inequality between      women and men that accounts for two empirical observations, one      being the earnings inequality between the sexes by the gender      composition of major occupational categories, the other being the      changing likelihood that wives will earn more than their husbands.              The data to be explained can be found in three tables (click to see) .        Use the tabs at the bottom to switch between tables.               The first table shows the 2012 earnings gap in the 20        occupational categories that have the largest number of        females. These have been sorted by the proportion        female. The numbers in dark red show the earnings        gap where women also account for two-thirds or more of the        those in the occupational category.         The second table shows the same kind of data as the        first, but is for the 20 occupational categories that have        the largest number of males. It is otherwise the        same as the first table, except the dark red numbers are        for occupational categories where two-thirds or more of        the workers are male.         The third table shows the changing proportion of married        couples where the wife earns more than the husband over        the 25 years up to 2011.                      Preliminary to developing an analysis, the first task is,       of course, to interpret what the data in the tables tell us       about economic inequality between women and men. It is       recommended that you focus on the dark red numbers of all the       tables. The first two tables are meant to be interpreted       as one.        The main task is to develop a background analysis of gender       inequality in the economy, as it exists today and how it has       changed over the past several decades. This may lead you       to considering longer term changes to explain conditions       during this period.        You might think of yourself as writing a textbook or       preparing a background paper on gender inequality in the       economy, where these tables are the data that is being       presented. Your goal is to offer an understanding of       these tables.        One way to think about this is in terms of what we don't see       in the tables.               Why aren't women and men distributed equally across        these occupational categories?         Why are women's earnings lower?         Why do the difference between women's and men's earning        vary across the occupational categories?         Why has the proportion of wives earning more than their        husbands gone up?         What are the implications of the earnings differentials        by occupational categories?         What are the implications of the data on wives'        earnings?         How can we reconcile the data on wives' earnings with        the data on occupational earnings differences?                      In short, we are aiming at a brief explanation of women's       vs. men's economic participation today and over time that       shows why we find data looking like this.                   Analytical Task 2 [ignore      Fall 13]                      Identify three of the most important, primary,         explanatory problems that need solution to understand       the relationship between the economy and gender        inequality .                 Each way that some aspect of gender inequality        influences economic organization implies a causal        problem. Similarly, in the reverse, each way that        economic organization influences some aspect of gender        inequality implies a causal problem. For example,        women used to have no access to most high-status        positions in the American economy and are now still        under represented in them. In either direction we        might consider the intensity or degree of gender        inequality, rather than some aspect of gender        inequality, as that which influences or is influenced by        economic organization. For each observation or        claim about economic inequality between women and men,        we can ask \"why?\" or \"how?\" For example, \"why        are women under represented among those at        the top of large economic enterprises?\" or \"how does        women's relative absence from positions great economic        power influence the persistence of gender inequality?\"         Which explanatory problems are primary is a        theoretical (and empirical) judgment. A         primary causal process is one without which the         relationship between the economy and gender inequality         would look and work differently . Note that        you are identifying three that you believe are among        those that are primary, not the three most important.                        For each of the three selected, primary,       explanatory problems, do the following: State clearly what        is the explanatory problem and why it is a        primary or important one . Think carefully about       what makes some causal processes more important than others       when we are trying to understand a social phenomenon (her       the relationship between gender inequality and economic       organization).        Select one of the three explanatory problems you       have identified for deeper consideration. For that       problem:                Briefly describe what stand out as the         possible causal processes that could account for        the relationship or condition that is the focus of the        explanatory problem. For example, what might        be the causal processes that account for few women        being in positions of high economic power? These        are the competing or alternative explanations for the        problem. These may include the causes or        explanations explicitly suggested in the literature        concerning the problem, or explanations derived from        applying a more general theoretical orientation (e.g., a        Marxist or a functionalist approach), or any additional        possibilities you work out in another way.          Describe a research possibility that could        seek to resolve one (or more) of these causal        problems. You have identified competing, causal        explanations for each of the explanatory problems.         For one of these, consider how we might hope to learn        which causal explanation is more valid by doing relevant        research. To do this, we usually want to think        about the circumstances under which the competing        theories suggest that something in the world should look        or work differently.                       To summarize, the analytical task involves (1) identifying       three primary, explanatory problems relating gender       inequality and economic organization, providing a careful       description for each of those explanatory problems, stating       why it is important, (2) for one explanatory problem,       exploring competing explanations that could solve the       problem, and describing a research design that could,       hypothetically, discover which explanation is better.

X. What role does ideology play in    determining the relations between men and women?     Ideology is near the center of almost all   efforts to explain gender inequalities. People's conceptions of   masculinity and femininity, ideas concerning the fairness of differential   treatment or expectations of women and men, internalized schema that   evoke different judgments of women's and men's actions, rules about proper   male and female behavior applied to children \u2013 all these and more concern the   influence of ideology on gender identities, differential treatment of women   and men, and the organization and persistence of gender inequality.    Conversely, each ideological belief that symbolizes, legitimates, invokes,   guides, induces, or helps sustain gender inequality is itself a product of   gender inequality. To untangle these complex causal interdependencies,   we must always attend carefully to two kinds of distinctions. First,   we must consistently recognize differences in levels of social organization,   including, among others, societal structures and culture, organizations,   social networks, social processes, and individual actors. While it is   tempting to treat ideological beliefs as diffuse entities unconnected to   identifiable people, organizations, or structures, the analytical results   are poor. Second, we must consistently distinguish between   contemporaneous causes (e.g., the ways that internalized schema can   influence interactions) and asynchronous or historical causes (e.g., the   ways that changes in domestic production induce different ideas about   women's place). Causal arguments about ideology consider it as both an   effect of gender inequality and a cause of gender inequality, although it is   ideology's potential role as a contributing cause that stands out as more   theoretically important.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical problem .      For this week's task, we want to pose an initial analysis of the      relationship between ideology and some aspect of gender      inequality. We want to consider the joint direction of      causal influence for the selected context, how the dynamics of      inequality influences the ideas and how the presence of ideas      influences the understandings and actions of all the relevant      actors.             The aim of       this week's task is to explore the relationship between       beliefs \u2013 ideology \u2013 and some example of inequality. The       goal is to work through the various ways that ideas and       expectations are involved in the causal processes surrounding       gender inequality using the chosen example to do this at a       more concrete level. The purpose of the task       specification that follows is to help you to be systematic       about this.        To begin ,       choose one aspect or component of gender inequality.        This may involve the direct relationships between women and       men or a difference in the opportunities or status available       to women. Examples might be the way that women overall       select less prestigious fields of study than men in college,       that higher education used to be restricted for women, that       women are objects of sex trafficking, that male professional       sports have much higher status, or the different kinds of       restaurants that use male vs. female waiters. You might       try to be a bit creative. It can be helpful to focus your       discussion using a concrete instance of that type of       inequality with which you are familiar.                   Contents of the analysis .       Use this schematic outline as a starting point.             1        Clarify what aspect or component of gender inequality is your       focus.               As always, remember to give the basic characteristics        and principal patterns of the inequality as you understand        it. Among other possibilities, this will normally        include: (1) describe what is unequal; (2) describe what        this inequality looks like, how it is experienced, or how        it has its impact in social life; (3) assess how the        distribution appears or is manifest in the world, how we        would recognize the differences between more or less of        it, and how it is currently distributed).         The goal is to ensure the reader (and you) clearly        understand what inequality is relevant, and what examples        of that inequality you will address.                      2        Describe the principal ideological beliefs or ideas that seem       relevant to the inequality being examined.               While identifying the relevant beliefs is obviously        crucial, it can also be difficult. The range of        potentially relevant beliefs may be very large, so we have        to exercise judgment about which are most important         It may help to distinguish beliefs that motivate         the practice of this aspect of gender inequality from         those that legitimate it.         It is crucial to consider the actions and ideas of both men and women .         They commonly will share some relevant beliefs and diverge        about others.         Consider also whether different beliefs motivate or        legitimate this type of inequality in different times,        places, or circumstances. That is, you want to        decide what characteristics of the beliefs connected to        this inequality are fairly consistent across various        concrete instances of this type of inequality and what        sort of beliefs differ across instances. For        example, the beliefs that motivated male resistance to        women entering \"male\" occupations may have varied by the        status of the occupation and by the time period women        began to enter.         Consider the degree of consensus (or dispute) over the        important beliefs. When is the consensus high or        low, what causes it to be high or low, and what difference        does the degree of agreement make? In particular, do        people dispute some aspects of the beliefs relevant to        this type of inequality, such that the dispute affects the        inequality or informs us about it? Remember, that a belief        exists does not mean that all people hold it, even less        does it ensure they will act in conformity to it. The        greater the disagreement about a belief within a group or         category of actors, the less that it can contribute to         consistent responses it decides actions (although this         may not diminish its appeal as a justification).         Beliefs have a variety of other variable characteristics         that can be important to analyzing their significance.         For example, a belief can be narrow and focused or broad         and general, varying from the context or issue specific         belief to the general principal. A belief can be so         salient and closely held that people refer to it all the         time or so insignificant and loosely held that it plays a         role only when forced to the forefront.                      3        Assess the effects of these beliefs.               Consider the social significance or function of beliefs.         The effects of beliefs are generally understood by        comparing them to real or hypothetical alternatives.         Although beliefs exist only by being held by individuals,         we generally want to think of beliefs as cultural         phenomena. The beliefs that concern us are those preserved         and imposed by cultures or acquired as the common effect of         shared or parallel experiences. People are prone to all         kinds of idiosyncratic beliefs, but only shared beliefs         have social effect.         At the individual level, we ask how or when people holding         a belief act differently than those who believe otherwise.         At the social level, we ask how the presence of those         beliefs in a group or circumstance has social consequences         -- such as influencing the structure of organizations, the         prevailing legal system, or direction of historical         changes.         What we identify as important effects will therefore        depend on the selection of those alternative beliefs.         Reasonable alternatives might include: beliefs observed to        exist in more egalitarian (or more unequal) circumstances,        reversal of beliefs about women and men (often implausible        in reality, but potentially clarifying as an imaginary        experiment), the absence of any such beliefs, or the        presence of some reasonable hypothetical alternative         beliefs.         As usual, we want to give some thought to both women and        men, and we want to consider how the effects of the        beliefs might vary depending on the context or other        mediating influences. Typically, we expect to find women         and men share many beliefs, but are sharply divided on        others.         Beliefs can affect judgments, motives, aspirations,        quality of experience, and so forth. Again, deciding        what is important is an analytical judgment. We are trying        to figure out what beliefs really make a difference to the        strength, durability, or form of gender inequality.                      4        Try to explain how the relevant beliefs come to exist and why       they persist.               Thus, for the example of inequality being examined, we         are trying to explain how beliefs or ideas might         arise as a result of the presence of the inequality         that they legitimate and motivate. This is our         central goal, and it is difficult.         It can help to do a hypothetical experiment.         Consider an imaginary circumstance (which might have a        real historical counterpart) where the relevant aspect of        gender inequality did not exist, nor did the related        beliefs \u2013 then at some point in time this type of gender        inequality came into existence. Then try to think        through how ideas would change as a result of the        emergence of this facet of gender inequality.         Consider what issues might arise if this type of        inequality came to exist, but the beliefs still did not,        and how might the response to such issues lead to new        beliefs. Think about both women and men trying to make        sense of the unequal circumstances, and trying to mold the        perception of reality and justice to fit their        circumstances.         To make the analysis more concrete, see if you can        provide evidence or observations about real circumstances        where this type of inequality is minimal (different        cultures, different historical periods, different parts of        society). Assess how the beliefs under minimal        inequality compare to those where it is high.         It is a good idea to consider under what conditions, if        any, would the beliefs associated with a facet of gender         inequality exist without the presence of this facet of        gender inequality. That is, could similar or analogous        beliefs appear with different kinds of inequality or under        conditions of little inequality. The first        possibility is critical, because it suggests beliefs due        to the presence of inequality per se, not dependent on the        type of inequality. The second possibility suggests        the prospect of beliefs hijacked from conditions distinct        from inequality, then converted to some service to        reinforce or challenge inequality.         It is also a good idea to consider how people acquire        the relevant beliefs? Are they part of general        cultural expectations, are the transferred in specific        contexts, or do people generate them from experience        rather than learning them from others?         Finally, ask what happens if some people question or        reject the beliefs? This question applies to both women        and men. The mechanisms to ensure acceptance and        conformity are crucial to the preservation and        effectiveness of beliefs.                      5        Finally, after completing the steps in the analysis above, try       to give an overall assessment about the significance of       ideology to the facet of gender inequality you are       considering.                   Additional Notes              Throughout, be careful to distinguish between empirical        claims and moral claims. Both kinds of beliefs       are important. And they may be confused or overlapping       rather than neatly distinguished in real life. Still,       they are crucially different. Similarly, distinguish       between the explanation of beliefs and the justification        of beliefs.

Both the popular press and scholarship have devoted a lot   of effort seeking to make sense of people's beliefs about feminism and   equality, but these efforts have done little to reduce the disagreements.          Analytical     Task                 The goal of this task is to explore what young people think      about feminism today and to attempt to explain these beliefs.       As a prelude, you should interview some female and some male      acquaintances about feminism.             Use your own judgment about who to interview and how       many. You are trying to get enough \"data\" to serve as       the basis for your analysis.        Also use your own judgment about how to conduct your       interviews and what to ask. However, at a minimum try to       include: 1) how they would define feminism, 2) what kinds of       the people they know do they consider feminist, 3) what they       think is true about gender inequality/equality today, 4)       whether or not they consider themselves feminist and why, 5)       whether or not they consider themselves committed to gender       equality.                   Based on these interviews and your pre-existing observations,      write a descriptive assessment of young, educated American's      orientation toward feminism.       Prepare a provisional causal analysis of these current attitudes      toward feminism and gender equality in your reference population.      Try to do a reasoned analysis, taking into account the readings      for this topic.       Causal analyses always hinge on the choice of comparison.       Among others, you might consider: 1) the differences between now      and the past, 2) the differences between women and men, 3) the      differences between those who identify as feminist and those who      do not, 3) the difference between people like you and people      unlike you                     Common Readings            Destined for Equality : Women's      Rejection of Subordination      Nancy Burns and Katherine Gallagher. \" Public      Opinion on Gender Issues: The Politics of Equity and Roles .\"     Annual Review of Political Science, 2010, Vol. 13: 425-443       [doi: 10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.040507.142213]      Jo Freeman. \" Political      Organization in the Feminist Movement .\" Acta Sociologica ,     Vol. 18, No. 2/3 (1975), pp. 222-244      Susan E.

How have political    processes and structures sustained men's and women's relative status?     As structure and as actor, the state has been   unavoidably central to ongoing practice of gender inequality, to its   persistence, and to changes in the form and amount of gender inequality.     States or governments have power. Through the   military and police, a state can enforce conformity to its rules, repel and   punish challenges from the scale of individual acts to collective   rebellions, and by threat, implicit or explicit, deter rebellions from   appearing. Through the law, regulations, and bureaucratic policies, a state   can define what constitutes acceptable or legitimate behavior at all levels   of social organization. Through economic policies of taxation, expenditures,   and redistributions (such as welfare policies or agricultural supports), a   state influences the relative economic status of different groups.     By acting differently toward groups with   regard to any of these aspects of government power, a state can create,   reinforce, or exacerbate social inequalities. Analogously, a state can, in   theory, obstruct, destabilize, or diminish social inequality by using its   power in ways that are inconsistent with social inequalities. States   determine, influence, legitimize, and sanction rights and opportunities;   they may do so in more or less egalitarian ways.     When significant, enduring, social inequality   exists, those privileged by that form of inequality will normally have more   influence over the state than do those disadvantaged by the inequality, and   the overall effect of state policies will reinforce the exercise and   persistence of the inequality. A fundamental problem for all state theories   is who or what decides state policies and actions. To some degree, those   \"in\" the state (elected, appointed, hired, or appropriated) make decisions   based on their interests and outlooks as members of the state apparatus. To   some degree, state actors respond to the influence of power brokers outside   the state, such as the economically powerful. In either case, when making   policy or strategic planning decisions, those influencing state actions are   in part responding to what they perceive will be the responses of all actors   in the nation affected by those decisions. States, or the political   actors who comprise the government, also have their own interests, most   notably preserving their power, and these interests are not automatically   consistent with the interests of dominant social groups.     These political processes may support and   enforce gender inequality, passively permit it, or oppose gender inequality   (as is true with any form of social inequality). They may do any combination   of these with respect to different aspects of gender inequality.    Sustaining influence over political processes is a fundamental feature and   goal of socially dominant groups and the long monopoly of men over political   power has both demonstrated and sustained gender inequality. Yet,   government actions have also contributed to the decline of gender inquality   over the past two centuries.          Analytical     Task                 You have been hired by the newly elected President of the United      States (or the analogous top political position in another country      that you prefer to examine). One of the new President\u2019s main      goals for her years in office is to use government power to      improve gender inequality and the status of women. Your job      is to recommend toward what specific goals she should focus her      efforts.       You may recommend new legislation (or the removal of old), new      administrative strategies such as who gets appointed, new      executive policies (for example, rules for the military) that are      within the President\u2019s power without legislation, concerted      efforts to influence public opinion or state level      governance. In short, you can consider the entire range of      actions available to a President.       You should propose at least three distinct initiatives that you      believe could serve this purpose.       Chose the strategy you believe holds the most promise. For      this strategy, you must provide an analytical justification. Your      justification should consider the following:             At what aspects of gender inequality is the policy       aimed?        Include a brief analysis of this inequality that explains       what is unequal, how great is the inequality, who does it       effect, how widely is it recognized, how it has (or has not)       changed over time, and what seem to be the principal causes.        Describe how have government actions (or inaction)       influenced this inequality in the past.        Show why we should expect that it will be easy or hard to       carry out the strategy and how the possible difficulties       reflect the influence or effects of gender inequality.        Explain how the proposed strategy can be expected to       alleviate gender inequality. This explanation should       connect directly to the causal explanation of the inequality       being diminished.                   In short, you should propose several strategies by which a      government could promote greater gender equality, then provide an      analytic appraisal of the strategy you deem best. This      appraisal should stress the causes of relevant facets of gender      inequality, how the proposed strategy will affect that causal      process, and how gender inequality has a causal influence on      government policy that must be countered to implement the      policy. Do not forget to provide a historical context.

XIII. What does the future hold?     Where do we go from here? Predicting the future is the     ultimate challenge for causal analyses. To have any potential to     see into the future, we need a sound and thorough causal theory, one     that can encompass the range of possible influences     simultaneously. We also need to cope with the unpredictable     potential effects of processes and events that are outside the     boundaries of our theories. These are extremely difficult     conditions to meet. But the need to make some sense of the     future weighs on us. Will gender inquality continue to decline,     and greater gender equality spread throughout the world? Are     some aspects of gender inquality particularly resistant to reduction,     and if so why? Could change stagnate? Behind such concerns     are two principal questions. What has caused the long-term     pattern of declining gender inequality? And what has preserved     aspects of gender inequality in the face of these accumulating     changes? Combining the answers to these two questions with an     effort to project the relevant influences into the future, is the     basis for trying to understand the possibilities for the future.      Behind this also lies another analytical question with moral     overtones: what does gender equality really mean?                    Analytical       Task 1                    Select two types of inequality, both       important, one that you believe to be moving toward greater       equality at a relatively high rate, the other that you       believe is moving toward equality at a relatively slow rate       (or is stalled or is moving backwards)               for each of these two types, describe what is the        inequality (how are women and men unequal, which women        and men experience it, how do things differ when this        inequality is high from when it is low)         describe the evidence and logic that suggests one        type is declining relatively quickly and the other        relatively slowly                      Try to explain why the two different rates of movement       toward equality               For each, consider what processes, conditions,        interests, and the like propel the movement toward        greater equality         For each, consider what circumstances, activities,        and the like obstruct the movement toward greater        equality         Try to explain how and why the balance between the        causes propelling greater equality and the causes        sustaining existing inequality differ between the two        types of gender inequality                                                 Analytical       Task 2                    The general       analytical problem . Using two       plausible future scenarios about gender inequality, assess       what processes or conditions will decide which future       alternative comes to pass.        The task has the following main parts               Select two         of three alternatives to use for the analysis: highest        conceivable level of equality, highest possibility of in equality,        most likely conditions. Essentially this means        that we compare the two extreme possibilities, or we        compare what we think most likely with one of the        extreme possibilities.         For each of the two        selected alternatives, give a clear description of what        the expected level of gender inequality means.         How severe will be major components of gender        inequality, how consistent will different aspects of        gender inequality be with each other, how consistent        will these patterns be in society, and so on. (It        might help to look back over the range of topics        covered above.)         The center of the        analysis will be to provide a causal argument about        what causal conditions and sequence of developments         could lead to each of the two alternatives.         To this end, we must consider the full        range of causal influences that we have examined        previously.                      Thinking tools .               To consider any future path, we must make assumptions        about: (1) how far into the future, (2) in what society        and with respect to what social groups, and (3) what        other changes might occur, altering the cultural,        political, and economic environment.                  For our purposes, let us set the future to be         about one and two generations, that is when your         children are your current age, and then when their         children reach a similar age. The key         tradeoff with setting the distance into the future         is simple: the further we go into the future the         more interesting and significant are the social         changes but equally the more obscure become the         realistic possibilities.          Let us focus on our own society as a whole,         referencing distinctive social categories as         needed.          Similarly, let us assume that the cultural,         political, and economic environments are reasonably         stable, with the expectation that existing long         term trends will continue into the future. We         will ignore the potential for significant         structural changes and historical \"shocks\" such as         economic recessions and wars. Of course, the         further we look into the future, the more         speculative and fallible such assumptions become,         but our purpose is not to predict the actual         future.                         Looking forward, the future is always uncertain,        however well we may explain it once it becomes the        past. One way to make the future more amenable to        analysis is to simplify it into what we believe are the        principal alternative futures that matter to us.         Probably the simplest technique it to focus on one        characteristic and consider the most extreme plausible        possibilities.         With this in mind, let us try to analyze the future        of gender inequality by contrasting stark        alternatives. To begin consider three        possibilities:                 First, the highest level of gender equality that         we can imagine. This might be the current         state of inequality, or it might be the highest         level of inequality now seen in any comparable         society, or it might be a much higher level of         inequality. The problem here is to imagine         what is the greatest amount of future inequality we         can          Second, the highest level of gender in equality         that we can imagine.          And, third, the most likely level of gender         inequality that we expect. This could         coincide with either one of the previous, but will         commonly be somewhere between them.                         For deciding the plausibility of any future        circumstances, we want to remember that there are two        kinds of limiting conditions we must consider.         First, functional plausibility ,        asking if that level of inequality is feasible in the        context of what we perceive to be the relevant        surrounding circumstances. For a simple example,        a social custom of leaving all property to sons is        largely unworkable in a society with a low reproduction        rate because so many families have no sons.         Second, transition        plausibility , asking if a conceivable        historical path of development could lead from present        circumstances to the future scenario. For a        simple example, it might be possible to conceive how        American society could have functioned with full gender        equality in 1900, but it would extremely difficult to        suggest any plausible way that condition could have        emerged under any conceivable historical sequence from        the social organization of American society in 1850.                              Bringing it together . Our goal here is       not to predict the future of gender inequality, but to       examine what sequence of causal conditions seem likely determinants       of that future. We are trying to discover defensible       \" if, then \" arguments. To do this, we are       starting by imagining possible futures, then working       backwards from them to find paths from the present to those       futures, then asserting what else must occur for those       paths to materialize. We should not forget, there may       be more than one path to an imagined future and more than       one set of causal conditions that could lead us there.        For each alternative being considered, we want to analyze        why and how it might reasonably occur.        As an optional extra, you can offer an analysis of which        alternative seems more likely and why.

How have women's and     men's actions obstructed or furthered change, taking into account     the changing institutional context?       Both women and men    have acted in every possible way towards gender inequality. What    we want to understand are the circumstances in which they predictably    act in ways that either reinforce or erode inequality. People's    actions are complex results of their interests, ideologies,    circumstances, opportunities, and constraints. While theories of    gender inequality invoke all kinds of abstract causal processes, in real    life inequality is sustained and changed by the actions of women and    men. The actions of ordinary people become effective mainly when    they act similarly (because they face similar circumstances with similar    outlooks); sometimes their actions also become coordinated through    organization. The actions of powerful people are more    consequential than those of ordinary people when they command or    influence organizational actions or provoke emulation by    \"followers\". Even unique political actions may have great effect    by altering laws, policies, or the balance of power, although even in    these cases the institutionalization of changes generally depends on    dispersed acceptance; in the economic realm, even organizational actions    typically become effective only when multiple organizations pursue    parallel policies (governmental controls over an economy would be an    exception).           Analytical      Task                  The goal of this task is to       examine why some of men's actions worked against gender       inequality while others sustained it, and similarly why       women's actions also included ones that challenged gender       inequality and others that reinforced it. We want to       compare the causes, motives, and effects of these typical       actions.               \"Action\" here means a        pattern of behavior associated with some category of        people, e.g. the tendency to take or not take advantage of        educational opportunities by women of some type in some        period. The relevant actions are those that were one        typical result either of being either in certain enduring        categories of women or men (for example, single women with        higher education) or in certain recurring circumstances        (for example, married women whose husbands lost their jobs        for long periods). The category could include all        women or all men.        To say that actions        reinforce gender inequality means that they either bolster        the stability of gender inequality or help to make it more        severe; alternatively, if those actions became rare        and were not replaced by alternative actions with        similar effects, then either the degree of gender        inequality experienced by some people would decline or the        persistence of gender inequality would become more        problematic. (by the identified group in the        identified conditions)        Analogously, to say that        actions challenge gender inequality means that those        actions, if taken by enough people, result in reducing the        amount of gender inequality or they erode the stability of        gender inequality making it more vulnerable to future        challenges.                    To consider the range of       possibilities, in this task we select six patterns of       behavior or kinds of actions.               Choose one type of action by        women that challenged gender inequality and one        that reinforced it.        Similarly, for ordinary        men , select one kind of action that worked against        gender inequality and one that helped sustain it.        Finally, do the same for men        with power .                    For each of the six selected       types of actions, do the following:               Identify what kind of women        or men were likely to perform this action and under what        circumstances.        Describe the action,        including an assessment of its effects on gender        inequality. This may include consideration of        reasons why its effects might vary (e.g., the number        acting might have to surpass a threshold before there are        widespread effects, the effects might be contingent on        other conditions, the effects might happen after a delay,        and so on).        Try to specify the reasons        why this type of action occurred. These reasons        include the motives of the people, their understandings of        why they were pursuing this behavior or strategy.         The reasons also include the social and cultural        conditions that induce the actions and make them seem        necessary, sensible, and just. The reasons may also        include triggering events.                    To summarize: Pick six kinds of       behavior that have made a difference to the persistence of       gender inequality, one reinforcing and one challenging for       each of the three categories: women, ordinary men, powerful       men. Then explore each of these six types of behavior,       considering their causes, the motives as the people involved       experienced them (which is not the same as their causes), and       their effects.

How do the media    influence or reflect gender inequality?     Commentators often point toward media influence when   they try to explain contemporary gender inequality. Theories of media alert    us that we must always consider reciprocal causal processes. While any    individual may appear only to be the object of media influence, the content    and impact of media depend greatly on the existing culture and social    structure. The relationship of the media to the collective market effect of    consumers may be compared to the relationship between elected public officials    and voters. Also, consumers have considerable freedom to choose which media    outlets to give their attention and people selectively interpret and judge    the media to which they are exposed. All of this makes the relationship    between what is portrayed in the media and what occur in the \"real\" world    rather complex.          Analytical     Task                 Select one kind of popular/mass media, such as magazines or the      cinema, or, alternatively, a form of popular culture thought to      have an analogous impact, such as popular music.       Prepare a simple comparative analysis of current examples to      examples from around 1980, a third of a century ago.             Choose a small, reasonable sample from the two       periods. For example, the samples might be       advertisements from three magazines present in both periods,       or the female and male protagonists of top earning movies, or       the lyrics of the highest rated songs.        Using the dimensions or characteristics identified in the       readings, (or analogous ones that better fit the media you are       assessing), characterize the differences in the ways women and       men are portrayed in the two periods.                   Given the results of your comparisons, show how the data you      observe might be explained by (1) theories stressing the influence      of the media on gender expectations, evaluations, and behavior, or      (2) theories stressing the media as reflecting gender inequality,      or (3) theories stressing market segmentation (audiences choose      among media offerings and media makers aim at audience segments.       Prepare a simple, reasonable response to the questions, \"What is      the basic causal relationship between mass media and gender       inequality?\" and \"How      is the correspondence between media portrayals and real-life      gender inequality sustained over time as gender inequality changes?

How have political     processes and structures sustained men's and women's relative     status? [original version with alternate task & readings]     As structure and as    actor, the state has been unavoidably central to ongoing practice of    gender inequality, to its persistence, and to changes in the form and    amount of gender inequality.      States or governments have power. Through the    military and police, a state can enforce conformity to its rules, repel    and punish challenges from the scale of individual acts to collective    rebellions, and by threat, implicit or explicit, deter rebellions from    appearing. Through the law, regulations, and bureaucratic policies, a    state can define what constitutes acceptable or legitimate behavior at    all levels of social organization. Through economic policies of    taxation, expenditures, and redistributions (such as welfare policies or    agricultural supports), a state influences the relative economic status    of different groups.      By acting differently toward groups with regard to    any of these aspects of government power, a state can create, reinforce,    or exacerbate social inequalities. Analogously, a state can, in theory,    obstruct, destabilize, or diminish social inequality by using its power    in ways that are inconsistent with social inequalities. States    determine, influence, legitimize, and sanction rights and opportunities;    they may do so in more or less egalitarian ways.      When significant, enduring, social inequality    exists, those privileged by that form of inequality will normally have    more influence over the state than do those disadvantaged by the    inequality, and the overall effect of state policies will reinforce the    exercise and persistence of the inequality. A fundamental problem for    all state theories is who or what decides state policies and actions. To    some degree, those \"in\" the state (elected, appointed, hired, or    appropriated) make decisions based on their interests and outlooks as    members of the state apparatus. To some degree, state actors respond to    the influence of power brokers outside the state, such as the    economically powerful. In either case, when making policy or strategic    planning decisions, those influencing state actions are in part    responding to what they perceive will be the responses of all actors in    the nation affected by those decisions.           Analytical      Task                   Task summary: Assess the most       important ways the American state (or some other) has       influenced and been influenced by gender inequality over the       past two hundred years. Try to keep in mind that this       always concerns the accumulation and exercise of social power.              What are the crucial ways that       government reflected gender inequality?                Consider how and why the        state treated women and men differently         Consider ways that the        state helped gender inequality operate smoothly         Consider how the state        helped gender inequality to persist                     How and why has the state       promoted gender equality by reducing the differences in its       treatment of women? How has the state How and why has       the state made it difficult (and irrational) for many to       continue practices that disadvantage women?        How and why have the relevant       government actions changed over time?         While developing the analysis       for this task, it can be helpful to examine how the       relationship between the state and gender inequality resembled       or differed from the state's relationships to other kinds of       inequality.

Table of Contents                              Description \u2013 Scope, Organization, and Access:      The Scope of the Topics and Materials.      We know a lot about gender inequality \u2013 its history, how people     experience it in their lives, the ways it varies in intensity and form     across time and place, the beliefs that make it seem natural, and much     more. The outpouring of research and commentary on gender     inequality over the past half century has been extraordinary.      Unfortunately, despite all this, our understanding of what causes     gender inequality remains troubled. Both ordinary people and experts     (such as scholars) commonly fluctuate between simplistic explanations     that founder under close scrutiny and throwing up their hands in     frustration over what can seem an enigma beyond human     comprehension. Here we will seek to surmount this dilemma.      We will explore diverse facets of gender inequality and varied ideas     about what causes might be decisive. We will also look carefully     at the ways we can identify and verify the causes of social     phenomena. Through these efforts we will aim both to enhance our     understanding of what produces gender inequality and to improve our     general ability to do causal social analyses effectively.      The class     organization and goals. In this class, each week's work will     be organized around an analytical task, as well as a set of     readings. Rather than focusing on discussion of the readings,     the analytical tasks involve attempting a causal analysis of some     aspect of gender inequality related to the week's issue, building on     the materials we read (in brief papers of a couple pages). The     approach in this class seeks to develop analytical skills as well as     understandings of the relevant literature by stressing doing actual     analyses of gender inequality. (Note: this class does not have an exam     nor a final paper.)      All class meetings are organized as discussions. Part of our     class discussions will be on the common readings and part on students'     efforts to explore the analytical tasks each week. We will     adjust the time devoted to these two goals according to our     experiences over the class. Every week, students will initiate     discussions on readings and papers. To make this work, each week's     papers will be exchanged (electronically) with enough lead time that     we can all read all the papers prior to the class meetings.      Each topic below includes \u2013 beside the common readings \u2013     three other subsections. These are: an analytical task ,     recommended readings , and related readings . The analytical task is the writing     assignment for the week. Everyone should read the common     readings while doing the analytical task (and be prepared to     discuss them). In each of these papers \u2013 always brief      papers \u2013 students will try out causal ideas related to the week's     topic. Recommended and     related readings are optional      materials useful for those who want to dig deeper into a topic.      To simplify navigating through the syllabus, these subsections are     hidden until the viewer clicks on the subsection heading, then they     will appear.      Most of our readings will be articles available for downloading.      The links will appear in the online version of the course     syllabus. Excerpts from Down So Long . . .: The Puzzling     Persistence of Gender Inequality (book manuscript by RMJ not yet     published) will similarly be available for downloading from the class web     site. (As we will read selections from Jackson's book Destined     for Equality [Harvard U Press] throughout the course, you might     want to buy it or borrow it.)      Any student unfamiliar with the study of gender, can (and probably     should) pick up the basics from a standard textbook in the area \u2013 I     recommend Michael Kimmel's Gendered Society (which I use in my     basic general undergraduate class on gender, so used copies should be     easy to find).      For further relevant sources, my reading lists/syllabi for two     graduate courses might be valuable. The one most directly     related is      What Causes Gender Inequality:     Analytical Foundations ; a more general class,           What Causes Inequality: Analytical     Foundations , may provide materials for broader     questions about different kinds of inequalities and how to think about     gender inequality in relationship to them.       A note      on the \"hidden\" material below : Each section of     this guide includes \u2013 beside the common readings \u2013 three     subsections, one for an analytical task , one for recommended     readings , and one for related readings . To     simplify navigating through the course guide, only the headings for     these subsections are initially visible. The contents of all     these subsections are hidden (so that the beginning appearance of the     page is similar to a standard syllabus) until the viewer clicks on a     subsection heading, then its contents will appear. While this     organization is helpful for negotiating the page most of the time, it     can become an obstacle if we want to search the page (for example, for     a particular article) as searches will ignore the hidden material     (that is, if you search a page you are viewing in an internet browser,     the search will only examine what is shown on the page at that time).      To overcome this limitation, you can \"open\" all the hidden sections to     show everything on the page by clicking the \u00a7 symbol at the top of the     page. (To restore the page to the normal condensed view, simply     reload the page which will collapse all the \"hidden\" sections to their     usual look). The table of contents at the top of this page will     aid speedy navigation to any topic, which is particularly helpful if     you reveal all the \"hidden\" material.                              The Topics                I. Introduction. What    do we mean by gender inequality?     To analyze the causes of gender     inequality, we need to know what we mean by gender     inequality. How can we conceive of and talk about     gender inequality in ways that are general enough to apply across the     range of relevant phenomena, consistent enough to minimize conceptual     ambiguities, and precise enough to be analytically effective?      Gender inequality has been extraordinarily diverse and wide     spread. Women and men are unequal in every conceivable way in     endless circumstances, both immediate and enduring, by both objective     criteria and subjective experience. So, what counts as gender     inequality? Can we characterize it in ways that let us confidently and     impartially assess when there is more or less of it?          Analytical     Task                 No task for the introductory meeting.

II. Causality - What are causes,    mechanisms, and the like?     We casually refer to causes and effects in normal   interactions all the time. We all conduct our lives \u2013 choosing actions,   making decisions, trying to influence others \u2013 based on theories about why   and how things happen in the world. From the early stages of childhood   we attribute causes, building a vision of the social (and physical) world   that makes it understandable. Every action, every choice about what to   do, is based on our anticipation of its effects, our understandings of   consequences. Analytical and scientific reasoning has a similar form,   but requires that we approach causation more systematically and   self-consciously.          Analytical     Task                 The general      analytical problem . In this and other societies,      women and men commonly dress differently. Prepare a      causal analysis that seeks to explain why women and men dress      differently .              Our analytical task this week is to attempt a \"simple\"       causal analysis of a gender difference that is obvious but not       often questioned - the way we dress. The purpose of this       exercise is to get us thinking about causality.        To the degree that we can, we want to try to think of       different kinds of causes based on varied ways of framing the       causal question. Realistically, one could easily write a       book about all the possible ways of interpreting this causal       question and answering it. We are just trying to develop       some sensible insights in a couple pages.                   Thinking Tools .       The starting point of most causal analyses is a comparison.       When we start with the general question \"what causes X?\" we turn      it into possible comparisons to produce an answer. Examples      of such questions might be \"why do people in group A do X more      than those in group B?,\" \"why does X occur more often in summer      than winter?,\" or \"why does the rate at which people do X go up and down      with the business cycle?\" The underlying idea is simple but      powerful. If we are trying to explain some phenomenon, X,      then we need to identify variations in the likelihood of X or the      rate of X, and look for potential causes that (1) vary across the      relevant circumstances in a way that could explain X and (2) that      we can connect to the outcomes for X in some way. For      example, with the gender distinctive clothing question, some ways      to better specify the question and look at it through comparisons      are:              What causes individual       conformity to the cultural pattern? What       induces women and men to conform to the expectations for       dressing differently? Whenever we observe a consistent       pattern of social behavior, some common conditions or       processes must be inducing people to act in a similar       way. Figuring out what encourages conformity and       discourages deviance allows us to provide a causal       explanation. Think about what happens to people who do       not conform to the expectations about male and female       appropriate clothing. And, just as important, ask why it       is that people punish nonconformists. Here the basic       comparison is between people who conform and those who do not,       or between the reactions of people to conformity and       nonconformity.        What causes differences       in dress \"codes\" across cultures? What circumstances       could exist across societies that consistently produce gender       differences in modes of dress? The clothing       characteristic of each sex varies greatly across societies       (and time). Clothing differs between \"primitive\"       cultures and modern ones, between warm and cold climates, and       between different parts of the world. But seemingly       everywhere men and women dress differently. How can we       explain this pattern? Here the primary comparison is       between cultures that have different clothing.        Why do the expectations       about clothing differences vary by context ? Why       are gender differences in dress greater in some circumstances       than in others? For example, both women and men may wear       similar coveralls in a factory, but women and men generally       wear dramatically different clothing to formal dances.        Our efforts to find causes behind any phenomena are improved       by looking at variations. If male and female clothing is       just a little different in some contexts but greatly different       in others, we can usefully focus on what might produce this       variance in gender differences. Here the primary       comparison is between contexts with greater differences in the       expected clothing and contexts with lesser differences.                   Thinking Tools 2 .       While considering how to explain the differences in the ways      women and men dress, it can also be helpful to think through       ways that this pattern could be considered an example of a       larger pattern. The explanation for the broader pattern       may be different or easier to develop. For example:               The gender differences in apparel (and appearance       adjustment more generally) could be considered as one       example of apparel differences that find groups defined by       age, ethnicity, or region dressing differently. That       is to say, it is not only women and men who consistently       dress differently. Different ways of dressing also       distinguish other groups. If we think about those       other groups, does it give us insights into explaining the       difference between women's and men's clothing?        The gender differences in dress could be considered as one       example of a wider range of behavioral differences between       women and men such as rules of proper decorum, speech       patterns, or displays of sexuality. That is, we can       point to other presentational differences between women and       men. If we think about the range of these       presentational differences, do they suggest ideas that might       help explain differences in apparel?

How is gender inequality    symbolized and reproduced in everyday life?     To start our investigation of the causes of gender   inequality, we will consider how people experience and act out gender in   their day to day lives. We want to think about the most basic   questions. Why and when do women and men act differently? Why   and when do people respond differently to women than men? How do all   these private individual actions when taken together over time influence the   understanding of gender in a culture and gender inequality?          Analytical     Task                  The general       analytical problem . Using a typical setting       where women and men meet, assess how Ridgeway's framing       approach helps explain the role of gender in these       interactions and where it might fall short.               For this task, we choose some familiar (to us) setting        or type of interaction where women and men typically        engage each other. For example, this could be a        workplace, a bar, interactions between buyers and sellers,        or parties. We use this as our source of empirical        data and focus our argument on explaining gender        interactions there.         First, we need to read Ridgeway's argument        carefully. Then we try to apply her argument to the        setting we have chosen.         We want to assess how much we believe people's actions (in        the context we chose) fit the expectations we can derive        from her argument and when they might not. As we        work on our analyses, we are evaluating Ridgeway's        approach as a tool. The right tool allows us to construct        a better edifice with less effort; the wrong tool does        not.                      Thinking tools .       The remaining notes for this analytical task look at some       analytical steps that allow us to think through this problem       effectively.               Systematic steps in        the analysis . Doing this kind of thought        experiment, we want our thinking to be as systematic as        possible. For all systematic causal analyses, we        want to consider how the phenomenon being examined varies        in regular or predictable ways across conditions,        settings, types of people, places, or the like. Then, we        ask what conditions or events typically precede or occur        along with the outcomes that could plausibly influence        those outcomes.                 For example, first, we simply consider possible         differences between men's and women's actions.          Then we consider how their actions might differ         between opposite-sex and same-sex encounters.          We can broaden the range of the examples we use to         think about these differences by considering other         characteristics that might affect interactions, such         as the age or race of the people, whether the         interaction is cordial or unfriendly, how well the         people know each other, and so on.          We want to ask ourselves if the gender aspect of the         interaction will be influenced by these other         circumstances that seem relevant to interactions. For         example, does gender influence cordial interactions         differently from the ways it influences confrontations         in our setting? If we believe the answer         is yes, then we consider how and why.          Analogously, we want to think about the ways that         people's goals in gendered interactions vary in these         kinds of circumstances, and how these goals influence         their actions. For example, in the same setting,         a person seeking sex will commonly act differently         than someone trying to curry favor or sell a product.                  When we apply a systematic logic to the analysis, we         usually do not want to write about all the         possibilities we think about. Instead, we use         the ones that we find telling. But we will not         identify those telling possibilities unless we         systematically work through all the relevant possible         influences.                         Gender context .        We can take the analysis of interactions another step by        considering how the influence of gender on these        interactions is potentially affected by conditions like:                 the presence or absence of onlookers (i.e., the         relative privacy of the interaction) or          the gender distribution of other people present         (i.e., mostly male, mostly female, or mixed)                         Conformity .         Whenever we try to explain patterns like this, we want to        consider the exceptions. When will people violate        the implications of gender expectations and what follows        when they do? Are there circumstances that make it        more likely people will depart from conventional        behavior? Violations of norms or common expectations        are valuable for causal analyses because cracks in the        veneer of social order can reveal its structure and        dynamics.                      Bring it       together . After working through the steps       above, we try to assess when Ridgeway's approach does a good       job explaining how gender influences behavior in our chosen       setting, and when her approach seems to fall short. Do       we see ways that her approach neglects or misunderstands       important causes influencing the gender character of behavior       in the context we examine? Our central goal here is to       explain how and why gender organizes interactions in our       chosen example. We are not attempting a general evaluation of       Ridgeway's ideas, but a focused assessment of their       effectiveness in the setting we have selected to try them out.

And how does    explaining the \"origins\" of gender inequality relate to explaining the    \"persistence\" of gender inequality?     Although some scholars may question if    women have been subordinate in all societies, all agree that men have been   dominant in most societies although the degree of dominance varies   greatly. This raises the very tricky question, how do we explain the   prevalence of male dominance? This exceedingly elusive question   continues to elude any answer that will evoke a consensus.          Analytical     Task                  Analytical Task       Alternative 1: An analytical critique . As most       of us lack the substantive knowledge needed to develop even       simple analyses of gender inequality's possible origins, we       will explore the causal possibilities by responding to the       arguments of people who are knowledgeable.               Please read the \" Basics of Causal        Descriptions \" on a separate page for some simple,        beginning ideas about describing a causal analysis.         Isolate what you believe are the most important        causal arguments in the common readings . Give        a critical assessment of their different approaches .         In doing this, try to pay attention to what it is that        makes you find the causal arguments more or less        persuasive. The recommended and related readings        provide a range of material that you can look at as you        need to deepen and sharpen your arguments.                       It can be helpful to look back at the material from        Topic II, especially Gerring's list of criteria for causal        arguments.                      Analytical Task       Alternative 2: A hypothetical scenario . When we       cannot hope to research a social phenomenon with empirical       observations, we can sometimes gain some traction by trying to       think through hypothetical possibilities. Here is an       example.               Assume that sometime in the near future we launch a        rocket into space with a crew of 1,000. This crew is        evenly divided between women and men, the women and men        have similar credentials and accomplishments, and the two        sexes are about equally represented at each level of        authority. The crew members' cultural understandings        are similar to those of college students today.         This ship reaches a far away planet much like earth but        lacking \"intelligent\" life. Unfortunately, the        ship's engines have become unstable and the crew must        abandon it. So they must start life on this new        planet. While they possess much advanced knowledge,        they have no technology. They must start from        scratch, producing food, organizing themselves into a        community, pairing off to reproduce, slowly building        toward some kind of technological development over        generations. [Note: If the distant planet scenario        seems unnerving, we could have the same effect by dropping        a 1,000 people on a remote island that is isolated as a        social experiment.]         Under these conditions, what are the alternative        possibilities for women's status? What might decide        which alternative occurs?

What determines men's and    women's roles and positions within families?     Family and kinship are potentially relevant to gender   inequality in varied ways and a lot of work had pursued such issues.    Probably the two most important general issues involve the ways that women   and men are unequal within families and the ways that family organization   both contributes to and is influenced by gender inequality beyond the family   institution. We will just touch the surface of these issues this week.          Analytical     Task                  The general       analytical problem . We want to provide an       integrated analytical overview of the principal causal       arguments about gender inequality and family organization that       appear in the common readings.        Each of the readings has various causal arguments about       family organization, some directly about gender inequality,       some relevant to gender inequality but not directly exploring       it. Some of the causal questions may receive different       causal analyses by these authors. Sometimes two or more       authors may use a similar causal approach to explain different       causal problems. Our goal is to sort this out.        Our overviews should be organized around the causal       arguments, not        a series of summaries of what each author wrote (see Thinking       Tools).        Thinking tools .               We want to use one of the following two possible ways to        organize the causal assessment (unless one of us has a        better way). The first organizes around what is to        be explained, the second around the causes.                 First approach .          We start by identifying the principal causal problems         addressed by the group of papers. That is, we         figure out what they suggest needs to be         explained. Then, we organize these causal         problems in a sensible order (including consideration         of some problems potentially being secondary or         sub-problems of others). Under each causal         problem, we summarize and assess all the relevant         explanations found in the readings.          Second approach .          We start by identifying the principal causal         frameworks used in the papers. That is, we         figure out what they suggest are the conditions or         processes that have the most important influence over         the outcomes. Then, we organize these causal         frameworks in a sensible order, taking into account         which are entirely different and which might be         variations of a similar theme, and which are competing         versus complementary. For each of these, after         summarizing the causal logic of the framework, we show         how it has been used by these authors, describing the         range of outcomes the framework is supposed to         determine and how it has such effects.          Note that         regardless which way we organize our analysis of         competing causal arguments, it can be valuable to         think about not only what is          considered by the authors being examine, but also         which theoretical questions and which causal         frameworks seem relevant but absent.                         Please reread the \" Basics of Causal        Descriptions \" on the starting point for describing a        causal analysis.                      Bringing it       together . In short, our aim is to produce a       critical overview of the principal causal arguments concerning       the family and gender inequality, starting with the ideas       present in the common readings for this week. To do this       effectively, we need to identify all the relevant causal       arguments, deduce the logical structure of each causal       argument and determine how to present that clearly (even if       the original source is inconsistent or ambiguous), detect how       the causal arguments (from different sources) relate to each       other and present them in a way that makes those relations       clear, and, where possible, summarize the important analytical       strengths and weaknesses of each argument (or facet to an       argument).       (We should start with the understanding that this kind of       analytical overview is rather easy to do poorly and very       demanding to do well and thoroughly. At this stage we       are not aspiring to a professional job but hoping to achieve       a reasonable, if basic, analysis.)                             Common Readings           Andrew J.

What is the role of    sexuality?     Sexuality has been evoked in     multiple ways in the study of gender inequality. Some have     considered it as a possible motivating cause for inequality, others have     explored how gender inequality can mold the experience and practice of     sexuality, and others have tried to theoretically incorporate     sexuality as a peculiar tension between women and men that mediates     both the causes and effects of gender inequality. Essentially,     everyone recognizes sexuality is critically important to gender     inequality, but we lack agreement or clarity on how it matters.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical      problem . Our central task this week is to propose a      causal account that plausibly explains the relationship between one      aspect of sexuality and gender inequality.              Everyone who analyzes gender inequality considers sexuality       important, but they have highly varied ideas about what       matters and why. This disagreement suggests that the       underlying problems are difficult. We cannot       hope to solve them in this brief effort. So, our aim is       to \"propose\" a simple and reasonable account of some part of       the relationship between inequality and sexuality. We are        not trying to develop a full, professional analysis.        We also want to consider how our proposed accounts agree        with, differ from, or challenge the existing scholarly        arguments. Again, our goal here is limited. The        aim is to give a reasonable first sense of how the proposed        account fits (or does not fit).                   Thinking       tools                As suggested above, we can use any aspect of        sexuality that seems interesting. However, it may        help if the selected facet of sexuality:                 has a relationship to gender inequality that at         least some writers think is important. Which way         it is important is wide open. The role of the         chosen sexuality characteristic relative to gender         inequality may be cause, effect, catalyst, or whatever         else seems causally relevant.          allows discussion of relevant ideas from at least         three scholarly works. These may be part of the         common readings, any of the other readings recommended         here, or another legitimate source. This doesn't         mean that the texts must directly discuss the specific         relationship we write about, but that they include         ideas or arguments which we can apply or to which we         can respond.                         A basic approach to the task presentation might have the        following three parts:                 First, we lay out the causal, explanatory         problem. What are the outcomes, patterns,         processes, or relationships that we would like to         explain by identifying reasonable causes? And         why is this important enough to merit attention? (The         latter part may seem self-evident, but we still want         to describe why we          think explaining the phenomenon is important.)          Second, we provide the causal analysis. We         want to be as complete as possible within reasonable         space limits. And, we want to be clear, simple,         and direct.          Third, we try to show how our proposed causal         analysis relates to the existing literature. For         our purposes, we can limit ourselves to considering a         couple theories or perspectives that would support or         compliment our approach and a couple that would be         likely to question our proposed causal analysis.          (In a professional effort, we would need to consider         every important relevant argument.) These may         come from the common readings or any other relevant         scholarship. When discussing those who might         disagree, we want to be as specific as possible about         what criticism we would expect from each of these         \"opponents\" and how we might respond.                                      Bringing it       together . In short, our aim is to construct a       basic causal argument seeking to understand how some aspect of       sexuality is related to gender inequality, and to assess how       that causal argument relates to the existing literature (as       represented in our readings).

Attempts to explain gender inequality at all levels are   haunted by essentialism . Essentialist arguments impute   distinctive attributes to women and men and attribute the social differences   between women's and men's activities, opportunities, statuses, and roles to   these distinct attributes. Even theoretical analyses of gender   inequality that expressly reject the possibility of consequential, inherent   sex differences, commonly build their explanations of inequality on   gender differences. To complicate matters, essentialist arguments   proclaiming superior attributes for women exist alongside of the arguments   proclaiming women inferior. Moreover, while for some, essentialism   always means a difference based in biology or genetics, for others it   includes cultural differences that are embodied in women and men.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical problem .      To investigate how essentialist arguments work, we will      examine how different kinds of essentialist arguments might be      applied to explain some aspect of gender inequality, in contrast      to a non-essentialist argument. We aim to see both the      attraction of essentialist arguments and the possibilities for      alternatives.             Select one form or facet of gender inequality that you will       try to explain for this task. This instance or aspect of       gender inequality should be sufficiently important,       widespread, and enduring or recurring to merit thoughtful       theory and explanation. It should also be narrow or       specific enough that the goal of explaining it is       plausible. For example, the facet might be that wives       commonly defer to husbands.        For the selected type or aspect of gender inequality, you       will suggest five alternative explanations, each one       representing a different approach to explaining such social       phenomena. The explanations should be succinct but       clear. They should also be plausible to the extent that       a reasonable person might make such an argument. Plausible       does not mean true, of course. Rather, we are trying to       imagine an argument that would seem plausible to people who       are advocates for each of the perspectives.                   The five types of explanation .       Attempt to devise the best explanations you can for the relevant      facet of inequality from each of the following      perspectives. Explanations may be categorized in many      ways. The five perspectives defined here are meant to engage      different responses to the problem of essentialism.              Direct biological - Devise an explanation claiming       that some biological difference between the sexes produces the       relevant aspect of inequality by making women and men act       differently. For example, an argument might be that men       are stronger than women so men dominate women as a simple       result of superior strength. (More complex biological       explanations might be derived from evolutionary       psychology.) This type of explanation is usually purely       essentialist. Note that this type of explanation can be       divided further into those relying on real biological       differences and those imputing fictional biological       differences. Let us stress biological differences that       are at least potentially real here, leaving the fictitious       ones for below.        Indirect biological - Formulate an explanation       claiming some biological difference does not directly       produce the inequality, but the biological difference has       important effects or implications of some sort, and those       effects that make likely or unavoidable the emergence or       persistence of the selected aspect of gender inequality.        For example, someone might argue that women's child bearing       makes them anxious about the welfare of their children, and       that anxiety makes them feel weak and in want of a protector,       leading them to defer to husbands. Or, others might       suggest that women's biologically induced child rearing       orientation encourages both women and men to make men       responsible for warfare, and that men's resulting skill at       combat, their possession of weapons, and men's organization       around mutual defense leaves wives typically in their       husbands' control. The key for this type of explanation       is that the relevant biological differences do not directly       cause the gender inequality being explained, but have effects       on social behavior and social organization that lead to gender       inequality. These types of explanations have       essentialist origins in a biological difference, but the       explanation as a whole may invoke mediating causal influences       that reduce the essentialist quality, sometimes greatly.        Non-biological sex difference - Suggest how       some socially constructed difference between women and men \u2013       one that is neither biological nor a direct result of       biological differences \u2013 initiates or preserves the aspect of       gender inequality being explained. This will usually be       an enduring individual characteristic (a difference that       people carry with them, not a difference in their       circumstances). For example, one might claim that women       are fearful and dependent because of socialization processes       (that have no biological basis), and this psychological       condition induces wives to defer to their husbands. Or,       one might argue that childhood sports available only to boys       result in a higher competitive drive that accounts for adult       men's greater success in business. This type of       explanation claims a real difference exists between women and       men (in the society or social context where the inequality       being explained occurs; the relevant sex difference need not       exist in all or any other society or social context), but this       difference is a social construction. This type of       explanation often becomes redundantly circular: each aspect of       inequality exists as a result of inequality, and that overall       inequality is constituted by the various aspects.        Fictitious sex difference - An imputed sex       difference that does not really exist is claimed to play a       significant role in producing the selected facet of gender       inequality. For example, someone might suggest that       although women have no better capacity for child rearing,       people commonly assume they do because women bear children,       and that this false expectation produces a division of labor       and power favoring men. This type of explanation focuses       on the consequences of beliefs, relying on the observation       that beliefs can organize behavior even if they are false       beliefs. While such fictitious differences are commonly       assumed to be biological, they need not be.        Causes independent of sex differentiation - A       causal process that does not involve any difference between       the sexes is argued to produce the inequality being       considered. For example, some might argue that for       families to fulfill their social functions effectively, they       need one spouse/parent to perform the critical emotional       actions needed and the other spouse/parent to perform the       practical and leadership actions (this is essentially a       well-know idea of Talcott Parsons). This role       differentiation can then result in spouse inequality, as an       indirect and unintended consequence. This category       includes highly diverse explanations, the one critical       similarity among them being that they do not rely on a sex       difference in their central causal argument. It may be       worth noting that one reason explanations based on sex       differences (including all the preceding perspectives) are       more common is that formulating a plausible analysis that       forgoes the mechanism of sex differences is often a hard task.                         (Note, in this task we are aiming to produce explanations that      those advocating each of the above types of explanation would      think are reasonable. It is often hardest to conceive good      explanations from the points of view we find unconvincing or      unappealing, but the capacity to do this is a valuable skill.)       Bringing it together .       The point of this exercise is to examine how it is possible to      devise a range of alternative causal explanations of gender      inequality stressing some mechanism of sex differences, while      developing alternative theories that do not rely on sex      differences is rather hard. The difference arguments run the      full range from being directly and fully biological to relying on      non-biological or fictitious differences in indirect ways.       The arguments that exclude not only biology but all dependence on      sex differences commonly derive from another theoretical approach,      such as functionalism or conflict theories. The challenge      with these approaches is not only to make the immediate causal      process eschew differences, but to avoid relying on sex      differences one or two steps earlier in the causal chain.

What is the role of     violence and intimidation in the relationships between men and     women?     Most theoretical approaches to gender inequality   suggest that violence between women and men plays a role in sustaining   inequality; some also point toward violence as an initial    cause. A recurring issue concerns the degree to which violence is an   expression or result of gender inequality or, alternatively, is a cause of   inequality. The separate roles of rape, harassment, and domestic   violence, and their relationships to each other are another critical   question. Much research and argument has also been focused on the   question of women's aggressive impulses and actions.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task 1:      Explain why women do not engage in sexual harassment or sexual      violence at anything like the rates that men do? Our      strategy is to reverse the usual way people approach the problem      of gender violence.              When people refer to the patterns of violence between women       and men (in modern societies), they are usually referring to       several distinctive patterns including sexual violence       (particularly rape), sexual harassment, and intimate partner       violence (which includes wife battering). These       categories implicitly distinguish patterns of aggression based       on several criteria: the degree to which the aggressive acts       involve sexuality, the severity of the aggressive acts, and       the relationship between the man and woman. These       aggressive actions in these categories are all related to       gender inequality both in that inequality engenders them and       that they reinforce gender inequality. They are       particularly linked in their contributions to women\u2019s fear and       sense of physical vulnerability. And that fear is       crucial. For it is the prospect of possible violence       that induces women to restrict their behavior, to seek male       protectors, and to heed men\u2019s wishes.        Here, to simplify our task, we will set aside the question       of intimate partner violence.        To begin, you might consider what determines the actions of       women that do or do not lead to violence and how those       immediate determinants differ from the determinants for       men. Men vary greatly, so you must decide if you will       abstract away all that variation (to talk of \"men\" in the most       generic or abstract possible manner) or if you feel that some       variations (e.g. wealth or age) require consideration.        Remember that you can restrict the scope of your analysis.               Potential determinants include beliefs, resources,        opportunities, the anticipated consequences of alternative        actions         Another way to look at it is the old detective's script:        motives, means, opportunity         It is commonly useful to start your reasoning        concretely, using what you know best. Think about        the kinds of people you know best, either through personal        experience or from studying them. Try to explain        concretely why the women do not engage in sexual        harassment or sexual violence more. This gives you a        starting point.               Expect to develop your argument backwards from the concrete       beginnings. This means that after you assemble your       first round explanation of what directly influences women's       actions, you take those explanatory conditions as the problem       to explain in the second. For example, if you used       women's beliefs about violence as an immediate cause of their       restrained violence, then you next need to consider why they       have different beliefs from men. You want to produce at       least two levels of the causal analysis, and see if you can do       three.        Please take the time to look over the lists of Recommended       and Related Readings. You are likely to find some work       there what will shorten the time needed to complete this task.                              Analytical Task 2 : Try      to develop a clear causal analysis of the role played in      gender inequality by a fear of violence.                    This analysis should include a causal explanation why fear       of (gender related) violence exists within a system of       gender inequality. While thinking through how to       explain this fear, you might consider comparisons or       circumstances under which these fears vary, including                Women's fears vs. men's fears         The circumstances under which women experience greater        fear and those where they feel safe         Differences in the amount of fear typical amongst        groups or categories of women according to their age,        affluence, location, companions, or any other relevant        social condition         Differences in the distribution of fear across        societies distinguished by such conditions as forms of        economic and political organization, degree of        development, prevailing religious or cultural        institutions and the like                       This analysis should also include a causal explanation of       the consequences for gender inequality of the distribution       of fears of violence. In what ways do fears of       violence influence the behavior of women or the       relationships between women and men? Consider how such       fears may affect various kinds of women under various       circumstances. But remember to return to aggregate       effects \u2013 it is the impact of these fears on the pattern of       women's experiences and behavior that affects gender       inequality writ large.        Avoid the analytic temptation to argue as if equality       might imply an absence of discord and aggression.        Realistically, equality between two groups by itself only       leads us to expect that acts of aggression will occur with       equal frequency and effect between members of the two       groups. Removing inequality as a source of discord       should reduce one kind of frustrations that motivate       aggression. Other sources of discord still exist,       however, and some forms of aggression that would be       suppressed by inequality might even rise.        Try to introduce appropriate connections between the       argument(s) you present and the readings. Consider not       only the common readings from this week, but also past       readings and optional ones from this week that seem       particularly relevant.        The causal arguments should try to conform to the       standards for a good causal argument that we have read about       and discussed. Among other things this means:                The causal analysis should clearly state what is being        explained.         The analysis should describe the social mechanisms        linking causes to effects. It should show what        happens in the world that produces the outcomes, what        kinds of people or organizations behave in manner, what        circumstances arise that induce the relevant behavior,        and so forth. This may be abstract at the level of        the causal model.         The analysis should consider why the decisive        causes exist and take the form that they do. That        is, the causal analysis should push back at least one        step past the causes being invoked to ask what causes        them.         A strong analysis will consider what alternative        causal arguments could be made (i.e., how the causal        processes could be different from what you describe) and        show what evidence or logic favors the argument you have        presented. A thorough causal analysis will        recognize that other causal models might be considered        plausable, and try to compare the causal model being        promoted to the alternatives.         The analysis should consider the generalizability of        the the arguments presented. It should consider to        what periods, places, types of societies, parts of        society, kinds of social relationships or interactions        do the arguments apply?         Most will find it difficult to do all of the above        effectively, so consider it suggestions about what would        be ideal, then apply your judgment about allocating your        time and effort.

How has the economy    influenced men's and women's positions in society?     Analyses of gender inequality attribute great   importance to the economy. Gender inequality appears everywhere   embedded in economic inequality, in the sense that a critical aspect of   gender inequality involves unequal access to economic resources and   positions. This relationship becomes clearer in more \"advanced\"   societies where economic organization has become institutionally   differentiated from kinship and political organization. Sometimes this   unequal economic access is understood as an expression of gender inequality,   sometimes a cause of gender inequality, sometimes a result. Many analyses   consider it all three.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task       1: Develop a causal analysis of economic inequality between      women and men that accounts for two empirical observations, one      being the earnings inequality between the sexes by the gender      composition of major occupational categories, the other being the      changing likelihood that wives will earn more than their husbands.              The data to be explained can be found in three tables (click to see) .        Use the tabs at the bottom to switch between tables.               The first table shows the 2012 earnings gap in the 20        occupational categories that have the largest number of        females. These have been sorted by the proportion        female. The numbers in dark red show the earnings        gap where women also account for two-thirds or more of the        those in the occupational category.         The second table shows the same kind of data as the        first, but is for the 20 occupational categories that have        the largest number of males. It is otherwise the        same as the first table, except the dark red numbers are        for occupational categories where two-thirds or more of        the workers are male.         The third table shows the changing proportion of married        couples where the wife earns more than the husband over        the 25 years up to 2011.                      Preliminary to developing an analysis, the first task is,       of course, to interpret what the data in the tables tell us       about economic inequality between women and men. It is       recommended that you focus on the dark red numbers of all the       tables. The first two tables are meant to be interpreted       as one.        The main task is to develop a background analysis of gender       inequality in the economy, as it exists today and how it has       changed over the past several decades. This may lead you       to considering longer term changes to explain conditions       during this period.        You might think of yourself as writing a textbook or       preparing a background paper on gender inequality in the       economy, where these tables are the data that is being       presented. Your goal is to offer an understanding of       these tables.        One way to think about this is in terms of what we don't see       in the tables.               Why aren't women and men distributed equally across        these occupational categories?         Why are women's earnings lower?         Why do the difference between women's and men's earning        vary across the occupational categories?         Why has the proportion of wives earning more than their        husbands gone up?         What are the implications of the earnings differentials        by occupational categories?         What are the implications of the data on wives'        earnings?         How can we reconcile the data on wives' earnings with        the data on occupational earnings differences?                      In short, we are aiming at a brief explanation of women's       vs. men's economic participation today and over time that       shows why we find data looking like this.                   Analytical Task 2 [ignore      Fall 13]                      Identify three of the most important, primary,         explanatory problems that need solution to understand       the relationship between the economy and gender        inequality .                 Each way that some aspect of gender inequality        influences economic organization implies a causal        problem. Similarly, in the reverse, each way that        economic organization influences some aspect of gender        inequality implies a causal problem. For example,        women used to have no access to most high-status        positions in the American economy and are now still        under represented in them. In either direction we        might consider the intensity or degree of gender        inequality, rather than some aspect of gender        inequality, as that which influences or is influenced by        economic organization. For each observation or        claim about economic inequality between women and men,        we can ask \"why?\" or \"how?\" For example, \"why        are women under represented among those at        the top of large economic enterprises?\" or \"how does        women's relative absence from positions great economic        power influence the persistence of gender inequality?\"         Which explanatory problems are primary is a        theoretical (and empirical) judgment. A         primary causal process is one without which the         relationship between the economy and gender inequality         would look and work differently . Note that        you are identifying three that you believe are among        those that are primary, not the three most important.                        For each of the three selected, primary,       explanatory problems, do the following: State clearly what        is the explanatory problem and why it is a        primary or important one . Think carefully about       what makes some causal processes more important than others       when we are trying to understand a social phenomenon (her       the relationship between gender inequality and economic       organization).        Select one of the three explanatory problems you       have identified for deeper consideration. For that       problem:                Briefly describe what stand out as the         possible causal processes that could account for        the relationship or condition that is the focus of the        explanatory problem. For example, what might        be the causal processes that account for few women        being in positions of high economic power? These        are the competing or alternative explanations for the        problem. These may include the causes or        explanations explicitly suggested in the literature        concerning the problem, or explanations derived from        applying a more general theoretical orientation (e.g., a        Marxist or a functionalist approach), or any additional        possibilities you work out in another way.          Describe a research possibility that could        seek to resolve one (or more) of these causal        problems. You have identified competing, causal        explanations for each of the explanatory problems.         For one of these, consider how we might hope to learn        which causal explanation is more valid by doing relevant        research. To do this, we usually want to think        about the circumstances under which the competing        theories suggest that something in the world should look        or work differently.                       To summarize, the analytical task involves (1) identifying       three primary, explanatory problems relating gender       inequality and economic organization, providing a careful       description for each of those explanatory problems, stating       why it is important, (2) for one explanatory problem,       exploring competing explanations that could solve the       problem, and describing a research design that could,       hypothetically, discover which explanation is better.

X. What role does ideology play in    determining the relations between men and women?     Ideology is near the center of almost all   efforts to explain gender inequalities. People's conceptions of   masculinity and femininity, ideas concerning the fairness of differential   treatment or expectations of women and men, internalized schema that   evoke different judgments of women's and men's actions, rules about proper   male and female behavior applied to children \u2013 all these and more concern the   influence of ideology on gender identities, differential treatment of women   and men, and the organization and persistence of gender inequality.    Conversely, each ideological belief that symbolizes, legitimates, invokes,   guides, induces, or helps sustain gender inequality is itself a product of   gender inequality. To untangle these complex causal interdependencies,   we must always attend carefully to two kinds of distinctions. First,   we must consistently recognize differences in levels of social organization,   including, among others, societal structures and culture, organizations,   social networks, social processes, and individual actors. While it is   tempting to treat ideological beliefs as diffuse entities unconnected to   identifiable people, organizations, or structures, the analytical results   are poor. Second, we must consistently distinguish between   contemporaneous causes (e.g., the ways that internalized schema can   influence interactions) and asynchronous or historical causes (e.g., the   ways that changes in domestic production induce different ideas about   women's place). Causal arguments about ideology consider it as both an   effect of gender inequality and a cause of gender inequality, although it is   ideology's potential role as a contributing cause that stands out as more   theoretically important.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical problem .      For this week's task, we want to pose an initial analysis of the      relationship between ideology and some aspect of gender      inequality. We want to consider the joint direction of      causal influence for the selected context, how the dynamics of      inequality influences the ideas and how the presence of ideas      influences the understandings and actions of all the relevant      actors.             The aim of       this week's task is to explore the relationship between       beliefs \u2013 ideology \u2013 and some example of inequality. The       goal is to work through the various ways that ideas and       expectations are involved in the causal processes surrounding       gender inequality using the chosen example to do this at a       more concrete level. The purpose of the task       specification that follows is to help you to be systematic       about this.        To begin ,       choose one aspect or component of gender inequality.        This may involve the direct relationships between women and       men or a difference in the opportunities or status available       to women. Examples might be the way that women overall       select less prestigious fields of study than men in college,       that higher education used to be restricted for women, that       women are objects of sex trafficking, that male professional       sports have much higher status, or the different kinds of       restaurants that use male vs. female waiters. You might       try to be a bit creative. It can be helpful to focus your       discussion using a concrete instance of that type of       inequality with which you are familiar.                   Contents of the analysis .       Use this schematic outline as a starting point.             1        Clarify what aspect or component of gender inequality is your       focus.               As always, remember to give the basic characteristics        and principal patterns of the inequality as you understand        it. Among other possibilities, this will normally        include: (1) describe what is unequal; (2) describe what        this inequality looks like, how it is experienced, or how        it has its impact in social life; (3) assess how the        distribution appears or is manifest in the world, how we        would recognize the differences between more or less of        it, and how it is currently distributed).         The goal is to ensure the reader (and you) clearly        understand what inequality is relevant, and what examples        of that inequality you will address.                      2        Describe the principal ideological beliefs or ideas that seem       relevant to the inequality being examined.               While identifying the relevant beliefs is obviously        crucial, it can also be difficult. The range of        potentially relevant beliefs may be very large, so we have        to exercise judgment about which are most important         It may help to distinguish beliefs that motivate         the practice of this aspect of gender inequality from         those that legitimate it.         It is crucial to consider the actions and ideas of both men and women .         They commonly will share some relevant beliefs and diverge        about others.         Consider also whether different beliefs motivate or        legitimate this type of inequality in different times,        places, or circumstances. That is, you want to        decide what characteristics of the beliefs connected to        this inequality are fairly consistent across various        concrete instances of this type of inequality and what        sort of beliefs differ across instances. For        example, the beliefs that motivated male resistance to        women entering \"male\" occupations may have varied by the        status of the occupation and by the time period women        began to enter.         Consider the degree of consensus (or dispute) over the        important beliefs. When is the consensus high or        low, what causes it to be high or low, and what difference        does the degree of agreement make? In particular, do        people dispute some aspects of the beliefs relevant to        this type of inequality, such that the dispute affects the        inequality or informs us about it? Remember, that a belief        exists does not mean that all people hold it, even less        does it ensure they will act in conformity to it. The        greater the disagreement about a belief within a group or         category of actors, the less that it can contribute to         consistent responses it decides actions (although this         may not diminish its appeal as a justification).         Beliefs have a variety of other variable characteristics         that can be important to analyzing their significance.         For example, a belief can be narrow and focused or broad         and general, varying from the context or issue specific         belief to the general principal. A belief can be so         salient and closely held that people refer to it all the         time or so insignificant and loosely held that it plays a         role only when forced to the forefront.                      3        Assess the effects of these beliefs.               Consider the social significance or function of beliefs.         The effects of beliefs are generally understood by        comparing them to real or hypothetical alternatives.         Although beliefs exist only by being held by individuals,         we generally want to think of beliefs as cultural         phenomena. The beliefs that concern us are those preserved         and imposed by cultures or acquired as the common effect of         shared or parallel experiences. People are prone to all         kinds of idiosyncratic beliefs, but only shared beliefs         have social effect.         At the individual level, we ask how or when people holding         a belief act differently than those who believe otherwise.         At the social level, we ask how the presence of those         beliefs in a group or circumstance has social consequences         -- such as influencing the structure of organizations, the         prevailing legal system, or direction of historical         changes.         What we identify as important effects will therefore        depend on the selection of those alternative beliefs.         Reasonable alternatives might include: beliefs observed to        exist in more egalitarian (or more unequal) circumstances,        reversal of beliefs about women and men (often implausible        in reality, but potentially clarifying as an imaginary        experiment), the absence of any such beliefs, or the        presence of some reasonable hypothetical alternative         beliefs.         As usual, we want to give some thought to both women and        men, and we want to consider how the effects of the        beliefs might vary depending on the context or other        mediating influences. Typically, we expect to find women         and men share many beliefs, but are sharply divided on        others.         Beliefs can affect judgments, motives, aspirations,        quality of experience, and so forth. Again, deciding        what is important is an analytical judgment. We are trying        to figure out what beliefs really make a difference to the        strength, durability, or form of gender inequality.                      4        Try to explain how the relevant beliefs come to exist and why       they persist.               Thus, for the example of inequality being examined, we         are trying to explain how beliefs or ideas might         arise as a result of the presence of the inequality         that they legitimate and motivate. This is our         central goal, and it is difficult.         It can help to do a hypothetical experiment.         Consider an imaginary circumstance (which might have a        real historical counterpart) where the relevant aspect of        gender inequality did not exist, nor did the related        beliefs \u2013 then at some point in time this type of gender        inequality came into existence. Then try to think        through how ideas would change as a result of the        emergence of this facet of gender inequality.         Consider what issues might arise if this type of        inequality came to exist, but the beliefs still did not,        and how might the response to such issues lead to new        beliefs. Think about both women and men trying to make        sense of the unequal circumstances, and trying to mold the        perception of reality and justice to fit their        circumstances.         To make the analysis more concrete, see if you can        provide evidence or observations about real circumstances        where this type of inequality is minimal (different        cultures, different historical periods, different parts of        society). Assess how the beliefs under minimal        inequality compare to those where it is high.         It is a good idea to consider under what conditions, if        any, would the beliefs associated with a facet of gender         inequality exist without the presence of this facet of        gender inequality. That is, could similar or analogous        beliefs appear with different kinds of inequality or under        conditions of little inequality. The first        possibility is critical, because it suggests beliefs due        to the presence of inequality per se, not dependent on the        type of inequality. The second possibility suggests        the prospect of beliefs hijacked from conditions distinct        from inequality, then converted to some service to        reinforce or challenge inequality.         It is also a good idea to consider how people acquire        the relevant beliefs? Are they part of general        cultural expectations, are the transferred in specific        contexts, or do people generate them from experience        rather than learning them from others?         Finally, ask what happens if some people question or        reject the beliefs? This question applies to both women        and men. The mechanisms to ensure acceptance and        conformity are crucial to the preservation and        effectiveness of beliefs.                      5        Finally, after completing the steps in the analysis above, try       to give an overall assessment about the significance of       ideology to the facet of gender inequality you are       considering.                   Additional Notes              Throughout, be careful to distinguish between empirical        claims and moral claims. Both kinds of beliefs       are important. And they may be confused or overlapping       rather than neatly distinguished in real life. Still,       they are crucially different. Similarly, distinguish       between the explanation of beliefs and the justification        of beliefs.

Today, feminism is both extolled and condemned, often   by people whose orientations toward feminism seem to defy their   interests. Both the popular press and scholarship have devoted a lot   of effort seeking to make sense of people's beliefs about feminism and   equality, but these efforts have done little to reduce the disagreements.          Analytical     Task                 The goal of this task is to explore what young people think      about feminism today and to attempt to explain these beliefs.       As a prelude, you should interview some female and some male      acquaintances about feminism.             Use your own judgment about who to interview and how       many. You are trying to get enough \"data\" to serve as       the basis for your analysis.        Also use your own judgment about how to conduct your       interviews and what to ask. However, at a minimum try to       include: 1) how they would define feminism, 2) what kinds of       the people they know do they consider feminist, 3) what they       think is true about gender inequality/equality today, 4)       whether or not they consider themselves feminist and why, 5)       whether or not they consider themselves committed to gender       equality.                   Based on these interviews and your pre-existing observations,      write a descriptive assessment of young, educated American's      orientation toward feminism.       Prepare a provisional causal analysis of these current attitudes      toward feminism and gender equality in your reference population.      Try to do a reasoned analysis, taking into account the readings      for this topic.       Causal analyses always hinge on the choice of comparison.       Among others, you might consider: 1) the differences between now      and the past, 2) the differences between women and men, 3) the      differences between those who identify as feminist and those who      do not, 3) the difference between people like you and people      unlike you                     Common Readings            Destined for Equality : Women's      Rejection of Subordination      Nancy Burns and Katherine Gallagher. \" Public      Opinion on Gender Issues: The Politics of Equity and Roles .\"     Annual Review of Political Science, 2010, Vol. 13: 425-443       [doi: 10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.040507.142213]      Jo Freeman. \" Political      Organization in the Feminist Movement .\" Acta Sociologica ,     Vol. 18, No. 2/3 (1975), pp. 222-244      Susan E.

How have political    processes and structures sustained men's and women's relative status?     As structure and as actor, the state has been   unavoidably central to ongoing practice of gender inequality, to its   persistence, and to changes in the form and amount of gender inequality.     States or governments have power. Through the   military and police, a state can enforce conformity to its rules, repel and   punish challenges from the scale of individual acts to collective   rebellions, and by threat, implicit or explicit, deter rebellions from   appearing. Through the law, regulations, and bureaucratic policies, a state   can define what constitutes acceptable or legitimate behavior at all levels   of social organization. Through economic policies of taxation, expenditures,   and redistributions (such as welfare policies or agricultural supports), a   state influences the relative economic status of different groups.     By acting differently toward groups with   regard to any of these aspects of government power, a state can create,   reinforce, or exacerbate social inequalities. Analogously, a state can, in   theory, obstruct, destabilize, or diminish social inequality by using its   power in ways that are inconsistent with social inequalities. States   determine, influence, legitimize, and sanction rights and opportunities;   they may do so in more or less egalitarian ways.     When significant, enduring, social inequality   exists, those privileged by that form of inequality will normally have more   influence over the state than do those disadvantaged by the inequality, and   the overall effect of state policies will reinforce the exercise and   persistence of the inequality. A fundamental problem for all state theories   is who or what decides state policies and actions. To some degree, those   \"in\" the state (elected, appointed, hired, or appropriated) make decisions   based on their interests and outlooks as members of the state apparatus. To   some degree, state actors respond to the influence of power brokers outside   the state, such as the economically powerful. In either case, when making   policy or strategic planning decisions, those influencing state actions are   in part responding to what they perceive will be the responses of all actors   in the nation affected by those decisions. States, or the political   actors who comprise the government, also have their own interests, most   notably preserving their power, and these interests are not automatically   consistent with the interests of dominant social groups.     These political processes may support and   enforce gender inequality, passively permit it, or oppose gender inequality   (as is true with any form of social inequality). They may do any combination   of these with respect to different aspects of gender inequality.    Sustaining influence over political processes is a fundamental feature and   goal of socially dominant groups and the long monopoly of men over political   power has both demonstrated and sustained gender inequality. Yet,   government actions have also contributed to the decline of gender inquality   over the past two centuries.          Analytical     Task                 You have been hired by the newly elected President of the United      States (or the analogous top political position in another country      that you prefer to examine). One of the new President\u2019s main      goals for her years in office is to use government power to      improve gender inequality and the status of women. Your job      is to recommend toward what specific goals she should focus her      efforts.       You may recommend new legislation (or the removal of old), new      administrative strategies such as who gets appointed, new      executive policies (for example, rules for the military) that are      within the President\u2019s power without legislation, concerted      efforts to influence public opinion or state level      governance. In short, you can consider the entire range of      actions available to a President.       You should propose at least three distinct initiatives that you      believe could serve this purpose.       Chose the strategy you believe holds the most promise. For      this strategy, you must provide an analytical justification. Your      justification should consider the following:             At what aspects of gender inequality is the policy       aimed?        Include a brief analysis of this inequality that explains       what is unequal, how great is the inequality, who does it       effect, how widely is it recognized, how it has (or has not)       changed over time, and what seem to be the principal causes.        Describe how have government actions (or inaction)       influenced this inequality in the past.        Show why we should expect that it will be easy or hard to       carry out the strategy and how the possible difficulties       reflect the influence or effects of gender inequality.        Explain how the proposed strategy can be expected to       alleviate gender inequality. This explanation should       connect directly to the causal explanation of the inequality       being diminished.                   In short, you should propose several strategies by which a      government could promote greater gender equality, then provide an      analytic appraisal of the strategy you deem best. This      appraisal should stress the causes of relevant facets of gender      inequality, how the proposed strategy will affect that causal      process, and how gender inequality has a causal influence on      government policy that must be countered to implement the      policy. Do not forget to provide a historical context.

XIII. What does the future hold?     Where do we go from here? Predicting the future is the     ultimate challenge for causal analyses. To have any potential to     see into the future, we need a sound and thorough causal theory, one     that can encompass the range of possible influences     simultaneously. We also need to cope with the unpredictable     potential effects of processes and events that are outside the     boundaries of our theories. These are extremely difficult     conditions to meet. But the need to make some sense of the     future weighs on us. Will gender inquality continue to decline,     and greater gender equality spread throughout the world? Are     some aspects of gender inquality particularly resistant to reduction,     and if so why? Could change stagnate? Behind such concerns     are two principal questions. What has caused the long-term     pattern of declining gender inequality? And what has preserved     aspects of gender inequality in the face of these accumulating     changes? Combining the answers to these two questions with an     effort to project the relevant influences into the future, is the     basis for trying to understand the possibilities for the future.      Behind this also lies another analytical question with moral     overtones: what does gender equality really mean?                    Analytical       Task 1                    Select two types of inequality, both       important, one that you believe to be moving toward greater       equality at a relatively high rate, the other that you       believe is moving toward equality at a relatively slow rate       (or is stalled or is moving backwards)               for each of these two types, describe what is the        inequality (how are women and men unequal, which women        and men experience it, how do things differ when this        inequality is high from when it is low)         describe the evidence and logic that suggests one        type is declining relatively quickly and the other        relatively slowly                      Try to explain why the two different rates of movement       toward equality               For each, consider what processes, conditions,        interests, and the like propel the movement toward        greater equality         For each, consider what circumstances, activities,        and the like obstruct the movement toward greater        equality         Try to explain how and why the balance between the        causes propelling greater equality and the causes        sustaining existing inequality differ between the two        types of gender inequality                                                 Analytical       Task 2                    The general       analytical problem . Using two       plausible future scenarios about gender inequality, assess       what processes or conditions will decide which future       alternative comes to pass.        The task has the following main parts               Select two         of three alternatives to use for the analysis: highest        conceivable level of equality, highest possibility of in equality,        most likely conditions. Essentially this means        that we compare the two extreme possibilities, or we        compare what we think most likely with one of the        extreme possibilities.         For each of the two        selected alternatives, give a clear description of what        the expected level of gender inequality means.         How severe will be major components of gender        inequality, how consistent will different aspects of        gender inequality be with each other, how consistent        will these patterns be in society, and so on. (It        might help to look back over the range of topics        covered above.)         The center of the        analysis will be to provide a causal argument about        what causal conditions and sequence of developments         could lead to each of the two alternatives.         To this end, we must consider the full        range of causal influences that we have examined        previously.                      Thinking tools .               To consider any future path, we must make assumptions        about: (1) how far into the future, (2) in what society        and with respect to what social groups, and (3) what        other changes might occur, altering the cultural,        political, and economic environment.                  For our purposes, let us set the future to be         about one and two generations, that is when your         children are your current age, and then when their         children reach a similar age. The key         tradeoff with setting the distance into the future         is simple: the further we go into the future the         more interesting and significant are the social         changes but equally the more obscure become the         realistic possibilities.          Let us focus on our own society as a whole,         referencing distinctive social categories as         needed.          Similarly, let us assume that the cultural,         political, and economic environments are reasonably         stable, with the expectation that existing long         term trends will continue into the future. We         will ignore the potential for significant         structural changes and historical \"shocks\" such as         economic recessions and wars. Of course, the         further we look into the future, the more         speculative and fallible such assumptions become,         but our purpose is not to predict the actual         future.                         Looking forward, the future is always uncertain,        however well we may explain it once it becomes the        past. One way to make the future more amenable to        analysis is to simplify it into what we believe are the        principal alternative futures that matter to us.         Probably the simplest technique it to focus on one        characteristic and consider the most extreme plausible        possibilities.         With this in mind, let us try to analyze the future        of gender inequality by contrasting stark        alternatives. To begin consider three        possibilities:                 First, the highest level of gender equality that         we can imagine. This might be the current         state of inequality, or it might be the highest         level of inequality now seen in any comparable         society, or it might be a much higher level of         inequality. The problem here is to imagine         what is the greatest amount of future inequality we         can          Second, the highest level of gender in equality         that we can imagine.          And, third, the most likely level of gender         inequality that we expect. This could         coincide with either one of the previous, but will         commonly be somewhere between them.                         For deciding the plausibility of any future        circumstances, we want to remember that there are two        kinds of limiting conditions we must consider.         First, functional plausibility ,        asking if that level of inequality is feasible in the        context of what we perceive to be the relevant        surrounding circumstances. For a simple example,        a social custom of leaving all property to sons is        largely unworkable in a society with a low reproduction        rate because so many families have no sons.         Second, transition        plausibility , asking if a conceivable        historical path of development could lead from present        circumstances to the future scenario. For a        simple example, it might be possible to conceive how        American society could have functioned with full gender        equality in 1900, but it would extremely difficult to        suggest any plausible way that condition could have        emerged under any conceivable historical sequence from        the social organization of American society in 1850.                              Bringing it together . Our goal here is       not to predict the future of gender inequality, but to       examine what sequence of causal conditions seem likely determinants       of that future. We are trying to discover defensible       \" if, then \" arguments. To do this, we are       starting by imagining possible futures, then working       backwards from them to find paths from the present to those       futures, then asserting what else must occur for those       paths to materialize. We should not forget, there may       be more than one path to an imagined future and more than       one set of causal conditions that could lead us there.        For each alternative being considered, we want to analyze        why and how it might reasonably occur.        As an optional extra, you can offer an analysis of which        alternative seems more likely and why.

How have women's and     men's actions obstructed or furthered change, taking into account     the changing institutional context?       Both women and men    have acted in every possible way towards gender inequality. What    we want to understand are the circumstances in which they predictably    act in ways that either reinforce or erode inequality. People's    actions are complex results of their interests, ideologies,    circumstances, opportunities, and constraints. While theories of    gender inequality invoke all kinds of abstract causal processes, in real    life inequality is sustained and changed by the actions of women and    men. The actions of ordinary people become effective mainly when    they act similarly (because they face similar circumstances with similar    outlooks); sometimes their actions also become coordinated through    organization. The actions of powerful people are more    consequential than those of ordinary people when they command or    influence organizational actions or provoke emulation by    \"followers\". Even unique political actions may have great effect    by altering laws, policies, or the balance of power, although even in    these cases the institutionalization of changes generally depends on    dispersed acceptance; in the economic realm, even organizational actions    typically become effective only when multiple organizations pursue    parallel policies (governmental controls over an economy would be an    exception).           Analytical      Task                  The goal of this task is to       examine why some of men's actions worked against gender       inequality while others sustained it, and similarly why       women's actions also included ones that challenged gender       inequality and others that reinforced it. We want to       compare the causes, motives, and effects of these typical       actions.               \"Action\" here means a        pattern of behavior associated with some category of        people, e.g. the tendency to take or not take advantage of        educational opportunities by women of some type in some        period. The relevant actions are those that were one        typical result either of being either in certain enduring        categories of women or men (for example, single women with        higher education) or in certain recurring circumstances        (for example, married women whose husbands lost their jobs        for long periods). The category could include all        women or all men.        To say that actions        reinforce gender inequality means that they either bolster        the stability of gender inequality or help to make it more        severe; alternatively, if those actions became rare        and were not replaced by alternative actions with        similar effects, then either the degree of gender        inequality experienced by some people would decline or the        persistence of gender inequality would become more        problematic. (by the identified group in the        identified conditions)        Analogously, to say that        actions challenge gender inequality means that those        actions, if taken by enough people, result in reducing the        amount of gender inequality or they erode the stability of        gender inequality making it more vulnerable to future        challenges.                    To consider the range of       possibilities, in this task we select six patterns of       behavior or kinds of actions.               Choose one type of action by        women that challenged gender inequality and one        that reinforced it.        Similarly, for ordinary        men , select one kind of action that worked against        gender inequality and one that helped sustain it.        Finally, do the same for men        with power .                    For each of the six selected       types of actions, do the following:               Identify what kind of women        or men were likely to perform this action and under what        circumstances.        Describe the action,        including an assessment of its effects on gender        inequality. This may include consideration of        reasons why its effects might vary (e.g., the number        acting might have to surpass a threshold before there are        widespread effects, the effects might be contingent on        other conditions, the effects might happen after a delay,        and so on).        Try to specify the reasons        why this type of action occurred. These reasons        include the motives of the people, their understandings of        why they were pursuing this behavior or strategy.         The reasons also include the social and cultural        conditions that induce the actions and make them seem        necessary, sensible, and just. The reasons may also        include triggering events.                    To summarize: Pick six kinds of       behavior that have made a difference to the persistence of       gender inequality, one reinforcing and one challenging for       each of the three categories: women, ordinary men, powerful       men. Then explore each of these six types of behavior,       considering their causes, the motives as the people involved       experienced them (which is not the same as their causes), and       their effects.

How do the media    influence or reflect gender inequality?     Commentators often point toward media influence when   they try to explain contemporary gender inequality. Theories of media alert    us that we must always consider reciprocal causal processes. While any    individual may appear only to be the object of media influence, the content    and impact of media depend greatly on the existing culture and social    structure. The relationship of the media to the collective market effect of    consumers may be compared to the relationship between elected public officials    and voters. Also, consumers have considerable freedom to choose which media    outlets to give their attention and people selectively interpret and judge    the media to which they are exposed. All of this makes the relationship    between what is portrayed in the media and what occur in the \"real\" world    rather complex.          Analytical     Task                 Select one kind of popular/mass media, such as magazines or the      cinema, or, alternatively, a form of popular culture thought to      have an analogous impact, such as popular music.       Prepare a simple comparative analysis of current examples to      examples from around 1980, a third of a century ago.             Choose a small, reasonable sample from the two       periods. For example, the samples might be       advertisements from three magazines present in both periods,       or the female and male protagonists of top earning movies, or       the lyrics of the highest rated songs.        Using the dimensions or characteristics identified in the       readings, (or analogous ones that better fit the media you are       assessing), characterize the differences in the ways women and       men are portrayed in the two periods.                   Given the results of your comparisons, show how the data you      observe might be explained by (1) theories stressing the influence      of the media on gender expectations, evaluations, and behavior, or      (2) theories stressing the media as reflecting gender inequality,      or (3) theories stressing market segmentation (audiences choose      among media offerings and media makers aim at audience segments.       Prepare a simple, reasonable response to the questions, \"What is      the basic causal relationship between mass media and gender       inequality?\" and \"How      is the correspondence between media portrayals and real-life      gender inequality sustained over time as gender inequality changes?

How have political     processes and structures sustained men's and women's relative     status? [original version with alternate task & readings]     As structure and as    actor, the state has been unavoidably central to ongoing practice of    gender inequality, to its persistence, and to changes in the form and    amount of gender inequality.      States or governments have power. Through the    military and police, a state can enforce conformity to its rules, repel    and punish challenges from the scale of individual acts to collective    rebellions, and by threat, implicit or explicit, deter rebellions from    appearing. Through the law, regulations, and bureaucratic policies, a    state can define what constitutes acceptable or legitimate behavior at    all levels of social organization. Through economic policies of    taxation, expenditures, and redistributions (such as welfare policies or    agricultural supports), a state influences the relative economic status    of different groups.      By acting differently toward groups with regard to    any of these aspects of government power, a state can create, reinforce,    or exacerbate social inequalities. Analogously, a state can, in theory,    obstruct, destabilize, or diminish social inequality by using its power    in ways that are inconsistent with social inequalities. States    determine, influence, legitimize, and sanction rights and opportunities;    they may do so in more or less egalitarian ways.      When significant, enduring, social inequality    exists, those privileged by that form of inequality will normally have    more influence over the state than do those disadvantaged by the    inequality, and the overall effect of state policies will reinforce the    exercise and persistence of the inequality. A fundamental problem for    all state theories is who or what decides state policies and actions. To    some degree, those \"in\" the state (elected, appointed, hired, or    appropriated) make decisions based on their interests and outlooks as    members of the state apparatus. To some degree, state actors respond to    the influence of power brokers outside the state, such as the    economically powerful. In either case, when making policy or strategic    planning decisions, those influencing state actions are in part    responding to what they perceive will be the responses of all actors in    the nation affected by those decisions.           Analytical      Task                   Task summary: Assess the most       important ways the American state (or some other) has       influenced and been influenced by gender inequality over the       past two hundred years. Try to keep in mind that this       always concerns the accumulation and exercise of social power.              What are the crucial ways that       government reflected gender inequality?                Consider how and why the        state treated women and men differently         Consider ways that the        state helped gender inequality operate smoothly         Consider how the state        helped gender inequality to persist                     How and why has the state       promoted gender equality by reducing the differences in its       treatment of women? How has the state How and why has       the state made it difficult (and irrational) for many to       continue practices that disadvantage women?        How and why have the relevant       government actions changed over time?         While developing the analysis       for this task, it can be helpful to examine how the       relationship between the state and gender inequality resembled       or differed from the state's relationships to other kinds of       inequality.

Table of Contents                               Note: \u2013 This web site is both a subject reading guide and     a course outline. The contents are always in     progress...           This guide serves to provide both a guided, extended reading list     on analyzing social inequality (or stratification) and the syllabus     for a graduate course based on the core of this extended reading     list (over 200 articles are included below). The selection and     organization of materials stresses primary analytical issues facing     the study of inequality (rather than types of inequality or the     popularity of topics).            Most of the readings \u2013 mainly articles plus some book excerpts \u2013      are available online. The list includes direct links to the online      versions of all these references. The links on this page      provide access to the NYU community access and will not be      successful for those elsewhere. However, this entire page is      mirrored with an externally      oriented version ( click      here for the external version ) that is the same as this      except that it uses generic links. Anyone having access to      online scholarly publications through their institutions should be      able to gain access to the articles using the links on that page.

Description \u2013 Scope, Organization, and Access    :      The     scope of the topics and materials . Each kind of    social inequality \u2013 such as class or gender \u2013 has distinctive dynamics and    each concrete instance of inequality has historically and culturally    specific characteristics. Yet, all social inequalities also share    critical common effects and requirements for persistence. For    example, all social inequalities produce legitimating ideologies, all    must curb resistance, all have to transfer the unequal resources and    positions to new generations, all produce divergent interests. To    understand a structural characteristic of some kind of inequality \u2013 such    as legitimation processes in a class system or violence in gender    inequality \u2013 we want to recognize that they represent a combination of the    dynamics common to most inequality systems and the specific    characteristics of that type of inequality. The topics below    pursue a series of fundamental questions about social inequalities,    seeking to investigate the general dynamics of inequalities, comparing    these dynamics across different types of inequality. Examples of    these topics include: what are the roles of interests in various kinds    of inequalities, how is inequality sustained across generations, what    processes induce conformity among both the advantaged and disadvantaged,    what mechanisms prevent rebellion, and what decides the intensity of    inequalities?     The readings represent the core of the stratification field in    sociology, the materials that sociologists working in this area expect    other others in the area to know, plus materials needed to pursue    important analytic issues under represented in the field.      The class     organization and goals . The class is intended for both    beginning and advanced graduate students. Critical    requirements for taking this course are a strong interest in inequality    and a commitment to the class project of investigating new ideas.     In this class, each week's activities will be organized around an    analytical task, as well as a set of readings. Rather than    focusing on discussion of the readings, the analytical tasks involve    attempting an analysis of inequality related to the week's issue,    building on the materials we read (in brief papers of 2-3 pages).     While mastering the existing research and theory is obviously a    prerequisite to doing good work, the approach in this class seeks to    develop analytical skills as well as understandings of the literature by    stressing actual analyses of inequality rather discussions of the    literature.     The course readings stress the foundational sociological literature on    inequality. Each week we will all look at some common    readings. The course guide will also point toward a range of other    recommended and related readings for further study for each topic -    students are not expected to read these optional materials as part of    the course. The recommended and related readings represent what a    student seeking to specialize in this area might read. Students in the    class are encouraged to scan these optional lists each week and look at    any pieces that seem particularly valuable or interesting.     All class meetings are organized as discussions. Part of our    class discussions will be on the common readings and part on students'    efforts to explore the analytical tasks each week. We will    adjust the time devoted to these two goals according to our experiences    over the class. Every week, students will initiate discussions on    readings and papers.

For convenience, some readings are selections (excerpts from articles or    books) that appear in two printed collections that are now available    online: articles with \"[Grusky \u2013 Classic]\" appended to the listing are    from Inequality: Classic Readings in Race, Class, &amp; Gender ,    2006, eds. David B. Grusky and Szonja Szel\u00e8nyi; articles with \"[Grusky -    Contemporary]\" appended are from Inequality Reader: Contemporary     &amp; Foundational Readings in Race, Class, &amp; Gender , 2006,    eds. David B. Grusky and Szonja Szel\u00e8nyi \u2013 for most of the selections    from these readers, alternative citations and links are also provided    for the original publication or an appropriate alternative. Note:     Links for all readings will appear in the online version of the course     guide.      A note on the \"hidden\" material     below : Each section of this guide includes \u2013     beside the common readings \u2013 three subsections, one for an analytical     task , one for recommended readings , and one for related     readings . To simplify navigating through the course guide,    only the headings for these subsections are initially visible. The    content of all these subsections are hidden (so that the beginning    appearance of the page is similar to a standard syllabus) until the    viewer clicks on the subsection heading, then its contents will    appear. While this organization is helpful for negotiating the    page most of the time, it can become an obstacle if we want to search    the page (for example, for a particular article) as searches will ignore    the hidden material. To overcome this limitation, it is possible    to show all the hidden sections by clicking the \u00a7 symbol at the top     of the page (and simply reload the page to    collapse all the \"hidden\" sections to their usual look). The table    of contents at the top of the page will still work to aid speedy    navigation to any section.                The Topics         I.

How can we conceive of and talk about social inequality in ways that are    general enough to apply across the range of relevant phenomena, consistent    enough to minimize conceptual ambiguities, and precise enough to be    analytically effective? Inequality is ubiquitous. People are    unequal in every conceivable way in endless circumstances, both immediate    and enduring, by both objective criteria and subjective experience.     So, what counts as social inequality ? Can we characterize it    in ways that let us confidently and impartially assess when there is more    or less of it?          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: What is social inequality ?       We often think that the meaning of social inequality is      self-evident or easy. Perhaps it is when we focus on extreme      versions of the more obvious forms of social inequality, such as      the rich compared to the poor. But, equally, perhaps it is      not when we consider inequalities that are subler or more      complex, such as those based on sexual preference or ethnic      identity or between nations. We want to begin by looking a      little deeper into our conceptualization of social inequalities.       Choose two kinds of inequality . For each kind of      inequality, consider an example showing a high degree of      inequality and another showing equality or a minimal amount of      inequality. Here we are simply trying to conceive a simple 2      x 2 table, showing two kinds of inequality and two levels of      inequality for each kind. This is the simplest design for      doing social analyses, whether that analysis is empirical or      theoretical. (Note: It is fine to use standard, commonly      discussed kinds of inequality, but being original and creative      about kinds of inequality to consider is also good.)       Describe (briefly) how the relevant groups are unequal for      each type. For each of these two kinds of inequality,      try to list the main ways that those affected are      unequal. For now, do not worry about why       such inequality exists. For now we are concerned with what      we mean by inequality, not what causes it. Try to specify      the crucial experiences, opportunities, or other circumstances      that distinguish the beneficiaries of the inequality from those      who are disadvantaged. Consider also the relationships      between the disadvantaged and advantaged, both direct and      indirect. (The idea of \" indirect relationships\"      refers to ways that the advantaged or disadvantaged influence the      circumstances or actions of those who are differently situated      without direct interaction, e.g. by controlling government      policies or creating a culture of fear.) In short, for each      of the two types of inequality, what induces us to call one      example high inequality and another low?       A final question . After working through the      questions above, try to complete a definition sentence beginning \"In      general, social inequality exists when ... .\" The goal      of this sentence is to provide a definition of social inequality      general enough to embrace the range of social inequalities but      also precise enough to distinguish social inequality from its      absence. The implicit strategy is compare what social      inequality means for the two chosen examples, then to try to      identify the common conditions that make them (and other forms)      all merit being called \"social inequality\" (distinguished from the      characteristics specific to certain types of inequality or      concrete historical and cultural conditions). To do this      involves not only the empirical comparison, but the appropriate      conceptual abstraction.       For the ambitious (to develop a       deeper grasp)...              Here are some other issues that you       might integrate into your initial assessment of inequalities               Vantage points . Might       some people (scholars, political actors, others) disagree       that any of the components you identify should really be       considered inequality ? If so, why?        (The goal here is to think through the reasons that people       disagree about what should be called inequality?)        Try to figure out how we might measure         the amount of inequality. Of the ways that you       have listed people being unequal, select which of these       differences seem most important. What might be       reasonable ways to measure each identified facet       of inequality? For each kind of inequality you have       selected an example where inequality is high and another       where it is low. Can you think of a measurement       procedure that will allow one to look at any society or       group and determine if some aspect of inequality is high,       medium, or low? Focus on realistic means that could be       applied in research, that could be used for the same aspects       of inequality when they apply to other kinds of       inequality. Do this only for the two or three facets       of inequality in your examples that seem most decisive.               For each of the two types of       inequality, if we put aside differences in the circumstances       of advantaged and disadvantaged people, what important       differences in social organization distinguish societies (or       other social groupings such as communities or organizations)       where that type of inequality is high from those where it is       low? The goal here is to consider if societies (or       other levels of social organization containing inequality)       that have high levels of some type of inequality       consistently differ from societies that have low levels, in       ways other than the difference in the level of this kind of       inequality.        Most people responding to the       prompts above will think about inequality between kinds of       people. Consider two other important concerns.        First, inequality may be between positions rather than       people (this is a critical concern which we will address       later). Second, inequality may concern \"units\" other       that people, such as families or organizations or nations.                                       Common Readings          David B.

What are common forms of social inequality?     What is the range of social inequalities that we should be addressing?    Pundits, scholars, and ordinary people usually focus on the couple    forms of inequality they experience as most troubling. Contemporary    sociology's sometimes blinkered perspective is reflected in the many    readers and texts on race, class, and gender. The range of analytically    relevant inequalities is considerably wider.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task : This week's task is to identify      major forms of inequality in two societies. The goal      is to see the range of inequalities that exist in      different societies. The remainder of this task description      just tries to show how to approach this systematically.       To start, choose two societies with which you have some      familiarity. It is fine to use this society or an another      society in which you have lived as one example (but it is an      interesting challenge to use two societies you have not      experienced). The two societies can be from two different      parts of the world or from different points in time. The      main goal is to use two societies that differ significantly in      their structure and culture, regardless whether those differences      reflect location, culture, historical circumstance, or something      else.       For each example (society), identify the significant,      widely-present forms of social inequality that persist      over time.              \"widely present\" means not limited to certain locations nor       small parts of the population; note that many instances of       inequality that are limited to particular places or subgroups       are, however, examples of some more generally defined kind of       inequality, so moving to a higher level of generality or       categorization identifies a widely present inequality of which       they are specific examples        two or more instances of inequality with a similar system or       structure but involving different populations should usually       be considered to of the same kind (e.g., similar ethnic       inequality processes or structures may apply to Hindi and       Chinese minorities)        The aim here is not to see how long the list of inequalities       might be, but we do want to see how diverse the forms of       inequality can be, and to consider if important kinds of       inequality are overlooked.                   Try to describe briefly each form of inequality       identified (for each society), by indicating:             to what degree is the inequality more a continuous gradation       (like years of age) or more a division into distinct       categories (like employed vs. unemployed)        what is unequal, that is what are the assets, opportunities,       capacities, relationships, or whatever that define the       inequality by their unequal distribution (this is not        what explains the inequality, but simply what is       unequal); this is self-evident for some kinds of inequality,       but not for others.        who is advantaged and who disadvantaged; in       essence, this asks how are the advantaged people different       from the disadvantaged people not only in the advantages that       define the inequality, but in other ways as well (e.g. for       ethnic inequalities, the groups are, in theory, defined by       ethnic identity [although ethnicity is tricky]; distinguishing       characteristics for some kinds of inequality might be more       difficult to characterize, and could, in theory, not exist if       placement is random)        [ optional \u2013 how do the disadvantaged and the       advantaged perceive the inequality?; do they have similar or       different conceptions of what is unequal, why they are       disadvantaged or advantaged, whether it is fair, and the       like?]                   In short , for two societies, you are preparing a list      of outstanding inequalities, that gives the primary      characteristics of each kind of inequality. You could make      this either as two lists or as two simple tables.       Finally , having prepared a catalog of the primary forms      of social inequality in the two societies, how would you compare      the two societies with respect to their patterns of social      inequality? All we are looking for here are initial,      outstanding differences and similarities (note that similarities      are at least as important as differences). To be clear, we      are just looking for an initial impression \u2013 a comprehensive      comparison would be a major project, obviously far beyond our      scope.             If this aspect of the analysis seems baffling, overwhelming,       or obscure initially, consider the following questions.        Does the overall amount of inequality seem greater in one       society than the other or similar or does this seem impossible       to guess? Do the structures of the societies or their       potential for change seem to be dominated by different or       similar inequalities? Does inequality overall seem more       rigid in one society than the other? Do major forms of       inequality seem to overlap a lot, or are they distinctive and       rather independent from each other? Is inequality more       continuous in one society and more categorical in the       other?                   For the ambitious with time to go       further:              How might we categorize the varied       forms of inequality discerned in the two societies into       groups defined by some notable similarities? For       example, if we have twelve types of inequality initially,       could we usefully fit them into two or three categories that       reflect their similarities (and differences)? Here are       some examples of criteria that might be used to categorize       inequalities:                Consider the processes        producing them         Consider who is advantaged and        disadvantaged         Consider how one form affects        the others         Consider their legitimacy claims                 Consider their histories                 Consider any other reasonable        logic you can conceive for grouping them, remembering        that a useful analytic taxonomy will usually rely on        some aspect of causation                      Do any of the forms of social       inequality seem more important to the structure and       organizational dynamics of a society than do others?        If so, why?

IV. What distinguishes legitimate from illegitimate    forms of inequality?     We often use the term inequality to refer only to forms of    inequality we consider unjust or otherwise undesirable. Yet, much    inequality is commonly accepted as appropriate, fair, or desirable in    societies. The amount of legitimacy attributed to a form of    inequality can be anywhere between extremely high (e.g. the authority of    parents over infants) to extremely low (e.g., slavery in a modern society    with well-developed civil rights). The assessment of    legitimacy should always consider potential differences among    differentially situated groups (e.g., those enjoying advantages in a    system of inequality, those disadvantaged, and those relatively    unaffected), and the degree of agreement or disagreement about legitimacy    assessments. Analytically, we want to ask what processes or    conditions cause a form of inequality to be considered more or less    legitimate. When does the legitimacy status of inequality change or    become contested?          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task : Using examples of two kinds of      inequality, consider what circumstances appear to foster or to      erode the acceptance of the inequality as legitimate.       First , select two kinds of inequality .       These can be from any place or time, but it might be simpler if      they coexist in the same society. They do not need to be      inequalities considered socially \"important.\" For each       kind of inequality, select one example or circumstance with      high \"legitimacy\" when those involved appear accepting or      complacent and another example or circumstance with      low \"legitimacy\" when those involved contest the      inequality. Thus you are considering four examples in all,      two that are uncontested, high legitimacy and two that are      contested, low legitimacy, based on the two types of      inequality. This is, once again, the simplest comparative      design for social analysis, essentially a two by two table, with      one direction being the two kinds of inequality and the other      being the two levels of legitimacy. (Whether an inequality      is perceived as legitimate and whether it is contested are not the      same, but we are simplifying for our current goals.)       Second , for each of the two kinds of inequality,      describe what are the principal arguments or claims offered       by the advantaged (or their representatives) to defend or      explain the system of inequality in the examples you have      chosen.              Look for arguments that respond to three common claims in       defense of inequality, that it is (1) just, (2)       necessary, and (3) beneficial to all.        Where possible, identify the general cultural beliefs or       symbols from which the arguments seek to gain acceptance or       weight, such as religious beliefs, science, or fear of       outsiders.                    Is it possible to distinguish between claims that seem to be       historically or culturally contingent and those more       fundamental to the particular kind of inequality?        [Explanatory note: If we compare organized religions we find       that all have practices and rituals for marriage. Many       of the specific rituals are artifacts of the historical       conditions in which they emerged, and would just as       effectively if they were different. Some aspects of       these practices, such as significant property exchanges (e.g.,       bride price) may reflect functional needs of the prevailing       economic and kinship system, although their concrete       manifestation can vary. Some even more general aspects,       such as requirement of marriage to identify kinship       relationships of children may reflect fundamental requirements       for the functional order of any kinship system. Claims       about inequality can similarly be categorized from the       historically arbitrary to those that seem unavoidable.]                   Third , when describing the legitimacy claims, consider      if the claims when the inequality is contested differ from      when its acceptance is largely unproblematic. That is, for each of      the two kinds of inequality, what seems to distinguish the      examples where legitimacy claims succeed from those where they      fail?             When the disadvantaged seem to accept legitimacy claims,       which arguments appear to be convincing or acceptable to       them? Why do they accept these?        When the disadvantaged question and contest the legitimacy       of the inequality, what are the principal counter arguments       they use? Their counter arguments suggest how the       legitimacy claims are failing.                   In short , you are developing a description of the ways      that people try to legitimate two kinds of inequalities, comparing      examples where the legitimacy efforts succeed with examples where      they do not. The goal is not to explain the range of these      claims or when they succeed, but to get a first level sense of      what legitimacy claims are and why they are important.       Finally , in response to the preceding analysis you have      developed of legitimacy claims regarding four examples of      inequality (based on two types of inequality), try to state      three general hypotheses about legitimacy claims, the role      of legitimacy, or conflicts over legitimacy in systems of      inequality. Elaborate each of these hypotheses just enough      that we can understand what they mean and what motivates      them.              These are hypotheses , which means they are not       theories and not claims we can defend. Rather, we can       think of them as informed speculations about what might be       true. They are ideas worth researching or worth thinking       about if trying to develop a theory about the legitimation of       inequality. Essentially, this is asking what ideas       spring to mind as a result of doing the empirical comparisons       in this task.

Down So Long (unpublished      ms.). Disputed      Ideals: Ideologies of Domesticity and Feminist Rebellion                             V. What is the critical distinction between positional    inequality and status inequality?     To put it simply, positional inequality refers to inequalities    between \"positions\" such as the different levels in an organizational    hierarchy (e.g., president, divisional manager, supervisor, clerk).     These locations give their advantages and disadvantages to the people who    circulate through them. Status inequality refers to social    advantages and disadvantages that adhere to categories of people without    regard to the positions they hold (such as race). Grasping the    differences between these two \"types\" of inequality and the relationships    between them is crucial for analytic clarity. (This distinction has    some similarity to the common contrast between achieved status and    ascribed status, but it is analytically different. Our distinction    stresses the way inequality is socially organized while the    achieved/ascribed concepts refer to the ways people acquire a    characteristic.)          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: How do positional and status      inequalities differ and how are those differences important?       Select two examples of positional inequalities and two      examples of status inequalities . The examples may be two      fundamentally different kinds of positional (or status) inequality      or they may be two distinctive instances of the same kind of      inequality appearing in different societies (e.g., racial      inequality in a plantation economy and racial inequality in a      market economy). It will probably be easier to use four      reasonably concrete examples (such as contemporary racial      inequality in Britain). Using more general categories (such      as racial inequality in market economies) is a more ambitious      strategy.             As usual, for each type of inequality, clearly describe who       are the advantaged and the disadvantaged and how they are       unequal.                   Enumerate the characteristics that distinguish the two      examples of positional inequality from the two examples of      status inequality . To put it differently, in what ways are      both examples of positional inequality different from both      examples of status inequality? Examples of things to      consider include (but should not be limited to):             homogeneity of people sharing similar standing (i.e., level       of [dis]advantage)        intergenerational rigidity (likelihood of having same       standing as parents)        ways that people's standing may improve or decline over time              diffuseness of impact on people's lives (i.e., what       proportion of people's time, activities, and relationships are       highly influenced)        legal status and government role in regulating, preserving,       or challenging the inequality        legitimation processes (content of the justifying ideology,       who or what promotes the legitimacy)        historical roots of the inequality structure                   For each difference you identify above between the positional      and status inequalities, please             briefly describe how the positional and status inequalities       seem to differ with respect to this characteristic, and,        if you can, suggest what might explain the difference (or,       to put it differently, suggest why you would expect this       difference to distinguish other examples of status and       positional inequalities).                   In short : We are making an initial effort to      identify general ways that systems of positional inequality differ      from systems of status inequality. The goal is to produce a      list of plausible differences, and to get a first sense of what      form these differences will take and why they appear.             note that we are again using a very basic \"research design,\"       comparing two examples of positional inequality with two       examples of status inequality; this is the simplest possible       design for trying to identify differences between two       categories (as we must have at least two examples of each       category to make the simplest control for other sources of       variation among the phenomena being categorized, in this case       instances of social inequality)                   Finally : Based on the differences you enumerate and      explore from your examples, what hypotheses do you have about      general differences between positional and status inequalities?

VI. How do we understand \"honor\" status hierarchies,    that lack apparent material bases?     Academia is one good example of a well-developed system (or systems) of    honorific inequality. High school peer groups are often good    examples of short-lived patterns of reputational inequality. The    idea of celebrity is usually associated with unequal prestige. The    key to honorific inequalities is that people compete for recognition and    deference, rather than material goods, power, or opportunities.     Purely honorific inequality structures are rare, as the pursuit of    prestige is commonly intermingled with materialistic inequities. The study    of honor and prestige systems (other than in the specialized form of    occupational prestige) is underdeveloped in sociology. Theoretical    works recognize its significance, but most treat honorific inequality as    both causally derivative and of marginal importance when compared to    economic and political inequalities. While prestige and honor are    elusively intangible, we are likely to misunderstand any type of    inequality if they are ignored.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: What do non-material      inequalities of honor or prestige look like in practice and what      is the logic of their processes?       Select two (or more) examples of honorific inequality      systems , where people \"compete\" directly for recognition,      respect, and deference. Such systems often include income and      power rewards. But we are looking for forms of inequality      where honorific status is central. Here are several      reasonable identifying characteristics to consider:             Does honor (or prestige or the like) motivate competition       for desirable locations as much as does power or material       rewards?        Is deference to others determined as much by their perceived       prestige as by their structural position, wealth, authority,       or the like?        In general, are honor or prestige acts at least as much a       cause of material rewards as it is a result of them?                   For each inequality system selected , try to      develop an analytical assessment of the way it works by responding      to these:             Identify and describe as well as you can what       conveys or is experienced as honor ; consider how it       looks both from within and from outside; think about ways that       the lives of those with more honor differ from the lives of       those with less; also, think about how we know which people       have more honor, or to put it differently, how we know to whom       we should defer and who should defer to us. (Think about       titles, awards, forms of dress, access to activities, and so       forth.)        Describe what people do to gain honor or to compete       for honor.        What decides the distribution of honor overall       within each system? Consider what processes and which       people decide who has more honor. Is it controlled from       the top or the bottom? Are people aware who decides the       outcomes?        What induces people to accept and conform        to the expectations of the prestige system? Why do they       defer to those who possess more honor? (Consider both       the carrots and the sticks.)                   Compare these systems of honor and prestige to       the systems of positional and status inequality we have      considered. Try to identify two or more important      differences and two or more important similarities,      explaining as best you can why you think each of these differences      and similarities exist.       In short , the aim of this week's task is to compare two      specific examples of honor inequality systems (and secondarily      compare them to inequalities where honor is secondary) to get an      initial sense of how honor inequality systems work.

How do people experience inequality and why do    these experiences matter?     Research on inequalities commonly treats experience as a simple effect    of inequality; interesting but secondary to theory and explanation.     Here we want to think of experience not only as a result, but also as a    potential ingredient to the explanation of inequalities. The    experiences of inequalities can serve as strong motivating forces at all    levels. The experiences also encompass not only the outcomes of    inequality, but all the processes that sustain or challenge it.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: How do lower-status and      higher-status people experience inequalities and their locations      within them? With what consequences for the systems of      inequality?       Select two systems of inequality : one in which      you have (now or in the past) been in a relatively low-status      location and another system in which you have been in a relatively      high-status location. The point here is to select systems in      which you have observational knowledge about the experience of      inequality. If possible, use a form of positional inequality      for one example and status inequality for the other, but it okay      if that is too much of a stretch given your biography.              As usual, briefly describe each system of inequality.        Who are included, what is unequally distributed, who are       advantaged or disadvantaged, and the like. If you are       going to consider a subset of a larger system of inequality,       be clear about what you are doing and why.        (OPTIONAL \u2013 To go further ... To       seek a more complete means of assessing experience, double       the examples, to consider two systems in which you have       experienced low standing and two in which you have had       higher standing, again representing both status inequality       and positional inequality if possible. This will give       you much more traction for seeing generalization       possibilities, but the time requirements may be more than       you can manage.)                   For each of these systems of inequality, try to characterize ,      briefly, how those in      high-status locations have different experiences than those in      low-status locations . This is not easy to do      well. Among other things, note that it is rarely obvious      which kinds of experiences matter more and it is difficult to      reduce the varieties of experience into a few categories that are      not arbitrary.       Focus on typ ical or defining       experiences. While experience seems inherently      individualistic because it is to such a degree private and      internal, the goal here is to move beyond the individual.       Systems of social inequality are comprised of socially organized      \"structures,\" processes, and cultural understandings. In the      search of a social analysis of inequality, we are looking for      common or shared experiences (understanding that these may be      shared unequally, so that there are alternative experiences common      to subgroups determined by other conditions, circumstance, or even      random variation). A good way to start is by thinking about      typical experience.       To make this effort more systematic and comparable, while trying      to assess differences in experience, here are dimensions you      might consider :             How much and in what ways do people recognize the inequality       and think about it? For example, people may                grasp the outlines of social inequality between groups        or positions         see themselves as being in unequal relationships, but        not have a conception of this as part of a larger pattern        of inequality (e.g., when women or men see themselves as        superior or inferior to the other sex, but do not perceive        there to be gender inequality)         people may not be able to conceptualize their experience        of an inequality as being inequality, but think of it in        different terms (e.g., believing it is not that \"they\" are        inferior or that \"we\" discriminate against \"them,\" \"they\"        are just different)                      in what way do people seem to perceive or talk about       fairness with respect to an inequality?               what sense of fairness do they have in their own        position?         and how do they think about the fairness of the        existence of inequality (of this sort)?                      how do the advantaged and disadvantaged have distinctive       experiences about what other people who share their standing       are like?               do the reference groups have different demographic        compositions (e.g. sex, ethnicity, age, class) apart from        the defining distinctions due to that inequality?         are their cultural differences in the ways people dress,        ways of talking, leisure activities, religiosity, or the        like?                      how do people perceive those at their level as different       from those at the other end of the inequality spectrum, and       how do they interact differently with them?               In particular, what, if any, are the common patterns of        deference when interacting with a previously unknown        person at the other end of the inequality spectrum?        (Most importantly, presumably, within the        institutional context embracing this form of inequality,        but also, potentially, in external contexts.)                      How do advantaged and disadvantaged people differ in general       ways that they experience the possibilities and realities of       life?               how do people experience ambition vs.        resignation?;         how do they differ in expectations for the future?         do they allocate blame for failures and credit for        successes (of the individual) differently?         do they have different orientations toward behavioral        tendencies such as violence, intimidation, manipulation,        cooperation, and subservience?         are there significant differences in religiosity?         do they seem to feel different loyalties toward the        institution surrounding the structure of inequality,        toward those in a similar location in the inequality        structure, toward those at a different level?         how do they differ in their trust in authority and        government?                      If you can, consider the implications of social mobility or       changing social standing for these experiences of       inequalities. That is, do people differ in their       experience of a location in a system of inequality depending       on how they got there?                Note that even people distinguished by locations in a        system of status inequalities may experience some form of        mobility. First, they may experience a shift in the        relative weight of the status inequality due to changes in        other status investing characteristics; an example        could be different meaning of race for affluent        blacks vs. poor blacks and affluent whites vs. poor        whites, where the analytical class difference may be        experience in terms of race. Second, the standing of        an entire status group or category may change over time;        consider, for example, the changes that have been seen by        middle-age blacks and whites in South Africa or women and        men in many countries.         Note that someone whose status appears unchanged may        experience it differently because the statuses of        significant others do change                      How do people differ in their experiences of being       advantaged or disadvantaged in the referent form of inequality       depending on their location in other important forms of       inequality? (For example, how does the experience of       being Native American differ between the highly educated and       the low educated?)                   In short , the goal of this task is to contrast the      experiences of being advantaged with those of being disadvantaged      under two different kinds of inequality. The goal is to      examine these differences systematically, and to consider their      causes and their consequences.       Finally , after completing work on the issues above,      considering the patterns of similarities and dissimilarities you      have discussed, can you devise any general hypotheses about the      experience of inequalities? That is, from the specific      patterns of differences you observe in your cases, what general      differences might you expect to find in other inequalities, in the      experiences of inequality, and in the causes and effects of those      experiences?

How should we conceive interests in the    analysis of inequality?     Almost everyone analyzing any system of inequality refers    to \"interests\" sooner or later, even authors who emphasize cultural    or normative explanations. Yet, interests usually receive casual,    unsystematic treatment. This casual reliance on interests builds on    two simple assumptions: (1) a range of relevant potential actions and    events will have differential consequences for people depending on their    location in a system of inequality and (2) anticipation or past    experiences of these consequences will influence peoples' actions.     From this starting point the considerations of interests take many routes,    considering objective and subjective interests, individual versus    collective interests, realistic compared to misconceived interests,    consistent versus inconsistent interests, contradictory and ambiguous    interests, and so on. Simply put, every theory of inequality relies    on a theory of interests (even if a negative theory).          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Interests       Select two examples of inequality; if possible, use one example      of positional inequality and one of status inequality.             Characterize who are the advantaged and who are the       disadvantaged in each example        As always, specify clearly what is unequal        If an example is not itself a system of inequality, but a       subsystem, a site where the effects of a system of inequality       are played out, or an intersection between systems of       inequality, then be clear what the relevant system or systems       of inequality might be                   For each example, examine the interests that seem to be      determined by the social organization of inequality, regardless      how people recognize them.             List the most important ways that the \"objective\" interests       of the advantaged are at odds with those of the       disadvantaged; here the objective interests means the       interests implied by the structure of inequality and their       location within this structure, regardless of their       recognition of the interests        Similarly, list the most important ways that the \"objective\"       interests of advantaged people or groups converge with       those of the disadvantaged. Here we are concerned with       interests related to conditions or practices that have a       widespread influence, usually where both the advantaged and       disadvantaged are exposed to common effects. For example,       potentially a shared interest between officials of an       autocratic government and the citizenry in maintaining public       peace would be relevant, but parallel or similar interests in       being healthy would not. Similarly, the employers and       workers in a corporation may have divided interests about the       distribution of the company's income, but they have convergent       interests in the corporation being successful.        For the above assessments, both the interests at odds and       those that converge, consider whether the objective interests       seem try to characterize the most important interests in terms       of their clarity, consistency, extremity, and the like.        thinking about objective interests not as an individual       experiences them, but as they are produced and sustained by       the systems of inequality, how would you ?                   Now, a really tough part. As best you can, with these      examples, consider how interests become recognized or conceived       by people who are subject to the interest-producing circumstances      of inequality.               We want to avoid the temptation to think about this in terms       of the reasons an individual might choose one way or       another. Instead, we want to examine how the       characteristics of objective interests or the structure of the       relevant inequality induces people to interpret their       interests in one way or another. We are seeking the       social conditions or dynamics that direct the conception of       interests.        Note to begin that people may conceive their interests as       some subset of the objective interests previously identified,       or they may rely on conceptions that ignore or even oppose the       objective interests.        What institutional and cultural processes or arrangements       seem to influence the emergence of common interests based on       the inequalities in your examples? E.g., the aged       or young adults may have a strong, self-conscious sense of       common interests under some circumstances but at other times       not recognize possible shared interests.; what determines when       they do see their concerns as common interests? Given       the objective interests you have identified, think under what       conditions you would expect people more likely to identify and       pursue each of those objective interests as opposed to the       conditions under which they would not do so. Similarly,       consider under what conditions people might be prone to       misinterpret their interests entirely. Or, under what       conditions they are more likely to stress oppositional       interests and under what conditions they will emphasize the       interests they have in common with those with whom they are       unequal?        For each example, in what important ways and under what       circumstances do people's conceived interests seem to diverge       from their objective interests? (A classic example       occurs when members of a group, such as the working class,       believe their interests are best served by a political party       that is actually committed to policies that threaten their       interests, such as those typically associated with       Republicans.) What seems to account for the       disjunctions? (Consider both the advantaged and the       disadvantaged.)                   For the inequalities you are using, when and where do individual      interests seem to contradict collective interests? What      consequences does this have? (E.g., it is generally      in students' collective interest that professors grade all      students the same way, but tall, pretty boys have individual      interests in biased grading if professors favor tall, pretty      boys.)       In short , the goal here is to develop some initial      ideas about the ways that interests work. We use two      examples as the simplest design that allows us to begin      generalizing about inequality, rather than describing the      character of a single instance. Using the chosen examples,      we want to produce some initial ideas about the range of objective      interests, both oppositional and shared, created by an inequality      system. Then we want to ask how people's conceptions of      their interests arise out of those objective interests in      interaction with impinging social conditions. And, in      particular we want to consider how and why conceived interests      might diverge from or even become inconsistent with objective      interests.

IX. What determines the allocation of people (or    other relevant unit) within a positional system of inequality?     This issue includes questions commonly addressed in the literatures    on social mobility and status attainment (and on placement within    organizations). More or less independent of its occupants, a system    of positional inequality has a static     \"structure\" characterized by the direct relationships of    authority and dependence between positions ; the ranking of    positions according to the rewards, authority, opportunities, and statuses    attached to them; and the demographic profile defined by the number of    positions of each type. A positional inequality system also has a dynamic     structure defined by the movement of people through it, both    within careers and between generations. These two components of    structure \u2013 the static and the dynamic \u2013 are linked by the selection    processes controlling access to positions. We can usefully conceive    positional inequality as the juxtaposition of two parallel systems that    are often confused or conflated: first, the structure of relationships    among the positions constituting the system of inequality (e.g., the    enduring authority relationship between a managerial position and a    line-worker position), and, second, the relations between the people who    occupy these positions (e.g., the interactions between managers and    workers). The patterns of people's movement between positions both    reflects and influences the relationships among positions, but it also    shows the impact of impinging status inequalities. To understand the    inequalities among people, we obviously need to understand what decides    which people occupy which positions.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: We will explore how positional      inequalities work. Recall that two general examples of positional      inequalities would be the occupational structure of a modern      society or the hierarchy of positions within a complex      organization. Note that, in this analytical context, income      inequality is an effect of positional inequalities;      income inequality is not itself a system of inequality      (involving neither transferable positions nor status groups),      although it functions as both an incentive and consequence of      positional (and status) inequalities. Also note that positional      inequalities are commonly constituted by relatively clear \"local\"      hierarchies that only loosely translate into a societal wide      hierarchy. For example, complex organizations usually have      well-defined positional hierarchies, but their finer distinctions      are organization or industry specific. As a result, people      (both scholars and ordinary people) use common characteristics of      positions \u2013 such as income, authority level, or organizational      size \u2013 to translate \"local\" positional standings into a comparable      metric.       Choose two dissimilar examples of positional inequalities.       Try to choose two that have different institutional settings, are      not closely causally connected to each other, or operate by      different logics. They may coexist in one society or be      drawn from different (in space or time) societies.       For each example, describe the overall structure of      positions. Among other things, an analytical description of      a positional structure should consider the following:             Assess the differential characteristics attached to the       positions (rewards, authority, visibility, etc.)        Summarize and characterize the relationships among       positions.                    Consider the simple demographics of the system: how many       positions exist at each level?; what is the turnover rate of       personnel occupying the positions (the departure rates)?; how       stable is the demographic profile (i.e., do the relative and       absolute numbers remain the same over time)?        If possible to assess, how did the existing configuration of       positions come into existence?                   For each example, try to describe the \"normal\" pathways of      movement into and between positions             What are the typical initial entry points, the positions       that take people who have not previously been in the system of       positional inequality? For example, in a large business       or organization, many positions are typically filled by       promotions from other positions; people are not usually hired       from the outside for such positions. Commonly, a If these entry-point       positions are themselves unequal, also consider                How are the entry points unequal ?         What determines who gets in which ones?         Who controls the allocation process of the initial        positions (directly and indirectly)?                      What is the pattern of movement among positions within the       system?               To what degree does selectivity operate (the demographic        constraint)? (Among other things, this asks what        proportion of people at any given level will ascend to a        higher level.)         Consider if lateral movement among positions is relevant        to hierarchical movement.         Is there significant downward movement as well as upward        in the positional hierarchy? If so, remember        to examine downward as well as upward for all issues about        movement among positions.         What appears to decide who moves up into more desirable        positions (or down)?                  Is the determining process fairly consistent across         positions or does it vary by how high or in what         sector the position appears?          who has decision-making power?          how standardized or impartial are the processes         governing mobility among positions? Note that         impartiality can be the result of self-conscious         efforts to eliminate bias and reliance on         inappropriate criteria, but, alternatively, it also         can be the result of an uncontrolled process that is         inherently unbiased (as some would suggest for market         mechanisms)? Slave traders, for example, may be         just as impartial toward the ethnic divisions among         their chattel as the most progressive advocate of         meritocratic assessments.                                      How is the position-allocation process ideologically       conceived?;                particularly consider ideological constructs that        reinforce, obfuscate, legitimate, or challenge the        allocation process.         how are \"success\" and \"failure\" conceived (as moral and        practical categories)         are there competing ideological formulations of what        causes success and failure?                                 Taking into account all the above, comparing the two examples,      what can you say about the patterns of affiliation, alliance,      deference, patronage, avoidance, opposition, and conflict that      constitute the structure of relationships among people occupying      different locations in a positional inequality? While      exploring this issue, pay careful attention to the distinction      between the positions and the people occupying them.       In short , the goal of this task is to gain some insight      into the ways that positional systems of inequality work.       Using two concrete examples is the simplest possible design for      identifying some of the common characteristics of such      systems. A commonly unanticipated difficulty in analyzing      such systems arises from their duality: a structure of      relationships among the positions independent of the people who      occupy them and the dynamics of relationships among the people who      do occupy the positions.

From those enjoying the most privileged positions to those suffering the    most disadvantages, people may believe that the system of inequality that    divides them reflects the elusively differential favor of the gods, the    cruel fate of nature's uneven treatment, or unavoidable results of    people's differential efforts and capacities. In truth, systems of    inequality require work to keep them going, particularly the efforts of    those in superior positions to preserve the shape of the system and their    positions within it. We cannot hope to grasp the logic of a system    of inequality until we understand what this work is and how it gets done.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Assess how and why advantaged      people (or their agents) act in ways that (1) preserve their      advantages and (2) preserve the system of inequality that gives      them advantages.       Select two examples of inequality to assess the actions of      advantaged people. The first example should concern gender      inequality \u2013 this may be an instance of gender inequality (e.g.,      gender inequality in an organization, or in an occupation, or in a      sport) or it may be gender inequality more generally (although      this may prove more difficult). The second example should be      a different kind of inequality, preferably an example of      positional inequality or alternatively an example of a quite      different form of status inequality.       For each example of inequality, the goal is to identify and      explain the kinds of actions by advantaged people that (1) seem to      occur consistently and (2) seem to reinforce their      advantages. To approach this problem systematically, try to      answer the following about each example of inequality:             How do the advantaged people treat disadvantaged people in       direct interactions; the relevant comparisons are with the       ways the advantaged relate to each other and the ways the       disadvantaged relate to each other?        How do advantaged people have different kinds of       relationships with other advantaged people than than they have       with disadvantaged people (this is similar to the previous,       but concerns the more general problem of relationships        rather than interactions )?        In what ways might common actions or behavioral patterns of       those in the advantaged \"class\" \u2013 actions that use or reflect       their advantaged circumstances \u2013 reinforce the privileges of       advantaged people, even though the actions are not aimed at       disadvantaged people or at sustaining inequality? (For       example, the advantaged might buy all unused land for golf       courses and expansive estates, leaving poor farmers no way to       expand their acreage for crops.)        How do advantaged people respond if one of them is       challenged by a disadvantaged person.                \"Challenges\" can take many forms. A member of a        subordinate group may simply refuse to show \"proper\"        deference, as when a lower caste person does not step        aside, a black woman does not go to her place in the rear        of a bus, or a member of the secretarial pool addresses        managers by their first name just as they do her.         Someone with lower standing may adopt the dress or        mannerisms of those with higher standing, or attempt to        move into their neighborhoods or schools. More        directly, someone with lower standing may reject and defy        efforts to exercise authority by those \"above\" them.         And so forth ....         Consider not only the actions of the person who is        directly challenged, but potential actions by others in        the advantaged class.                      How do advantaged people exercise power in government, over       laws, or in the economy in ways that benefit those with       advantages?        How do advantaged people respond if there is a collective       challenge to the system of inequality in which they have       advantages?                   Looking over the range of actions you identify as relevant      above, can they usefully be categorized? For example, one      might divide them into those that mainly benefit an individual's      status and those that mainly help sustain the system of      inequality. The goal here is to consider if there is an      analytically useful way to reduce the range of relevant actions      and behavior patterns into a small number of general types.       What within the system of inequality seems to organize and      ensure the actions that sustain it? For example, in the      simplest conceivable system of inequality, we might find the only      mechanism is the interests of those in dominance \u2013 they      individually act on those interests in a manner unmediated      by ideology, norms, relationships with others in the dominant      group, laws, organizational processes, or anything else.       More complex systems involve mechanisms that induce these actions,      giving individuals motivation, direction, and support.       Looking at the range of actions identified as relevant, what stand      out as the mechanisms that make such actions consistent and      effective?       What seem to be important limitations on the actions that secure      dominance? How are these actions constrained by laws, norms,      ideology, resources, or the like? What conditions or      potentials for the future might cause the actions to lose      enthusiasm or effectiveness?       In short , this task concerns the ways that inequality      systems induce advantaged groups to act in ways that sustain the      inequality (and their standing within that inequality). Once      again, using two examples is the simplest design to allow initial      speculations about the general functioning of inequality.       The questions above aim to help one to think systematically about      the range of possible actions and their sources.       When analyzing the actions of the advantaged (and      disadvantaged) as described above, keeping several considerations      in mind may help:             The shorthand references here to \"the actions of advantaged       people\" do not imply that all advantaged people act the same       way or that the actions that sustain inequality are produced       in the same way and at the same rate by all the       advantaged. Such actions may be nearly universal, they       may be typical but with a high degree of variation       across people and circumstances, or they may be the special       actions of a minority who are the key representatives of the       group interests.        The analytical focus should be on the processes and       circumstances that induce enough actions of sufficient       effectiveness by enough advantaged people to protect the       inequality system. An individualistic focus on the       motives or beliefs of people will probably go astray.        Note initially that the relevant actions of the advantaged       may differ from those of the disadvantaged in varied ways       other than reflecting divergent interests. For example,       (1) the opportunities to act may differ (e.g. differential       access to higher education), (2) analogous actions may       have different effects, and (3) even with equivalent       opportunities and effects, they may choose to act differently       (e.g. because they have different beliefs or respond to       different interests).

Inequality systems do not only have causes that bring them into    existence and causes that preserve them, they also have causes that    potentially reduce or eliminate them. Systems of inequality    may decline because they are pushed out of the way by new systems of    inequality, because they simply become increasingly ineffective or    irrelevant, because the disadvantaged are increasingly able to overcome    their circumstances as individuals, or because the system is dramatically    overturned by collective actions from below or intrusion from    invaders. How and why these processes dilute, undermine, or    eliminate inequalities is theoretically underdeveloped.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Declining inequalities       Select as example of social inequality, positional or status,      that showed significant reductions in the degree of inequality      over time.              For the selected example of inequality, if it is not a       system of inequality but a component, result, or instance of a       system of inequality, the analysis should include careful       consideration of the system itself.        (Note that inequality may decline in a component as a result       of overall decline in the system, decline in a component may       induce greater inequality in the system, or decline in a       component may take place independently of and without       noticeable impact of the enveloping system.                   In what ways did those involved in the example of inequality      being considered actively promote or resist its      decline?              In our simplest examples, \"those involved\" reduces to the       advantaged group versus the disadvantaged. In real life,       seems can be much more complex. Each system of       inequality may have multiple types of involvement,       distinguished by subtle or ambiguous differences of interests,       relationships and activities. And, systems of inequality       overlap and interact. We want to be sensitive to this       potential complexity, but willing to reduce it conceptually as       far as possible to produce a manageable model.        Note that people may actively promote or resist a change in       inequality for motives that are not focused on the issue of       the inequality's persistence.        The goal here is to characterize the types of people whose       actions tended to reinforce the inequality and those whose       actions tended to erode it. Recall that members of       advantaged groups may join the challengers (against their       putative interests) and members of the disadvantaged may join       the supporters.                   Were any other coexisting systems of inequality declining or      becoming more extreme during the same period? If so, is it      possible to identify causal processes that might connect the      simultaneous changes?       Were there direct clashes over the competing interests of those      advantaged and those disadvantaged by system of inequality that      was declining? If so, what were there causes and their      consequences?       Were there any independent changes in the circumstances of the      advantaged people that plausibly diminished their will or ability      to sustain the pattern of inequality?       Were actors who were not direct participants in the systems of      inequality (i.e. not acting as members of the advantaged or      disadvantaged) significant for promoting or obstructing the      movement toward change? The state is an obvious contender      here, but so are others whose interests or symbolic commitments      seem to be at stake.       Are there other processes, actors, circumstances, or causal      dynamics neglected by the above questions that seem important to      analyzing the changes in inequality in the examples being      considered?       In short , the goal this week is to explore the      conditions and processes that work against the persistence of      inequalities under appropriate structural and historical      circumstances.                    Common Readings          Karl Marx's theories of capitalism and societal transformation,     often simplified as the theory of historical materialism, is a     benchmark of all later theories aiming to explain changing systems     of inequality.

What are the theoretical and empirical    relationships between different forms of inequality?     Multiple systems of inequality coexist in societies, with crosscutting    categories and with individuals simultaneously located in each. An    older tradition in sociology suggested that the degree of overlap between    different forms of inequality was one condition influencing the likelihood    of class formation. A more recent interest has been the    \"intersection\" between race, gender, and class as experienced by    individuals, with the central (largely atheoretical) premise that the    implications of one's status in one system depends on one's statuses in    the others. Our concern here is more at the level of inequality's    organization, asking in what ways different systems of inequality interact    with each other.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Interdependence of inequalities            Select one society and historical moment (or one period, such as      the second half of the 20 th century). Within this      historical context, select two examples of systems of positional      inequality and two examples of systems of status inequality,      chosen such that a significant number of individuals will have a      location within each of the four systems considered. .       Assess in what ways and to what degree an individual's status in      one instance of inequality relates to others. To be systematic,      consider             How standing in one form of positional inequality relates to       standing in the other example of positional inequality        How standing in one instance of status inequality relates to       standing in the other form of status inequality        How standing in the systems of positional inequality relate       to standing in the systems of status inequality                   Assess how the organization and functioning of these systems of      inequality influence or overlap each other. Among other things,      this might include considering             How the \"locations\" in the two examples of positional       inequality are related. Are any locations defined       simultaneously in both systems? Are there enduring       relationships between locations in the two systems that       continue regardless who are in those locations? Are there       sustained patterns of movement between the two systems?        What relationships exist among the the symbolic       representations and ideological legitimation schemes       associated with the forms of inequality being examined?        Are they simply independent?; are they separate but drawing on       some common ideas?; are they partially or wholly merged into       one scheme that serves all at once?        In what ways is persistence of one system of inequality       dependent on its relationship with another? For example, how       might the elimination of any one system of inequality affect       the others.?

What causes inequality?     Perhaps the most fundamental question about inequalities, and sometimes    seeming the most illusive to answer, is the misleadingly simple question,    what causes inequality? While no general, all embracing answer is    possible (at this time), progress in understanding inequality demands that    we continually try to improve our analyses of the causes. Any effort    to do this must consider different forms of causation that are    possible.              Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: We want to investigate what      causes inequalities. Causation is a difficult, often      elusive, concept. What we mean by the causes of inequalities      can take different forms. We can ask why it comes into      existence. This question about origins may concern the      specific historical circumstances or sequence of events in which      an inequality emerges. Or we might interpret original causes      in terms of the social conditions necessary for such inequality to      emerge or, somewhat differently, the social conditions that make      it unavoidable. We might instead ask what causes (or allows)      an inequality to persist over time, potentially distinct from the      reasons for its origin, the conditions and processes that sustain      it. Or, we might focus on the variations in the severity of      some inequality, seeking the key to understanding it in the      conditions that cause it to be great in some places and slight in      others. In either case, we may stress the mechanisms, the      recurring actions and social processes that produce the      inequality, or we may stress the conditions that allow or require      it. Given this expanse of possibilities, we must narrow our      question, to make it reasonable.       Choose two kinds of inequality, each of which varies      considerably in its intensity. For each kind choose one      example that has low inequality and another that has high      inequality. These four examples, two with low inequality to      compare with two having high inequality, will be the basis of the      analysis. These may come from the same historical and      cultural setting or from different ones.             For each kind of inequality, if it is not a system of       inequality but a component, result, or instance of a system of       inequality, the analysis should stress the system.        For example, if we start with two unequal occupations, we       would say that they are in most cases not a system of       inequality but a part of one. So, we could shift our       attention to the system of occupational inequality. Or,       if we begin with the inequality between women and men within       the financial industry, we could move to the general       inequality between the sexes.        In general, an example of inequality that is a component,       result, or instance of a system of inequality may have       particularistic causes that seem sufficient to account for its       contours or variations. However, we expect its existence       is derivative of the relevant system of inequality and that it       and other similar instances that are derivative of the same       system of inequality are all subject to the causal processes       that generate and sustain that system of inequality.        Thus, an effort to identify and make sense of the causal       processes cannot look at the component or instance alone.                   Describe each kind of inequality and the difference between the      higher and lower inequality instances.             As always, describe who are distinguished by the inequality,       and what it is that is unequal.        Specify why we consider the inequality in one instance to be       significantly higher than in the other. This is a       measurement issue on the surface, but commonly has deeper       implications about what the inequality means.                   Comparing the instances of high inequality with those of low      inequality, construct a series of hypotheses about about the      possible causes of high inequality (compared to low      inequality). In some cases these hypotheses may apply to      both kinds of inequality similarly while in others they are quite      different \u2013 try to be clear about this. For each      hypothesis, explain the reasoning behind your speculation.       In attempting to generate hypotheses representing a systematic      analysis, among other things to think about, you might consider:             the origins of each example of inequality (e.g., do the high       and low inequality instances arise from distinctive conditions       that relate to their subsequent intensity)        the history of changes in levels of inequality if applicable       and known (e.g., does knowledge of their varying intensities       over time suggest anything about why or how they differ in the       instances you compare?0        political and legal contexts        ideological and cultural contexts        relationships to other forms of inequality        direct relationships between those advantaged and those       disadvantaged by the inequality        how individuals' statuses are decided        ... Each of the foregoing refer to important aspects of an       inequality system that imply the existence of some causal       process. Looking back over the previous topics we have       examined should give more facets of inequality calling for a       similar causal analysis.                   Moving beyond hypotheses, see which of these more general      questions you can begin to answer.              Consider to what degree the origins, the persistence, or the       severity of the inequality is explained by the outcomes of       self-interested actions of individuals and organizations.        Consider to what degree the origins, the persistence, or the       severity of the inequality is explained by its functional and       structural relationships to important social arrangements or       \"needs.\"        Consider to what degree the origins, the persistence, or the       severity of the inequality is explained by some competitive       processes.        Try to be self-conscious about the comparisons being made,       implicit or explicit, and what alternatives might be possible.              Try not to forget that inequality induces processes,       conditions, and structures that limit resistance's       effectiveness and part of its explanation lies in the ways       this obstruction or resistance works.                   In short , our      analytical goal is to generate ideas about what produces      inequality, by first looking at what seems to explain variations      in the degree of severity of two types of inequality.

XIV. What makes some forms of inequality more    important than others to the organization of social structure and the    patterns of human action?     Some have argued that class dominates in particular societies or all    societies. Others have suggested that gender inequality is the most    fundamental inequality. Putting aside grand claims, most would agree    that some kinds of inequality have greater influence over the organization    of a society (or other social entity) and the history of that    organization. How we can systematically assess the relative    importance of different kinds of inequality and what decides their    differential importance are not clear.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: To be added       Select four kinds of inequality that are widespread within a      society or some other boundaried social context (such as an      organization or social category).       Try to rank these examples of in equality in terms of their      relative importance.             Note that different criteria for \"importance\" can result in       different rankings. One goal is to identify what       criteria for importance make sense for the chosen       examples.        Note that the importance of an inequality may vary by time       period, by type of people, by location in another system of       inequality, and other differentiating conditions.        Thus, a careful assessment will commonly result in a series       of rankings for the relative importance of the inequality       example, with the rankings distinguished by the criteria for       importance used and by the circumstances that mediate the       evaluations for any specific criterion.        To be systematic, one will usually want to rewrite the       analysis of relative importance organized around the       conditioning criteria                   Having assessed the relative importance of the inequality      examples, try to explore what caused the rankings. In the      foregoing, we are focusing on description and measurement.       Here the concern is causality. Above we are trying to      establish why and when we might call one kind of inequality more      important than another, a conceptual and empirical exercise.       Here we are asking what it is about the content, configuration and      history of the inequalities that results in one having more      importance than the other.             One path to answering this question might be to consider       known empirical examples where the relative importance of the       types of inequality being considered have a different ranking       importance.        Another path to answering might be to imagine what it would       take to lower the importance of the higher ranked inequality       or raise the importance of the lower ranked one.

How does resistance by subordinate groups work?     &amp;    People do not enjoy the lower status, fewer rewards, subjection to    authority, and other disadvantages attached to being at the lower end of    a system of inequality. This may result in anything between a    mild, occasional resentment and a continuous, burning hatred with    their fate. Fear, identification with the system, search for    praise from those above, or hope for personal advancement may induce    some to conform as much as possible with the expectations of the    advantaged. Still, wherever inequality exists, resistance    exists.          Analytical      Task                   Analytical task: Resistance       Select two examples of inequality. In each case, how do the      disadvantaged resist?       While identifying resistance, consider &lt;              everyday, commonly repeated actions of the disadvantaged        unusual, more extreme individual actions by some       disadvantaged        collective or organized forms of resistance                    What conditions, rules, processes, and actions limit      resistance? To recognize these obstacles, consider why the      identified forms of resistance are not more common, more      extreme, or more effective?

A system of inequality is a \"system.\" From a functionalist    perspective, its persistence requires mechanisms to ensure conformity to    its rules and expectations, to recruit adequate personnel to sustain    operation, to preserve commitment of those in advantaged statuses and    limit rebellion from others, and so forth. From a structuralist    perspective, it will induce latent conflicts that must be contained, it    will require legitimating ideology, it must enforce unequal effort and    unequal rewards, and so forth. A system of inequality has    structure, it has processes that occur over time, it has mechanisms to    sustain itself. Are there ways we can conceive these elements that    allow us to talk with a common language about the structural logics of    diverse systems of inequality?          Analytical      Task                  Analytical task .       Select and list five or more       distinctive systems of inequality . From each of      the past weeks in this class, select one system of inequality      from the weekly papers . The possibilities from which to      choose includes any system of inequality that appears in any of      the papers for a given week.       As usual, briefly describe each system of inequality.       Who are included, what is unequally distributed, who are      advantaged or disadvantaged, and the like. If you are      going to consider a subset of a larger system of inequality, be      clear about what you are doing and why.

What are general dimensions of inequality systems, by which we can    characterize, compare, and categorize them?     Generally, researchers and theorists treat different kinds of    inequalities as if they existed in distinct and unrelated    conceptual worlds, although they might empirically overlap in concrete    historical settings. Various empirical instances of racial    inequality are compared, as are different instances of income inequality    or organizational hierarchies, but divergent kinds of inequality each    get their own, independent analytic turf. The divisions between    \"kinds\" of inequality are not the result of any systematic logic, but    treated as self-evident, natural distinctions.

[part 2]     Continuing the analysis of interests.          Analytical      Task                   Analytical Task 2 on Interests       Taking into account the insights and concerns developed in the       Common Readings listed below, write a critical review of      Jackson's effort to use interests as a theoretical device and      analytical tool in the studies of class and gender inequality      listed above.                           How      to write a critical review                  Although scholars spend much time and effort writing critiques      of published work, and graduate students spend even more,      systematic treatments of the criteria for, and strategies      toward, good critiques are rare. Here are just a few points to      consider.        A critique can never be better than its author's      understanding of the work being criticized. And a reader      cannot appreciate the intent of the critique beyond their grasp      of the critic's reading of the original work. This means      that to write a good critical review, we must first be sure we      understand what we are criticizing and, second, we must present      a clear summary of that understanding as part of our critique.       Although there are important exceptions, most critical reviews      really are elaborations of the answer to a simple      question. After reading the piece, do I, the critic, find      the argument worthwhile or not? However elaborate or      simple, with whatever style of presentation, the review is      largely an effort to present a sustained defense of that      evaluation.       A good review is always fair. We should never shy from      identifying a flaw or calling a mistake what it is. But we      should always try to use the language and tone that we hope      reviewers will use when they reveal the similar failings in our      work.              We review manuscripts, articles, and books. We do       not review people. Brilliant scholars write dim       papers \u2013 they are not dim as a result. A wise reviewer       avoids referring to the author, and concentrates on the       strengths and weaknesses of the work being reviewed.        For example, saying that \"the arguments in the last and       first sections contradict each other\" is preferable to       saying \"in the last section, the author contradicts what she       said in the first section\". Attributing thoughts and       intentions to an author is worse. Sitting in judgment       of the author's intellect, effort, or morality is       worst.                      As reviewers, we commonly want to be clear about two       interpretations of what has been accomplished in the work       being reviewed: that of the author and that of the       reviewer. Sometimes these will be the same; often not.        A critic has no obligation to share the author's view       of the what has been done in the work. But the       scholarly critic does have an obligation to grasp and       accurately present the author's aims and orientation as they       are conveyed in the work.        When an author sees a review, the author should not feel       (1) the reviewer has said or implied I said something that I       never said or implied or (2) the reviewer has said or       implied that I failed to consider something that is       explicitly part of my presentation.        Good scholars do not mind critical reviews, even highly       critical ones, that are accurate and fair. Good       scholars despise reviews that are inaccurate or unfair, even       if they are positive.                    What a review covers depends on the review's purpose, the      audience, and the content and quality of the work being      reviewed. No possible recipe of ingredients will apply to      all or even most reviews. The closest we can come to this      is to list common elements of reviews, understanding that the      reviewer must judge what weight, if any, each merits in a      particular review. Some of these common elements to      consider in reviews include:              Does the work have a central thesis, argument or claim       that is clear, relatively unambiguous, fully presented,       logically consistent, and not inherently flawed?        Does the work adequately consider alternative arguments?        Does the work provide evidence that effectively supports       the advocated claim over alternative claims?                Is the evidence well chosen, properly gathered, and        effectively analyzed (or is the work methodologically        sound)?         How compelling is the evidence?                       Does the work neglect or misconstrue some relevant       research or theory in ways that raise questions and       significantly diminish confidence in its claims?        Are there serious logical flaws or gaps in the analysis?        Overall, is the argument compelling?        Overall, is the analysis a valuable contribution?        Or, does it have something to say that is worth       saying?                                       Common Readings      Recommended     Readings                  Wikipedia, \" Prisoner's       dilemma \"                      Related     Readings                  ...       ...                                 *. What is the theoretical natural state: is it inequality or    equality that should be explained?     Sometimes a seemingly tangential question has the potential to gain us    unexpected insights. At least since Rousseau wrote the on the    origins of inequality we have been able to conceive that either equality    or inequality may be considered the problem to explain. While    modern sociology attributes little explanatory value to ideas about the    natural state of humankind, we may still hope to enhance our    understanding by juxtaposing efforts to identify the social mechanisms    responsible for inequality with those aimed at specifying the mechanisms    that induce equality.

This is a continuation of the previous week's topic          Analytical      Task                  Analytical task . Rewrite analytical task of      last week.       While rewriting, pay particular attention to the clear      identification of the systems of inequality. The examples      used may be a subset of a system, a particular context in a      system, or a location that is the intersection of two      systems. Try to clarify this as much as possible.       Try to think about what is unequal, and who are all the people      or all the positions that are related to those in the example      (and each other) by the inequality in the example.       Recall that some examples of inequality amongst people are      more appropriately understood as the effects of a system of      inequality. If people have different quality housing as a      result of income inequality, we usually want to conceive of this      as an effect of income inequality, rather than analyzing housing      inequality as a system of inequality. The \"system\" of      inequality is where the causal dynamics between the advantaged      and disadvantaged are centered. There is no hard and fast      rule about the proper way to define a system of inequality,      because the optimal way of understanding an inequality will      depend on our analytical goals                      Common Readings           Review readings of past weeks                      Recommended     Readings                  Review readings of past weeks       ...

Table of Contents                              Description \u2013 Scope, Organization, and Access:      The Scope of the Topics and Materials.      We know a lot about gender inequality \u2013 its history, how people     experience it in their lives, the ways it varies in intensity and form     across time and place, the beliefs that make it seem natural, and much     more. The outpouring of research and commentary on gender     inequality over the past half century has been extraordinary.      Unfortunately, despite all this, our understanding of what causes     gender inequality remains troubled. Both ordinary people and experts     (such as scholars) commonly fluctuate between simplistic explanations     that founder under close scrutiny and throwing up their hands in     frustration over what can seem an enigma beyond human     comprehension. Here we will seek to surmount this dilemma.      We will explore diverse facets of gender inequality and varied ideas     about what causes might be decisive. We will also look carefully     at the ways we can identify and verify the causes of social     phenomena. Through these efforts we will aim both to enhance our     understanding of what produces gender inequality and to improve our     general ability to do causal social analyses effectively.      The class     organization and goals. In this class, each week's work will     be organized around an analytical task, as well as a set of     readings. Rather than focusing on discussion of the readings,     the analytical tasks involve attempting a causal analysis of some     aspect of gender inequality related to the week's issue, building on     the materials we read (in brief papers of a couple pages). The     approach in this class seeks to develop analytical skills as well as     understandings of the relevant literature by stressing doing actual     analyses of gender inequality. (Note: this class does not have an exam     nor a final paper.)      All class meetings are organized as discussions. Part of our     class discussions will be on the common readings and part on students'     efforts to explore the analytical tasks each week. We will     adjust the time devoted to these two goals according to our     experiences over the class. Every week, students will initiate     discussions on readings and papers. To make this work, each week's     papers will be exchanged (electronically) with enough lead time that     we can all read all the papers prior to the class meetings.      Each topic below includes \u2013 beside the common readings \u2013     three other subsections. These are: an analytical task ,     recommended readings , and related readings . The analytical task is the writing     assignment for the week. Everyone should read the common     readings while doing the analytical task (and be prepared to     discuss them). In each of these papers \u2013 always brief      papers \u2013 students will try out causal ideas related to the week's     topic. Recommended and     related readings are optional      materials useful for those who want to dig deeper into a topic.      To simplify navigating through the syllabus, these subsections are     hidden until the viewer clicks on the subsection heading, then they     will appear.      Most of our readings will be articles available for downloading.      The links will appear in the online version of the course     syllabus. Excerpts from Down So Long . . .: The Puzzling     Persistence of Gender Inequality (book manuscript by RMJ not yet     published) will similarly be available for downloading from the class web     site. (As we will read selections from Jackson's book Destined     for Equality [Harvard U Press] throughout the course, you might     want to buy it or borrow it.)      Any student unfamiliar with the study of gender, can (and probably     should) pick up the basics from a standard textbook in the area \u2013 I     recommend Michael Kimmel's Gendered Society (which I use in my     basic general undergraduate class on gender, so used copies should be     easy to find).      For further relevant sources, my reading lists/syllabi for two     graduate courses might be valuable. The one most directly     related is      What Causes Gender Inequality:     Analytical Foundations ; a more general class,           What Causes Inequality: Analytical     Foundations , may provide materials for broader     questions about different kinds of inequalities and how to think about     gender inequality in relationship to them.       A note      on the \"hidden\" material below : Each section of     this guide includes \u2013 beside the common readings \u2013 three     subsections, one for an analytical task , one for recommended     readings , and one for related readings . To     simplify navigating through the course guide, only the headings for     these subsections are initially visible. The contents of all     these subsections are hidden (so that the beginning appearance of the     page is similar to a standard syllabus) until the viewer clicks on a     subsection heading, then its contents will appear. While this     organization is helpful for negotiating the page most of the time, it     can become an obstacle if we want to search the page (for example, for     a particular article) as searches will ignore the hidden material     (that is, if you search a page you are viewing in an internet browser,     the search will only examine what is shown on the page at that time).      To overcome this limitation, you can \"open\" all the hidden sections to     show everything on the page by clicking the \u00a7 symbol at the top of the     page. (To restore the page to the normal condensed view, simply     reload the page which will collapse all the \"hidden\" sections to their     usual look). The table of contents at the top of this page will     aid speedy navigation to any topic, which is particularly helpful if     you reveal all the \"hidden\" material.                              The Topics                I. Introduction. What    do we mean by gender inequality?     To analyze the causes of gender     inequality, we need to know what we mean by gender     inequality. How can we conceive of and talk about     gender inequality in ways that are general enough to apply across the     range of relevant phenomena, consistent enough to minimize conceptual     ambiguities, and precise enough to be analytically effective?      Gender inequality has been extraordinarily diverse and wide     spread. Women and men are unequal in every conceivable way in     endless circumstances, both immediate and enduring, by both objective     criteria and subjective experience. So, what counts as gender     inequality? Can we characterize it in ways that let us confidently and     impartially assess when there is more or less of it?          Analytical     Task                 No task for the introductory meeting.

II. Causality - What are causes,    mechanisms, and the like?     We casually refer to causes and effects in normal   interactions all the time. We all conduct our lives \u2013 choosing actions,   making decisions, trying to influence others \u2013 based on theories about why   and how things happen in the world. From the early stages of childhood   we attribute causes, building a vision of the social (and physical) world   that makes it understandable. Every action, every choice about what to   do, is based on our anticipation of its effects, our understandings of   consequences. Analytical and scientific reasoning has a similar form,   but requires that we approach causation more systematically and   self-consciously.          Analytical     Task                 The general      analytical problem . In this and other societies,      women and men commonly dress differently. Prepare a      causal analysis that seeks to explain why women and men dress      differently .              Our analytical task this week is to attempt a \"simple\"       causal analysis of a gender difference that is obvious but not       often questioned - the way we dress. The purpose of this       exercise is to get us thinking about causality.        To the degree that we can, we want to try to think of       different kinds of causes based on varied ways of framing the       causal question. Realistically, one could easily write a       book about all the possible ways of interpreting this causal       question and answering it. We are just trying to develop       some sensible insights in a couple pages.                   Thinking Tools .       The starting point of most causal analyses is a comparison.       When we start with the general question \"what causes X?\" we turn      it into possible comparisons to produce an answer. Examples      of such questions might be \"why do people in group A do X more      than those in group B?,\" \"why does X occur more often in summer      than winter?,\" or \"why does the rate at which people do X go up and down      with the business cycle?\" The underlying idea is simple but      powerful. If we are trying to explain some phenomenon, X,      then we need to identify variations in the likelihood of X or the      rate of X, and look for potential causes that (1) vary across the      relevant circumstances in a way that could explain X and (2) that      we can connect to the outcomes for X in some way. For      example, with the gender distinctive clothing question, some ways      to better specify the question and look at it through comparisons      are:              What causes individual       conformity to the cultural pattern? What       induces women and men to conform to the expectations for       dressing differently? Whenever we observe a consistent       pattern of social behavior, some common conditions or       processes must be inducing people to act in a similar       way. Figuring out what encourages conformity and       discourages deviance allows us to provide a causal       explanation. Think about what happens to people who do       not conform to the expectations about male and female       appropriate clothing. And, just as important, ask why it       is that people punish nonconformists. Here the basic       comparison is between people who conform and those who do not,       or between the reactions of people to conformity and       nonconformity.        What causes differences       in dress \"codes\" across cultures? What circumstances       could exist across societies that consistently produce gender       differences in modes of dress? The clothing       characteristic of each sex varies greatly across societies       (and time). Clothing differs between \"primitive\"       cultures and modern ones, between warm and cold climates, and       between different parts of the world. But seemingly       everywhere men and women dress differently. How can we       explain this pattern? Here the primary comparison is       between cultures that have different clothing.        Why do the expectations       about clothing differences vary by context ? Why       are gender differences in dress greater in some circumstances       than in others? For example, both women and men may wear       similar coveralls in a factory, but women and men generally       wear dramatically different clothing to formal dances.        Our efforts to find causes behind any phenomena are improved       by looking at variations. If male and female clothing is       just a little different in some contexts but greatly different       in others, we can usefully focus on what might produce this       variance in gender differences. Here the primary       comparison is between contexts with greater differences in the       expected clothing and contexts with lesser differences.                   Thinking Tools 2 .       While considering how to explain the differences in the ways      women and men dress, it can also be helpful to think through       ways that this pattern could be considered an example of a       larger pattern. The explanation for the broader pattern       may be different or easier to develop. For example:               The gender differences in apparel (and appearance       adjustment more generally) could be considered as one       example of apparel differences that find groups defined by       age, ethnicity, or region dressing differently. That       is to say, it is not only women and men who consistently       dress differently. Different ways of dressing also       distinguish other groups. If we think about those       other groups, does it give us insights into explaining the       difference between women's and men's clothing?        The gender differences in dress could be considered as one       example of a wider range of behavioral differences between       women and men such as rules of proper decorum, speech       patterns, or displays of sexuality. That is, we can       point to other presentational differences between women and       men. If we think about the range of these       presentational differences, do they suggest ideas that might       help explain differences in apparel?

How is gender inequality    symbolized and reproduced in everyday life?     To start our investigation of the causes of gender   inequality, we will consider how people experience and act out gender in   their day to day lives. We want to think about the most basic   questions. Why and when do women and men act differently? Why   and when do people respond differently to women than men? How do all   these private individual actions when taken together over time influence the   understanding of gender in a culture and gender inequality?          Analytical     Task                  The general       analytical problem . Using a typical setting       where women and men meet, assess how Ridgeway's framing       approach helps explain the role of gender in these       interactions and where it might fall short.               For this task, we choose some familiar (to us) setting        or type of interaction where women and men typically        engage each other. For example, this could be a        workplace, a bar, interactions between buyers and sellers,        or parties. We use this as our source of empirical        data and focus our argument on explaining gender        interactions there.         First, we need to read Ridgeway's argument        carefully. Then we try to apply her argument to the        setting we have chosen.         We want to assess how much we believe people's actions (in        the context we chose) fit the expectations we can derive        from her argument and when they might not. As we        work on our analyses, we are evaluating Ridgeway's        approach as a tool. The right tool allows us to construct        a better edifice with less effort; the wrong tool does        not.                      Thinking tools .       The remaining notes for this analytical task look at some       analytical steps that allow us to think through this problem       effectively.               Systematic steps in        the analysis . Doing this kind of thought        experiment, we want our thinking to be as systematic as        possible. For all systematic causal analyses, we        want to consider how the phenomenon being examined varies        in regular or predictable ways across conditions,        settings, types of people, places, or the like. Then, we        ask what conditions or events typically precede or occur        along with the outcomes that could plausibly influence        those outcomes.                 For example, first, we simply consider possible         differences between men's and women's actions.          Then we consider how their actions might differ         between opposite-sex and same-sex encounters.          We can broaden the range of the examples we use to         think about these differences by considering other         characteristics that might affect interactions, such         as the age or race of the people, whether the         interaction is cordial or unfriendly, how well the         people know each other, and so on.          We want to ask ourselves if the gender aspect of the         interaction will be influenced by these other         circumstances that seem relevant to interactions. For         example, does gender influence cordial interactions         differently from the ways it influences confrontations         in our setting? If we believe the answer         is yes, then we consider how and why.          Analogously, we want to think about the ways that         people's goals in gendered interactions vary in these         kinds of circumstances, and how these goals influence         their actions. For example, in the same setting,         a person seeking sex will commonly act differently         than someone trying to curry favor or sell a product.                  When we apply a systematic logic to the analysis, we         usually do not want to write about all the         possibilities we think about. Instead, we use         the ones that we find telling. But we will not         identify those telling possibilities unless we         systematically work through all the relevant possible         influences.                         Gender context .        We can take the analysis of interactions another step by        considering how the influence of gender on these        interactions is potentially affected by conditions like:                 the presence or absence of onlookers (i.e., the         relative privacy of the interaction) or          the gender distribution of other people present         (i.e., mostly male, mostly female, or mixed)                         Conformity .         Whenever we try to explain patterns like this, we want to        consider the exceptions. When will people violate        the implications of gender expectations and what follows        when they do? Are there circumstances that make it        more likely people will depart from conventional        behavior? Violations of norms or common expectations        are valuable for causal analyses because cracks in the        veneer of social order can reveal its structure and        dynamics.                      Bring it       together . After working through the steps       above, we try to assess when Ridgeway's approach does a good       job explaining how gender influences behavior in our chosen       setting, and when her approach seems to fall short. Do       we see ways that her approach neglects or misunderstands       important causes influencing the gender character of behavior       in the context we examine? Our central goal here is to       explain how and why gender organizes interactions in our       chosen example. We are not attempting a general evaluation of       Ridgeway's ideas, but a focused assessment of their       effectiveness in the setting we have selected to try them out.

And how does    explaining the \"origins\" of gender inequality relate to explaining the    \"persistence\" of gender inequality?     Although some scholars may question if    women have been subordinate in all societies, all agree that men have been   dominant in most societies although the degree of dominance varies   greatly. This raises the very tricky question, how do we explain the   prevalence of male dominance? This exceedingly elusive question   continues to elude any answer that will evoke a consensus.          Analytical     Task                  Analytical Task       Alternative 1: An analytical critique . As most       of us lack the substantive knowledge needed to develop even       simple analyses of gender inequality's possible origins, we       will explore the causal possibilities by responding to the       arguments of people who are knowledgeable.               Please read the \" Basics of Causal        Descriptions \" on a separate page for some simple,        beginning ideas about describing a causal analysis.         Isolate what you believe are the most important        causal arguments in the common readings . Give        a critical assessment of their different approaches .         In doing this, try to pay attention to what it is that        makes you find the causal arguments more or less        persuasive. The recommended and related readings        provide a range of material that you can look at as you        need to deepen and sharpen your arguments.                       It can be helpful to look back at the material from        Topic II, especially Gerring's list of criteria for causal        arguments.                      Analytical Task       Alternative 2: A hypothetical scenario . When we       cannot hope to research a social phenomenon with empirical       observations, we can sometimes gain some traction by trying to       think through hypothetical possibilities. Here is an       example.               Assume that sometime in the near future we launch a        rocket into space with a crew of 1,000. This crew is        evenly divided between women and men, the women and men        have similar credentials and accomplishments, and the two        sexes are about equally represented at each level of        authority. The crew members' cultural understandings        are similar to those of college students today.         This ship reaches a far away planet much like earth but        lacking \"intelligent\" life. Unfortunately, the        ship's engines have become unstable and the crew must        abandon it. So they must start life on this new        planet. While they possess much advanced knowledge,        they have no technology. They must start from        scratch, producing food, organizing themselves into a        community, pairing off to reproduce, slowly building        toward some kind of technological development over        generations. [Note: If the distant planet scenario        seems unnerving, we could have the same effect by dropping        a 1,000 people on a remote island that is isolated as a        social experiment.]         Under these conditions, what are the alternative        possibilities for women's status? What might decide        which alternative occurs?

What determines men's and    women's roles and positions within families?     Family and kinship are potentially relevant to gender   inequality in varied ways and a lot of work had pursued such issues.    Probably the two most important general issues involve the ways that women   and men are unequal within families and the ways that family organization   both contributes to and is influenced by gender inequality beyond the family   institution. We will just touch the surface of these issues this week.          Analytical     Task                  The general       analytical problem . We want to provide an       integrated analytical overview of the principal causal       arguments about gender inequality and family organization that       appear in the common readings.        Each of the readings has various causal arguments about       family organization, some directly about gender inequality,       some relevant to gender inequality but not directly exploring       it. Some of the causal questions may receive different       causal analyses by these authors. Sometimes two or more       authors may use a similar causal approach to explain different       causal problems. Our goal is to sort this out.        Our overviews should be organized around the causal       arguments, not        a series of summaries of what each author wrote (see Thinking       Tools).        Thinking tools .               We want to use one of the following two possible ways to        organize the causal assessment (unless one of us has a        better way). The first organizes around what is to        be explained, the second around the causes.                 First approach .          We start by identifying the principal causal problems         addressed by the group of papers. That is, we         figure out what they suggest needs to be         explained. Then, we organize these causal         problems in a sensible order (including consideration         of some problems potentially being secondary or         sub-problems of others). Under each causal         problem, we summarize and assess all the relevant         explanations found in the readings.          Second approach .          We start by identifying the principal causal         frameworks used in the papers. That is, we         figure out what they suggest are the conditions or         processes that have the most important influence over         the outcomes. Then, we organize these causal         frameworks in a sensible order, taking into account         which are entirely different and which might be         variations of a similar theme, and which are competing         versus complementary. For each of these, after         summarizing the causal logic of the framework, we show         how it has been used by these authors, describing the         range of outcomes the framework is supposed to         determine and how it has such effects.          Note that         regardless which way we organize our analysis of         competing causal arguments, it can be valuable to         think about not only what is          considered by the authors being examine, but also         which theoretical questions and which causal         frameworks seem relevant but absent.                         Please reread the \" Basics of Causal        Descriptions \" on the starting point for describing a        causal analysis.                      Bringing it       together . In short, our aim is to produce a       critical overview of the principal causal arguments concerning       the family and gender inequality, starting with the ideas       present in the common readings for this week. To do this       effectively, we need to identify all the relevant causal       arguments, deduce the logical structure of each causal       argument and determine how to present that clearly (even if       the original source is inconsistent or ambiguous), detect how       the causal arguments (from different sources) relate to each       other and present them in a way that makes those relations       clear, and, where possible, summarize the important analytical       strengths and weaknesses of each argument (or facet to an       argument).       (We should start with the understanding that this kind of       analytical overview is rather easy to do poorly and very       demanding to do well and thoroughly. At this stage we       are not aspiring to a professional job but hoping to achieve       a reasonable, if basic, analysis.)                             Common Readings           Andrew J.

What is the role of    sexuality?     Sexuality has been evoked in     multiple ways in the study of gender inequality. Some have     considered it as a possible motivating cause for inequality, others have     explored how gender inequality can mold the experience and practice of     sexuality, and others have tried to theoretically incorporate     sexuality as a peculiar tension between women and men that mediates     both the causes and effects of gender inequality. Essentially,     everyone recognizes sexuality is critically important to gender     inequality, but we lack agreement or clarity on how it matters.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical      problem . Our central task this week is to propose a      causal account that plausibly explains the relationship between one      aspect of sexuality and gender inequality.              Everyone who analyzes gender inequality considers sexuality       important, but they have highly varied ideas about what       matters and why. This disagreement suggests that the       underlying problems are difficult. We cannot       hope to solve them in this brief effort. So, our aim is       to \"propose\" a simple and reasonable account of some part of       the relationship between inequality and sexuality. We are        not trying to develop a full, professional analysis.        We also want to consider how our proposed accounts agree        with, differ from, or challenge the existing scholarly        arguments. Again, our goal here is limited. The        aim is to give a reasonable first sense of how the proposed        account fits (or does not fit).                   Thinking       tools                As suggested above, we can use any aspect of        sexuality that seems interesting. However, it may        help if the selected facet of sexuality:                 has a relationship to gender inequality that at         least some writers think is important. Which way         it is important is wide open. The role of the         chosen sexuality characteristic relative to gender         inequality may be cause, effect, catalyst, or whatever         else seems causally relevant.          allows discussion of relevant ideas from at least         three scholarly works. These may be part of the         common readings, any of the other readings recommended         here, or another legitimate source. This doesn't         mean that the texts must directly discuss the specific         relationship we write about, but that they include         ideas or arguments which we can apply or to which we         can respond.                         A basic approach to the task presentation might have the        following three parts:                 First, we lay out the causal, explanatory         problem. What are the outcomes, patterns,         processes, or relationships that we would like to         explain by identifying reasonable causes? And         why is this important enough to merit attention? (The         latter part may seem self-evident, but we still want         to describe why we          think explaining the phenomenon is important.)          Second, we provide the causal analysis. We         want to be as complete as possible within reasonable         space limits. And, we want to be clear, simple,         and direct.          Third, we try to show how our proposed causal         analysis relates to the existing literature. For         our purposes, we can limit ourselves to considering a         couple theories or perspectives that would support or         compliment our approach and a couple that would be         likely to question our proposed causal analysis.          (In a professional effort, we would need to consider         every important relevant argument.) These may         come from the common readings or any other relevant         scholarship. When discussing those who might         disagree, we want to be as specific as possible about         what criticism we would expect from each of these         \"opponents\" and how we might respond.                                      Bringing it       together . In short, our aim is to construct a       basic causal argument seeking to understand how some aspect of       sexuality is related to gender inequality, and to assess how       that causal argument relates to the existing literature (as       represented in our readings).

Attempts to explain gender inequality at all levels are   haunted by essentialism . Essentialist arguments impute   distinctive attributes to women and men and attribute the social differences   between women's and men's activities, opportunities, statuses, and roles to   these distinct attributes. Even theoretical analyses of gender   inequality that expressly reject the possibility of consequential, inherent   sex differences, commonly build their explanations of inequality on   gender differences. To complicate matters, essentialist arguments   proclaiming superior attributes for women exist alongside of the arguments   proclaiming women inferior. Moreover, while for some, essentialism   always means a difference based in biology or genetics, for others it   includes cultural differences that are embodied in women and men.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical problem .      To investigate how essentialist arguments work, we will      examine how different kinds of essentialist arguments might be      applied to explain some aspect of gender inequality, in contrast      to a non-essentialist argument. We aim to see both the      attraction of essentialist arguments and the possibilities for      alternatives.             Select one form or facet of gender inequality that you will       try to explain for this task. This instance or aspect of       gender inequality should be sufficiently important,       widespread, and enduring or recurring to merit thoughtful       theory and explanation. It should also be narrow or       specific enough that the goal of explaining it is       plausible. For example, the facet might be that wives       commonly defer to husbands.        For the selected type or aspect of gender inequality, you       will suggest five alternative explanations, each one       representing a different approach to explaining such social       phenomena. The explanations should be succinct but       clear. They should also be plausible to the extent that       a reasonable person might make such an argument. Plausible       does not mean true, of course. Rather, we are trying to       imagine an argument that would seem plausible to people who       are advocates for each of the perspectives.                   The five types of explanation .       Attempt to devise the best explanations you can for the relevant      facet of inequality from each of the following      perspectives. Explanations may be categorized in many      ways. The five perspectives defined here are meant to engage      different responses to the problem of essentialism.              Direct biological - Devise an explanation claiming       that some biological difference between the sexes produces the       relevant aspect of inequality by making women and men act       differently. For example, an argument might be that men       are stronger than women so men dominate women as a simple       result of superior strength. (More complex biological       explanations might be derived from evolutionary       psychology.) This type of explanation is usually purely       essentialist. Note that this type of explanation can be       divided further into those relying on real biological       differences and those imputing fictional biological       differences. Let us stress biological differences that       are at least potentially real here, leaving the fictitious       ones for below.        Indirect biological - Formulate an explanation       claiming some biological difference does not directly       produce the inequality, but the biological difference has       important effects or implications of some sort, and those       effects that make likely or unavoidable the emergence or       persistence of the selected aspect of gender inequality.        For example, someone might argue that women's child bearing       makes them anxious about the welfare of their children, and       that anxiety makes them feel weak and in want of a protector,       leading them to defer to husbands. Or, others might       suggest that women's biologically induced child rearing       orientation encourages both women and men to make men       responsible for warfare, and that men's resulting skill at       combat, their possession of weapons, and men's organization       around mutual defense leaves wives typically in their       husbands' control. The key for this type of explanation       is that the relevant biological differences do not directly       cause the gender inequality being explained, but have effects       on social behavior and social organization that lead to gender       inequality. These types of explanations have       essentialist origins in a biological difference, but the       explanation as a whole may invoke mediating causal influences       that reduce the essentialist quality, sometimes greatly.        Non-biological sex difference - Suggest how       some socially constructed difference between women and men \u2013       one that is neither biological nor a direct result of       biological differences \u2013 initiates or preserves the aspect of       gender inequality being explained. This will usually be       an enduring individual characteristic (a difference that       people carry with them, not a difference in their       circumstances). For example, one might claim that women       are fearful and dependent because of socialization processes       (that have no biological basis), and this psychological       condition induces wives to defer to their husbands. Or,       one might argue that childhood sports available only to boys       result in a higher competitive drive that accounts for adult       men's greater success in business. This type of       explanation claims a real difference exists between women and       men (in the society or social context where the inequality       being explained occurs; the relevant sex difference need not       exist in all or any other society or social context), but this       difference is a social construction. This type of       explanation often becomes redundantly circular: each aspect of       inequality exists as a result of inequality, and that overall       inequality is constituted by the various aspects.        Fictitious sex difference - An imputed sex       difference that does not really exist is claimed to play a       significant role in producing the selected facet of gender       inequality. For example, someone might suggest that       although women have no better capacity for child rearing,       people commonly assume they do because women bear children,       and that this false expectation produces a division of labor       and power favoring men. This type of explanation focuses       on the consequences of beliefs, relying on the observation       that beliefs can organize behavior even if they are false       beliefs. While such fictitious differences are commonly       assumed to be biological, they need not be.        Causes independent of sex differentiation - A       causal process that does not involve any difference between       the sexes is argued to produce the inequality being       considered. For example, some might argue that for       families to fulfill their social functions effectively, they       need one spouse/parent to perform the critical emotional       actions needed and the other spouse/parent to perform the       practical and leadership actions (this is essentially a       well-know idea of Talcott Parsons). This role       differentiation can then result in spouse inequality, as an       indirect and unintended consequence. This category       includes highly diverse explanations, the one critical       similarity among them being that they do not rely on a sex       difference in their central causal argument. It may be       worth noting that one reason explanations based on sex       differences (including all the preceding perspectives) are       more common is that formulating a plausible analysis that       forgoes the mechanism of sex differences is often a hard task.                         (Note, in this task we are aiming to produce explanations that      those advocating each of the above types of explanation would      think are reasonable. It is often hardest to conceive good      explanations from the points of view we find unconvincing or      unappealing, but the capacity to do this is a valuable skill.)       Bringing it together .       The point of this exercise is to examine how it is possible to      devise a range of alternative causal explanations of gender      inequality stressing some mechanism of sex differences, while      developing alternative theories that do not rely on sex      differences is rather hard. The difference arguments run the      full range from being directly and fully biological to relying on      non-biological or fictitious differences in indirect ways.       The arguments that exclude not only biology but all dependence on      sex differences commonly derive from another theoretical approach,      such as functionalism or conflict theories. The challenge      with these approaches is not only to make the immediate causal      process eschew differences, but to avoid relying on sex      differences one or two steps earlier in the causal chain.

What is the role of     violence and intimidation in the relationships between men and     women?     Most theoretical approaches to gender inequality   suggest that violence between women and men plays a role in sustaining   inequality; some also point toward violence as an initial    cause. A recurring issue concerns the degree to which violence is an   expression or result of gender inequality or, alternatively, is a cause of   inequality. The separate roles of rape, harassment, and domestic   violence, and their relationships to each other are another critical   question. Much research and argument has also been focused on the   question of women's aggressive impulses and actions.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task 1:      Explain why women do not engage in sexual harassment or sexual      violence at anything like the rates that men do? Our      strategy is to reverse the usual way people approach the problem      of gender violence.              When people refer to the patterns of violence between women       and men (in modern societies), they are usually referring to       several distinctive patterns including sexual violence       (particularly rape), sexual harassment, and intimate partner       violence (which includes wife battering). These       categories implicitly distinguish patterns of aggression based       on several criteria: the degree to which the aggressive acts       involve sexuality, the severity of the aggressive acts, and       the relationship between the man and woman. These       aggressive actions in these categories are all related to       gender inequality both in that inequality engenders them and       that they reinforce gender inequality. They are       particularly linked in their contributions to women\u2019s fear and       sense of physical vulnerability. And that fear is       crucial. For it is the prospect of possible violence       that induces women to restrict their behavior, to seek male       protectors, and to heed men\u2019s wishes.        Here, to simplify our task, we will set aside the question       of intimate partner violence.        To begin, you might consider what determines the actions of       women that do or do not lead to violence and how those       immediate determinants differ from the determinants for       men. Men vary greatly, so you must decide if you will       abstract away all that variation (to talk of \"men\" in the most       generic or abstract possible manner) or if you feel that some       variations (e.g. wealth or age) require consideration.        Remember that you can restrict the scope of your analysis.               Potential determinants include beliefs, resources,        opportunities, the anticipated consequences of alternative        actions         Another way to look at it is the old detective's script:        motives, means, opportunity         It is commonly useful to start your reasoning        concretely, using what you know best. Think about        the kinds of people you know best, either through personal        experience or from studying them. Try to explain        concretely why the women do not engage in sexual        harassment or sexual violence more. This gives you a        starting point.               Expect to develop your argument backwards from the concrete       beginnings. This means that after you assemble your       first round explanation of what directly influences women's       actions, you take those explanatory conditions as the problem       to explain in the second. For example, if you used       women's beliefs about violence as an immediate cause of their       restrained violence, then you next need to consider why they       have different beliefs from men. You want to produce at       least two levels of the causal analysis, and see if you can do       three.        Please take the time to look over the lists of Recommended       and Related Readings. You are likely to find some work       there what will shorten the time needed to complete this task.                              Analytical Task 2 : Try      to develop a clear causal analysis of the role played in      gender inequality by a fear of violence.                    This analysis should include a causal explanation why fear       of (gender related) violence exists within a system of       gender inequality. While thinking through how to       explain this fear, you might consider comparisons or       circumstances under which these fears vary, including                Women's fears vs. men's fears         The circumstances under which women experience greater        fear and those where they feel safe         Differences in the amount of fear typical amongst        groups or categories of women according to their age,        affluence, location, companions, or any other relevant        social condition         Differences in the distribution of fear across        societies distinguished by such conditions as forms of        economic and political organization, degree of        development, prevailing religious or cultural        institutions and the like                       This analysis should also include a causal explanation of       the consequences for gender inequality of the distribution       of fears of violence. In what ways do fears of       violence influence the behavior of women or the       relationships between women and men? Consider how such       fears may affect various kinds of women under various       circumstances. But remember to return to aggregate       effects \u2013 it is the impact of these fears on the pattern of       women's experiences and behavior that affects gender       inequality writ large.        Avoid the analytic temptation to argue as if equality       might imply an absence of discord and aggression.        Realistically, equality between two groups by itself only       leads us to expect that acts of aggression will occur with       equal frequency and effect between members of the two       groups. Removing inequality as a source of discord       should reduce one kind of frustrations that motivate       aggression. Other sources of discord still exist,       however, and some forms of aggression that would be       suppressed by inequality might even rise.        Try to introduce appropriate connections between the       argument(s) you present and the readings. Consider not       only the common readings from this week, but also past       readings and optional ones from this week that seem       particularly relevant.        The causal arguments should try to conform to the       standards for a good causal argument that we have read about       and discussed. Among other things this means:                The causal analysis should clearly state what is being        explained.         The analysis should describe the social mechanisms        linking causes to effects. It should show what        happens in the world that produces the outcomes, what        kinds of people or organizations behave in manner, what        circumstances arise that induce the relevant behavior,        and so forth. This may be abstract at the level of        the causal model.         The analysis should consider why the decisive        causes exist and take the form that they do. That        is, the causal analysis should push back at least one        step past the causes being invoked to ask what causes        them.         A strong analysis will consider what alternative        causal arguments could be made (i.e., how the causal        processes could be different from what you describe) and        show what evidence or logic favors the argument you have        presented. A thorough causal analysis will        recognize that other causal models might be considered        plausable, and try to compare the causal model being        promoted to the alternatives.         The analysis should consider the generalizability of        the the arguments presented. It should consider to        what periods, places, types of societies, parts of        society, kinds of social relationships or interactions        do the arguments apply?         Most will find it difficult to do all of the above        effectively, so consider it suggestions about what would        be ideal, then apply your judgment about allocating your        time and effort.

How has the economy    influenced men's and women's positions in society?     Analyses of gender inequality attribute great   importance to the economy. Gender inequality appears everywhere   embedded in economic inequality, in the sense that a critical aspect of   gender inequality involves unequal access to economic resources and   positions. This relationship becomes clearer in more \"advanced\"   societies where economic organization has become institutionally   differentiated from kinship and political organization. Sometimes this   unequal economic access is understood as an expression of gender inequality,   sometimes a cause of gender inequality, sometimes a result. Many analyses   consider it all three.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task       1: Develop a causal analysis of economic inequality between      women and men that accounts for two empirical observations, one      being the earnings inequality between the sexes by the gender      composition of major occupational categories, the other being the      changing likelihood that wives will earn more than their husbands.              The data to be explained can be found in three tables (click to see) .        Use the tabs at the bottom to switch between tables.               The first table shows the 2012 earnings gap in the 20        occupational categories that have the largest number of        females. These have been sorted by the proportion        female. The numbers in dark red show the earnings        gap where women also account for two-thirds or more of the        those in the occupational category.         The second table shows the same kind of data as the        first, but is for the 20 occupational categories that have        the largest number of males. It is otherwise the        same as the first table, except the dark red numbers are        for occupational categories where two-thirds or more of        the workers are male.         The third table shows the changing proportion of married        couples where the wife earns more than the husband over        the 25 years up to 2011.                      Preliminary to developing an analysis, the first task is,       of course, to interpret what the data in the tables tell us       about economic inequality between women and men. It is       recommended that you focus on the dark red numbers of all the       tables. The first two tables are meant to be interpreted       as one.        The main task is to develop a background analysis of gender       inequality in the economy, as it exists today and how it has       changed over the past several decades. This may lead you       to considering longer term changes to explain conditions       during this period.        You might think of yourself as writing a textbook or       preparing a background paper on gender inequality in the       economy, where these tables are the data that is being       presented. Your goal is to offer an understanding of       these tables.        One way to think about this is in terms of what we don't see       in the tables.               Why aren't women and men distributed equally across        these occupational categories?         Why are women's earnings lower?         Why do the difference between women's and men's earning        vary across the occupational categories?         Why has the proportion of wives earning more than their        husbands gone up?         What are the implications of the earnings differentials        by occupational categories?         What are the implications of the data on wives'        earnings?         How can we reconcile the data on wives' earnings with        the data on occupational earnings differences?                      In short, we are aiming at a brief explanation of women's       vs. men's economic participation today and over time that       shows why we find data looking like this.                   Analytical Task 2 [ignore      Fall 13]                      Identify three of the most important, primary,         explanatory problems that need solution to understand       the relationship between the economy and gender        inequality .                 Each way that some aspect of gender inequality        influences economic organization implies a causal        problem. Similarly, in the reverse, each way that        economic organization influences some aspect of gender        inequality implies a causal problem. For example,        women used to have no access to most high-status        positions in the American economy and are now still        under represented in them. In either direction we        might consider the intensity or degree of gender        inequality, rather than some aspect of gender        inequality, as that which influences or is influenced by        economic organization. For each observation or        claim about economic inequality between women and men,        we can ask \"why?\" or \"how?\" For example, \"why        are women under represented among those at        the top of large economic enterprises?\" or \"how does        women's relative absence from positions great economic        power influence the persistence of gender inequality?\"         Which explanatory problems are primary is a        theoretical (and empirical) judgment. A         primary causal process is one without which the         relationship between the economy and gender inequality         would look and work differently . Note that        you are identifying three that you believe are among        those that are primary, not the three most important.                        For each of the three selected, primary,       explanatory problems, do the following: State clearly what        is the explanatory problem and why it is a        primary or important one . Think carefully about       what makes some causal processes more important than others       when we are trying to understand a social phenomenon (her       the relationship between gender inequality and economic       organization).        Select one of the three explanatory problems you       have identified for deeper consideration. For that       problem:                Briefly describe what stand out as the         possible causal processes that could account for        the relationship or condition that is the focus of the        explanatory problem. For example, what might        be the causal processes that account for few women        being in positions of high economic power? These        are the competing or alternative explanations for the        problem. These may include the causes or        explanations explicitly suggested in the literature        concerning the problem, or explanations derived from        applying a more general theoretical orientation (e.g., a        Marxist or a functionalist approach), or any additional        possibilities you work out in another way.          Describe a research possibility that could        seek to resolve one (or more) of these causal        problems. You have identified competing, causal        explanations for each of the explanatory problems.         For one of these, consider how we might hope to learn        which causal explanation is more valid by doing relevant        research. To do this, we usually want to think        about the circumstances under which the competing        theories suggest that something in the world should look        or work differently.                       To summarize, the analytical task involves (1) identifying       three primary, explanatory problems relating gender       inequality and economic organization, providing a careful       description for each of those explanatory problems, stating       why it is important, (2) for one explanatory problem,       exploring competing explanations that could solve the       problem, and describing a research design that could,       hypothetically, discover which explanation is better.

X. What role does ideology play in    determining the relations between men and women?     Ideology is near the center of almost all   efforts to explain gender inequalities. People's conceptions of   masculinity and femininity, ideas concerning the fairness of differential   treatment or expectations of women and men, internalized schema that   evoke different judgments of women's and men's actions, rules about proper   male and female behavior applied to children \u2013 all these and more concern the   influence of ideology on gender identities, differential treatment of women   and men, and the organization and persistence of gender inequality.    Conversely, each ideological belief that symbolizes, legitimates, invokes,   guides, induces, or helps sustain gender inequality is itself a product of   gender inequality. To untangle these complex causal interdependencies,   we must always attend carefully to two kinds of distinctions. First,   we must consistently recognize differences in levels of social organization,   including, among others, societal structures and culture, organizations,   social networks, social processes, and individual actors. While it is   tempting to treat ideological beliefs as diffuse entities unconnected to   identifiable people, organizations, or structures, the analytical results   are poor. Second, we must consistently distinguish between   contemporaneous causes (e.g., the ways that internalized schema can   influence interactions) and asynchronous or historical causes (e.g., the   ways that changes in domestic production induce different ideas about   women's place). Causal arguments about ideology consider it as both an   effect of gender inequality and a cause of gender inequality, although it is   ideology's potential role as a contributing cause that stands out as more   theoretically important.          Analytical     Task                 The general analytical problem .      For this week's task, we want to pose an initial analysis of the      relationship between ideology and some aspect of gender      inequality. We want to consider the joint direction of      causal influence for the selected context, how the dynamics of      inequality influences the ideas and how the presence of ideas      influences the understandings and actions of all the relevant      actors.             The aim of       this week's task is to explore the relationship between       beliefs \u2013 ideology \u2013 and some example of inequality. The       goal is to work through the various ways that ideas and       expectations are involved in the causal processes surrounding       gender inequality using the chosen example to do this at a       more concrete level. The purpose of the task       specification that follows is to help you to be systematic       about this.        To begin ,       choose one aspect or component of gender inequality.        This may involve the direct relationships between women and       men or a difference in the opportunities or status available       to women. Examples might be the way that women overall       select less prestigious fields of study than men in college,       that higher education used to be restricted for women, that       women are objects of sex trafficking, that male professional       sports have much higher status, or the different kinds of       restaurants that use male vs. female waiters. You might       try to be a bit creative. It can be helpful to focus your       discussion using a concrete instance of that type of       inequality with which you are familiar.                   Contents of the analysis .       Use this schematic outline as a starting point.             1        Clarify what aspect or component of gender inequality is your       focus.               As always, remember to give the basic characteristics        and principal patterns of the inequality as you understand        it. Among other possibilities, this will normally        include: (1) describe what is unequal; (2) describe what        this inequality looks like, how it is experienced, or how        it has its impact in social life; (3) assess how the        distribution appears or is manifest in the world, how we        would recognize the differences between more or less of        it, and how it is currently distributed).         The goal is to ensure the reader (and you) clearly        understand what inequality is relevant, and what examples        of that inequality you will address.                      2        Describe the principal ideological beliefs or ideas that seem       relevant to the inequality being examined.               While identifying the relevant beliefs is obviously        crucial, it can also be difficult. The range of        potentially relevant beliefs may be very large, so we have        to exercise judgment about which are most important         It may help to distinguish beliefs that motivate         the practice of this aspect of gender inequality from         those that legitimate it.         It is crucial to consider the actions and ideas of both men and women .         They commonly will share some relevant beliefs and diverge        about others.         Consider also whether different beliefs motivate or        legitimate this type of inequality in different times,        places, or circumstances. That is, you want to        decide what characteristics of the beliefs connected to        this inequality are fairly consistent across various        concrete instances of this type of inequality and what        sort of beliefs differ across instances. For        example, the beliefs that motivated male resistance to        women entering \"male\" occupations may have varied by the        status of the occupation and by the time period women        began to enter.         Consider the degree of consensus (or dispute) over the        important beliefs. When is the consensus high or        low, what causes it to be high or low, and what difference        does the degree of agreement make? In particular, do        people dispute some aspects of the beliefs relevant to        this type of inequality, such that the dispute affects the        inequality or informs us about it? Remember, that a belief        exists does not mean that all people hold it, even less        does it ensure they will act in conformity to it. The        greater the disagreement about a belief within a group or         category of actors, the less that it can contribute to         consistent responses it decides actions (although this         may not diminish its appeal as a justification).         Beliefs have a variety of other variable characteristics         that can be important to analyzing their significance.         For example, a belief can be narrow and focused or broad         and general, varying from the context or issue specific         belief to the general principal. A belief can be so         salient and closely held that people refer to it all the         time or so insignificant and loosely held that it plays a         role only when forced to the forefront.                      3        Assess the effects of these beliefs.               Consider the social significance or function of beliefs.         The effects of beliefs are generally understood by        comparing them to real or hypothetical alternatives.         Although beliefs exist only by being held by individuals,         we generally want to think of beliefs as cultural         phenomena. The beliefs that concern us are those preserved         and imposed by cultures or acquired as the common effect of         shared or parallel experiences. People are prone to all         kinds of idiosyncratic beliefs, but only shared beliefs         have social effect.         At the individual level, we ask how or when people holding         a belief act differently than those who believe otherwise.         At the social level, we ask how the presence of those         beliefs in a group or circumstance has social consequences         -- such as influencing the structure of organizations, the         prevailing legal system, or direction of historical         changes.         What we identify as important effects will therefore        depend on the selection of those alternative beliefs.         Reasonable alternatives might include: beliefs observed to        exist in more egalitarian (or more unequal) circumstances,        reversal of beliefs about women and men (often implausible        in reality, but potentially clarifying as an imaginary        experiment), the absence of any such beliefs, or the        presence of some reasonable hypothetical alternative         beliefs.         As usual, we want to give some thought to both women and        men, and we want to consider how the effects of the        beliefs might vary depending on the context or other        mediating influences. Typically, we expect to find women         and men share many beliefs, but are sharply divided on        others.         Beliefs can affect judgments, motives, aspirations,        quality of experience, and so forth. Again, deciding        what is important is an analytical judgment. We are trying        to figure out what beliefs really make a difference to the        strength, durability, or form of gender inequality.                      4        Try to explain how the relevant beliefs come to exist and why       they persist.               Thus, for the example of inequality being examined, we         are trying to explain how beliefs or ideas might         arise as a result of the presence of the inequality         that they legitimate and motivate. This is our         central goal, and it is difficult.         It can help to do a hypothetical experiment.         Consider an imaginary circumstance (which might have a        real historical counterpart) where the relevant aspect of        gender inequality did not exist, nor did the related        beliefs \u2013 then at some point in time this type of gender        inequality came into existence. Then try to think        through how ideas would change as a result of the        emergence of this facet of gender inequality.         Consider what issues might arise if this type of        inequality came to exist, but the beliefs still did not,        and how might the response to such issues lead to new        beliefs. Think about both women and men trying to make        sense of the unequal circumstances, and trying to mold the        perception of reality and justice to fit their        circumstances.         To make the analysis more concrete, see if you can        provide evidence or observations about real circumstances        where this type of inequality is minimal (different        cultures, different historical periods, different parts of        society). Assess how the beliefs under minimal        inequality compare to those where it is high.         It is a good idea to consider under what conditions, if        any, would the beliefs associated with a facet of gender         inequality exist without the presence of this facet of        gender inequality. That is, could similar or analogous        beliefs appear with different kinds of inequality or under        conditions of little inequality. The first        possibility is critical, because it suggests beliefs due        to the presence of inequality per se, not dependent on the        type of inequality. The second possibility suggests        the prospect of beliefs hijacked from conditions distinct        from inequality, then converted to some service to        reinforce or challenge inequality.         It is also a good idea to consider how people acquire        the relevant beliefs? Are they part of general        cultural expectations, are the transferred in specific        contexts, or do people generate them from experience        rather than learning them from others?         Finally, ask what happens if some people question or        reject the beliefs? This question applies to both women        and men. The mechanisms to ensure acceptance and        conformity are crucial to the preservation and        effectiveness of beliefs.                      5        Finally, after completing the steps in the analysis above, try       to give an overall assessment about the significance of       ideology to the facet of gender inequality you are       considering.                   Additional Notes              Throughout, be careful to distinguish between empirical        claims and moral claims. Both kinds of beliefs       are important. And they may be confused or overlapping       rather than neatly distinguished in real life. Still,       they are crucially different. Similarly, distinguish       between the explanation of beliefs and the justification        of beliefs.

Today, feminism is both extolled and condemned, often   by people whose orientations toward feminism seem to defy their   interests. Both the popular press and scholarship have devoted a lot   of effort seeking to make sense of people's beliefs about feminism and   equality, but these efforts have done little to reduce the disagreements.          Analytical     Task                 The goal of this task is to explore what young people think      about feminism today and to attempt to explain these beliefs.       As a prelude, you should interview some female and some male      acquaintances about feminism.             Use your own judgment about who to interview and how       many. You are trying to get enough \"data\" to serve as       the basis for your analysis.        Also use your own judgment about how to conduct your       interviews and what to ask. However, at a minimum try to       include: 1) how they would define feminism, 2) what kinds of       the people they know do they consider feminist, 3) what they       think is true about gender inequality/equality today, 4)       whether or not they consider themselves feminist and why, 5)       whether or not they consider themselves committed to gender       equality.                   Based on these interviews and your pre-existing observations,      write a descriptive assessment of young, educated American's      orientation toward feminism.       Prepare a provisional causal analysis of these current attitudes      toward feminism and gender equality in your reference population.      Try to do a reasoned analysis, taking into account the readings      for this topic.       Causal analyses always hinge on the choice of comparison.       Among others, you might consider: 1) the differences between now      and the past, 2) the differences between women and men, 3) the      differences between those who identify as feminist and those who      do not, 3) the difference between people like you and people      unlike you                     Common Readings            Destined for Equality : Women's      Rejection of Subordination      Nancy Burns and Katherine Gallagher. \" Public      Opinion on Gender Issues: The Politics of Equity and Roles .\"     Annual Review of Political Science, 2010, Vol. 13: 425-443       [doi: 10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.040507.142213]      Jo Freeman. \" Political      Organization in the Feminist Movement .\" Acta Sociologica ,     Vol. 18, No. 2/3 (1975), pp. 222-244      Susan E.

How have political    processes and structures sustained men's and women's relative status?     As structure and as actor, the state has been   unavoidably central to ongoing practice of gender inequality, to its   persistence, and to changes in the form and amount of gender inequality.     States or governments have power. Through the   military and police, a state can enforce conformity to its rules, repel and   punish challenges from the scale of individual acts to collective   rebellions, and by threat, implicit or explicit, deter rebellions from   appearing. Through the law, regulations, and bureaucratic policies, a state   can define what constitutes acceptable or legitimate behavior at all levels   of social organization. Through economic policies of taxation, expenditures,   and redistributions (such as welfare policies or agricultural supports), a   state influences the relative economic status of different groups.     By acting differently toward groups with   regard to any of these aspects of government power, a state can create,   reinforce, or exacerbate social inequalities. Analogously, a state can, in   theory, obstruct, destabilize, or diminish social inequality by using its   power in ways that are inconsistent with social inequalities. States   determine, influence, legitimize, and sanction rights and opportunities;   they may do so in more or less egalitarian ways.     When significant, enduring, social inequality   exists, those privileged by that form of inequality will normally have more   influence over the state than do those disadvantaged by the inequality, and   the overall effect of state policies will reinforce the exercise and   persistence of the inequality. A fundamental problem for all state theories   is who or what decides state policies and actions. To some degree, those   \"in\" the state (elected, appointed, hired, or appropriated) make decisions   based on their interests and outlooks as members of the state apparatus. To   some degree, state actors respond to the influence of power brokers outside   the state, such as the economically powerful. In either case, when making   policy or strategic planning decisions, those influencing state actions are   in part responding to what they perceive will be the responses of all actors   in the nation affected by those decisions. States, or the political   actors who comprise the government, also have their own interests, most   notably preserving their power, and these interests are not automatically   consistent with the interests of dominant social groups.     These political processes may support and   enforce gender inequality, passively permit it, or oppose gender inequality   (as is true with any form of social inequality). They may do any combination   of these with respect to different aspects of gender inequality.    Sustaining influence over political processes is a fundamental feature and   goal of socially dominant groups and the long monopoly of men over political   power has both demonstrated and sustained gender inequality. Yet,   government actions have also contributed to the decline of gender inquality   over the past two centuries.          Analytical     Task                 You have been hired by the newly elected President of the United      States (or the analogous top political position in another country      that you prefer to examine). One of the new President\u2019s main      goals for her years in office is to use government power to      improve gender inequality and the status of women. Your job      is to recommend toward what specific goals she should focus her      efforts.       You may recommend new legislation (or the removal of old), new      administrative strategies such as who gets appointed, new      executive policies (for example, rules for the military) that are      within the President\u2019s power without legislation, concerted      efforts to influence public opinion or state level      governance. In short, you can consider the entire range of      actions available to a President.       You should propose at least three distinct initiatives that you      believe could serve this purpose.       Chose the strategy you believe holds the most promise. For      this strategy, you must provide an analytical justification. Your      justification should consider the following:             At what aspects of gender inequality is the policy       aimed?        Include a brief analysis of this inequality that explains       what is unequal, how great is the inequality, who does it       effect, how widely is it recognized, how it has (or has not)       changed over time, and what seem to be the principal causes.        Describe how have government actions (or inaction)       influenced this inequality in the past.        Show why we should expect that it will be easy or hard to       carry out the strategy and how the possible difficulties       reflect the influence or effects of gender inequality.        Explain how the proposed strategy can be expected to       alleviate gender inequality. This explanation should       connect directly to the causal explanation of the inequality       being diminished.                   In short, you should propose several strategies by which a      government could promote greater gender equality, then provide an      analytic appraisal of the strategy you deem best. This      appraisal should stress the causes of relevant facets of gender      inequality, how the proposed strategy will affect that causal      process, and how gender inequality has a causal influence on      government policy that must be countered to implement the      policy. Do not forget to provide a historical context.

XIII. What does the future hold?     Where do we go from here? Predicting the future is the     ultimate challenge for causal analyses. To have any potential to     see into the future, we need a sound and thorough causal theory, one     that can encompass the range of possible influences     simultaneously. We also need to cope with the unpredictable     potential effects of processes and events that are outside the     boundaries of our theories. These are extremely difficult     conditions to meet. But the need to make some sense of the     future weighs on us. Will gender inquality continue to decline,     and greater gender equality spread throughout the world? Are     some aspects of gender inquality particularly resistant to reduction,     and if so why? Could change stagnate? Behind such concerns     are two principal questions. What has caused the long-term     pattern of declining gender inequality? And what has preserved     aspects of gender inequality in the face of these accumulating     changes? Combining the answers to these two questions with an     effort to project the relevant influences into the future, is the     basis for trying to understand the possibilities for the future.      Behind this also lies another analytical question with moral     overtones: what does gender equality really mean?                    Analytical       Task 1                    Select two types of inequality, both       important, one that you believe to be moving toward greater       equality at a relatively high rate, the other that you       believe is moving toward equality at a relatively slow rate       (or is stalled or is moving backwards)               for each of these two types, describe what is the        inequality (how are women and men unequal, which women        and men experience it, how do things differ when this        inequality is high from when it is low)         describe the evidence and logic that suggests one        type is declining relatively quickly and the other        relatively slowly                      Try to explain why the two different rates of movement       toward equality               For each, consider what processes, conditions,        interests, and the like propel the movement toward        greater equality         For each, consider what circumstances, activities,        and the like obstruct the movement toward greater        equality         Try to explain how and why the balance between the        causes propelling greater equality and the causes        sustaining existing inequality differ between the two        types of gender inequality                                                 Analytical       Task 2                    The general       analytical problem . Using two       plausible future scenarios about gender inequality, assess       what processes or conditions will decide which future       alternative comes to pass.        The task has the following main parts               Select two         of three alternatives to use for the analysis: highest        conceivable level of equality, highest possibility of in equality,        most likely conditions. Essentially this means        that we compare the two extreme possibilities, or we        compare what we think most likely with one of the        extreme possibilities.         For each of the two        selected alternatives, give a clear description of what        the expected level of gender inequality means.         How severe will be major components of gender        inequality, how consistent will different aspects of        gender inequality be with each other, how consistent        will these patterns be in society, and so on. (It        might help to look back over the range of topics        covered above.)         The center of the        analysis will be to provide a causal argument about        what causal conditions and sequence of developments         could lead to each of the two alternatives.         To this end, we must consider the full        range of causal influences that we have examined        previously.                      Thinking tools .               To consider any future path, we must make assumptions        about: (1) how far into the future, (2) in what society        and with respect to what social groups, and (3) what        other changes might occur, altering the cultural,        political, and economic environment.                  For our purposes, let us set the future to be         about one and two generations, that is when your         children are your current age, and then when their         children reach a similar age. The key         tradeoff with setting the distance into the future         is simple: the further we go into the future the         more interesting and significant are the social         changes but equally the more obscure become the         realistic possibilities.          Let us focus on our own society as a whole,         referencing distinctive social categories as         needed.          Similarly, let us assume that the cultural,         political, and economic environments are reasonably         stable, with the expectation that existing long         term trends will continue into the future. We         will ignore the potential for significant         structural changes and historical \"shocks\" such as         economic recessions and wars. Of course, the         further we look into the future, the more         speculative and fallible such assumptions become,         but our purpose is not to predict the actual         future.                         Looking forward, the future is always uncertain,        however well we may explain it once it becomes the        past. One way to make the future more amenable to        analysis is to simplify it into what we believe are the        principal alternative futures that matter to us.         Probably the simplest technique it to focus on one        characteristic and consider the most extreme plausible        possibilities.         With this in mind, let us try to analyze the future        of gender inequality by contrasting stark        alternatives. To begin consider three        possibilities:                 First, the highest level of gender equality that         we can imagine. This might be the current         state of inequality, or it might be the highest         level of inequality now seen in any comparable         society, or it might be a much higher level of         inequality. The problem here is to imagine         what is the greatest amount of future inequality we         can          Second, the highest level of gender in equality         that we can imagine.          And, third, the most likely level of gender         inequality that we expect. This could         coincide with either one of the previous, but will         commonly be somewhere between them.                         For deciding the plausibility of any future        circumstances, we want to remember that there are two        kinds of limiting conditions we must consider.         First, functional plausibility ,        asking if that level of inequality is feasible in the        context of what we perceive to be the relevant        surrounding circumstances. For a simple example,        a social custom of leaving all property to sons is        largely unworkable in a society with a low reproduction        rate because so many families have no sons.         Second, transition        plausibility , asking if a conceivable        historical path of development could lead from present        circumstances to the future scenario. For a        simple example, it might be possible to conceive how        American society could have functioned with full gender        equality in 1900, but it would extremely difficult to        suggest any plausible way that condition could have        emerged under any conceivable historical sequence from        the social organization of American society in 1850.                              Bringing it together . Our goal here is       not to predict the future of gender inequality, but to       examine what sequence of causal conditions seem likely determinants       of that future. We are trying to discover defensible       \" if, then \" arguments. To do this, we are       starting by imagining possible futures, then working       backwards from them to find paths from the present to those       futures, then asserting what else must occur for those       paths to materialize. We should not forget, there may       be more than one path to an imagined future and more than       one set of causal conditions that could lead us there.        For each alternative being considered, we want to analyze        why and how it might reasonably occur.        As an optional extra, you can offer an analysis of which        alternative seems more likely and why.

How have women's and     men's actions obstructed or furthered change, taking into account     the changing institutional context?       Both women and men    have acted in every possible way towards gender inequality. What    we want to understand are the circumstances in which they predictably    act in ways that either reinforce or erode inequality. People's    actions are complex results of their interests, ideologies,    circumstances, opportunities, and constraints. While theories of    gender inequality invoke all kinds of abstract causal processes, in real    life inequality is sustained and changed by the actions of women and    men. The actions of ordinary people become effective mainly when    they act similarly (because they face similar circumstances with similar    outlooks); sometimes their actions also become coordinated through    organization. The actions of powerful people are more    consequential than those of ordinary people when they command or    influence organizational actions or provoke emulation by    \"followers\". Even unique political actions may have great effect    by altering laws, policies, or the balance of power, although even in    these cases the institutionalization of changes generally depends on    dispersed acceptance; in the economic realm, even organizational actions    typically become effective only when multiple organizations pursue    parallel policies (governmental controls over an economy would be an    exception).           Analytical      Task                  The goal of this task is to       examine why some of men's actions worked against gender       inequality while others sustained it, and similarly why       women's actions also included ones that challenged gender       inequality and others that reinforced it. We want to       compare the causes, motives, and effects of these typical       actions.               \"Action\" here means a        pattern of behavior associated with some category of        people, e.g. the tendency to take or not take advantage of        educational opportunities by women of some type in some        period. The relevant actions are those that were one        typical result either of being either in certain enduring        categories of women or men (for example, single women with        higher education) or in certain recurring circumstances        (for example, married women whose husbands lost their jobs        for long periods). The category could include all        women or all men.        To say that actions        reinforce gender inequality means that they either bolster        the stability of gender inequality or help to make it more        severe; alternatively, if those actions became rare        and were not replaced by alternative actions with        similar effects, then either the degree of gender        inequality experienced by some people would decline or the        persistence of gender inequality would become more        problematic. (by the identified group in the        identified conditions)        Analogously, to say that        actions challenge gender inequality means that those        actions, if taken by enough people, result in reducing the        amount of gender inequality or they erode the stability of        gender inequality making it more vulnerable to future        challenges.                    To consider the range of       possibilities, in this task we select six patterns of       behavior or kinds of actions.               Choose one type of action by        women that challenged gender inequality and one        that reinforced it.        Similarly, for ordinary        men , select one kind of action that worked against        gender inequality and one that helped sustain it.        Finally, do the same for men        with power .                    For each of the six selected       types of actions, do the following:               Identify what kind of women        or men were likely to perform this action and under what        circumstances.        Describe the action,        including an assessment of its effects on gender        inequality. This may include consideration of        reasons why its effects might vary (e.g., the number        acting might have to surpass a threshold before there are        widespread effects, the effects might be contingent on        other conditions, the effects might happen after a delay,        and so on).        Try to specify the reasons        why this type of action occurred. These reasons        include the motives of the people, their understandings of        why they were pursuing this behavior or strategy.         The reasons also include the social and cultural        conditions that induce the actions and make them seem        necessary, sensible, and just. The reasons may also        include triggering events.                    To summarize: Pick six kinds of       behavior that have made a difference to the persistence of       gender inequality, one reinforcing and one challenging for       each of the three categories: women, ordinary men, powerful       men. Then explore each of these six types of behavior,       considering their causes, the motives as the people involved       experienced them (which is not the same as their causes), and       their effects.

How do the media    influence or reflect gender inequality?     Commentators often point toward media influence when   they try to explain contemporary gender inequality. Theories of media alert    us that we must always consider reciprocal causal processes. While any    individual may appear only to be the object of media influence, the content    and impact of media depend greatly on the existing culture and social    structure. The relationship of the media to the collective market effect of    consumers may be compared to the relationship between elected public officials    and voters. Also, consumers have considerable freedom to choose which media    outlets to give their attention and people selectively interpret and judge    the media to which they are exposed. All of this makes the relationship    between what is portrayed in the media and what occur in the \"real\" world    rather complex.          Analytical     Task                 Select one kind of popular/mass media, such as magazines or the      cinema, or, alternatively, a form of popular culture thought to      have an analogous impact, such as popular music.       Prepare a simple comparative analysis of current examples to      examples from around 1980, a third of a century ago.             Choose a small, reasonable sample from the two       periods. For example, the samples might be       advertisements from three magazines present in both periods,       or the female and male protagonists of top earning movies, or       the lyrics of the highest rated songs.        Using the dimensions or characteristics identified in the       readings, (or analogous ones that better fit the media you are       assessing), characterize the differences in the ways women and       men are portrayed in the two periods.                   Given the results of your comparisons, show how the data you      observe might be explained by (1) theories stressing the influence      of the media on gender expectations, evaluations, and behavior, or      (2) theories stressing the media as reflecting gender inequality,      or (3) theories stressing market segmentation (audiences choose      among media offerings and media makers aim at audience segments.       Prepare a simple, reasonable response to the questions, \"What is      the basic causal relationship between mass media and gender       inequality?\" and \"How      is the correspondence between media portrayals and real-life      gender inequality sustained over time as gender inequality changes?

How have political     processes and structures sustained men's and women's relative     status? [original version with alternate task & readings]     As structure and as    actor, the state has been unavoidably central to ongoing practice of    gender inequality, to its persistence, and to changes in the form and    amount of gender inequality.      States or governments have power. Through the    military and police, a state can enforce conformity to its rules, repel    and punish challenges from the scale of individual acts to collective    rebellions, and by threat, implicit or explicit, deter rebellions from    appearing. Through the law, regulations, and bureaucratic policies, a    state can define what constitutes acceptable or legitimate behavior at    all levels of social organization. Through economic policies of    taxation, expenditures, and redistributions (such as welfare policies or    agricultural supports), a state influences the relative economic status    of different groups.      By acting differently toward groups with regard to    any of these aspects of government power, a state can create, reinforce,    or exacerbate social inequalities. Analogously, a state can, in theory,    obstruct, destabilize, or diminish social inequality by using its power    in ways that are inconsistent with social inequalities. States    determine, influence, legitimize, and sanction rights and opportunities;    they may do so in more or less egalitarian ways.      When significant, enduring, social inequality    exists, those privileged by that form of inequality will normally have    more influence over the state than do those disadvantaged by the    inequality, and the overall effect of state policies will reinforce the    exercise and persistence of the inequality. A fundamental problem for    all state theories is who or what decides state policies and actions. To    some degree, those \"in\" the state (elected, appointed, hired, or    appropriated) make decisions based on their interests and outlooks as    members of the state apparatus. To some degree, state actors respond to    the influence of power brokers outside the state, such as the    economically powerful. In either case, when making policy or strategic    planning decisions, those influencing state actions are in part    responding to what they perceive will be the responses of all actors in    the nation affected by those decisions.           Analytical      Task                   Task summary: Assess the most       important ways the American state (or some other) has       influenced and been influenced by gender inequality over the       past two hundred years. Try to keep in mind that this       always concerns the accumulation and exercise of social power.              What are the crucial ways that       government reflected gender inequality?                Consider how and why the        state treated women and men differently         Consider ways that the        state helped gender inequality operate smoothly         Consider how the state        helped gender inequality to persist                     How and why has the state       promoted gender equality by reducing the differences in its       treatment of women? How has the state How and why has       the state made it difficult (and irrational) for many to       continue practices that disadvantage women?        How and why have the relevant       government actions changed over time?         While developing the analysis       for this task, it can be helpful to examine how the       relationship between the state and gender inequality resembled       or differed from the state's relationships to other kinds of       inequality.

Description \u2013 Scope, Organization, and Access    :      The     scope of the topics and materials . Each kind of    social inequality \u2013 such as class or gender \u2013 has distinctive dynamics and    each concrete instance of inequality has historically and culturally    specific characteristics. Yet, all social inequalities also share    critical common effects and requirements for persistence. For    example, all social inequalities produce legitimating ideologies, all    must curb resistance, all have to transfer the unequal resources and    positions to new generations, all produce divergent interests. To    understand a structural characteristic of some kind of inequality \u2013 such    as legitimation processes in a class system or violence in gender    inequality \u2013 we want to recognize that they represent a combination of the    dynamics common to most inequality systems and the specific    characteristics of that type of inequality. The topics below    pursue a series of fundamental questions about social inequalities,    seeking to investigate the general dynamics of inequalities, comparing    these dynamics across different types of inequality. Examples of    these topics include: what are the roles of interests in various kinds    of inequalities, how is inequality sustained across generations, what    processes induce conformity among both the advantaged and disadvantaged,    what mechanisms prevent rebellion, and what decides the intensity of    inequalities?     The readings represent the core of the stratification field in    sociology, the materials that sociologists working in this area expect    other others in the area to know, plus materials needed to pursue    important analytic issues under represented in the field.      The class     organization and goals . The class is intended for both    beginning and advanced graduate students. Critical    requirements for taking this course are a strong interest in inequality    and a commitment to the class project of investigating new ideas.     In this class, each week's activities will be organized around an    analytical task, as well as a set of readings. Rather than    focusing on discussion of the readings, the analytical tasks involve    attempting an analysis of inequality related to the week's issue,    building on the materials we read (in brief papers of 2-3 pages).     While mastering the existing research and theory is obviously a    prerequisite to doing good work, the approach in this class seeks to    develop analytical skills as well as understandings of the literature by    stressing actual analyses of inequality rather discussions of the    literature.     The course readings stress the foundational sociological literature on    inequality. Each week we will all look at some common    readings. The course guide will also point toward a range of other    recommended and related readings for further study for each topic -    students are not expected to read these optional materials as part of    the course. The recommended and related readings represent what a    student seeking to specialize in this area might read. Students in the    class are encouraged to scan these optional lists each week and look at    any pieces that seem particularly valuable or interesting.     All class meetings are organized as discussions. Part of our    class discussions will be on the common readings and part on students'    efforts to explore the analytical tasks each week. We will    adjust the time devoted to these two goals according to our experiences    over the class. Every week, students will initiate discussions on    readings and papers.

A note on the \"hidden\" material     below : Each section of this guide includes \u2013     beside the common readings \u2013 three subsections, one for an analytical     task , one for recommended readings , and one for related     readings . To simplify navigating through the course guide,    only the headings for these subsections are initially visible. The    content of all these subsections are hidden (so that the beginning    appearance of the page is similar to a standard syllabus) until the    viewer clicks on the subsection heading, then its contents will    appear. While this organization is helpful for negotiating the    page most of the time, it can become an obstacle if we want to search    the page (for example, for a particular article) as searches will ignore    the hidden material. To overcome this limitation, it is possible    to show all the hidden sections by clicking the \u00a7 symbol at the top     of the page (and simply reload the page to    collapse all the \"hidden\" sections to their usual look). The table    of contents at the top of the page will still work to aid speedy    navigation to any section.                The Topics         I.

How can we conceive of and talk about social inequality in ways that are    general enough to apply across the range of relevant phenomena, consistent    enough to minimize conceptual ambiguities, and precise enough to be    analytically effective? Inequality is ubiquitous. People are    unequal in every conceivable way in endless circumstances, both immediate    and enduring, by both objective criteria and subjective experience.     So, what counts as social inequality ? Can we characterize it    in ways that let us confidently and impartially assess when there is more    or less of it?          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: What is social inequality ?       We often think that the meaning of social inequality is      self-evident or easy. Perhaps it is when we focus on extreme      versions of the more obvious forms of social inequality, such as      the rich compared to the poor. But, equally, perhaps it is      not when we consider inequalities that are subler or more      complex, such as those based on sexual preference or ethnic      identity or between nations. We want to begin by looking a      little deeper into our conceptualization of social inequalities.       Choose two kinds of inequality . For each kind of      inequality, consider an example showing a high degree of      inequality and another showing equality or a minimal amount of      inequality. Here we are simply trying to conceive a simple 2      x 2 table, showing two kinds of inequality and two levels of      inequality for each kind. This is the simplest design for      doing social analyses, whether that analysis is empirical or      theoretical. (Note: It is fine to use standard, commonly      discussed kinds of inequality, but being original and creative      about kinds of inequality to consider is also good.)       Describe (briefly) how the relevant groups are unequal for      each type. For each of these two kinds of inequality,      try to list the main ways that those affected are      unequal. For now, do not worry about why       such inequality exists. For now we are concerned with what      we mean by inequality, not what causes it. Try to specify      the crucial experiences, opportunities, or other circumstances      that distinguish the beneficiaries of the inequality from those      who are disadvantaged. Consider also the relationships      between the disadvantaged and advantaged, both direct and      indirect. (The idea of \" indirect relationships\"      refers to ways that the advantaged or disadvantaged influence the      circumstances or actions of those who are differently situated      without direct interaction, e.g. by controlling government      policies or creating a culture of fear.) In short, for each      of the two types of inequality, what induces us to call one      example high inequality and another low?       A final question . After working through the      questions above, try to complete a definition sentence beginning \"In      general, social inequality exists when ... .\" The goal      of this sentence is to provide a definition of social inequality      general enough to embrace the range of social inequalities but      also precise enough to distinguish social inequality from its      absence. The implicit strategy is compare what social      inequality means for the two chosen examples, then to try to      identify the common conditions that make them (and other forms)      all merit being called \"social inequality\" (distinguished from the      characteristics specific to certain types of inequality or      concrete historical and cultural conditions). To do this      involves not only the empirical comparison, but the appropriate      conceptual abstraction.       For the ambitious (to develop a       deeper grasp)...              Here are some other issues that you       might integrate into your initial assessment of inequalities               Vantage points . Might       some people (scholars, political actors, others) disagree       that any of the components you identify should really be       considered inequality ? If so, why?        (The goal here is to think through the reasons that people       disagree about what should be called inequality?)        Try to figure out how we might measure         the amount of inequality. Of the ways that you       have listed people being unequal, select which of these       differences seem most important. What might be       reasonable ways to measure each identified facet       of inequality? For each kind of inequality you have       selected an example where inequality is high and another       where it is low. Can you think of a measurement       procedure that will allow one to look at any society or       group and determine if some aspect of inequality is high,       medium, or low? Focus on realistic means that could be       applied in research, that could be used for the same aspects       of inequality when they apply to other kinds of       inequality. Do this only for the two or three facets       of inequality in your examples that seem most decisive.               For each of the two types of       inequality, if we put aside differences in the circumstances       of advantaged and disadvantaged people, what important       differences in social organization distinguish societies (or       other social groupings such as communities or organizations)       where that type of inequality is high from those where it is       low? The goal here is to consider if societies (or       other levels of social organization containing inequality)       that have high levels of some type of inequality       consistently differ from societies that have low levels, in       ways other than the difference in the level of this kind of       inequality.        Most people responding to the       prompts above will think about inequality between kinds of       people. Consider two other important concerns.        First, inequality may be between positions rather than       people (this is a critical concern which we will address       later). Second, inequality may concern \"units\" other       that people, such as families or organizations or nations.                                       Common Readings          David B.

What are common forms of social inequality?     What is the range of social inequalities that we should be addressing?    Pundits, scholars, and ordinary people usually focus on the couple    forms of inequality they experience as most troubling. Contemporary    sociology's sometimes blinkered perspective is reflected in the many    readers and texts on race, class, and gender. The range of analytically    relevant inequalities is considerably wider.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical Task : This week's task is to identify      major forms of inequality in two societies. The goal      is to see the range of inequalities that exist in      different societies. The remainder of this task description      just tries to show how to approach this systematically.       To start, choose two societies with which you have some      familiarity. It is fine to use this society or an another      society in which you have lived as one example (but it is an      interesting challenge to use two societies you have not      experienced). The two societies can be from two different      parts of the world or from different points in time. The      main goal is to use two societies that differ significantly in      their structure and culture, regardless whether those differences      reflect location, culture, historical circumstance, or something      else.       For each example (society), identify the significant,      widely-present forms of social inequality that persist      over time.              \"widely present\" means not limited to certain locations nor       small parts of the population; note that many instances of       inequality that are limited to particular places or subgroups       are, however, examples of some more generally defined kind of       inequality, so moving to a higher level of generality or       categorization identifies a widely present inequality of which       they are specific examples        two or more instances of inequality with a similar system or       structure but involving different populations should usually       be considered to of the same kind (e.g., similar ethnic       inequality processes or structures may apply to Hindi and       Chinese minorities)        The aim here is not to see how long the list of inequalities       might be, but we do want to see how diverse the forms of       inequality can be, and to consider if important kinds of       inequality are overlooked.                   Try to describe briefly each form of inequality       identified (for each society), by indicating:             to what degree is the inequality more a continuous gradation       (like years of age) or more a division into distinct       categories (like employed vs. unemployed)        what is unequal, that is what are the assets, opportunities,       capacities, relationships, or whatever that define the       inequality by their unequal distribution (this is not        what explains the inequality, but simply what is       unequal); this is self-evident for some kinds of inequality,       but not for others.        who is advantaged and who disadvantaged; in       essence, this asks how are the advantaged people different       from the disadvantaged people not only in the advantages that       define the inequality, but in other ways as well (e.g. for       ethnic inequalities, the groups are, in theory, defined by       ethnic identity [although ethnicity is tricky]; distinguishing       characteristics for some kinds of inequality might be more       difficult to characterize, and could, in theory, not exist if       placement is random)        [ optional \u2013 how do the disadvantaged and the       advantaged perceive the inequality?; do they have similar or       different conceptions of what is unequal, why they are       disadvantaged or advantaged, whether it is fair, and the       like?]                   In short , for two societies, you are preparing a list      of outstanding inequalities, that gives the primary      characteristics of each kind of inequality. You could make      this either as two lists or as two simple tables.       Finally , having prepared a catalog of the primary forms      of social inequality in the two societies, how would you compare      the two societies with respect to their patterns of social      inequality? All we are looking for here are initial,      outstanding differences and similarities (note that similarities      are at least as important as differences). To be clear, we      are just looking for an initial impression \u2013 a comprehensive      comparison would be a major project, obviously far beyond our      scope.             If this aspect of the analysis seems baffling, overwhelming,       or obscure initially, consider the following questions.        Does the overall amount of inequality seem greater in one       society than the other or similar or does this seem impossible       to guess? Do the structures of the societies or their       potential for change seem to be dominated by different or       similar inequalities? Does inequality overall seem more       rigid in one society than the other? Do major forms of       inequality seem to overlap a lot, or are they distinctive and       rather independent from each other? Is inequality more       continuous in one society and more categorical in the       other?                   For the ambitious with time to go       further:              How might we categorize the varied       forms of inequality discerned in the two societies into       groups defined by some notable similarities? For       example, if we have twelve types of inequality initially,       could we usefully fit them into two or three categories that       reflect their similarities (and differences)? Here are       some examples of criteria that might be used to categorize       inequalities:                Consider the processes        producing them         Consider who is advantaged and        disadvantaged         Consider how one form affects        the others         Consider their legitimacy claims                 Consider their histories                 Consider any other reasonable        logic you can conceive for grouping them, remembering        that a useful analytic taxonomy will usually rely on        some aspect of causation                      Do any of the forms of social       inequality seem more important to the structure and       organizational dynamics of a society than do others?        If so, why?

IV. What distinguishes legitimate from illegitimate    forms of inequality?     We often use the term inequality to refer only to forms of    inequality we consider unjust or otherwise undesirable. Yet, much    inequality is commonly accepted as appropriate, fair, or desirable in    societies. The amount of legitimacy attributed to a form of    inequality can be anywhere between extremely high (e.g. the authority of    parents over infants) to extremely low (e.g., slavery in a modern society    with well-developed civil rights). The assessment of    legitimacy should always consider potential differences among    differentially situated groups (e.g., those enjoying advantages in a    system of inequality, those disadvantaged, and those relatively    unaffected), and the degree of agreement or disagreement about legitimacy    assessments. Analytically, we want to ask what processes or    conditions cause a form of inequality to be considered more or less    legitimate. When does the legitimacy status of inequality change or    become contested?          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task : Using examples of two kinds of      inequality, consider what circumstances appear to foster or to      erode the acceptance of the inequality as legitimate.       First , select two kinds of inequality .       These can be from any place or time, but it might be simpler if      they coexist in the same society. They do not need to be      inequalities considered socially \"important.\" For each       kind of inequality, select one example or circumstance with      high \"legitimacy\" when those involved appear accepting or      complacent and another example or circumstance with      low \"legitimacy\" when those involved contest the      inequality. Thus you are considering four examples in all,      two that are uncontested, high legitimacy and two that are      contested, low legitimacy, based on the two types of      inequality. This is, once again, the simplest comparative      design for social analysis, essentially a two by two table, with      one direction being the two kinds of inequality and the other      being the two levels of legitimacy. (Whether an inequality      is perceived as legitimate and whether it is contested are not the      same, but we are simplifying for our current goals.)       Second , for each of the two kinds of inequality,      describe what are the principal arguments or claims offered       by the advantaged (or their representatives) to defend or      explain the system of inequality in the examples you have      chosen.              Look for arguments that respond to three common claims in       defense of inequality, that it is (1) just, (2)       necessary, and (3) beneficial to all.        Where possible, identify the general cultural beliefs or       symbols from which the arguments seek to gain acceptance or       weight, such as religious beliefs, science, or fear of       outsiders.                    Is it possible to distinguish between claims that seem to be       historically or culturally contingent and those more       fundamental to the particular kind of inequality?        [Explanatory note: If we compare organized religions we find       that all have practices and rituals for marriage. Many       of the specific rituals are artifacts of the historical       conditions in which they emerged, and would just as       effectively if they were different. Some aspects of       these practices, such as significant property exchanges (e.g.,       bride price) may reflect functional needs of the prevailing       economic and kinship system, although their concrete       manifestation can vary. Some even more general aspects,       such as requirement of marriage to identify kinship       relationships of children may reflect fundamental requirements       for the functional order of any kinship system. Claims       about inequality can similarly be categorized from the       historically arbitrary to those that seem unavoidable.]                   Third , when describing the legitimacy claims, consider      if the claims when the inequality is contested differ from      when its acceptance is largely unproblematic. That is, for each of      the two kinds of inequality, what seems to distinguish the      examples where legitimacy claims succeed from those where they      fail?             When the disadvantaged seem to accept legitimacy claims,       which arguments appear to be convincing or acceptable to       them? Why do they accept these?        When the disadvantaged question and contest the legitimacy       of the inequality, what are the principal counter arguments       they use? Their counter arguments suggest how the       legitimacy claims are failing.                   In short , you are developing a description of the ways      that people try to legitimate two kinds of inequalities, comparing      examples where the legitimacy efforts succeed with examples where      they do not. The goal is not to explain the range of these      claims or when they succeed, but to get a first level sense of      what legitimacy claims are and why they are important.       Finally , in response to the preceding analysis you have      developed of legitimacy claims regarding four examples of      inequality (based on two types of inequality), try to state      three general hypotheses about legitimacy claims, the role      of legitimacy, or conflicts over legitimacy in systems of      inequality. Elaborate each of these hypotheses just enough      that we can understand what they mean and what motivates      them.              These are hypotheses , which means they are not       theories and not claims we can defend. Rather, we can       think of them as informed speculations about what might be       true. They are ideas worth researching or worth thinking       about if trying to develop a theory about the legitimation of       inequality. Essentially, this is asking what ideas       spring to mind as a result of doing the empirical comparisons       in this task.

Down So Long (unpublished      ms.). Disputed      Ideals: Ideologies of Domesticity and Feminist Rebellion                             V. What is the critical distinction between positional    inequality and status inequality?     To put it simply, positional inequality refers to inequalities    between \"positions\" such as the different levels in an organizational    hierarchy (e.g., president, divisional manager, supervisor, clerk).     These locations give their advantages and disadvantages to the people who    circulate through them. Status inequality refers to social    advantages and disadvantages that adhere to categories of people without    regard to the positions they hold (such as race). Grasping the    differences between these two \"types\" of inequality and the relationships    between them is crucial for analytic clarity. (This distinction has    some similarity to the common contrast between achieved status and    ascribed status, but it is analytically different. Our distinction    stresses the way inequality is socially organized while the    achieved/ascribed concepts refer to the ways people acquire a    characteristic.)          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: How do positional and status      inequalities differ and how are those differences important?       Select two examples of positional inequalities and two      examples of status inequalities . The examples may be two      fundamentally different kinds of positional (or status) inequality      or they may be two distinctive instances of the same kind of      inequality appearing in different societies (e.g., racial      inequality in a plantation economy and racial inequality in a      market economy). It will probably be easier to use four      reasonably concrete examples (such as contemporary racial      inequality in Britain). Using more general categories (such      as racial inequality in market economies) is a more ambitious      strategy.             As usual, for each type of inequality, clearly describe who       are the advantaged and the disadvantaged and how they are       unequal.                   Enumerate the characteristics that distinguish the two      examples of positional inequality from the two examples of      status inequality . To put it differently, in what ways are      both examples of positional inequality different from both      examples of status inequality? Examples of things to      consider include (but should not be limited to):             homogeneity of people sharing similar standing (i.e., level       of [dis]advantage)        intergenerational rigidity (likelihood of having same       standing as parents)        ways that people's standing may improve or decline over time              diffuseness of impact on people's lives (i.e., what       proportion of people's time, activities, and relationships are       highly influenced)        legal status and government role in regulating, preserving,       or challenging the inequality        legitimation processes (content of the justifying ideology,       who or what promotes the legitimacy)        historical roots of the inequality structure                   For each difference you identify above between the positional      and status inequalities, please             briefly describe how the positional and status inequalities       seem to differ with respect to this characteristic, and,        if you can, suggest what might explain the difference (or,       to put it differently, suggest why you would expect this       difference to distinguish other examples of status and       positional inequalities).                   In short : We are making an initial effort to      identify general ways that systems of positional inequality differ      from systems of status inequality. The goal is to produce a      list of plausible differences, and to get a first sense of what      form these differences will take and why they appear.             note that we are again using a very basic \"research design,\"       comparing two examples of positional inequality with two       examples of status inequality; this is the simplest possible       design for trying to identify differences between two       categories (as we must have at least two examples of each       category to make the simplest control for other sources of       variation among the phenomena being categorized, in this case       instances of social inequality)                   Finally : Based on the differences you enumerate and      explore from your examples, what hypotheses do you have about      general differences between positional and status inequalities?

VI. How do we understand \"honor\" status hierarchies,    that lack apparent material bases?     Academia is one good example of a well-developed system (or systems) of    honorific inequality. High school peer groups are often good    examples of short-lived patterns of reputational inequality. The    idea of celebrity is usually associated with unequal prestige. The    key to honorific inequalities is that people compete for recognition and    deference, rather than material goods, power, or opportunities.     Purely honorific inequality structures are rare, as the pursuit of    prestige is commonly intermingled with materialistic inequities. The study    of honor and prestige systems (other than in the specialized form of    occupational prestige) is underdeveloped in sociology. Theoretical    works recognize its significance, but most treat honorific inequality as    both causally derivative and of marginal importance when compared to    economic and political inequalities. While prestige and honor are    elusively intangible, we are likely to misunderstand any type of    inequality if they are ignored.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: What do non-material      inequalities of honor or prestige look like in practice and what      is the logic of their processes?       Select two (or more) examples of honorific inequality      systems , where people \"compete\" directly for recognition,      respect, and deference. Such systems often include income and      power rewards. But we are looking for forms of inequality      where honorific status is central. Here are several      reasonable identifying characteristics to consider:             Does honor (or prestige or the like) motivate competition       for desirable locations as much as does power or material       rewards?        Is deference to others determined as much by their perceived       prestige as by their structural position, wealth, authority,       or the like?        In general, are honor or prestige acts at least as much a       cause of material rewards as it is a result of them?                   For each inequality system selected , try to      develop an analytical assessment of the way it works by responding      to these:             Identify and describe as well as you can what       conveys or is experienced as honor ; consider how it       looks both from within and from outside; think about ways that       the lives of those with more honor differ from the lives of       those with less; also, think about how we know which people       have more honor, or to put it differently, how we know to whom       we should defer and who should defer to us. (Think about       titles, awards, forms of dress, access to activities, and so       forth.)        Describe what people do to gain honor or to compete       for honor.        What decides the distribution of honor overall       within each system? Consider what processes and which       people decide who has more honor. Is it controlled from       the top or the bottom? Are people aware who decides the       outcomes?        What induces people to accept and conform        to the expectations of the prestige system? Why do they       defer to those who possess more honor? (Consider both       the carrots and the sticks.)                   Compare these systems of honor and prestige to       the systems of positional and status inequality we have      considered. Try to identify two or more important      differences and two or more important similarities,      explaining as best you can why you think each of these differences      and similarities exist.       In short , the aim of this week's task is to compare two      specific examples of honor inequality systems (and secondarily      compare them to inequalities where honor is secondary) to get an      initial sense of how honor inequality systems work.

How do people experience inequality and why do    these experiences matter?     Research on inequalities commonly treats experience as a simple effect    of inequality; interesting but secondary to theory and explanation.     Here we want to think of experience not only as a result, but also as a    potential ingredient to the explanation of inequalities. The    experiences of inequalities can serve as strong motivating forces at all    levels. The experiences also encompass not only the outcomes of    inequality, but all the processes that sustain or challenge it.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: How do lower-status and      higher-status people experience inequalities and their locations      within them? With what consequences for the systems of      inequality?       Select two systems of inequality : one in which      you have (now or in the past) been in a relatively low-status      location and another system in which you have been in a relatively      high-status location. The point here is to select systems in      which you have observational knowledge about the experience of      inequality. If possible, use a form of positional inequality      for one example and status inequality for the other, but it okay      if that is too much of a stretch given your biography.              As usual, briefly describe each system of inequality.        Who are included, what is unequally distributed, who are       advantaged or disadvantaged, and the like. If you are       going to consider a subset of a larger system of inequality,       be clear about what you are doing and why.        (OPTIONAL \u2013 To go further ... To       seek a more complete means of assessing experience, double       the examples, to consider two systems in which you have       experienced low standing and two in which you have had       higher standing, again representing both status inequality       and positional inequality if possible. This will give       you much more traction for seeing generalization       possibilities, but the time requirements may be more than       you can manage.)                   For each of these systems of inequality, try to characterize ,      briefly, how those in      high-status locations have different experiences than those in      low-status locations . This is not easy to do      well. Among other things, note that it is rarely obvious      which kinds of experiences matter more and it is difficult to      reduce the varieties of experience into a few categories that are      not arbitrary.       Focus on typ ical or defining       experiences. While experience seems inherently      individualistic because it is to such a degree private and      internal, the goal here is to move beyond the individual.       Systems of social inequality are comprised of socially organized      \"structures,\" processes, and cultural understandings. In the      search of a social analysis of inequality, we are looking for      common or shared experiences (understanding that these may be      shared unequally, so that there are alternative experiences common      to subgroups determined by other conditions, circumstance, or even      random variation). A good way to start is by thinking about      typical experience.       To make this effort more systematic and comparable, while trying      to assess differences in experience, here are dimensions you      might consider :             How much and in what ways do people recognize the inequality       and think about it? For example, people may                grasp the outlines of social inequality between groups        or positions         see themselves as being in unequal relationships, but        not have a conception of this as part of a larger pattern        of inequality (e.g., when women or men see themselves as        superior or inferior to the other sex, but do not perceive        there to be gender inequality)         people may not be able to conceptualize their experience        of an inequality as being inequality, but think of it in        different terms (e.g., believing it is not that \"they\" are        inferior or that \"we\" discriminate against \"them,\" \"they\"        are just different)                      in what way do people seem to perceive or talk about       fairness with respect to an inequality?               what sense of fairness do they have in their own        position?         and how do they think about the fairness of the        existence of inequality (of this sort)?                      how do the advantaged and disadvantaged have distinctive       experiences about what other people who share their standing       are like?               do the reference groups have different demographic        compositions (e.g. sex, ethnicity, age, class) apart from        the defining distinctions due to that inequality?         are their cultural differences in the ways people dress,        ways of talking, leisure activities, religiosity, or the        like?                      how do people perceive those at their level as different       from those at the other end of the inequality spectrum, and       how do they interact differently with them?               In particular, what, if any, are the common patterns of        deference when interacting with a previously unknown        person at the other end of the inequality spectrum?        (Most importantly, presumably, within the        institutional context embracing this form of inequality,        but also, potentially, in external contexts.)                      How do advantaged and disadvantaged people differ in general       ways that they experience the possibilities and realities of       life?               how do people experience ambition vs.        resignation?;         how do they differ in expectations for the future?         do they allocate blame for failures and credit for        successes (of the individual) differently?         do they have different orientations toward behavioral        tendencies such as violence, intimidation, manipulation,        cooperation, and subservience?         are there significant differences in religiosity?         do they seem to feel different loyalties toward the        institution surrounding the structure of inequality,        toward those in a similar location in the inequality        structure, toward those at a different level?         how do they differ in their trust in authority and        government?                      If you can, consider the implications of social mobility or       changing social standing for these experiences of       inequalities. That is, do people differ in their       experience of a location in a system of inequality depending       on how they got there?                Note that even people distinguished by locations in a        system of status inequalities may experience some form of        mobility. First, they may experience a shift in the        relative weight of the status inequality due to changes in        other status investing characteristics; an example        could be different meaning of race for affluent        blacks vs. poor blacks and affluent whites vs. poor        whites, where the analytical class difference may be        experience in terms of race. Second, the standing of        an entire status group or category may change over time;        consider, for example, the changes that have been seen by        middle-age blacks and whites in South Africa or women and        men in many countries.         Note that someone whose status appears unchanged may        experience it differently because the statuses of        significant others do change                      How do people differ in their experiences of being       advantaged or disadvantaged in the referent form of inequality       depending on their location in other important forms of       inequality? (For example, how does the experience of       being Native American differ between the highly educated and       the low educated?)                   In short , the goal of this task is to contrast the      experiences of being advantaged with those of being disadvantaged      under two different kinds of inequality. The goal is to      examine these differences systematically, and to consider their      causes and their consequences.       Finally , after completing work on the issues above,      considering the patterns of similarities and dissimilarities you      have discussed, can you devise any general hypotheses about the      experience of inequalities? That is, from the specific      patterns of differences you observe in your cases, what general      differences might you expect to find in other inequalities, in the      experiences of inequality, and in the causes and effects of those      experiences?

How should we conceive interests in the    analysis of inequality?     Almost everyone analyzing any system of inequality refers    to \"interests\" sooner or later, even authors who emphasize cultural    or normative explanations. Yet, interests usually receive casual,    unsystematic treatment. This casual reliance on interests builds on    two simple assumptions: (1) a range of relevant potential actions and    events will have differential consequences for people depending on their    location in a system of inequality and (2) anticipation or past    experiences of these consequences will influence peoples' actions.     From this starting point the considerations of interests take many routes,    considering objective and subjective interests, individual versus    collective interests, realistic compared to misconceived interests,    consistent versus inconsistent interests, contradictory and ambiguous    interests, and so on. Simply put, every theory of inequality relies    on a theory of interests (even if a negative theory).          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Interests       Select two examples of inequality; if possible, use one example      of positional inequality and one of status inequality.             Characterize who are the advantaged and who are the       disadvantaged in each example        As always, specify clearly what is unequal        If an example is not itself a system of inequality, but a       subsystem, a site where the effects of a system of inequality       are played out, or an intersection between systems of       inequality, then be clear what the relevant system or systems       of inequality might be                   For each example, examine the interests that seem to be      determined by the social organization of inequality, regardless      how people recognize them.             List the most important ways that the \"objective\" interests       of the advantaged are at odds with those of the       disadvantaged; here the objective interests means the       interests implied by the structure of inequality and their       location within this structure, regardless of their       recognition of the interests        Similarly, list the most important ways that the \"objective\"       interests of advantaged people or groups converge with       those of the disadvantaged. Here we are concerned with       interests related to conditions or practices that have a       widespread influence, usually where both the advantaged and       disadvantaged are exposed to common effects. For example,       potentially a shared interest between officials of an       autocratic government and the citizenry in maintaining public       peace would be relevant, but parallel or similar interests in       being healthy would not. Similarly, the employers and       workers in a corporation may have divided interests about the       distribution of the company's income, but they have convergent       interests in the corporation being successful.        For the above assessments, both the interests at odds and       those that converge, consider whether the objective interests       seem try to characterize the most important interests in terms       of their clarity, consistency, extremity, and the like.        thinking about objective interests not as an individual       experiences them, but as they are produced and sustained by       the systems of inequality, how would you ?                   Now, a really tough part. As best you can, with these      examples, consider how interests become recognized or conceived       by people who are subject to the interest-producing circumstances      of inequality.               We want to avoid the temptation to think about this in terms       of the reasons an individual might choose one way or       another. Instead, we want to examine how the       characteristics of objective interests or the structure of the       relevant inequality induces people to interpret their       interests in one way or another. We are seeking the       social conditions or dynamics that direct the conception of       interests.        Note to begin that people may conceive their interests as       some subset of the objective interests previously identified,       or they may rely on conceptions that ignore or even oppose the       objective interests.        What institutional and cultural processes or arrangements       seem to influence the emergence of common interests based on       the inequalities in your examples? E.g., the aged       or young adults may have a strong, self-conscious sense of       common interests under some circumstances but at other times       not recognize possible shared interests.; what determines when       they do see their concerns as common interests? Given       the objective interests you have identified, think under what       conditions you would expect people more likely to identify and       pursue each of those objective interests as opposed to the       conditions under which they would not do so. Similarly,       consider under what conditions people might be prone to       misinterpret their interests entirely. Or, under what       conditions they are more likely to stress oppositional       interests and under what conditions they will emphasize the       interests they have in common with those with whom they are       unequal?        For each example, in what important ways and under what       circumstances do people's conceived interests seem to diverge       from their objective interests? (A classic example       occurs when members of a group, such as the working class,       believe their interests are best served by a political party       that is actually committed to policies that threaten their       interests, such as those typically associated with       Republicans.) What seems to account for the       disjunctions? (Consider both the advantaged and the       disadvantaged.)                   For the inequalities you are using, when and where do individual      interests seem to contradict collective interests? What      consequences does this have? (E.g., it is generally      in students' collective interest that professors grade all      students the same way, but tall, pretty boys have individual      interests in biased grading if professors favor tall, pretty      boys.)       In short , the goal here is to develop some initial      ideas about the ways that interests work. We use two      examples as the simplest design that allows us to begin      generalizing about inequality, rather than describing the      character of a single instance. Using the chosen examples,      we want to produce some initial ideas about the range of objective      interests, both oppositional and shared, created by an inequality      system. Then we want to ask how people's conceptions of      their interests arise out of those objective interests in      interaction with impinging social conditions. And, in      particular we want to consider how and why conceived interests      might diverge from or even become inconsistent with objective      interests.

IX. What determines the allocation of people (or    other relevant unit) within a positional system of inequality?     This issue includes questions commonly addressed in the literatures    on social mobility and status attainment (and on placement within    organizations). More or less independent of its occupants, a system    of positional inequality has a static     \"structure\" characterized by the direct relationships of    authority and dependence between positions ; the ranking of    positions according to the rewards, authority, opportunities, and statuses    attached to them; and the demographic profile defined by the number of    positions of each type. A positional inequality system also has a dynamic     structure defined by the movement of people through it, both    within careers and between generations. These two components of    structure \u2013 the static and the dynamic \u2013 are linked by the selection    processes controlling access to positions. We can usefully conceive    positional inequality as the juxtaposition of two parallel systems that    are often confused or conflated: first, the structure of relationships    among the positions constituting the system of inequality (e.g., the    enduring authority relationship between a managerial position and a    line-worker position), and, second, the relations between the people who    occupy these positions (e.g., the interactions between managers and    workers). The patterns of people's movement between positions both    reflects and influences the relationships among positions, but it also    shows the impact of impinging status inequalities. To understand the    inequalities among people, we obviously need to understand what decides    which people occupy which positions.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: We will explore how positional      inequalities work. Recall that two general examples of positional      inequalities would be the occupational structure of a modern      society or the hierarchy of positions within a complex      organization. Note that, in this analytical context, income      inequality is an effect of positional inequalities;      income inequality is not itself a system of inequality      (involving neither transferable positions nor status groups),      although it functions as both an incentive and consequence of      positional (and status) inequalities. Also note that positional      inequalities are commonly constituted by relatively clear \"local\"      hierarchies that only loosely translate into a societal wide      hierarchy. For example, complex organizations usually have      well-defined positional hierarchies, but their finer distinctions      are organization or industry specific. As a result, people      (both scholars and ordinary people) use common characteristics of      positions \u2013 such as income, authority level, or organizational      size \u2013 to translate \"local\" positional standings into a comparable      metric.       Choose two dissimilar examples of positional inequalities.       Try to choose two that have different institutional settings, are      not closely causally connected to each other, or operate by      different logics. They may coexist in one society or be      drawn from different (in space or time) societies.       For each example, describe the overall structure of      positions. Among other things, an analytical description of      a positional structure should consider the following:             Assess the differential characteristics attached to the       positions (rewards, authority, visibility, etc.)        Summarize and characterize the relationships among       positions.                    Consider the simple demographics of the system: how many       positions exist at each level?; what is the turnover rate of       personnel occupying the positions (the departure rates)?; how       stable is the demographic profile (i.e., do the relative and       absolute numbers remain the same over time)?        If possible to assess, how did the existing configuration of       positions come into existence?                   For each example, try to describe the \"normal\" pathways of      movement into and between positions             What are the typical initial entry points, the positions       that take people who have not previously been in the system of       positional inequality? For example, in a large business       or organization, many positions are typically filled by       promotions from other positions; people are not usually hired       from the outside for such positions. Commonly, a If these entry-point       positions are themselves unequal, also consider                How are the entry points unequal ?         What determines who gets in which ones?         Who controls the allocation process of the initial        positions (directly and indirectly)?                      What is the pattern of movement among positions within the       system?               To what degree does selectivity operate (the demographic        constraint)? (Among other things, this asks what        proportion of people at any given level will ascend to a        higher level.)         Consider if lateral movement among positions is relevant        to hierarchical movement.         Is there significant downward movement as well as upward        in the positional hierarchy? If so, remember        to examine downward as well as upward for all issues about        movement among positions.         What appears to decide who moves up into more desirable        positions (or down)?                  Is the determining process fairly consistent across         positions or does it vary by how high or in what         sector the position appears?          who has decision-making power?          how standardized or impartial are the processes         governing mobility among positions? Note that         impartiality can be the result of self-conscious         efforts to eliminate bias and reliance on         inappropriate criteria, but, alternatively, it also         can be the result of an uncontrolled process that is         inherently unbiased (as some would suggest for market         mechanisms)? Slave traders, for example, may be         just as impartial toward the ethnic divisions among         their chattel as the most progressive advocate of         meritocratic assessments.                                      How is the position-allocation process ideologically       conceived?;                particularly consider ideological constructs that        reinforce, obfuscate, legitimate, or challenge the        allocation process.         how are \"success\" and \"failure\" conceived (as moral and        practical categories)         are there competing ideological formulations of what        causes success and failure?                                 Taking into account all the above, comparing the two examples,      what can you say about the patterns of affiliation, alliance,      deference, patronage, avoidance, opposition, and conflict that      constitute the structure of relationships among people occupying      different locations in a positional inequality? While      exploring this issue, pay careful attention to the distinction      between the positions and the people occupying them.       In short , the goal of this task is to gain some insight      into the ways that positional systems of inequality work.       Using two concrete examples is the simplest possible design for      identifying some of the common characteristics of such      systems. A commonly unanticipated difficulty in analyzing      such systems arises from their duality: a structure of      relationships among the positions independent of the people who      occupy them and the dynamics of relationships among the people who      do occupy the positions.

X. What are the bases of actions that secure dominance    over time?     From those enjoying the most privileged positions to those suffering the    most disadvantages, people may believe that the system of inequality that    divides them reflects the elusively differential favor of the gods, the    cruel fate of nature's uneven treatment, or unavoidable results of    people's differential efforts and capacities. In truth, systems of    inequality require work to keep them going, particularly the efforts of    those in superior positions to preserve the shape of the system and their    positions within it. We cannot hope to grasp the logic of a system    of inequality until we understand what this work is and how it gets done.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Assess how and why advantaged      people (or their agents) act in ways that (1) preserve their      advantages and (2) preserve the system of inequality that gives      them advantages.       Select two examples of inequality to assess the actions of      advantaged people. The first example should concern gender      inequality \u2013 this may be an instance of gender inequality (e.g.,      gender inequality in an organization, or in an occupation, or in a      sport) or it may be gender inequality more generally (although      this may prove more difficult). The second example should be      a different kind of inequality, preferably an example of      positional inequality or alternatively an example of a quite      different form of status inequality.       For each example of inequality, the goal is to identify and      explain the kinds of actions by advantaged people that (1) seem to      occur consistently and (2) seem to reinforce their      advantages. To approach this problem systematically, try to      answer the following about each example of inequality:             How do the advantaged people treat disadvantaged people in       direct interactions; the relevant comparisons are with the       ways the advantaged relate to each other and the ways the       disadvantaged relate to each other?        How do advantaged people have different kinds of       relationships with other advantaged people than than they have       with disadvantaged people (this is similar to the previous,       but concerns the more general problem of relationships        rather than interactions )?        In what ways might common actions or behavioral patterns of       those in the advantaged \"class\" \u2013 actions that use or reflect       their advantaged circumstances \u2013 reinforce the privileges of       advantaged people, even though the actions are not aimed at       disadvantaged people or at sustaining inequality? (For       example, the advantaged might buy all unused land for golf       courses and expansive estates, leaving poor farmers no way to       expand their acreage for crops.)        How do advantaged people respond if one of them is       challenged by a disadvantaged person.                \"Challenges\" can take many forms. A member of a        subordinate group may simply refuse to show \"proper\"        deference, as when a lower caste person does not step        aside, a black woman does not go to her place in the rear        of a bus, or a member of the secretarial pool addresses        managers by their first name just as they do her.         Someone with lower standing may adopt the dress or        mannerisms of those with higher standing, or attempt to        move into their neighborhoods or schools. More        directly, someone with lower standing may reject and defy        efforts to exercise authority by those \"above\" them.         And so forth ....         Consider not only the actions of the person who is        directly challenged, but potential actions by others in        the advantaged class.                      How do advantaged people exercise power in government, over       laws, or in the economy in ways that benefit those with       advantages?        How do advantaged people respond if there is a collective       challenge to the system of inequality in which they have       advantages?                   Looking over the range of actions you identify as relevant      above, can they usefully be categorized? For example, one      might divide them into those that mainly benefit an individual's      status and those that mainly help sustain the system of      inequality. The goal here is to consider if there is an      analytically useful way to reduce the range of relevant actions      and behavior patterns into a small number of general types.       What within the system of inequality seems to organize and      ensure the actions that sustain it? For example, in the      simplest conceivable system of inequality, we might find the only      mechanism is the interests of those in dominance \u2013 they      individually act on those interests in a manner unmediated      by ideology, norms, relationships with others in the dominant      group, laws, organizational processes, or anything else.       More complex systems involve mechanisms that induce these actions,      giving individuals motivation, direction, and support.       Looking at the range of actions identified as relevant, what stand      out as the mechanisms that make such actions consistent and      effective?       What seem to be important limitations on the actions that secure      dominance? How are these actions constrained by laws, norms,      ideology, resources, or the like? What conditions or      potentials for the future might cause the actions to lose      enthusiasm or effectiveness?       In short , this task concerns the ways that inequality      systems induce advantaged groups to act in ways that sustain the      inequality (and their standing within that inequality). Once      again, using two examples is the simplest design to allow initial      speculations about the general functioning of inequality.       The questions above aim to help one to think systematically about      the range of possible actions and their sources.       When analyzing the actions of the advantaged (and      disadvantaged) as described above, keeping several considerations      in mind may help:             The shorthand references here to \"the actions of advantaged       people\" do not imply that all advantaged people act the same       way or that the actions that sustain inequality are produced       in the same way and at the same rate by all the       advantaged. Such actions may be nearly universal, they       may be typical but with a high degree of variation       across people and circumstances, or they may be the special       actions of a minority who are the key representatives of the       group interests.        The analytical focus should be on the processes and       circumstances that induce enough actions of sufficient       effectiveness by enough advantaged people to protect the       inequality system. An individualistic focus on the       motives or beliefs of people will probably go astray.        Note initially that the relevant actions of the advantaged       may differ from those of the disadvantaged in varied ways       other than reflecting divergent interests. For example,       (1) the opportunities to act may differ (e.g. differential       access to higher education), (2) analogous actions may       have different effects, and (3) even with equivalent       opportunities and effects, they may choose to act differently       (e.g. because they have different beliefs or respond to       different interests).

Inequality systems do not only have causes that bring them into    existence and causes that preserve them, they also have causes that    potentially reduce or eliminate them. Systems of inequality    may decline because they are pushed out of the way by new systems of    inequality, because they simply become increasingly ineffective or    irrelevant, because the disadvantaged are increasingly able to overcome    their circumstances as individuals, or because the system is dramatically    overturned by collective actions from below or intrusion from    invaders. How and why these processes dilute, undermine, or    eliminate inequalities is theoretically underdeveloped.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Declining inequalities       Select as example of social inequality, positional or status,      that showed significant reductions in the degree of inequality      over time.              For the selected example of inequality, if it is not a       system of inequality but a component, result, or instance of a       system of inequality, the analysis should include careful       consideration of the system itself.        (Note that inequality may decline in a component as a result       of overall decline in the system, decline in a component may       induce greater inequality in the system, or decline in a       component may take place independently of and without       noticeable impact of the enveloping system.                   In what ways did those involved in the example of inequality      being considered actively promote or resist its      decline?              In our simplest examples, \"those involved\" reduces to the       advantaged group versus the disadvantaged. In real life,       seems can be much more complex. Each system of       inequality may have multiple types of involvement,       distinguished by subtle or ambiguous differences of interests,       relationships and activities. And, systems of inequality       overlap and interact. We want to be sensitive to this       potential complexity, but willing to reduce it conceptually as       far as possible to produce a manageable model.        Note that people may actively promote or resist a change in       inequality for motives that are not focused on the issue of       the inequality's persistence.        The goal here is to characterize the types of people whose       actions tended to reinforce the inequality and those whose       actions tended to erode it. Recall that members of       advantaged groups may join the challengers (against their       putative interests) and members of the disadvantaged may join       the supporters.                   Were any other coexisting systems of inequality declining or      becoming more extreme during the same period? If so, is it      possible to identify causal processes that might connect the      simultaneous changes?       Were there direct clashes over the competing interests of those      advantaged and those disadvantaged by system of inequality that      was declining? If so, what were there causes and their      consequences?       Were there any independent changes in the circumstances of the      advantaged people that plausibly diminished their will or ability      to sustain the pattern of inequality?       Were actors who were not direct participants in the systems of      inequality (i.e. not acting as members of the advantaged or      disadvantaged) significant for promoting or obstructing the      movement toward change? The state is an obvious contender      here, but so are others whose interests or symbolic commitments      seem to be at stake.       Are there other processes, actors, circumstances, or causal      dynamics neglected by the above questions that seem important to      analyzing the changes in inequality in the examples being      considered?       In short , the goal this week is to explore the      conditions and processes that work against the persistence of      inequalities under appropriate structural and historical      circumstances.                    Common Readings          Karl Marx's theories of capitalism and societal transformation,     often simplified as the theory of historical materialism, is a     benchmark of all later theories aiming to explain changing systems     of inequality.

What are the theoretical and empirical    relationships between different forms of inequality?     Multiple systems of inequality coexist in societies, with crosscutting    categories and with individuals simultaneously located in each. An    older tradition in sociology suggested that the degree of overlap between    different forms of inequality was one condition influencing the likelihood    of class formation. A more recent interest has been the    \"intersection\" between race, gender, and class as experienced by    individuals, with the central (largely atheoretical) premise that the    implications of one's status in one system depends on one's statuses in    the others. Our concern here is more at the level of inequality's    organization, asking in what ways different systems of inequality interact    with each other.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: Interdependence of inequalities            Select one society and historical moment (or one period, such as      the second half of the 20 th century). Within this      historical context, select two examples of systems of positional      inequality and two examples of systems of status inequality,      chosen such that a significant number of individuals will have a      location within each of the four systems considered. .       Assess in what ways and to what degree an individual's status in      one instance of inequality relates to others. To be systematic,      consider             How standing in one form of positional inequality relates to       standing in the other example of positional inequality        How standing in one instance of status inequality relates to       standing in the other form of status inequality        How standing in the systems of positional inequality relate       to standing in the systems of status inequality                   Assess how the organization and functioning of these systems of      inequality influence or overlap each other. Among other things,      this might include considering             How the \"locations\" in the two examples of positional       inequality are related. Are any locations defined       simultaneously in both systems? Are there enduring       relationships between locations in the two systems that       continue regardless who are in those locations? Are there       sustained patterns of movement between the two systems?        What relationships exist among the the symbolic       representations and ideological legitimation schemes       associated with the forms of inequality being examined?        Are they simply independent?; are they separate but drawing on       some common ideas?; are they partially or wholly merged into       one scheme that serves all at once?        In what ways is persistence of one system of inequality       dependent on its relationship with another? For example, how       might the elimination of any one system of inequality affect       the others.?        What links exist between the laws and governmental       mechanisms that support these systems of inequality?        Can we identify inconsistencies or sources of friction       between these systems of inequality?        How do historical developments and changes in these systems       relate to each other?                                Common Readings          Jerry A.

What causes inequality?     Perhaps the most fundamental question about inequalities, and sometimes    seeming the most illusive to answer, is the misleadingly simple question,    what causes inequality? While no general, all embracing answer is    possible (at this time), progress in understanding inequality demands that    we continually try to improve our analyses of the causes. Any effort    to do this must consider different forms of causation that are    possible.              Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: We want to investigate what      causes inequalities. Causation is a difficult, often      elusive, concept. What we mean by the causes of inequalities      can take different forms. We can ask why it comes into      existence. This question about origins may concern the      specific historical circumstances or sequence of events in which      an inequality emerges. Or we might interpret original causes      in terms of the social conditions necessary for such inequality to      emerge or, somewhat differently, the social conditions that make      it unavoidable. We might instead ask what causes (or allows)      an inequality to persist over time, potentially distinct from the      reasons for its origin, the conditions and processes that sustain      it. Or, we might focus on the variations in the severity of      some inequality, seeking the key to understanding it in the      conditions that cause it to be great in some places and slight in      others. In either case, we may stress the mechanisms, the      recurring actions and social processes that produce the      inequality, or we may stress the conditions that allow or require      it. Given this expanse of possibilities, we must narrow our      question, to make it reasonable.       Choose two kinds of inequality, each of which varies      considerably in its intensity. For each kind choose one      example that has low inequality and another that has high      inequality. These four examples, two with low inequality to      compare with two having high inequality, will be the basis of the      analysis. These may come from the same historical and      cultural setting or from different ones.             For each kind of inequality, if it is not a system of       inequality but a component, result, or instance of a system of       inequality, the analysis should stress the system.        For example, if we start with two unequal occupations, we       would say that they are in most cases not a system of       inequality but a part of one. So, we could shift our       attention to the system of occupational inequality. Or,       if we begin with the inequality between women and men within       the financial industry, we could move to the general       inequality between the sexes.        In general, an example of inequality that is a component,       result, or instance of a system of inequality may have       particularistic causes that seem sufficient to account for its       contours or variations. However, we expect its existence       is derivative of the relevant system of inequality and that it       and other similar instances that are derivative of the same       system of inequality are all subject to the causal processes       that generate and sustain that system of inequality.        Thus, an effort to identify and make sense of the causal       processes cannot look at the component or instance alone.                   Describe each kind of inequality and the difference between the      higher and lower inequality instances.             As always, describe who are distinguished by the inequality,       and what it is that is unequal.        Specify why we consider the inequality in one instance to be       significantly higher than in the other. This is a       measurement issue on the surface, but commonly has deeper       implications about what the inequality means.                   Comparing the instances of high inequality with those of low      inequality, construct a series of hypotheses about about the      possible causes of high inequality (compared to low      inequality). In some cases these hypotheses may apply to      both kinds of inequality similarly while in others they are quite      different \u2013 try to be clear about this. For each      hypothesis, explain the reasoning behind your speculation.       In attempting to generate hypotheses representing a systematic      analysis, among other things to think about, you might consider:             the origins of each example of inequality (e.g., do the high       and low inequality instances arise from distinctive conditions       that relate to their subsequent intensity)        the history of changes in levels of inequality if applicable       and known (e.g., does knowledge of their varying intensities       over time suggest anything about why or how they differ in the       instances you compare?0        political and legal contexts        ideological and cultural contexts        relationships to other forms of inequality        direct relationships between those advantaged and those       disadvantaged by the inequality        how individuals' statuses are decided        ... Each of the foregoing refer to important aspects of an       inequality system that imply the existence of some causal       process. Looking back over the previous topics we have       examined should give more facets of inequality calling for a       similar causal analysis.                   Moving beyond hypotheses, see which of these more general      questions you can begin to answer.              Consider to what degree the origins, the persistence, or the       severity of the inequality is explained by the outcomes of       self-interested actions of individuals and organizations.        Consider to what degree the origins, the persistence, or the       severity of the inequality is explained by its functional and       structural relationships to important social arrangements or       \"needs.\"        Consider to what degree the origins, the persistence, or the       severity of the inequality is explained by some competitive       processes.        Try to be self-conscious about the comparisons being made,       implicit or explicit, and what alternatives might be possible.              Try not to forget that inequality induces processes,       conditions, and structures that limit resistance's       effectiveness and part of its explanation lies in the ways       this obstruction or resistance works.                   In short , our      analytical goal is to generate ideas about what produces      inequality, by first looking at what seems to explain variations      in the degree of severity of two types of inequality.

XIV. What makes some forms of inequality more    important than others to the organization of social structure and the    patterns of human action?     Some have argued that class dominates in particular societies or all    societies. Others have suggested that gender inequality is the most    fundamental inequality. Putting aside grand claims, most would agree    that some kinds of inequality have greater influence over the organization    of a society (or other social entity) and the history of that    organization. How we can systematically assess the relative    importance of different kinds of inequality and what decides their    differential importance are not clear.          Analytical     Task                 Analytical task: To be added       Select four kinds of inequality that are widespread within a      society or some other boundaried social context (such as an      organization or social category).       Try to rank these examples of in equality in terms of their      relative importance.             Note that different criteria for \"importance\" can result in       different rankings. One goal is to identify what       criteria for importance make sense for the chosen       examples.        Note that the importance of an inequality may vary by time       period, by type of people, by location in another system of       inequality, and other differentiating conditions.        Thus, a careful assessment will commonly result in a series       of rankings for the relative importance of the inequality       example, with the rankings distinguished by the criteria for       importance used and by the circumstances that mediate the       evaluations for any specific criterion.        To be systematic, one will usually want to rewrite the       analysis of relative importance organized around the       conditioning criteria                   Having assessed the relative importance of the inequality      examples, try to explore what caused the rankings. In the      foregoing, we are focusing on description and measurement.       Here the concern is causality. Above we are trying to      establish why and when we might call one kind of inequality more      important than another, a conceptual and empirical exercise.       Here we are asking what it is about the content, configuration and      history of the inequalities that results in one having more      importance than the other.             One path to answering this question might be to consider       known empirical examples where the relative importance of the       types of inequality being considered have a different ranking       importance.        Another path to answering might be to imagine what it would       take to lower the importance of the higher ranked inequality       or raise the importance of the lower ranked one.

How does resistance by subordinate groups work?     &amp;    People do not enjoy the lower status, fewer rewards, subjection to    authority, and other disadvantages attached to being at the lower end of    a system of inequality. This may result in anything between a    mild, occasional resentment and a continuous, burning hatred with    their fate. Fear, identification with the system, search for    praise from those above, or hope for personal advancement may induce    some to conform as much as possible with the expectations of the    advantaged. Still, wherever inequality exists, resistance    exists.          Analytical      Task                   Analytical task: Resistance       Select two examples of inequality. In each case, how do the      disadvantaged resist?       While identifying resistance, consider &lt;              everyday, commonly repeated actions of the disadvantaged        unusual, more extreme individual actions by some       disadvantaged        collective or organized forms of resistance                    What conditions, rules, processes, and actions limit      resistance? To recognize these obstacles, consider why the      identified forms of resistance are not more common, more      extreme, or more effective?

A system of inequality is a \"system.\" From a functionalist    perspective, its persistence requires mechanisms to ensure conformity to    its rules and expectations, to recruit adequate personnel to sustain    operation, to preserve commitment of those in advantaged statuses and    limit rebellion from others, and so forth. From a structuralist    perspective, it will induce latent conflicts that must be contained, it    will require legitimating ideology, it must enforce unequal effort and    unequal rewards, and so forth. A system of inequality has    structure, it has processes that occur over time, it has mechanisms to    sustain itself. Are there ways we can conceive these elements that    allow us to talk with a common language about the structural logics of    diverse systems of inequality?

As usual, briefly describe each system of inequality.       Who are included, what is unequally distributed, who are      advantaged or disadvantaged, and the like. If you are      going to consider a subset of a larger system of inequality, be      clear about what you are doing and why.

What are general dimensions of inequality systems, by which we can    characterize, compare, and categorize them?     Generally, researchers and theorists treat different kinds of    inequalities as if they existed in distinct and unrelated    conceptual worlds, although they might empirically overlap in concrete    historical settings. Various empirical instances of racial    inequality are compared, as are different instances of income inequality    or organizational hierarchies, but divergent kinds of inequality each    get their own, independent analytic turf. The divisions between    \"kinds\" of inequality are not the result of any systematic logic, but    treated as self-evident, natural distinctions.

[part 2]     Continuing the analysis of interests.          Analytical      Task                   Analytical Task 2 on Interests       Taking into account the insights and concerns developed in the       Common Readings listed below, write a critical review of      Jackson's effort to use interests as a theoretical device and      analytical tool in the studies of class and gender inequality      listed above.                           How      to write a critical review                  Although scholars spend much time and effort writing critiques      of published work, and graduate students spend even more,      systematic treatments of the criteria for, and strategies      toward, good critiques are rare. Here are just a few points to      consider.        A critique can never be better than its author's      understanding of the work being criticized. And a reader      cannot appreciate the intent of the critique beyond their grasp      of the critic's reading of the original work. This means      that to write a good critical review, we must first be sure we      understand what we are criticizing and, second, we must present      a clear summary of that understanding as part of our critique.       Although there are important exceptions, most critical reviews      really are elaborations of the answer to a simple      question. After reading the piece, do I, the critic, find      the argument worthwhile or not? However elaborate or      simple, with whatever style of presentation, the review is      largely an effort to present a sustained defense of that      evaluation.       A good review is always fair. We should never shy from      identifying a flaw or calling a mistake what it is. But we      should always try to use the language and tone that we hope      reviewers will use when they reveal the similar failings in our      work.              We review manuscripts, articles, and books. We do       not review people. Brilliant scholars write dim       papers \u2013 they are not dim as a result. A wise reviewer       avoids referring to the author, and concentrates on the       strengths and weaknesses of the work being reviewed.        For example, saying that \"the arguments in the last and       first sections contradict each other\" is preferable to       saying \"in the last section, the author contradicts what she       said in the first section\". Attributing thoughts and       intentions to an author is worse. Sitting in judgment       of the author's intellect, effort, or morality is       worst.                      As reviewers, we commonly want to be clear about two       interpretations of what has been accomplished in the work       being reviewed: that of the author and that of the       reviewer. Sometimes these will be the same; often not.        A critic has no obligation to share the author's view       of the what has been done in the work. But the       scholarly critic does have an obligation to grasp and       accurately present the author's aims and orientation as they       are conveyed in the work.        When an author sees a review, the author should not feel       (1) the reviewer has said or implied I said something that I       never said or implied or (2) the reviewer has said or       implied that I failed to consider something that is       explicitly part of my presentation.        Good scholars do not mind critical reviews, even highly       critical ones, that are accurate and fair. Good       scholars despise reviews that are inaccurate or unfair, even       if they are positive.                    What a review covers depends on the review's purpose, the      audience, and the content and quality of the work being      reviewed. No possible recipe of ingredients will apply to      all or even most reviews. The closest we can come to this      is to list common elements of reviews, understanding that the      reviewer must judge what weight, if any, each merits in a      particular review. Some of these common elements to      consider in reviews include:              Does the work have a central thesis, argument or claim       that is clear, relatively unambiguous, fully presented,       logically consistent, and not inherently flawed?        Does the work adequately consider alternative arguments?        Does the work provide evidence that effectively supports       the advocated claim over alternative claims?                Is the evidence well chosen, properly gathered, and        effectively analyzed (or is the work methodologically        sound)?         How compelling is the evidence?                       Does the work neglect or misconstrue some relevant       research or theory in ways that raise questions and       significantly diminish confidence in its claims?        Are there serious logical flaws or gaps in the analysis?        Overall, is the argument compelling?        Overall, is the analysis a valuable contribution?        Or, does it have something to say that is worth       saying?

What is the theoretical natural state: is it inequality or    equality that should be explained?     Sometimes a seemingly tangential question has the potential to gain us    unexpected insights. At least since Rousseau wrote the on the    origins of inequality we have been able to conceive that either equality    or inequality may be considered the problem to explain. While    modern sociology attributes little explanatory value to ideas about the    natural state of humankind, we may still hope to enhance our    understanding by juxtaposing efforts to identify the social mechanisms    responsible for inequality with those aimed at specifying the mechanisms    that induce equality.

This is a continuation of the previous week's topic          Analytical      Task                  Analytical task . Rewrite analytical task of      last week.       While rewriting, pay particular attention to the clear      identification of the systems of inequality. The examples      used may be a subset of a system, a particular context in a      system, or a location that is the intersection of two      systems. Try to clarify this as much as possible.       Try to think about what is unequal, and who are all the people      or all the positions that are related to those in the example      (and each other) by the inequality in the example.       Recall that some examples of inequality amongst people are      more appropriately understood as the effects of a system of      inequality. If people have different quality housing as a      result of income inequality, we usually want to conceive of this      as an effect of income inequality, rather than analyzing housing      inequality as a system of inequality. The \"system\" of      inequality is where the causal dynamics between the advantaged      and disadvantaged are centered. There is no hard and fast      rule about the proper way to define a system of inequality,      because the optimal way of understanding an inequality will      depend on our analytical goals                      Common Readings           Review readings of past weeks                      Recommended     Readings                  Review readings of past weeks       ...
