What is an Independent Study course and what are the requirements?      Independent Study is an opportunity for students to work   closely with a faculty advisor on a project related to their area of   study. Students must choose a member of the faculty. After   securing approval from a faculty member in writing, the student should   contact the Undergraduate Administrator, in order to register for the   independent study course. The proposal will be reviewed by the program   Director for approval. It is imperative that students meet with their   faculty advisor on a regular basis throughout the semester in which they   are doing the independent study. Upon completion of the \"course\", written proof from the student's faculty advisor that the student has completed all course work for study and a grade must    be presented to the Undergraduate Administrator. Independent Study   counts towards the Law &amp; Society Minor and can substitute for one of   the non-core Law &amp; Society courses. A grade of at least C is   required in every course to be counted towards the Law &amp; Society   Minor.      On the written proposal you must list the following:      Topic of the course How many credits (1-4 credits - at the discretion of the professor) Books you will be reading Name of the faculty member (must be a CAS faculty member)      Can I count courses taken at other universities towards my Law &amp; Society minor?

About    As schools in the twentieth century became an increasingly core societal institution, sociologists have directed continuous, concerted effort toward understanding both their structure and their effects on individuals. Over the past century, sociologists who developed the theoretical framework for the discipline as a whole (e.g., Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, Talcott Parsons, Pierre Bourdieu, James Coleman and John Meyer), also directly focused and wrote on the role of education in society. Because schools were complex institutions, sociological theorizing was multi-dimensional and multi-layered.    Sociology of education as a field developed a focus on two separate levels of analysis. At a macro-level, sociologists worked to identify how various social forces (such as politics, economics, culture, etc.) created variation in schools as organizations. At a more micro-level, researchers sought to identify how variation in school practices led to differences in individual-level student outcomes.    In addition to these distinct levels of analysis, researchers further developed separate focuses on various aspects of the functioning of education in society. While some researchers focused on economic aspects of education (e.g., how economic forces shaped school practices and how schools determined individual productivity and earnings), others focused on related issues of socialization, allocation and legitimization. When approaching research in the sociology of education, these distinctions are useful to keep in mind.
