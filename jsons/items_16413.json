Using techniques favored by many artists of the 18th century, Cottam excerpts images taken from the headlines or news snippets, and converts them into riveting and intense studies. Delicately rendered in white crayon against a blue page, they are silky threads of memory. Recording moments of journalism, depicting pieces of people, bodies, and the residual effects of mindless, senseless killing, Cottam draws what is reported on the news. The raw contrast between the pathos of a dead child\u2019s body, and the delicacy of his drawing, speaks to Cottam\u2019s intuitive sense of the historical and tragic record of a life, depicted on a paper so thin that it can fly away, like the soul of the tiny body that lies before us.          Working with images of war, much like Goya, Cottam draws and then scrapes back his images, creating and destroying a layered surface. As a result, many of the drawings have a transparent quality, because of the shimmering white crayon against thinned blue paper. The metalpoint that he uses to scrape away the surface also adds polish and sheen to the skinned paper, and mineral spirits added to the crayon create areas of wash. The technique is about layering and destruction, using methods that reflect an inherent need to remove the creation from its support. Choosing a paper renowned for its luxury, Cottam works on Smythson Featherweight stationery, laid and watermarked, with a soft dove gray-sapphire color. The sheets serve as blue skies to vapors of imagination, with cloud-like and fleeting images.

This series of paintings emerged from his experience of language, and its permutations, as the artist experienced harsh words in common parlance, called out loud on streets among friends and strangers every day in public and private in the City.       Each small painting has the same dimensions. The panel depths vary, implying the hurt of the words, how deeply they penetrate as they are uttered. Contained on the handcrafted wooden panel is a single word, appearing in the top register of a two-color field, lovingly painted with stencil.

The first light in the night sky, it is often seen low on the horizon just after sunset. Ericsson plays with the subsequent interpretation of Lucifer as the favored angel who falls from grace, becoming identified with forces of darkness. In these photograms, Lucifer brings light to the paper, revealing a woman&rsquo;s form, fashioning her contours against glossy black.            Playing with light and dark, edges and shadows, Ericsson manipulates both muse and medium to create a sensuous and luminous image.

Using a different medium each time, sometimes paint, sometimes egg, sometimes pigment and oils, she circulates images into a basin of water, dropping viscous liquids into a receptive tray filled with water, coloring the movement and ripples on the surface, with these intense and delicious substances. At times they are suspended like a meniscus on the surface, at times they form shapes, and then dissolve, trailing tails behind.       The movement of the artist's hand over the water, her gesture, is recorded in the three poetic series of polaroids.

Tender  reflections of majestic landscapes, made on site as he traveled through Norway's fjords and   mountains, many of the small works later inspired larger paintings and drawings when he   returned to his studio. They convey his immediate responses to Norwegian landscape. His own   words describe his impressions:     1991. Lofoten, an archipelago within the Artic Circle, mountainous islands reach out into the Norwegian Sea. In late May the &ldquo;midnight sun&rdquo; floats along the horizon. Dusk becomes dawn; one day runs into the next. I was working with pastels using my fingers to grind pigment into pigment. This physical act extends my being directly into the paper. The work is not driven by conscious thought, rather by a series of sensations and the rhythm of my hands responding to the moment.

In his film Dreamsequence , women are posed in diferent rooms that suggest a dramatic stage set. One kneels on the floor in an empty room filling with balloons that drop randomly from the ceiling, and later sits in a chair, lifting her face to a shower of golden glitter raining down upon her skin. The other perches on a chair in a bay window, naked except for the paint on her face, and the tulle enveloping her lower limbs. She moves without speaking, holding a bird in a cage. In the close ups of their faces shown here, they appear as though they are remembered from a dream.

Animals inhabit an interior and domestic landscape, coming to life and interacting with their environment. A group of branches in a vase waves cautiously as if bent by wind toward an unseen place, breaking into pieces and wispy fragments for no apparent reason. A slipcover begins to growl as if ready for attack. A hidden dragon slithers to life in the folds of a drapery, leaving fire in its wake. An archer shoots at a trophy stag from the      comfort of his decorative pose on an ovoid telephone table. A flock of birds twitter against      the back of a sofa. A living room is submerged in standing water, colorless, and linear. A      blue mattress, its coils exposed, floats away on an ocean of coiled lines. The images form a     personal narrative of disquiet.

As an immigrant to the United States from Korea in 1996, his continued fascination with these interactions has led him to create an art practice that embraces sculpture and installation to create interactive spaces. Working in both large-scale monumental sculpture and intimate conceptual pieces, he brings sensitivity and power to his work. Because he wants to break through the confining divisions between audience and artist, he asks a wide range of participants to bring their own concerns to transform his pieces.

This exhibition of horse      drawings spans two important dates connected to the imagery of Irish painter Timothy Hawkesworth: 1 February 2014      marks the beginning of the Year of the Horse, the seventh sign of the Chinese zodiac and an auspicious year recognizing      the power and primal nature of the horse. The end date of the exhibition, 17 March marks Saint Patrick\u2019s Day, named    for the patron saint of Ireland, where Timothy Hawkesworth grew up on a farm and began his relationship with horses.       Hawkesworth\u2019s horses are energetic and rapidly drawn with graphite over wax and paint on paper, moving from right to left, galloping, rearing, and walking with heads bowed, raised or thrown back in restless movement. Evoking the animal nature with figurative representations, like Susan Rothenberg\u2019s horses from the 1970s, Hawkesworth infuses a personal vision in these drawings, and taps into a source of infinite fascination: domesticated animals that retain a wild and untamed spirit.

Duke House. In this body of work Smith engages themes of transience and permanence, movement and color, nature and displacement.       Taking elements of color and bubbles from his ongoing &quot;Painter Project,&quot; Smith transforms them, draping them over the railings of staircases, suspending them from the skylights and floating them across the floor toward the viewer. Using techniques attuned classic films like as director Carol Reed&rsquo;s &ldquo;Odd Man Out (1947, Two Cities film), Jean-Luc Godard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Two or Three Things I Know About Her,&rdquo; (1967, Argos Films), or Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s 1976 classic, &ldquo;Taxi Driver,&rdquo; Smith hones in on the bubbles floating in front of the camera as visual metaphors for the transience of life, the fragility of the moment.

The transformation of the text of James Ferguson's Astronomy Explained upon Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s Principles (1799) began in response to a Victorian astronomy book entitled Flowers of the Sky in the archive of the John Work Garrett Library at Johns Hopkins University.      As the artist describes, the fluid yet tenuous painting on the book pages is analogous to a fragile web or distant constellation. For Smith, flowers are symbols of our selves and of nature, as well as a metaphor for the machinations of the universe. Implicitly, book folios serve as multivalent supports for the painted leaves and flowers that adorn them with color and design imposed over printed words.

The Picture of Dorian Gray   opens in a studio: here Dorian is first seduced by Lord Henry Wotton's decadent   pronouncements and here the picture that leads Dorian to ruin is created. The   dual images of creation and decay represented by the studio draw Wilde's reader   into the very public battle waging over Aestheticism, the movement that adopted   Wilde as its most prominent emblem and most notorious sinner.     The Aesthetic Movement encompassed the   visual arts, the decorative arts, and literature. At Oxford, Wilde studied under   the two great art critics of the Victorian age, Walter Pater and John Ruskin.   Pater's injunction \"to know one's impression as it really is\" underlies Aestheticism's   guiding principle: the sole function of art is to inspire an emotion or create   a mood. Pater's influence on Wilde's art criticism is strong; \"All art is quite   useless,\" Wilde asserts in the Preface to Dorian Gray. The Aesthetic   Movement sought an art that exists for beauty alone. Arguments raged for and   against the amorality of art, with every major thinker and artist of the day   jumping into the fray. The highly publicized court battle between James McNeill   Whistler and John Ruskin over Whistler's aesthetic art set an early precedent   in the battle over the function of art in society. Later, for a time, Whistler   and Wilde were interchangeable figures to the public. They battled in the newspapers   and lecture halls for prominence, and Wilde won. He became the most visible   symbol of Aestheticism in the 1880s; he would become the scapegoat for its excesses,   both real and imagined, in the 1890s.     Wilde's own insistence on the amorality   of art was not uncomplicated, however, as shown in The Picture of Dorian   Gray. The studio represents both the perils and promises of the Aesthetic   Movement: artistic and sexual freedom from moral concerns--a space for homosexuality   and decadence. So long as these freedoms remained buried in the subtext or locked   in the studio, the outside world could enjoy the risque titillation of forbidden   life. But when the doors to the studio where flung open in the press and in   the courts, Wilde's life and art were shattered.   -- Lisa Golmitz      Walter   Pater, (1843-1894}   Studies in the History of the Renaissance. London: Macmillan, 1873.      W.   B. Yeats, in his Autobiography , quotes Wilde as saying of this book,   \"It is my golden book; I never travel anywhere without it; but it is the very   flower of decadence: the last trumpet should have sounded the moment it was   written.\" This is Walter Pater's famous book of essays, in which he attempts   to capture the spirit of the Renaissance through highly personal, impressionistic   sketches of artists and works of art. The Preface boldly gives direction to   Aestheticism, arguing against Matthew Arnold's injunction that one must \"see   the object as in itself it really is.\" Pater modifies this to knowing \"one's   impression as it really is, to discriminate it, to realise it distinctly.\" The   aesthetic critic filters all art through the lens of himself, through the temperament   he cultivates. The Conclusion to the Renaissance became the touchstone   of the Art for Art s Sake Movement, with Pater's passionate injunction \"To burn   always with this hard, gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success   in life.\"          Photograph of Aubrey Beardsley             Serialized   from January through June, 1894, the exploits of Trilby, Svengali and the three   British expatriate artists in Paris were closely followed by an adoring public.   In this illustration by Du Maurier, a caricature of James McNeill Whistler as   Joe Sibley is easily identifiable in the right corner against the wall. If the   text's description of Sibley was unmistakable to an irate Whistler, this illustration   was unmistakable to the public at large. Whistler threatened to sue if the character   was not removed..                    George Du Mau rier,    (1834-1896)      Trilby. New York: Harper's,    1894.     Here is the same illustration from    Trilby in the first hardcover edition of the novel. Du Maurier removed    the offensive references to Whistler from the text, and comically added    a rough beard to the caricature, seen here..                       Wilde v. Whistler: An Acrimonious Correspondence on Art. London:Privately   Printer, 1906.   This leaflet features many of the letters   published in the Pall Mall Gazette from both Wilde and Whistler in   which they argue over the provenance of Aesthetic theory. Whistler began in   his attacks in his series of lectures called \"Mr. Whistler's Ten o'Clock.\" Whistler   liked to believe that Wilde was his disciple, and so Wilde's increasing popularity   galled him. He attacked Wilde for his conceit, and for stealing his best ideas..   Wilde countered in the press and in his essay \"The Decay of Lying,\" which while   borrowing much of Whistler's tone, is a more coherent and interesting spin on   Aesthetic criticism than Whistler could admit.          Whistler v. Ruskin: Art and Art Critics. London: Chatto and Windus,   1878.   In 1887, Whistler displayed several paintings   at the opening of Grosvenor Gallery. John Ruskin, the Slade Professor of Fine   Arts at Oxford and the leading art critic of his day, attacked Whistler's The   Nocturne in Black and Gold [The Falling Rocket] in a review of the show. Ruskin   wrote, \"I have seen and heard much of Cockney impudence before now, but never   expected to hear a coxcomb ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint   in the public's face.\" Whistler was incensed, and sued Ruskin for libel. Although   Whistler argued that the issue of the case was not the merit of his art but   Ruskin's personal attack, the art itself was at the center of the trial. Whistler   won his case, but was awarded only a farthing in damages. Ruskin resigned his   professorship, arguing that a critic who cannot criticize is useless. Whistler   may have been morally vindicated bythe trial, but he was financially devastated.   This pamphlet was his failedattempt to recoup his losses. It was not well-received   by the art world, who sympathized with the fallen Ruskin..         Joris Karl Huysmans, (1848-1907)     Against the Grain. Paris: Groves & Michaux, 1926.    This   is a beautifully illustrated French edition of J.-K. Huysmans' infamous novel,   A Rebours . Huysmans hero, Duc Jean Floressas des Esseintes, is the   prototypical Decadent. Wilde, at his trial, admitted that des Esseintes was   one of the models for Dorian Gray, and that A Rebours is the book he   refers to in the novel that leads Dorian to a life of aesthetic and criminal   excess. Huysman's aesthete creates a completely artistic environment in which   to live, a studio where even artificial scents are introduced to create a mood.   This is an interior space where all manner of decadent behaviors can be indulged,   a space that, as the title implies, relies on nature for nothing. Des Esseintes   moves from one unsatisfying passion to another, never finding satiety for his   appetites.          Oscar   Wilde, (1854-1900)   Salom&eacute;: A Tragedy in One Act. Translated from the French of Oscar   Wilde: Pictured by Aubrey Beardsley. London: Elkin Mathews and John Lane,   1894.   Mallarm&eacute; called it \"fine and sombre   like a chapter of the Apocalypse,\" but Wilde had a difficult time finding anyone   willing to stage this Decadent retelling of the Biblical tale. Written first   in French, Wilde threatened to adopt French citizenship if the British censors   refused to allow an English staging. It was refused by the Lord Chamberlain,   but Wilde went ahead with plans to publish the play in French. Elkin Mathews   & John Lane bought copies printed in France from Wilde for distribution in Britain.   Aubrey Beardsley was hired to illustrate the first English-language edition   of the play after Wilde saw an earlier drawing he had done of Salom&eacute;   for the Studio , and the results are these maniacal, sensuous drawings.            Oscar Wilde, (1854-1900)  \"The Critic as Artist\" in Intentions . London: James R. Osgood, McIlvaine  and Company,1891.    This   dialogue between \"Ernest\" and \"Gilbert\" is a witty slap in the face to Whistler,   who felt that Wilde could not speak on the visual arts because he was not a   visual artist himself. This essay proposes that \"to know the principles of the   highest art is to know the principles of all the arts,\" and the highest art,   Wilde argues, is Criticism. \"It works with materials, and puts them into a form   that is at once new and delightful.What more can one say of poetry?\" Playing   with Arnold and Pater's rhetoric, Wilde asserts that the object of art is to   \"see the object as in itself it is not.\" Moreover, he states that \"Aesthetics   are higher than ethics. They belong to a more spiritual sphere. To discern the   beauty of a thing is the finest point to which we can arrive.\" In this essay,   Wilde praises Pater outright, obliquely criticizes Whistler, and takes on every   late Victorian argument about the purpose and function of art.          The Yellow Book. Volume I, April, 1894.   The Yellow Book was the brain-child   of Beardsley even down to its title. Novels by the French decadent writer were   often issued in yellow wrappers; the most important of the novels was J.K. Huysmans'   A Rebours , 1883. Beardsley proposed a new illustrated quarterly dedicated   to modern literature and art because \"many brilliant story painters and picture   writers cannot get their best stuff accepted in the conventional magazines,   either because they are not topical, or perhaps a little risqu.\" John Lane   agreed to publish the quarterly with Henry Harland as the literary editor and   Beardsley as the art editor. The Yellow Book published some of the   best authors and artists of the Nineties, often causing scandals to the conservative   public.   The first issue of The Yellow Book provoked outrage. The Times   referred to the \"repulsiveness and insolence\" of the cover; The Westminster   Gazette remarked about the \"Portrait of Mrs. Patrick Campbell\" it would   take \"a short act of Parliament to make this kind of thing illegal.\" Beardsley's   notoriety blossomed and the magazine sold briskly..         Geoffrey Chaucer, (ca. 1343-1400)     The Works of Geoffry Chaucer Newly Imprinted. Hammersmith: TheKelmscott  Press, 1890.   Following his socialist leanings and   his interest in medievalism, William Morris began the Kelmscott Press to bring   the joy of work back into the production of beautiful books. Based on close   study of the early printers, Morris developed typefaces and designed page layouts   that sparked the revival of printing. The influence of his designs can be seen   in all of Wilde's books, especially the first edition of The Picture of   Dorian Gray and The Sphinx.            Oscar Wilde, (1854-1900)     The Sphinx. London: Elkin Mathews and John Lane, 1894. Illustrated   by Charles Ricketts.   Perhaps the most beatiful book designed   in the 1890s, The Sphinx, is a tour de force of decadent style,   Wilde's elaborate poem inspired Charles Ricketts type design, use of three muted   colors of ink - cinnamon, forest, and black - and his exquisite woodcut illustrations.   Ricketts and his lover, Charles Shannon were members of Wilde's circle and Wilde   was a frequent visitor to their studio, The Vale. Basil Hallward's studio in   the opening scene of The Picture of Dorian Gray is modeled after their   studio.          George   Du Maurier, (1834-1896)   In Harper s New Monthly Magazine January-August,   1894.   George Du Maurier's Trilby became   a huge sensation when it was serialized in Harper's magazine in 1894.   Du Maurier had been an artstudent in Paris with Whistler, and while Whistler   became the leading artist of his day, Du Maurier became an illustrator for Punch .   Du Maurier's caricatures of Wilde and the Aesthetic Cult were enormously popular,   and Trilby also features Du Maurier's illustrations. Trilby is the   story of three young artists in Paris who discover a brassy artist's model and   proceed to fall in love with her. Trilby, though tone-deaf, is transformed through   mesmerism into a diva through the evil powers of the musician Svengali. Along   the way, Du Maurier illustrates the life in the studio of young, struggling   artists. Trilby became an overnight sensation, with the Trilby hat   the most memorable remnant of this fame. The Trilby Scrapbook in the Fales collection   represents a collector's excerpts from Harper's, Life, and other sources concerning   Trilby and Whistler's threatened lawsuit over Du Maurier's caricature of him   as the lazy Joe Sibley.          Prospectus for The Savoy   After being ejected from The Yellow   Book , Beardsley found financial support from two men, Andr&eacute; Raffalovich   and Leonard Smithers. Smithers became Beardsley's new publisher, starting The   Savoy with Arthur Symons as literary editor and Beardsley as art editor.   The magazine took its name from The Savoy hotel in which Wilde and Douglas entertained   the young men they met through Alfred Taylor. Beardsley developed his baroque   style in illustrations for The Savoy . Most important, his illustrations   for The Rape of the Lock and The Ballad of the Barber appeared   in subsequent issues. By 1896, shop-owners and newsstands refused to sell The   Savoy . It was a private act of censorship aimed at Beardsley. It worked.   The Savoy ceased publication after the December 1896 issue. Shown is   the suppressed state of the prospectus, which was rejected because of the figure   appears to have an erection.

The metalpoint that he uses to scrape away the surface also adds polish and sheen to the skinned paper, and mineral spirits added to the crayon create areas of wash. The technique is about layering and destruction, using methods that reflect an inherent need to remove the creation from its support. Choosing a paper renowned for its luxury, Cottam works on Smythson Featherweight stationery, laid and watermarked, with a soft dove gray-sapphire color. The sheets serve as blue skies to vapors of imagination, with cloud-like and fleeting images.

The first light in the night sky, it is often seen low on the horizon just after sunset. Ericsson plays with the subsequent interpretation of Lucifer as the favored angel who falls from grace, becoming identified with forces of darkness. In these photograms, Lucifer brings light to the paper, revealing a woman&rsquo;s form, fashioning her contours against glossy black.            Playing with light and dark, edges and shadows, Ericsson manipulates both muse and medium to create a sensuous and luminous image.

Using a different medium each time, sometimes paint, sometimes egg, sometimes pigment and oils, she circulates images into a basin of water, dropping viscous liquids into a receptive tray filled with water, coloring the movement and ripples on the surface, with these intense and delicious substances. At times they are suspended like a meniscus on the surface, at times they form shapes, and then dissolve, trailing tails behind.       The movement of the artist's hand over the water, her gesture, is recorded in the three poetic series of polaroids.

Tender  reflections of majestic landscapes, made on site as he traveled through Norway's fjords and   mountains, many of the small works later inspired larger paintings and drawings when he   returned to his studio. They convey his immediate responses to Norwegian landscape. His own   words describe his impressions:     1991. Lofoten, an archipelago within the Artic Circle, mountainous islands reach out into the Norwegian Sea. In late May the &ldquo;midnight sun&rdquo; floats along the horizon. Dusk becomes dawn; one day runs into the next. I was working with pastels using my fingers to grind pigment into pigment. This physical act extends my being directly into the paper. The work is not driven by conscious thought, rather by a series of sensations and the rhythm of my hands responding to the moment.

In his film Dreamsequence , women are posed in diferent rooms that suggest a dramatic stage set. One kneels on the floor in an empty room filling with balloons that drop randomly from the ceiling, and later sits in a chair, lifting her face to a shower of golden glitter raining down upon her skin. The other perches on a chair in a bay window, naked except for the paint on her face, and the tulle enveloping her lower limbs. She moves without speaking, holding a bird in a cage. In the close ups of their faces shown here, they appear as though they are remembered from a dream.

Animals inhabit an interior and domestic landscape, coming to life and interacting with their environment. A group of branches in a vase waves cautiously as if bent by wind toward an unseen place, breaking into pieces and wispy fragments for no apparent reason. A slipcover begins to growl as if ready for attack. A hidden dragon slithers to life in the folds of a drapery, leaving fire in its wake. An archer shoots at a trophy stag from the      comfort of his decorative pose on an ovoid telephone table. A flock of birds twitter against      the back of a sofa. A living room is submerged in standing water, colorless, and linear. A      blue mattress, its coils exposed, floats away on an ocean of coiled lines. The images form a     personal narrative of disquiet.

As an immigrant to the United States from Korea in 1996, his continued fascination with these interactions has led him to create an art practice that embraces sculpture and installation to create interactive spaces. Working in both large-scale monumental sculpture and intimate conceptual pieces, he brings sensitivity and power to his work. Because he wants to break through the confining divisions between audience and artist, he asks a wide range of participants to bring their own concerns to transform his pieces.

This exhibition of horse      drawings spans two important dates connected to the imagery of Irish painter Timothy Hawkesworth: 1 February 2014      marks the beginning of the Year of the Horse, the seventh sign of the Chinese zodiac and an auspicious year recognizing      the power and primal nature of the horse. The end date of the exhibition, 17 March marks Saint Patrick\u2019s Day, named    for the patron saint of Ireland, where Timothy Hawkesworth grew up on a farm and began his relationship with horses.       Hawkesworth\u2019s horses are energetic and rapidly drawn with graphite over wax and paint on paper, moving from right to left, galloping, rearing, and walking with heads bowed, raised or thrown back in restless movement. Evoking the animal nature with figurative representations, like Susan Rothenberg\u2019s horses from the 1970s, Hawkesworth infuses a personal vision in these drawings, and taps into a source of infinite fascination: domesticated animals that retain a wild and untamed spirit.

Duke House. In this body of work Smith engages themes of transience and permanence, movement and color, nature and displacement.       Taking elements of color and bubbles from his ongoing &quot;Painter Project,&quot; Smith transforms them, draping them over the railings of staircases, suspending them from the skylights and floating them across the floor toward the viewer. Using techniques attuned classic films like as director Carol Reed&rsquo;s &ldquo;Odd Man Out (1947, Two Cities film), Jean-Luc Godard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Two or Three Things I Know About Her,&rdquo; (1967, Argos Films), or Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s 1976 classic, &ldquo;Taxi Driver,&rdquo; Smith hones in on the bubbles floating in front of the camera as visual metaphors for the transience of life, the fragility of the moment.

The transformation of the text of James Ferguson's Astronomy Explained upon Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s Principles (1799) began in response to a Victorian astronomy book entitled Flowers of the Sky in the archive of the John Work Garrett Library at Johns Hopkins University.      As the artist describes, the fluid yet tenuous painting on the book pages is analogous to a fragile web or distant constellation. For Smith, flowers are symbols of our selves and of nature, as well as a metaphor for the machinations of the universe. Implicitly, book folios serve as multivalent supports for the painted leaves and flowers that adorn them with color and design imposed over printed words.

The Picture of Dorian Gray   opens in a studio: here Dorian is first seduced by Lord Henry Wotton's decadent   pronouncements and here the picture that leads Dorian to ruin is created. The   dual images of creation and decay represented by the studio draw Wilde's reader   into the very public battle waging over Aestheticism, the movement that adopted   Wilde as its most prominent emblem and most notorious sinner.     The Aesthetic Movement encompassed the   visual arts, the decorative arts, and literature. At Oxford, Wilde studied under   the two great art critics of the Victorian age, Walter Pater and John Ruskin.   Pater's injunction \"to know one's impression as it really is\" underlies Aestheticism's   guiding principle: the sole function of art is to inspire an emotion or create   a mood. Pater's influence on Wilde's art criticism is strong; \"All art is quite   useless,\" Wilde asserts in the Preface to Dorian Gray. The Aesthetic   Movement sought an art that exists for beauty alone. Arguments raged for and   against the amorality of art, with every major thinker and artist of the day   jumping into the fray. The highly publicized court battle between James McNeill   Whistler and John Ruskin over Whistler's aesthetic art set an early precedent   in the battle over the function of art in society. Later, for a time, Whistler   and Wilde were interchangeable figures to the public. They battled in the newspapers   and lecture halls for prominence, and Wilde won. He became the most visible   symbol of Aestheticism in the 1880s; he would become the scapegoat for its excesses,   both real and imagined, in the 1890s.     Wilde's own insistence on the amorality   of art was not uncomplicated, however, as shown in The Picture of Dorian   Gray. The studio represents both the perils and promises of the Aesthetic   Movement: artistic and sexual freedom from moral concerns--a space for homosexuality   and decadence. So long as these freedoms remained buried in the subtext or locked   in the studio, the outside world could enjoy the risque titillation of forbidden   life. But when the doors to the studio where flung open in the press and in   the courts, Wilde's life and art were shattered.   -- Lisa Golmitz      Walter   Pater, (1843-1894}   Studies in the History of the Renaissance. London: Macmillan, 1873.      W.   B. Yeats, in his Autobiography , quotes Wilde as saying of this book,   \"It is my golden book; I never travel anywhere without it; but it is the very   flower of decadence: the last trumpet should have sounded the moment it was   written.\" This is Walter Pater's famous book of essays, in which he attempts   to capture the spirit of the Renaissance through highly personal, impressionistic   sketches of artists and works of art. The Preface boldly gives direction to   Aestheticism, arguing against Matthew Arnold's injunction that one must \"see   the object as in itself it really is.\" Pater modifies this to knowing \"one's   impression as it really is, to discriminate it, to realise it distinctly.\" The   aesthetic critic filters all art through the lens of himself, through the temperament   he cultivates. The Conclusion to the Renaissance became the touchstone   of the Art for Art s Sake Movement, with Pater's passionate injunction \"To burn   always with this hard, gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success   in life.\"          Photograph of Aubrey Beardsley             Serialized   from January through June, 1894, the exploits of Trilby, Svengali and the three   British expatriate artists in Paris were closely followed by an adoring public.   In this illustration by Du Maurier, a caricature of James McNeill Whistler as   Joe Sibley is easily identifiable in the right corner against the wall. If the   text's description of Sibley was unmistakable to an irate Whistler, this illustration   was unmistakable to the public at large. Whistler threatened to sue if the character   was not removed..                    George Du Mau rier,    (1834-1896)      Trilby. New York: Harper's,    1894.     Here is the same illustration from    Trilby in the first hardcover edition of the novel. Du Maurier removed    the offensive references to Whistler from the text, and comically added    a rough beard to the caricature, seen here..                       Wilde v. Whistler: An Acrimonious Correspondence on Art. London:Privately   Printer, 1906.   This leaflet features many of the letters   published in the Pall Mall Gazette from both Wilde and Whistler in   which they argue over the provenance of Aesthetic theory. Whistler began in   his attacks in his series of lectures called \"Mr. Whistler's Ten o'Clock.\" Whistler   liked to believe that Wilde was his disciple, and so Wilde's increasing popularity   galled him. He attacked Wilde for his conceit, and for stealing his best ideas..   Wilde countered in the press and in his essay \"The Decay of Lying,\" which while   borrowing much of Whistler's tone, is a more coherent and interesting spin on   Aesthetic criticism than Whistler could admit.          Whistler v. Ruskin: Art and Art Critics. London: Chatto and Windus,   1878.   In 1887, Whistler displayed several paintings   at the opening of Grosvenor Gallery. John Ruskin, the Slade Professor of Fine   Arts at Oxford and the leading art critic of his day, attacked Whistler's The   Nocturne in Black and Gold [The Falling Rocket] in a review of the show. Ruskin   wrote, \"I have seen and heard much of Cockney impudence before now, but never   expected to hear a coxcomb ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint   in the public's face.\" Whistler was incensed, and sued Ruskin for libel. Although   Whistler argued that the issue of the case was not the merit of his art but   Ruskin's personal attack, the art itself was at the center of the trial. Whistler   won his case, but was awarded only a farthing in damages. Ruskin resigned his   professorship, arguing that a critic who cannot criticize is useless. Whistler   may have been morally vindicated bythe trial, but he was financially devastated.   This pamphlet was his failedattempt to recoup his losses. It was not well-received   by the art world, who sympathized with the fallen Ruskin..         Joris Karl Huysmans, (1848-1907)     Against the Grain. Paris: Groves & Michaux, 1926.    This   is a beautifully illustrated French edition of J.-K. Huysmans' infamous novel,   A Rebours . Huysmans hero, Duc Jean Floressas des Esseintes, is the   prototypical Decadent. Wilde, at his trial, admitted that des Esseintes was   one of the models for Dorian Gray, and that A Rebours is the book he   refers to in the novel that leads Dorian to a life of aesthetic and criminal   excess. Huysman's aesthete creates a completely artistic environment in which   to live, a studio where even artificial scents are introduced to create a mood.   This is an interior space where all manner of decadent behaviors can be indulged,   a space that, as the title implies, relies on nature for nothing. Des Esseintes   moves from one unsatisfying passion to another, never finding satiety for his   appetites.          Oscar   Wilde, (1854-1900)   Salom&eacute;: A Tragedy in One Act. Translated from the French of Oscar   Wilde: Pictured by Aubrey Beardsley. London: Elkin Mathews and John Lane,   1894.   Mallarm&eacute; called it \"fine and sombre   like a chapter of the Apocalypse,\" but Wilde had a difficult time finding anyone   willing to stage this Decadent retelling of the Biblical tale. Written first   in French, Wilde threatened to adopt French citizenship if the British censors   refused to allow an English staging. It was refused by the Lord Chamberlain,   but Wilde went ahead with plans to publish the play in French. Elkin Mathews   & John Lane bought copies printed in France from Wilde for distribution in Britain.   Aubrey Beardsley was hired to illustrate the first English-language edition   of the play after Wilde saw an earlier drawing he had done of Salom&eacute;   for the Studio , and the results are these maniacal, sensuous drawings.            Oscar Wilde, (1854-1900)  \"The Critic as Artist\" in Intentions . London: James R. Osgood, McIlvaine  and Company,1891.    This   dialogue between \"Ernest\" and \"Gilbert\" is a witty slap in the face to Whistler,   who felt that Wilde could not speak on the visual arts because he was not a   visual artist himself. This essay proposes that \"to know the principles of the   highest art is to know the principles of all the arts,\" and the highest art,   Wilde argues, is Criticism. \"It works with materials, and puts them into a form   that is at once new and delightful.What more can one say of poetry?\" Playing   with Arnold and Pater's rhetoric, Wilde asserts that the object of art is to   \"see the object as in itself it is not.\" Moreover, he states that \"Aesthetics   are higher than ethics. They belong to a more spiritual sphere. To discern the   beauty of a thing is the finest point to which we can arrive.\" In this essay,   Wilde praises Pater outright, obliquely criticizes Whistler, and takes on every   late Victorian argument about the purpose and function of art.          The Yellow Book. Volume I, April, 1894.   The Yellow Book was the brain-child   of Beardsley even down to its title. Novels by the French decadent writer were   often issued in yellow wrappers; the most important of the novels was J.K. Huysmans'   A Rebours , 1883. Beardsley proposed a new illustrated quarterly dedicated   to modern literature and art because \"many brilliant story painters and picture   writers cannot get their best stuff accepted in the conventional magazines,   either because they are not topical, or perhaps a little risqu.\" John Lane   agreed to publish the quarterly with Henry Harland as the literary editor and   Beardsley as the art editor. The Yellow Book published some of the   best authors and artists of the Nineties, often causing scandals to the conservative   public.   The first issue of The Yellow Book provoked outrage. The Times   referred to the \"repulsiveness and insolence\" of the cover; The Westminster   Gazette remarked about the \"Portrait of Mrs. Patrick Campbell\" it would   take \"a short act of Parliament to make this kind of thing illegal.\" Beardsley's   notoriety blossomed and the magazine sold briskly..         Geoffrey Chaucer, (ca. 1343-1400)     The Works of Geoffry Chaucer Newly Imprinted. Hammersmith: TheKelmscott  Press, 1890.   Following his socialist leanings and   his interest in medievalism, William Morris began the Kelmscott Press to bring   the joy of work back into the production of beautiful books. Based on close   study of the early printers, Morris developed typefaces and designed page layouts   that sparked the revival of printing. The influence of his designs can be seen   in all of Wilde's books, especially the first edition of The Picture of   Dorian Gray and The Sphinx.            Oscar Wilde, (1854-1900)     The Sphinx. London: Elkin Mathews and John Lane, 1894. Illustrated   by Charles Ricketts.   Perhaps the most beatiful book designed   in the 1890s, The Sphinx, is a tour de force of decadent style,   Wilde's elaborate poem inspired Charles Ricketts type design, use of three muted   colors of ink - cinnamon, forest, and black - and his exquisite woodcut illustrations.   Ricketts and his lover, Charles Shannon were members of Wilde's circle and Wilde   was a frequent visitor to their studio, The Vale. Basil Hallward's studio in   the opening scene of The Picture of Dorian Gray is modeled after their   studio.          George   Du Maurier, (1834-1896)   In Harper s New Monthly Magazine January-August,   1894.   George Du Maurier's Trilby became   a huge sensation when it was serialized in Harper's magazine in 1894.   Du Maurier had been an artstudent in Paris with Whistler, and while Whistler   became the leading artist of his day, Du Maurier became an illustrator for Punch .   Du Maurier's caricatures of Wilde and the Aesthetic Cult were enormously popular,   and Trilby also features Du Maurier's illustrations. Trilby is the   story of three young artists in Paris who discover a brassy artist's model and   proceed to fall in love with her. Trilby, though tone-deaf, is transformed through   mesmerism into a diva through the evil powers of the musician Svengali. Along   the way, Du Maurier illustrates the life in the studio of young, struggling   artists. Trilby became an overnight sensation, with the Trilby hat   the most memorable remnant of this fame. The Trilby Scrapbook in the Fales collection   represents a collector's excerpts from Harper's, Life, and other sources concerning   Trilby and Whistler's threatened lawsuit over Du Maurier's caricature of him   as the lazy Joe Sibley.          Prospectus for The Savoy   After being ejected from The Yellow   Book , Beardsley found financial support from two men, Andr&eacute; Raffalovich   and Leonard Smithers. Smithers became Beardsley's new publisher, starting The   Savoy with Arthur Symons as literary editor and Beardsley as art editor.   The magazine took its name from The Savoy hotel in which Wilde and Douglas entertained   the young men they met through Alfred Taylor. Beardsley developed his baroque   style in illustrations for The Savoy . Most important, his illustrations   for The Rape of the Lock and The Ballad of the Barber appeared   in subsequent issues. By 1896, shop-owners and newsstands refused to sell The   Savoy . It was a private act of censorship aimed at Beardsley. It worked.   The Savoy ceased publication after the December 1896 issue. Shown is   the suppressed state of the prospectus, which was rejected because of the figure   appears to have an erection.

Using techniques favored by many artists of the 18th century, Cottam excerpts images taken from the headlines or news snippets, and converts them into riveting and intense studies. Delicately rendered in white crayon against a blue page, they are silky threads of memory. Recording moments of journalism, depicting pieces of people, bodies, and the residual effects of mindless, senseless killing, Cottam draws what is reported on the news. The raw contrast between the pathos of a dead child\u2019s body, and the delicacy of his drawing, speaks to Cottam\u2019s intuitive sense of the historical and tragic record of a life, depicted on a paper so thin that it can fly away, like the soul of the tiny body that lies before us.          Working with images of war, much like Goya, Cottam draws and then scrapes back his images, creating and destroying a layered surface. As a result, many of the drawings have a transparent quality, because of the shimmering white crayon against thinned blue paper. The metalpoint that he uses to scrape away the surface also adds polish and sheen to the skinned paper, and mineral spirits added to the crayon create areas of wash.

The first light in the night sky, it is often seen low on the horizon just after sunset. Ericsson plays with the subsequent interpretation of Lucifer as the favored angel who falls from grace, becoming identified with forces of darkness. In these photograms, Lucifer brings light to the paper, revealing a woman&rsquo;s form, fashioning her contours against glossy black.            Playing with light and dark, edges and shadows, Ericsson manipulates both muse and medium to create a sensuous and luminous image.

Using a different medium each time, sometimes paint, sometimes egg, sometimes pigment and oils, she circulates images into a basin of water, dropping viscous liquids into a receptive tray filled with water, coloring the movement and ripples on the surface, with these intense and delicious substances. At times they are suspended like a meniscus on the surface, at times they form shapes, and then dissolve, trailing tails behind.       The movement of the artist's hand over the water, her gesture, is recorded in the three poetic series of polaroids.

Tender  reflections of majestic landscapes, made on site as he traveled through Norway's fjords and   mountains, many of the small works later inspired larger paintings and drawings when he   returned to his studio. They convey his immediate responses to Norwegian landscape. His own   words describe his impressions:     1991. Lofoten, an archipelago within the Artic Circle, mountainous islands reach out into the Norwegian Sea. In late May the &ldquo;midnight sun&rdquo; floats along the horizon. Dusk becomes dawn; one day runs into the next. I was working with pastels using my fingers to grind pigment into pigment. This physical act extends my being directly into the paper. The work is not driven by conscious thought, rather by a series of sensations and the rhythm of my hands responding to the moment.

In his film Dreamsequence , women are posed in diferent rooms that suggest a dramatic stage set. One kneels on the floor in an empty room filling with balloons that drop randomly from the ceiling, and later sits in a chair, lifting her face to a shower of golden glitter raining down upon her skin. The other perches on a chair in a bay window, naked except for the paint on her face, and the tulle enveloping her lower limbs. She moves without speaking, holding a bird in a cage. In the close ups of their faces shown here, they appear as though they are remembered from a dream.

Animals inhabit an interior and domestic landscape, coming to life and interacting with their environment. A group of branches in a vase waves cautiously as if bent by wind toward an unseen place, breaking into pieces and wispy fragments for no apparent reason. A slipcover begins to growl as if ready for attack. A hidden dragon slithers to life in the folds of a drapery, leaving fire in its wake. An archer shoots at a trophy stag from the      comfort of his decorative pose on an ovoid telephone table. A flock of birds twitter against      the back of a sofa. A living room is submerged in standing water, colorless, and linear. A      blue mattress, its coils exposed, floats away on an ocean of coiled lines. The images form a     personal narrative of disquiet.

As an immigrant to the United States from Korea in 1996, his continued fascination with these interactions has led him to create an art practice that embraces sculpture and installation to create interactive spaces. Working in both large-scale monumental sculpture and intimate conceptual pieces, he brings sensitivity and power to his work. Because he wants to break through the confining divisions between audience and artist, he asks a wide range of participants to bring their own concerns to transform his pieces.

This exhibition of horse      drawings spans two important dates connected to the imagery of Irish painter Timothy Hawkesworth: 1 February 2014      marks the beginning of the Year of the Horse, the seventh sign of the Chinese zodiac and an auspicious year recognizing      the power and primal nature of the horse. The end date of the exhibition, 17 March marks Saint Patrick\u2019s Day, named    for the patron saint of Ireland, where Timothy Hawkesworth grew up on a farm and began his relationship with horses.       Hawkesworth\u2019s horses are energetic and rapidly drawn with graphite over wax and paint on paper, moving from right to left, galloping, rearing, and walking with heads bowed, raised or thrown back in restless movement. Evoking the animal nature with figurative representations, like Susan Rothenberg\u2019s horses from the 1970s, Hawkesworth infuses a personal vision in these drawings, and taps into a source of infinite fascination: domesticated animals that retain a wild and untamed spirit.

Duke House. In this body of work Smith engages themes of transience and permanence, movement and color, nature and displacement.       Taking elements of color and bubbles from his ongoing &quot;Painter Project,&quot; Smith transforms them, draping them over the railings of staircases, suspending them from the skylights and floating them across the floor toward the viewer. Using techniques attuned classic films like as director Carol Reed&rsquo;s &ldquo;Odd Man Out (1947, Two Cities film), Jean-Luc Godard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Two or Three Things I Know About Her,&rdquo; (1967, Argos Films), or Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s 1976 classic, &ldquo;Taxi Driver,&rdquo; Smith hones in on the bubbles floating in front of the camera as visual metaphors for the transience of life, the fragility of the moment.

The transformation of the text of James Ferguson's Astronomy Explained upon Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s Principles (1799) began in response to a Victorian astronomy book entitled Flowers of the Sky in the archive of the John Work Garrett Library at Johns Hopkins University.      As the artist describes, the fluid yet tenuous painting on the book pages is analogous to a fragile web or distant constellation. For Smith, flowers are symbols of our selves and of nature, as well as a metaphor for the machinations of the universe. Implicitly, book folios serve as multivalent supports for the painted leaves and flowers that adorn them with color and design imposed over printed words.

The Picture of Dorian Gray   opens in a studio: here Dorian is first seduced by Lord Henry Wotton's decadent   pronouncements and here the picture that leads Dorian to ruin is created. The   dual images of creation and decay represented by the studio draw Wilde's reader   into the very public battle waging over Aestheticism, the movement that adopted   Wilde as its most prominent emblem and most notorious sinner.     The Aesthetic Movement encompassed the   visual arts, the decorative arts, and literature. At Oxford, Wilde studied under   the two great art critics of the Victorian age, Walter Pater and John Ruskin.   Pater's injunction \"to know one's impression as it really is\" underlies Aestheticism's   guiding principle: the sole function of art is to inspire an emotion or create   a mood. Pater's influence on Wilde's art criticism is strong; \"All art is quite   useless,\" Wilde asserts in the Preface to Dorian Gray. The Aesthetic   Movement sought an art that exists for beauty alone. Arguments raged for and   against the amorality of art, with every major thinker and artist of the day   jumping into the fray. The highly publicized court battle between James McNeill   Whistler and John Ruskin over Whistler's aesthetic art set an early precedent   in the battle over the function of art in society. Later, for a time, Whistler   and Wilde were interchangeable figures to the public. They battled in the newspapers   and lecture halls for prominence, and Wilde won. He became the most visible   symbol of Aestheticism in the 1880s; he would become the scapegoat for its excesses,   both real and imagined, in the 1890s.     Wilde's own insistence on the amorality   of art was not uncomplicated, however, as shown in The Picture of Dorian   Gray. The studio represents both the perils and promises of the Aesthetic   Movement: artistic and sexual freedom from moral concerns--a space for homosexuality   and decadence. So long as these freedoms remained buried in the subtext or locked   in the studio, the outside world could enjoy the risque titillation of forbidden   life. But when the doors to the studio where flung open in the press and in   the courts, Wilde's life and art were shattered.   -- Lisa Golmitz      Walter   Pater, (1843-1894}   Studies in the History of the Renaissance. London: Macmillan, 1873.      W.   B. Yeats, in his Autobiography , quotes Wilde as saying of this book,   \"It is my golden book; I never travel anywhere without it; but it is the very   flower of decadence: the last trumpet should have sounded the moment it was   written.\" This is Walter Pater's famous book of essays, in which he attempts   to capture the spirit of the Renaissance through highly personal, impressionistic   sketches of artists and works of art. The Preface boldly gives direction to   Aestheticism, arguing against Matthew Arnold's injunction that one must \"see   the object as in itself it really is.\" Pater modifies this to knowing \"one's   impression as it really is, to discriminate it, to realise it distinctly.\" The   aesthetic critic filters all art through the lens of himself, through the temperament   he cultivates. The Conclusion to the Renaissance became the touchstone   of the Art for Art s Sake Movement, with Pater's passionate injunction \"To burn   always with this hard, gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success   in life.\"          Photograph of Aubrey Beardsley             Serialized   from January through June, 1894, the exploits of Trilby, Svengali and the three   British expatriate artists in Paris were closely followed by an adoring public.   In this illustration by Du Maurier, a caricature of James McNeill Whistler as   Joe Sibley is easily identifiable in the right corner against the wall. If the   text's description of Sibley was unmistakable to an irate Whistler, this illustration   was unmistakable to the public at large. Whistler threatened to sue if the character   was not removed..                    George Du Mau rier,    (1834-1896)      Trilby. New York: Harper's,    1894.     Here is the same illustration from    Trilby in the first hardcover edition of the novel. Du Maurier removed    the offensive references to Whistler from the text, and comically added    a rough beard to the caricature, seen here..                       Wilde v. Whistler: An Acrimonious Correspondence on Art. London:Privately   Printer, 1906.   This leaflet features many of the letters   published in the Pall Mall Gazette from both Wilde and Whistler in   which they argue over the provenance of Aesthetic theory. Whistler began in   his attacks in his series of lectures called \"Mr. Whistler's Ten o'Clock.\" Whistler   liked to believe that Wilde was his disciple, and so Wilde's increasing popularity   galled him. He attacked Wilde for his conceit, and for stealing his best ideas..   Wilde countered in the press and in his essay \"The Decay of Lying,\" which while   borrowing much of Whistler's tone, is a more coherent and interesting spin on   Aesthetic criticism than Whistler could admit.          Whistler v. Ruskin: Art and Art Critics. London: Chatto and Windus,   1878.   In 1887, Whistler displayed several paintings   at the opening of Grosvenor Gallery. John Ruskin, the Slade Professor of Fine   Arts at Oxford and the leading art critic of his day, attacked Whistler's The   Nocturne in Black and Gold [The Falling Rocket] in a review of the show. Ruskin   wrote, \"I have seen and heard much of Cockney impudence before now, but never   expected to hear a coxcomb ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint   in the public's face.\" Whistler was incensed, and sued Ruskin for libel. Although   Whistler argued that the issue of the case was not the merit of his art but   Ruskin's personal attack, the art itself was at the center of the trial. Whistler   won his case, but was awarded only a farthing in damages. Ruskin resigned his   professorship, arguing that a critic who cannot criticize is useless. Whistler   may have been morally vindicated bythe trial, but he was financially devastated.   This pamphlet was his failedattempt to recoup his losses. It was not well-received   by the art world, who sympathized with the fallen Ruskin..         Joris Karl Huysmans, (1848-1907)     Against the Grain. Paris: Groves & Michaux, 1926.    This   is a beautifully illustrated French edition of J.-K. Huysmans' infamous novel,   A Rebours . Huysmans hero, Duc Jean Floressas des Esseintes, is the   prototypical Decadent. Wilde, at his trial, admitted that des Esseintes was   one of the models for Dorian Gray, and that A Rebours is the book he   refers to in the novel that leads Dorian to a life of aesthetic and criminal   excess. Huysman's aesthete creates a completely artistic environment in which   to live, a studio where even artificial scents are introduced to create a mood.   This is an interior space where all manner of decadent behaviors can be indulged,   a space that, as the title implies, relies on nature for nothing. Des Esseintes   moves from one unsatisfying passion to another, never finding satiety for his   appetites.          Oscar   Wilde, (1854-1900)   Salom&eacute;: A Tragedy in One Act. Translated from the French of Oscar   Wilde: Pictured by Aubrey Beardsley. London: Elkin Mathews and John Lane,   1894.   Mallarm&eacute; called it \"fine and sombre   like a chapter of the Apocalypse,\" but Wilde had a difficult time finding anyone   willing to stage this Decadent retelling of the Biblical tale. Written first   in French, Wilde threatened to adopt French citizenship if the British censors   refused to allow an English staging. It was refused by the Lord Chamberlain,   but Wilde went ahead with plans to publish the play in French. Elkin Mathews   & John Lane bought copies printed in France from Wilde for distribution in Britain.   Aubrey Beardsley was hired to illustrate the first English-language edition   of the play after Wilde saw an earlier drawing he had done of Salom&eacute;   for the Studio , and the results are these maniacal, sensuous drawings.            Oscar Wilde, (1854-1900)  \"The Critic as Artist\" in Intentions . London: James R. Osgood, McIlvaine  and Company,1891.    This   dialogue between \"Ernest\" and \"Gilbert\" is a witty slap in the face to Whistler,   who felt that Wilde could not speak on the visual arts because he was not a   visual artist himself. This essay proposes that \"to know the principles of the   highest art is to know the principles of all the arts,\" and the highest art,   Wilde argues, is Criticism. \"It works with materials, and puts them into a form   that is at once new and delightful.What more can one say of poetry?\" Playing   with Arnold and Pater's rhetoric, Wilde asserts that the object of art is to   \"see the object as in itself it is not.\" Moreover, he states that \"Aesthetics   are higher than ethics. They belong to a more spiritual sphere. To discern the   beauty of a thing is the finest point to which we can arrive.\" In this essay,   Wilde praises Pater outright, obliquely criticizes Whistler, and takes on every   late Victorian argument about the purpose and function of art.          The Yellow Book. Volume I, April, 1894.   The Yellow Book was the brain-child   of Beardsley even down to its title. Novels by the French decadent writer were   often issued in yellow wrappers; the most important of the novels was J.K. Huysmans'   A Rebours , 1883. Beardsley proposed a new illustrated quarterly dedicated   to modern literature and art because \"many brilliant story painters and picture   writers cannot get their best stuff accepted in the conventional magazines,   either because they are not topical, or perhaps a little risqu.\" John Lane   agreed to publish the quarterly with Henry Harland as the literary editor and   Beardsley as the art editor. The Yellow Book published some of the   best authors and artists of the Nineties, often causing scandals to the conservative   public.   The first issue of The Yellow Book provoked outrage. The Times   referred to the \"repulsiveness and insolence\" of the cover; The Westminster   Gazette remarked about the \"Portrait of Mrs. Patrick Campbell\" it would   take \"a short act of Parliament to make this kind of thing illegal.\" Beardsley's   notoriety blossomed and the magazine sold briskly..         Geoffrey Chaucer, (ca. 1343-1400)     The Works of Geoffry Chaucer Newly Imprinted. Hammersmith: TheKelmscott  Press, 1890.   Following his socialist leanings and   his interest in medievalism, William Morris began the Kelmscott Press to bring   the joy of work back into the production of beautiful books. Based on close   study of the early printers, Morris developed typefaces and designed page layouts   that sparked the revival of printing. The influence of his designs can be seen   in all of Wilde's books, especially the first edition of The Picture of   Dorian Gray and The Sphinx.            Oscar Wilde, (1854-1900)     The Sphinx. London: Elkin Mathews and John Lane, 1894. Illustrated   by Charles Ricketts.   Perhaps the most beatiful book designed   in the 1890s, The Sphinx, is a tour de force of decadent style,   Wilde's elaborate poem inspired Charles Ricketts type design, use of three muted   colors of ink - cinnamon, forest, and black - and his exquisite woodcut illustrations.   Ricketts and his lover, Charles Shannon were members of Wilde's circle and Wilde   was a frequent visitor to their studio, The Vale. Basil Hallward's studio in   the opening scene of The Picture of Dorian Gray is modeled after their   studio.          George   Du Maurier, (1834-1896)   In Harper s New Monthly Magazine January-August,   1894.   George Du Maurier's Trilby became   a huge sensation when it was serialized in Harper's magazine in 1894.   Du Maurier had been an artstudent in Paris with Whistler, and while Whistler   became the leading artist of his day, Du Maurier became an illustrator for Punch .   Du Maurier's caricatures of Wilde and the Aesthetic Cult were enormously popular,   and Trilby also features Du Maurier's illustrations. Trilby is the   story of three young artists in Paris who discover a brassy artist's model and   proceed to fall in love with her. Trilby, though tone-deaf, is transformed through   mesmerism into a diva through the evil powers of the musician Svengali. Along   the way, Du Maurier illustrates the life in the studio of young, struggling   artists. Trilby became an overnight sensation, with the Trilby hat   the most memorable remnant of this fame. The Trilby Scrapbook in the Fales collection   represents a collector's excerpts from Harper's, Life, and other sources concerning   Trilby and Whistler's threatened lawsuit over Du Maurier's caricature of him   as the lazy Joe Sibley.          Prospectus for The Savoy   After being ejected from The Yellow   Book , Beardsley found financial support from two men, Andr&eacute; Raffalovich   and Leonard Smithers. Smithers became Beardsley's new publisher, starting The   Savoy with Arthur Symons as literary editor and Beardsley as art editor.   The magazine took its name from The Savoy hotel in which Wilde and Douglas entertained   the young men they met through Alfred Taylor. Beardsley developed his baroque   style in illustrations for The Savoy . Most important, his illustrations   for The Rape of the Lock and The Ballad of the Barber appeared   in subsequent issues. By 1896, shop-owners and newsstands refused to sell The   Savoy . It was a private act of censorship aimed at Beardsley. It worked.   The Savoy ceased publication after the December 1896 issue. Shown is   the suppressed state of the prospectus, which was rejected because of the figure   appears to have an erection.

and practice of theater and performance. The study of this ancient, universal, and multi-faceted art form illuminates the power of the imagination in engaging with and shaping the political and spiritual lives of individuals and cultures. The concentration in Theater is designed to be combined with a major in another discipline and to develop the student's capacity for intellectual and creative risk-taking in the pursuit of knowledge. The expressive and interpretive skills developed in working with dramatic material make the concentration in Theater an excellent component of a well-rounded liberal arts education. All courses that a student wishes to count towards the concentration in Theater must be approved in advance by the student's mentor, including those taken at NYU's global sites. Only one course may double-count for the concentration in Theater and another major or concentration.

In this course students design sound for ongoing theatrical productions, films by NYUAD students, or installation work, and learn how to approach sound design for these diverse media. Topics such as Automatic Dialog Replacement (ADR), Foley, post-synchronized sound and musique concr&egrave;te techniques are covered, and several examples of sound design for film and theatrical performance are analyzed and discussed in class, leading the students to develop their own conceptual approaches to sound design.    * Prerequiste: MUSIC-AD 106 and MUSIC-AD 120 or equivalent.

THEAT-AD 100 Making Theater                                                                           / Required                                                                                                              Working as a performance company, students learn the fundamentals of collaborative theater-making. Acting and performance are central to the process, but so is the recognition that a performance takes place in a space that has to be invested with rules and conventions before it can tell a story. Exploring the possibilities offered by these rules and conventions is key to understanding the potential for theater as a means of expression and mode of knowledge. Combining the tools and techniques of Aristotle, Stanislavsky, Meyerhold, Brecht, Grotowski, Brook, and Bogart, students work in groups to devise and stage silent stories as well as textual scenes to explore what it means to create a theatrical experience. All students participate as directors, actors, designers, and audience, and discuss each other&rsquo;s work in order to develop a clearer and more objective relationship to their own.

The course introduces key terms and methodologies for understanding performance as an object of analysis and a means of expressive behavior. We explore how particular theories of drama emerge at historical moments and why; we do so by looking at those theories embodiment on the stage, in dramatic literature, in public, and in everyday life. The aim of this class is to provide a performance vocabulary that will serve as a foundation and framework for advanced studies. Although this is not a survey of theatre history, the course will draw from a wide variety of historical plays and performances to elucidate the critical concerns of the field.

We engage the body as an expressive tool in support of artistic craft and technique and build confidence in our ability to translate creative impulses through physical action. The course guides the student through awareness of and release from habitual tensions and into body alignment, breathing, resonators, sound and movement, group interaction, and the exploration of individual and group creativity. We focus on the kinetic application of movement in the art-making process, using core energy, dynamics, breath connection, strength, flexibility, range of motion, stamina, and relaxation techniques in order to strengthen our creative output. The goal is a free voice in a free body and the ability to express thought and emotion with openness and truth.

Students build a directorial vocabulary for translating impulse and imagination into compelling narrative and non-narrative staged moments. Using techniques from Brecht, Brook, Grotowski, and Bogart, students learn to articulate ideas to actors in compelling and inspiring ways. Students explore physical exercises to increase their range as directors; tools with which to fuel actors physically and emotionally; and theories of collaboration and ensemble. The core of the class is the exploration of directing as a physical collaboration with actors within a landscape of thought, emotion, openness, and truth.

Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus&rsquo;s Historical Miniatures, &lsquo;Udwan&rsquo;s The Trial of the Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus&rsquo;s The Elephant, Diyab&rsquo;s Strangers Don&rsquo;t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki&rsquo;s use of the halqa and Wannus&rsquo; inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus&rsquo;s and Farag&rsquo;s use of the Arabian Nights Tales, Al-Hakim&rsquo;s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim&rsquo;s use of Greek myth).

THEAT-AD 151 Dramas from the African Continent and the African Diaspora                                                                              In this course, we critique 20th- and 21st century plays from the African continent, including works from Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, Ethiopia, and South Africa (the Sub-Saharan countries) as well as from Tunis, Algeria, Egypt, Libya Morocco, and Tunisia (North African countries). From a variety of critical theoretical discourses, our discussions focus on the theatrical practices demanded by the texts, along with the intersections and divergences of structures and topics shared by continental plays, such as blackness and race, exile, colonialism and post-colonialism, violence, gender inequality, family, moral and social values, interraciality, religion, and political resistance. The plays from North Africa that align with the Arab world will serve as a bridge to introduce noteworthy works from the African diaspora, with plays written by Africans or those of African ancestry living in the Middle East, Europe, and the United States.

THEAT-AD 152 Art, Performance, and Social Practice                                                        How do we begin to know each other differently from the way in which dominant social systems and communicative technologies structure our daily interactions? This question drives art and performance&rsquo;s &ldquo;social turn&rdquo; to real-world collaborations between artists and performers who act in the role of instigators or catalysts with the communities around them. The social turn explicitly rejects the artist&rsquo;s more traditional role as the producer of a consumable aesthetic object or theatrical performance and instead proposes that the conscious processes of collaborative engagement -- activist, participatory, coauthored &ndash; must be understood and valued as art. In this intertwining of art with performance, cooperative processes are foregrounded as frameworks to understand and shift the impact of political and social policy, architecture, art history, urban planning, and new media on our lives. The social practice of art proposes that in making encounters where artists engage with the members of communities as &ldquo;expert participants,&rdquo; we might construct more livable alternatives through social cooperation. Art as social practice also insists that this process is an aesthetic practice. In this course we will read recent critical theories and histories of the aesthetics and politics of the social practice of art, explore case studies of &ldquo;relational art,&rdquo; and collaborate on our own &ldquo;living as form&rdquo; project.

Training exercises are used to develop kinesthetic awareness, focus, listening, character, action, creativity, imagination, and collaboration. Through a holistic approach connected to recent findings in cognitive science, students build technical craft as well as begin to remove obstructive physical, vocal and mental habits, so as to release the full potential of the responsiveness, expressivity, and presence of their actor/performer instruments: the body-mind.    *Prerequisites are: THEAT-AD 110 Fundamentals of Acting OR THEAT-AD 111 Body at Work: Voice and Movement for the Artist    Students in the NYUNY Drama Dept: This course counts as an elective credit towards the major .
