A selection of representative research topics can be found by looking through our working paper series.  The research conducted by the group has an explicitly applied focus, using both theoretical and empirical approaches to understand contemporary issues relevant to both the firms engaged in global commerce and to the policy makers that set the rules by which that commerce is conducted. Toward this end, the research group aims to foster substantive research that contributes to a deeper understanding of economic theory and measurement, as applied to this broad area of inquiry.
