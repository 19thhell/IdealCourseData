Click here to download the CV              Professor Becker's research interests include Christian martyrdom in the Sasanian Empire, Jewish-Christian relations in Late Antiquity, the social and intellectual history of the Syriac (Christian Aramaic) tradition, the missionary encounter in the nineteenth century, and the theoretical problems relating to the study of religion in pre-modernity. His book, Fear of God and the Beginning of Wisdom: The School of Nisibis and the Development of Christian Scholastic Culture in Late Antique Mesopotamia (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006), is a history of the East Syrian (i.e. Syriac \"Nestorian\" Christian) school movement and includes material on the reception of the Neoplatonic version of Aristotelian logic in Mesopotamia in the sixth century CE. He has also published an annotated translation of some of the most important East Syrian school sources. His most recent book, Revival and Awakening: American Evangelical Missionaries and the Origins of Assyrian Nationalism (forthcoming March 2015) addresses the interaction between American Evangelical missionaries and the indigenous Christian community of upper Mesoptamia in the nineteenth and early twentieth century and the secular ethnic nationalism that resulted from this encounter. He is currently working on Syriac sources from late fifth century upper Mesopotamia to address the question of Christianity and inculturation. Prof. Becker's background is in philology and history of religions in antiquity, but he regularly teaches courses on secularism and social theoretical approaches to religion. His undergraduate lecture courses include \"Introduction to the New Testament,\" \"Martyrdom: Ancient and Modern,\" and \"Utopias and Dystopias.\" He often reads Latin, Greek, and Syriac sources with students.

The colloquium explores the place of Judaism and Christianity in the historical and social setting of the ancient world. The formative period for classical Judaism and the origins of Christianity unfolded in the wider setting of the cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and Mesopotamia. Yet, Judaism and Christianity are often studied in isolation from this broader context. Scholars of Judaism and Christianity will examine the many ways that these two religions were shaped by the experience of living among these ancient civilizations.   Presentations include \u201cSelling Souls: Early Christians (and Their Neighbors) as Religious Entrepreneurs\u201d and \u201cPractices of Seeing God(s) in Late Antiquity\u201d as well as \u201cThe New Testament as a Source for the History of the Jews and Judaism,\u201d the keynote address by NYU\u2019s Lawrence Schiffman (March 26, 5:15 p.m.).   The full program may be viewed here .   The event is free and open to the public, which may call 212.992.7978 or email ancient.studies@nyu.edu for more information.

Click here to download the CV              Professor Becker's research interests include Christian martyrdom in the Sasanian Empire, Jewish-Christian relations in Late Antiquity, the social and intellectual history of the Syriac (Christian Aramaic) tradition, the missionary encounter in the nineteenth century, and the theoretical problems relating to the study of religion in pre-modernity. His book, Fear of God and the Beginning of Wisdom: The School of Nisibis and the Development of Christian Scholastic Culture in Late Antique Mesopotamia (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006), is a history of the East Syrian (i.e. Syriac \"Nestorian\" Christian) school movement and includes material on the reception of the Neoplatonic version of Aristotelian logic in Mesopotamia in the sixth century CE. He has also published an annotated translation of some of the most important East Syrian school sources. His most recent book, Revival and Awakening: American Evangelical Missionaries and the Origins of Assyrian Nationalism (forthcoming March 2015) addresses the interaction between American Evangelical missionaries and the indigenous Christian community of upper Mesoptamia in the nineteenth and early twentieth century and the secular ethnic nationalism that resulted from this encounter. He is currently working on Syriac sources from late fifth century upper Mesopotamia to address the question of Christianity and inculturation. Prof. Becker's background is in philology and history of religions in antiquity, but he regularly teaches courses on secularism and social theoretical approaches to religion. His undergraduate lecture courses include \"Introduction to the New Testament,\" \"Martyrdom: Ancient and Modern,\" and \"Utopias and Dystopias.\" He often reads Latin, Greek, and Syriac sources with students.
