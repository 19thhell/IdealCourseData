Description       Literature is obsessed with animals. They howl and lurch through the history of literary art: creatures with clawed wings; faces that breathe fire; whales that smash ships; and men who turn into insects, wolves, and bats. We will begin our exploration of this obsession with two scenes at the origin of the Western tradition: Adam giving names to the creatures assembled in the Garden of Eden, and Aristotle declaring that the real difference between \u201cman and other animals\u201d is that man alone possesses language. Setting out with an examination of the\u00a0 representation \u00a0of animals in literary and philosophical texts, we will soon take our cue from Emerson\u2019s mysterious statement that \u201cevery word was once an animal,\u201d and consider how some works of literature ask to be read\u00a0 as \u00a0animals \u2013 unpredictable, strangely animate, and uneasily familiar. In the course of exploring the link between animals and language, we will pay special attention to our own writing. We will discuss the construction of analytical and critical arguments, and ask some fascinating questions along the way. What does it mean to write about writing? What is at stake when we take a piece of literature as an object of study? In addition to Genesis and Book I of Aristotle\u2019s\u00a0 Politics \u00a0, our readings may include selections from the fables of Aesop and La Fontaine;\u00a0 Gulliver\u2019s Travels \u00a0(Jonathan Swift); selections from the poetry of William Wordsworth and Percy Bysshe Shelley;\u00a0 Frankenstein \u00a0(Mary Shelley); selections from\u00a0 On the \u00a0\u00a0 Origin of Species \u00a0(Charles Darwin); and\u00a0 Elizabeth Costello \u00a0(J.M.

Description       This course will address problems of language and writing through the rapidly growing theoretical field of animal studies. We will examine a diverse array of writing about animals\u2014from literature to philosophy and science writing\u2014considering what depictions of animals (including humans) tell us about emotion, language, agency, humanity, and animality. How do we describe the animal and what do the words we use tell us about how animals are understood? Why has the animal posed such a problem for philosophers of language and literature, especially those concerned with the problem of description? Students will learn how literary and scientific texts use words to make explicit and implicit claims about animals and how to make interpretive arguments that intervene in a scholarly conversation about a text. Readings may include Charles Darwin\u2019s\u00a0 The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals \u00a0, Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll\u2019s\u00a0 A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans \u00a0, Giorgio Agamben's\u00a0 The Open: Man and Animal \u00a0, Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cOn Truth and Lies in and Extra-moral Sense,\u201d Roland Barthes\u2019 \u201cThe Reality Effect,\u201d and poetry by Marianne Moore and Elizabeth Bishop. Students will write several short essays that compare representations of the animal in the texts under discussion as well as research and participate in a critical debate about a text. The class culminates with a research paper for which students investigate a piece of writing of their choice that engages the question how animals are or should be described.
