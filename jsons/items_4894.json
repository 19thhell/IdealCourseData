Focuses on  the core concepts that intersect the constituent programs of SCA:  Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/Pacific/American Studies  (A/P/A), Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latino Studies, and  Metropolitan Studies. The course surveys basic approaches to a range  of significant analytical concepts (e.g., property, work, technology,  nature, popular culture, consumption, and knowledge), each one  considered within a two-week unit.      Approaches to Gender  and Sexuality Studies   SCA-UA 401 Offered at  least once a year. 4 points.   Designed to interest  and challenge both the student new to the study of gender and  sexuality and the student who has taken departmental courses focusing  on women, gender, and/or sexuality. Through a focus on particular  issues and topics, explores the construction of sex, gender, and  sexuality; gender asymmetry in society; sexual normativity and  violations of norms; and the interactions of sex, gender, sexuality,  race, class, and nation. This interdisciplinary course engages  materials and methodologies from a range of media and disciplines,  such as literature, the visual arts, history, sociology, psychology,  and anthropology. Examines both feminist and nonfeminist arguments  from a variety of critical perspectives.
