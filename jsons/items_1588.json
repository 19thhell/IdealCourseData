Their hope was to escape the religious persecution they faced in their own countries. However, the people who fled England did not want to establish a church like the Church of England. They simply wanted their choice of practicing any sort of religion freely. Religious diversity had become a dominant part of England's Thirteen Colonies.

Oftentimes, analyses focus on the battles that were fought, the generals that became heroes, and the political ideologies that swept through the minds of individuals such as Jefferson or Washington.                  In this website, we urge teachers and students to examine another part of the American Revolution: the everyday life activities that occurred during this era. By analyzing different aspects of religion, health &amp; medicine, education, music, and work, both teachers and students can understand the American Revolution better. What was everyday life like during the American Revolution? How did the American Revolution affect schools, churches, middle-class workers, or doctors? Has the American Revolution created any everlasting traditions in the everyday life of Americans? These are questions to keep in mind as we examine The American Revolution: The Everyday Life Perspective .
