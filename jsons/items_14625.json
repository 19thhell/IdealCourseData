Everyone who applies for a position is required to create an application which includes certain information. Any required information is denoted with an asterisk (*). However, the more information you provide, the easier it will be to effectively evaluate your skills, abilities and qualifications.

How do I go about submitting my cover letter and my resume?                                                       You will be able to submit a resume and cover letter each time you apply for a position. There will be directions prompting you how and when to attach your documents. Please note that attaching a resume does not substitute for completing the application form.

Yes; for example, you can copy and paste the information from a Word or WordPerfect document directly into the appropriate fields in the application form.

What happens after I submit my application and resume in the system?                                                       Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                            How long do you keep applications on file?                                                       Your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for job opportunities for one year.                                                                                                                                                                            What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.                                                                                                                                                                            How do I apply for faculty or research positions?                                                       Academic positions (faculty and research scientists) are advertised in a variety of venues (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, professional journals) by individual schools and/or academic departments within NYU. Therefore, all inquiries should be directed specifically to the appropriate school or department.

Bobby Vallejo                                                    Meet Bobby:                               College of Arts &amp; Sciences     Economics     Hometown: Medford, NJ   Ask me about: The Transfer &amp; Transitioning Student Association, study abroad, internships, commuting from New Jersey     My advice to new transfer and visitng students: Although transferring may be difficult, I found that the best way to meet new people is to take advantage of the transfer events and groups at NYU.&amp;nbsp; I have had so much fun and met so many new people through my involvement in transfer life at NYU.&amp;nbsp; Also, visit the Student Resource Center if you ever have any questions or if you want to learn more about the different resources and opportunities that NYU offers you. Everyone in the SRC is really nice and always eager to help.                                                                          Chad Wong                                                    Meet Chad:                               Leonard N. Stern School of Business   Finance and Economics     Hometown: Vancouver, BC     Ask me about: Sports, travelling, study abroad, movies, &amp; NYC     My advice to new transfer and transitioning students: Take advantage of all that NYC and NYU have to offer. The best way to get involved is to venture outside of your comfort zone: Take courses you can\u2019t find anywhere else, join different clubs, walk around the city until you\u2019re lost. Keep exploring and keep an open mind!                                                 Jamie Bellissimo                                                    Meet Jamie:                               College of Arts &amp; Science   Psychology   Hometown: East Stroudsburg, PA   Ask me about: Clubs and activities, Study abroad in Florence, &amp; living on campus   My advice to new transfer and visiting students: Don't be afraid to go to an event solo- some of my best memories were meeting fellow transfers who couldn't find anyone to go with! Additionally, don't be afraid to go out and adventure- moving to NYC is one of the best decisions I ever made, and I am so happy I got the opportunity to get to know the different parts of the city (sometimes by even getting lost!).                                                Kylie Unell                                                  Meet Kylie:                                   Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development          Early Childhood Education and Political Science      Hometown:     Overland Park, Kansas, Modi\u2019in, Israel &amp; Greensboro, NC - I\u2019ve moved around.    Ask me about:     Best places to get work done, transitioning smoothly, subway system, theatre, best dollar slices, politics and anything else on your mind!     My advice to new transfer and transitioning students:     Take a second to imagine the incredible things you have heard about NYU. Now, take a second to imagine something even better. That is NYU. It is even better than you imagine it to be. While it can be easy to get distracted by all that\u2019s going on around you \u2013 trust me, there\u2019s a lot - stay focused on the important things, but don\u2019t let them be all that you live for. Doing well in school is important, but it doesn\u2019t compare to experiences that will last you a lifetime. Take advantage of as much as you can! The key is balance. Once you\u2019ve mastered that, I can guarantee that you will thrive here!                                               Ward Pettibone                                                    Meet Ward:                               College of Arts &amp; Sciences   Neural Science &amp; Computer Science     Hometown: Providence, RI     Ask me about: Clubs and activities, apartment life &amp; cheap tickets to cool shows     My advice to new transfer and visiting students: Get out and explore - bring some friends, bring some strangers who hopefully will become friends! NYC is a really exciting place to be, and NYU is great about facilitating these little adventures every so often. Don't be shy about inviting people to things - odds are they'll be thrilled to come along!

If you close your browser prior to clicking SAVE AND CONTINUE TO NEXT or SAVE AND STAY ON THIS PAGE your application and account will be saved, but you will lose the information on the last page that was not saved.                                                                                                                                                                            How do I go about submitting my cover letter and my resume?                                                       You will be able to submit a resume and cover letter each time you apply for a position. There will be directions prompting you how and when to attach your documents. Please note that attaching a resume does not substitute for completing the application form.

Yes; for example, you can copy and paste the information from a Word or WordPerfect document directly into the appropriate fields in the application form.

Your resume is accessible immediately upon completion of your online submission.

What happens after I submit my application and resume in the system?                                                       Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                            How long do you keep applications on file?                                                       Your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for job opportunities for one year.                                                                                                                                                                            What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.                                                                                                                                                                            How do I apply for faculty or research positions?                                                       Academic positions (faculty and research scientists) are advertised in a variety of venues (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, professional journals) by individual schools and/or academic departments within NYU. Therefore, all inquiries should be directed specifically to the appropriate school or department.

Chad Wong                                                    Meet Chad:                               Leonard N. Stern School of Business   Finance and Economics     Hometown: Vancouver, BC     Ask me about: Sports, travelling, study abroad, movies, &amp; NYC     My advice to new transfer and transitioning students: Take advantage of all that NYC and NYU have to offer. The best way to get involved is to venture outside of your comfort zone: Take courses you can\u2019t find anywhere else, join different clubs, walk around the city until you\u2019re lost. Keep exploring and keep an open mind!                                                 Jamie Bellissimo                                                    Meet Jamie:                               College of Arts &amp; Science   Psychology   Hometown: East Stroudsburg, PA   Ask me about: Clubs and activities, Study abroad in Florence, &amp; living on campus   My advice to new transfer and visiting students: Don't be afraid to go to an event solo- some of my best memories were meeting fellow transfers who couldn't find anyone to go with! Additionally, don't be afraid to go out and adventure- moving to NYC is one of the best decisions I ever made, and I am so happy I got the opportunity to get to know the different parts of the city (sometimes by even getting lost!).                                                Kylie Unell                                                  Meet Kylie:                                   Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development          Early Childhood Education and Political Science      Hometown:     Overland Park, Kansas, Modi\u2019in, Israel &amp; Greensboro, NC - I\u2019ve moved around.    Ask me about:     Best places to get work done, transitioning smoothly, subway system, theatre, best dollar slices, politics and anything else on your mind!     My advice to new transfer and transitioning students:     Take a second to imagine the incredible things you have heard about NYU. Now, take a second to imagine something even better. That is NYU. It is even better than you imagine it to be. While it can be easy to get distracted by all that\u2019s going on around you \u2013 trust me, there\u2019s a lot - stay focused on the important things, but don\u2019t let them be all that you live for. Doing well in school is important, but it doesn\u2019t compare to experiences that will last you a lifetime. Take advantage of as much as you can! The key is balance. Once you\u2019ve mastered that, I can guarantee that you will thrive here!                                               Ward Pettibone                                                    Meet Ward:                               College of Arts &amp; Sciences   Neural Science &amp; Computer Science     Hometown: Providence, RI     Ask me about: Clubs and activities, apartment life &amp; cheap tickets to cool shows     My advice to new transfer and visiting students: Get out and explore - bring some friends, bring some strangers who hopefully will become friends! NYC is a really exciting place to be, and NYU is great about facilitating these little adventures every so often. Don't be shy about inviting people to things - odds are they'll be thrilled to come along!
