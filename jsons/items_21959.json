Objectives    This course introduces the concepts and tools necessary for building robust web applications using the Microsoft .NET Framework. Among the topics explored will be the multi-language .NET architecture, build and deployment process, the C# programming language, Entity Framework, Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, web services, TFS version control, and the Azure cloud platform. This is a hands- on, project-based course where students will collaborate to build a fully functional web solution. Students must have administrative access to a Windows-based computer. A laptop is preferable so students may follow the demonstrations in class. Visual Studio 2013 Express Edition or higher, and a number of other components will be installed throughout the semester.    This is a a &quot;hands on&quot; course where students will learn by doing. There will be individual assignments, but (remote) collaboration with team members will also be required. Since this is a graduate level course, students should expect to cover material more deeply and also more rapidly than in an undergraduate setting.    Prerequisites    No prior knowledge of the .NET, C#, or the Visual Studio products is assumed or expected prior to entering this course. It is highly recommended that students have background in programming languages, object-oriented programming, relational databases, and data structures prior to taking this couse.
