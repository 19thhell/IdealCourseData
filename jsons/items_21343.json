I wore Old Navy flip-flops, nothing else. It was the middle of the afternoon in Africa.   This past weekend, I had the opportunity to visit and stay the night in a rural village in the Volta region of Ghana. There, we helped do some construction work and were chosen by families in the village to be their guest for the night. It was awesome; we danced, ate, sang, and everyone was adopted for the day and got to live the life of their respective family. Trips like these are what make studying abroad most satisfying, and being able to escape the modernity of Accra for first-hand experiences in traditional settings lends itself to the most unforgettable memories.   The village we stayed in had power but no running water. So, women and children were often tasked with fetching water from a stream about a mile away. This water was used for everything from cooking to cleaning, and, most relevant to my story, bathing. You see, people in Ghana who don\u2019t have plumbing take something called bucket baths. They\u2019re exactly what they sound like- you use a bucket full of water to bathe yourself. My host family instructed me to strip and was gave me about a yard of fabric to cover myself with once I was naked. Then, I was led to the shower area, which was about 20 feet away from the \u201chouse.\u201d The structure was made of dried palm fronds and sticks, and had an opening in one wall for you to enter and exit through. There was a stick that fit horizontally across this opening, and when a person goes in (s)he\u2019s supposed to take off the cloth and drape it over the stick to cover this gap in fencing. However, this was all really a technicality for me because since I\u2019m so tall and the walls are so short, anyone who looked was able to see anything they wanted.   So, there I was, naked in the jungle in Africa. Like I said, the walls of the shower only came up to my waist, so the people walking by could definitely see me in\u2026all my glory. Oddly, I wasn\u2019t as upset or nervous about this as I thought I would be. I dunno, it was just really nice to be naked with the sun shining on my back and a warm breeze slowly drying me off as I listened to birds sing and children play. The water wasn\u2019t hot, there was no multi-setting shower head, and I don\u2019t exactly know how clean I was when I was done, but I think that shower will go down as one of the best I\u2019ve ever taken.   So, if you\u2019ve recently been accepted (congratulations!) and are on the fence about attending NYU, just think about how this school allowed me to bathe in the jungle. And, if that doesn\u2019t scare you off, I think you\u2019ll fit right in.                             1 Comment                Great Story. 100% you took me there. I am Indian and I lived in Nigeria for years. You reminded me of my those days where in remote place of Nigeria travel, we had the exact same experience. You refreshed my memory again..Thank you.
