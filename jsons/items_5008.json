This is normally interpreted as the satisfactory completion of  Conversation and Composition (FREN-UA 30) with the grade of B-minus or better  (or an equivalent course or exam). No grade lower than C may be counted toward  the major. The overall GPA in French courses must be 2.0 or above. All  students who wish to major in the Department of French must declare with the  department and consult a departmental adviser prior to any registration.          The  major consists of nine 4-point courses (36 points), distributed as follows:   Written Contemporary French (FREN-UA 105). Advanced Composition (FREN-UA 9106,  taught in Paris) may be substituted.   Three core courses. Every major must take at least one course in the two-course  sequence Readings in French Literature I: From the Middle Ages to the French  Revolution (FREN-UA 120) and Readings in French Literature II: From 1800 to the  Present (FREN-UA 121). The other core courses to choose from are: Approaches to  Francophone Literature (FREN-UA 145), French Society and Culture from the  Middle Ages to the Modern Period (FREN-UA 163), and Contemporary France  (FREN-UA 164).   Four electives. Up to two electives may be advanced language courses chosen  from: Spoken Contemporary French (FREN-UA 101), Phonetics (FREN-UA 103),  Translation (FREN-UA 107), Advanced Techniques of Translation (FREN-UA 108),  Acting French (FREN-UA 109), and Business French (FREN-UA 110). The other  electives must revolve around French and Francophone literature and civilization.  With permission of the adviser, students may take some electives at the same  time as core courses. With permission, students may also substitute additional  core courses, or a graduate course, for electives. Approved courses taken in  French universities may count as electives.   A Senior Seminar. The Senior Seminar (FREN-UA 991, 992) is typically taken in  the fall or spring of senior year. At  least one of the courses completed in fulfillment of the major (either a core  course or an elective) must focus on the period preceding 1800. Majors may  count one of the department's English-language courses toward the major, but  only if they do the written work in French.          Transfer  students must complete at least five courses (20 points) of the nine courses  required for the French major at the College of Arts and Science or at NYU  Paris.          A  student who fulfills the requirements above may thereby fulfill the state  minimum of 24 credits required for certification to teach French in New York  State junior or senior high schools. For information on minors in education,  please see the section on cross-school minors in this Bulletin.                Major  in Romance Languages      See  the Romance languages section of this Bulletin for details and requirements.                Major  in French and Linguistics      This  joint major requires a total of nine 4-point courses (36 points).          The  French part of this major is satisfied by taking four 4-point courses (16  points) as follows:   One advanced language course chosen from the following:   Spoken Contemporary French (FREN-UA 101)   Phonetics (FREN-UA 103)   Translation (FREN-UA 107)   Advanced Techniques of Translation (FREN-UA 108)   Acting French (FREN-UA 109)   Business French (FREN-UA 110)   One course in advanced written French (usually Written Contemporary French,  FREN-UA 105)   Two courses in French literature (in French), to be determined in consultation  with the director of undergraduate studies The  linguistics part of this major is satisfied by taking the following five  4-point courses (20 points):   One introductory course: Language (LING-UA 1) or Language and Mind (LING-UA 3,  formerly 28)   Sound and Language (LING-UA 11)   Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13)   And a total of two additional courses from two different fields of linguistics,  chosen from the following (please see linguistics section in this Bulletin for  course titles and descriptions):   Historical linguistics (LING-UA 14, LING-UA 17, LING-UA 76)   Sociolinguistics (LING-UA 15, LING-UA 18, LING-UA 30, LING-UA 38)   Phonology (LING-UA 12)   Semantics (LING-UA 4)   Computational linguistics (LING-UA 3, LING-UA 24)   Psycholinguistics (LING-UA 5, LING-UA 43, LING-UA 54)          Minors  in French      All  students who wish to minor in the Department of French must declare with the  department and consult a departmental adviser prior to any registration.          Students  may choose one of four programs of study. They may minor in French studies,  French literature in translation, literature in translation, or Francophone  studies.          French Studies   This minor consists of four courses (16 points) above the intermediate level to  be determined in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies.   Students pursuing a French studies minor can focus either on language  courses or on language and literature courses. Only courses taught in  French can count toward this minor. In addition, no grade lower than C counts  toward this minor.          French Literature in Translation   This minor is for students who have an interest in French literature but do not  yet have the linguistic preparation to read this literature in French. This  minor consists of four courses (16 points) taught in English that focus on  French literature. The courses are to be chosen in consultation with the  director of undergraduate studies. No grade lower than a C counts toward this  minor.          Literature in Translation   This minor is for students who have an interest in the literature of several different countries and/or cultures and wish to explore that literature through English translation. This minor consists of four courses (16 points) taught in English with a focus on foreign (i.e., not written in English) literature offered by participating CAS disciplines (classics, comparative literature, dramatic literature, East Asian studies, English, French, German, Hebrew and Judaic studies, Italian, Middle Eastern and Islamic studies, Russian and Slavic studies, Spanish and Portuguese). A student majoring in a specific language cannot take courses in his or her home department for this minor. In addition, a student must take courses from at least two different departments for this minor, with no more than two courses from the same department. No grade lower than a C counts toward this minor.          Francophone Studies   This minor is for students with an interest in French-language literature and  culture outside of France (e.g., in Africa, the Caribbean, Canada, the U.S., or  the Far East). This minor consists of four courses (16 points). Approaches to  Francophone Literature (FREN-UA 145) is required; the three other courses must  be taught in French and chosen in consultation with the director of  undergraduate studies. With permission of the French department, a course  taught in English can be counted toward this minor if the coursework is  completed in French. Courses focusing on the literature or culture of France do  not count toward this minor. No grade lower than a C counts toward this minor.              Internships      In  addition to the basic requirements for the major, students also have the  opportunity to participate in internships sponsored by the Department of  French. Recent internships have been completed at the French cultural services  office, the French music office, and the French film office. For more  information, please contact the undergraduate administrative aide. Internships  and independent studies do not count toward the French major, except with  special permission of the department.                Honors  Program          Eligibility      A  student must spend a minimum of three full semesters in residence at the  College of Arts and Science. Attendance at NYU Paris counts toward such residence.  The student must maintain an overall GPA of at least 3.65 and a major average  of 3.65 or higher. Students who wish to pursue honors should apply to the  departmental director of honors during their junior year.          Requirements for Honors   Completion of all major requirements (above).   In addition to enrollment in a Senior Seminar (FREN-UA 991, 992), candidates  for French honors must also enroll in Honors Thesis (FREN-UA 995), a 4-point  course taken over both semesters of the senior year (2 points in the fall, 2  points in the spring). This Honors Thesis course sequence cannot count toward  completion of the credit requirements for the French major.   The honors thesis should be a work of scholarship and/or criticism in the field  of French or Francophone literature or culture. The thesis is ordinarily  written in French (25 pages minimum); exceptionally, students may petition to  write it in English (40 to 60 pages). The seminar professor and the thesis  adviser determine based on this work and an oral defense whether to recommend  the student for an honors degree. A grade of at least A-minus is required for  the award of honors in French. Accelerated  B.A./M.A. Program in French or French Studies      The  Department of French and the Institute of French Studies offer qualified  students the opportunity to earn the B.A. and M.A. degrees in a shortened  period of study. While still undergraduates, students enrolled in the program  may earn up to 12 points toward the M.A. by completing three graduate courses  in the Department of French or at the Institute of French Studies. To earn  advanced standing, these points may not be counted toward an undergraduate  degree, and must be in excess of the 128 points required for the B.A.      Under  normal circumstances, this can be achieved by students who register for the  maximum allowable number of points in their senior year. Earned in this manner,  advanced standing has the additional advantage of enabling qualified students  to start graduate work at an earlier stage and in the most cost-efficient way.      Admission  to the program is open to students who have completed between 48 and 96 credits  with an overall GPA of at least 3.5 and a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major.  Application to the program can be made through the director of undergraduate  studies in the Department of French. Final acceptance into the graduate  sequence of the program is contingent on successful completion of the B.A.,  formal admission into the Graduate School of Arts and Science, and acceptance  of the student's application. For more information on the B.A./M.A. in French  studies, please consult www.ifs.as.nyu.edu/object/ifs.bama .              Facilities      The  University has two special facilities for students of French.          La Maison Fran\u00e7aise   This attractive house in the old and picturesque Washington Mews is open to  students of French. It has a comfortable lounge, a small reading room opening  onto a terrace, and a soundproof music room. Programs of lectures and  recreational activities free to all students interested in French are given  here.          Institute of French Studies   Adjacent to La Maison Fran\u00e7aise in Washington Mews, the institute offers  graduate courses in contemporary French society and culture that are open to  undergraduates with special permission. The institute has a large newspaper and  periodical collection and a wide range of videotapes; it also organizes  frequent lectures and seminars by visiting scholars, political personalities,  and business and administrative leaders from France.

P\u00e9rec d\u00e9montre combien ces lieux que nous fr\u00e9quentons, comme inconsciemment, sont aussi lisibles qu\u2019un livre, combien ces lieux poss\u00e8dent une logique et une syntaxe, combien ces lieux sont des \u00ab fictions \u00bb autant que des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. Embo\u00eetant le pas \u00e0 P\u00e9rec (que nous lirons) et nous inspirant \u00e9galement de certains autres penseurs du XXe si\u00e8cle (Foucault, Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Latour, etc.), nous voudrions donc r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la litt\u00e9rature probl\u00e9matise notre relation aux \u00ab lieux \u00bb, des plus intimes (le lit) aux plus abstraits (l\u2019univers, l\u2019 \u00ab anthropoc\u00e8ne \u00bb). En privil\u00e9giant ces questions, nous pr\u00e9l\u00e8verons sur l\u2019histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise des \u0153uvres publi\u00e9es depuis le Moyen \u00c2ge jusqu\u2019au XXIe si\u00e8cle. Auteurs probables (liste pr\u00e9liminaire) : Marie de France, Christine de Pisan, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Joachim du Bellay, Gilles Corrozet, Raymond Queneau, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Michel Butor, Michel Foucault, Georges P\u00e9rec, Monique Wittig, Annie Ernaux, Michel Houellebecq.

Nous essaierons de comprendre les enjeux politiques des images, leur dimension id\u00e9ologique et l\u2019influence qu\u2019elles exercent sur notre vie quotidienne. Les discussions et les expos\u00e9s ont pour objectif d\u2019offrir aux \u00e9tudiants de larges opportunit\u00e9s de s\u2019exprimer et de se situer en tant que citoyens libres de leurs opinions. Th\u00e8mes et questions abord\u00e9s dans ce cours inclurent: L\u2019iconographie des hommes politiques, les rapports entre la politique et l\u2019humour au cin\u00e9ma, l\u2019influence des images sur la perception du corps, de la sexualit\u00e9 et du genre, la publicit\u00e9 et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de consommation, la repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019environnement, et la question de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et de la censure.

L'analyse portera tant sur les th\u00e8mes et les personnages que sur l'organisation du texte et les probl\u00e8mes de la narration, le point du vue, l'expression du temps et de l'espace, sans oublier une certaine forme de recontextualisation historique.

Up to two electives may be advanced language courses chosen  from: Spoken Contemporary French (FREN-UA 101), Phonetics (FREN-UA 103),  Translation (FREN-UA 107), Advanced Techniques of Translation (FREN-UA 108),  Acting French (FREN-UA 109), and Business French (FREN-UA 110). The other  electives must revolve around French and Francophone literature and civilization.  With permission of the adviser, students may take some electives at the same  time as core courses. With permission, students may also substitute additional  core courses, or a graduate course, for electives. Approved courses taken in  French universities may count as electives.   A Senior Seminar. The Senior Seminar (FREN-UA 991, 992) is typically taken in  the fall or spring of senior year. At  least one of the courses completed in fulfillment of the major (either a core  course or an elective) must focus on the period preceding 1800. Majors may  count one of the department's English-language courses toward the major, but  only if they do the written work in French.          Transfer  students must complete at least five courses (20 points) of the nine courses  required for the French major at the College of Arts and Science or at NYU  Paris.          A  student who fulfills the requirements above may thereby fulfill the state  minimum of 24 credits required for certification to teach French in New York  State junior or senior high schools. For information on minors in education,  please see the section on cross-school minors in this Bulletin.                Major  in Romance Languages      See  the Romance languages section of this Bulletin for details and requirements.                Major  in French and Linguistics      This  joint major requires a total of nine 4-point courses (36 points).          The  French part of this major is satisfied by taking four 4-point courses (16  points) as follows:   One advanced language course chosen from the following:   Spoken Contemporary French (FREN-UA 101)   Phonetics (FREN-UA 103)   Translation (FREN-UA 107)   Advanced Techniques of Translation (FREN-UA 108)   Acting French (FREN-UA 109)   Business French (FREN-UA 110)   One course in advanced written French (usually Written Contemporary French,  FREN-UA 105)   Two courses in French literature (in French), to be determined in consultation  with the director of undergraduate studies The  linguistics part of this major is satisfied by taking the following five  4-point courses (20 points):   One introductory course: Language (LING-UA 1) or Language and Mind (LING-UA 3,  formerly 28)   Sound and Language (LING-UA 11)   Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13)   And a total of two additional courses from two different fields of linguistics,  chosen from the following (please see linguistics section in this Bulletin for  course titles and descriptions):   Historical linguistics (LING-UA 14, LING-UA 17, LING-UA 76)   Sociolinguistics (LING-UA 15, LING-UA 18, LING-UA 30, LING-UA 38)   Phonology (LING-UA 12)   Semantics (LING-UA 4)   Computational linguistics (LING-UA 3, LING-UA 24)   Psycholinguistics (LING-UA 5, LING-UA 43, LING-UA 54)          Minors  in French      All  students who wish to minor in the Department of French must declare with the  department and consult a departmental adviser prior to any registration.          Students  may choose one of four programs of study. They may minor in French studies,  French literature in translation, literature in translation, or Francophone  studies.          French Studies   This minor consists of four courses (16 points) above the intermediate level to  be determined in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies.   Students pursuing a French studies minor can focus either on language  courses or on language and literature courses. Only courses taught in  French can count toward this minor. In addition, no grade lower than C counts  toward this minor.          French Literature in Translation   This minor is for students who have an interest in French literature but do not  yet have the linguistic preparation to read this literature in French. This  minor consists of four courses (16 points) taught in English that focus on  French literature. The courses are to be chosen in consultation with the  director of undergraduate studies. No grade lower than a C counts toward this  minor.          Literature in Translation   This minor is for students who have an interest in the literature of several different countries and/or cultures and wish to explore that literature through English translation. This minor consists of four courses (16 points) taught in English with a focus on foreign (i.e., not written in English) literature offered by participating CAS disciplines (classics, comparative literature, dramatic literature, East Asian studies, English, French, German, Hebrew and Judaic studies, Italian, Middle Eastern and Islamic studies, Russian and Slavic studies, Spanish and Portuguese). A student majoring in a specific language cannot take courses in his or her home department for this minor. In addition, a student must take courses from at least two different departments for this minor, with no more than two courses from the same department. No grade lower than a C counts toward this minor.          Francophone Studies   This minor is for students with an interest in French-language literature and  culture outside of France (e.g., in Africa, the Caribbean, Canada, the U.S., or  the Far East). This minor consists of four courses (16 points). Approaches to  Francophone Literature (FREN-UA 145) is required; the three other courses must  be taught in French and chosen in consultation with the director of  undergraduate studies. With permission of the French department, a course  taught in English can be counted toward this minor if the coursework is  completed in French. Courses focusing on the literature or culture of France do  not count toward this minor. No grade lower than a C counts toward this minor.              Internships      In  addition to the basic requirements for the major, students also have the  opportunity to participate in internships sponsored by the Department of  French. Recent internships have been completed at the French cultural services  office, the French music office, and the French film office. For more  information, please contact the undergraduate administrative aide. Internships  and independent studies do not count toward the French major, except with  special permission of the department.                Honors  Program          Eligibility      A  student must spend a minimum of three full semesters in residence at the  College of Arts and Science. Attendance at NYU Paris counts toward such residence.  The student must maintain an overall GPA of at least 3.65 and a major average  of 3.65 or higher. Students who wish to pursue honors should apply to the  departmental director of honors during their junior year.          Requirements for Honors   Completion of all major requirements (above).   In addition to enrollment in a Senior Seminar (FREN-UA 991, 992), candidates  for French honors must also enroll in Honors Thesis (FREN-UA 995), a 4-point  course taken over both semesters of the senior year (2 points in the fall, 2  points in the spring). This Honors Thesis course sequence cannot count toward  completion of the credit requirements for the French major.   The honors thesis should be a work of scholarship and/or criticism in the field  of French or Francophone literature or culture. The thesis is ordinarily  written in French (25 pages minimum); exceptionally, students may petition to  write it in English (40 to 60 pages). The seminar professor and the thesis  adviser determine based on this work and an oral defense whether to recommend  the student for an honors degree. A grade of at least A-minus is required for  the award of honors in French. Accelerated  B.A./M.A. Program in French or French Studies      The  Department of French and the Institute of French Studies offer qualified  students the opportunity to earn the B.A. and M.A. degrees in a shortened  period of study. While still undergraduates, students enrolled in the program  may earn up to 12 points toward the M.A. by completing three graduate courses  in the Department of French or at the Institute of French Studies. To earn  advanced standing, these points may not be counted toward an undergraduate  degree, and must be in excess of the 128 points required for the B.A.      Under  normal circumstances, this can be achieved by students who register for the  maximum allowable number of points in their senior year. Earned in this manner,  advanced standing has the additional advantage of enabling qualified students  to start graduate work at an earlier stage and in the most cost-efficient way.      Admission  to the program is open to students who have completed between 48 and 96 credits  with an overall GPA of at least 3.5 and a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major.  Application to the program can be made through the director of undergraduate  studies in the Department of French. Final acceptance into the graduate  sequence of the program is contingent on successful completion of the B.A.,  formal admission into the Graduate School of Arts and Science, and acceptance  of the student's application. For more information on the B.A./M.A. in French  studies, please consult www.ifs.as.nyu.edu/object/ifs.bama .              Facilities      The  University has two special facilities for students of French.          La Maison Fran\u00e7aise   This attractive house in the old and picturesque Washington Mews is open to  students of French. It has a comfortable lounge, a small reading room opening  onto a terrace, and a soundproof music room. Programs of lectures and  recreational activities free to all students interested in French are given  here.          Institute of French Studies   Adjacent to La Maison Fran\u00e7aise in Washington Mews, the institute offers  graduate courses in contemporary French society and culture that are open to  undergraduates with special permission. The institute has a large newspaper and  periodical collection and a wide range of videotapes; it also organizes  frequent lectures and seminars by visiting scholars, political personalities,  and business and administrative leaders from France.

P\u00e9rec d\u00e9montre combien ces lieux que nous fr\u00e9quentons, comme inconsciemment, sont aussi lisibles qu\u2019un livre, combien ces lieux poss\u00e8dent une logique et une syntaxe, combien ces lieux sont des \u00ab fictions \u00bb autant que des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. Embo\u00eetant le pas \u00e0 P\u00e9rec (que nous lirons) et nous inspirant \u00e9galement de certains autres penseurs du XXe si\u00e8cle (Foucault, Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Latour, etc.), nous voudrions donc r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la litt\u00e9rature probl\u00e9matise notre relation aux \u00ab lieux \u00bb, des plus intimes (le lit) aux plus abstraits (l\u2019univers, l\u2019 \u00ab anthropoc\u00e8ne \u00bb). En privil\u00e9giant ces questions, nous pr\u00e9l\u00e8verons sur l\u2019histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise des \u0153uvres publi\u00e9es depuis le Moyen \u00c2ge jusqu\u2019au XXIe si\u00e8cle.
