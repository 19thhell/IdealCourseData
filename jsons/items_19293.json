Experimental approaches in neural science  vary from analyses of molecular and cellular mechanisms in nerve cells and  groups of nerve cells to behavioral and psychological studies of whole  organisms. Theoretical tools include mathematical and computational  modeling approaches that have proved useful in other areas of science.  Experimental questions include issues related to biophysical and  neurochemical mechanisms within single nerve cells, functional neural  circuits consisting of small numbers  of neurons, the behavior of large systems of neurons, and the  relationship between the activity of elements of the nervous system and the  behavior of organisms.          The undergraduate Neural Science curriculum blends courses from many of the  basic sciences as a foundation for higher level work in Neural Science.            Minimum requirements for graduation include:         6 courses in Neural Science (24 pts)   3 courses in Biology (12 pts)    2 courses in Chemistry (10 pts)    1 course in Physics (5 pts)    1 course in Psychology (Statistics) (4 pts)      1 course at the Calculus level in mathematics (4 pts)    1 upper level elective course in either Biology or Experimental  Psychology.

Advisors at the College Advising office,  and DUSs in other departments, cannot declare a student a Neural  Science major. In order to be eligible to declare a Neural Science major, a  student must have grades of C or better in all courses required for the  major that have been completed   at the time of declaration. Students cannot officially declare the Neural  Science Major until they have received a grade of B- or better in   Introduction to Neural Science (INTRONS) .       Students who have completed INTRONS may submit their request to declare  their major electronically here:           Declaration of Neural Science Major             Students who are not eligible to declare the major may request to receive  announcements of interest to intended majors here:           Neural Science Interest Form           Specific Course Requirements for the Major      Neural Science Courses:   The first course students take in Neural Science is Introduction to  Neural Science (INTRONS) , taught annually in the Fall; ideally this  course should be taken in the sophomore year after a student has completed  the first 2 courses of the Biology Core sequence (Bio I, Bio II). Following  Introduction to Neural Science, students take each of two higher level  Neural Science courses: Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology (CMNB) ,  taught annually in the Fall, and Behavioral and Integrative Neuroscience  (BINS) , taught annually in the Spring; these courses should ideally be  taken in the Sophomore or Junior year.     Students then take three of the Neural Science elective courses:  e.g., Development and Dysfunction of the NS , Computational  Neuroscience , or Special Topics in Neural Science .         Biology Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take the first 3 courses of  the Biology core curriculum: Principles of Biology I, II , and   Molecular and Cell Biology I . The first two of these courses are  preparation for Introduction to Neural Science. The third, MCBio 1, is the  prerequisite to Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology , and is typically  taken in the same semester as INTRONS. MCBio 1 is only offered in the Fall  semester.   In addition, majors can then choose to  take one or more courses from a selection of upper level offerings in the  Biology curriculum (see list below).        Psychology Courses:      Neural science majors are required to take a statistics course:   Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences PSYCH-UA 10. Students  may request the substitution of other courses from minors or other majors  for this requirement as well, but Quantitative Reasoning in the College Core Curriculum is not an  acceptable substitution.  Majors can then choose to take one or more courses from a selection of   upper-level  offerings in the Experimental Psychology curriculum (see list below).        Chemistry Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take 2 chemistry courses with the  associated labs: General Chemistry I & II . As these classes are a  prerequisite to MCBio 1, most majors will take these courses in conjunction  with Bio I & II in their freshmen year. PreHealth note: Pre-health  students must also take Organic Chemistry I & II .        Physics Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take one course in Physics:   General Physics II . Pre-health students must also take General  Physics I .      Physics II is offered annually in the  Spring and is required prior to Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology .   Neural Science majors who are not completing the Pre-Health track   may request an  exemption from the Physics I prerequisite to Physics II from the Physics  department when registering in the Spring semester.        Mathematics Courses:      All Neural Science majors must take Calculus I . There is room in  the curriculum in the event that students require precalculus-level  mathematics. Students interested in Computational Neuroscience research are encouraged  to pursue Caluclus II or above.       Computer Science Courses:    Introduction to Computer Science is recommended for all students,  but not required.     Grading and Academic Performance Requirements   The minimum acceptable grade in courses required for the major is C.  These academic standards must be maintained in order for major standing to  continue.       Honors  Students must apply to the DUS for admission to the Honors Track.   Students requesting Honors status must receive a B or better in  Introduction to Neural Science, achieve a grade point average of 3.65 or  better in all courses required for the major and 3.65 over all courses  taken for credit. Students should also demonstrate a genuine interest in  research. Students must conduct at least one semester of research with a  faculty member affiliated with the Center for Neural Science (or an  otherwise approved faculty member). The student must submit an honors  thesis that must be accepted for Honors   standing by the faculty sponsor and the DUS. Presentation of the  thesis work at NYU's annual Undergraduate Research Conference is required.  Students must also complete 8 additional credits of coursework by taking two laboratory classes and an  Honors seminar.

For formatting guidelines for the Honors thesis, please see here .                     Minors   There is no Minor concentration in Neural Science. Neural Science  courses can be taken as electives through the Biology or Psychology  Departments for interested students. Students wishing to major in Neural  Science and declare a Minor in another science department must take 1-2  additional courses in that department, beyond those required for the major  (one for Chemistry, two for Psychology). Students may not minor in Biology.             Double Majors   Students wishing to major in Neural Science and declare a second major in  another science department may be required to take 1-2 additional courses  beyond those required for the major in that department as approved by the  DUSs.           For students wishing to double major in Psychology and Neural  Science:   PSYCH 10 ( Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences ) and NEURL-UA 220  ( Behavioral & Integrative NS ) can be used toward the degree in both  majors. If the student chooses to fulfill the 'Biology/Psychology' elective  requirement with a Psychology course, this course can not be one used  toward the Psychology degree.             There is no allowed double-major for Neural Science and Biology.              Core Curriculum of the College of Arts and Science   All students must meet the additional requirements of the College Core Corriculum in order to have a broad,  well-rounded liberal arts education. Neural Science students need to  satisfy the Expository Writing, Foreign Language, and Foundations of  Contemporary Culture components of the Core Curriculum. In addition, students may need  to pass the English Writing Proficiency exam administered by the Expository  Writing program. The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) requirement is satisfied through the Neural Science major course requirements.          Study Abroad   Neural Science now has study away courses that can be taken at NYU Shanghai.  They are Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology and three Neural Science  electives: Neural Bases of Speech and Language; Networks and Dynamics;  and Free Will and the Brain. In addition, the major requires many  science classes outside of the department, which can be taken abroad.  Students studying in London or Sydney typically take  Physics II (PHYS-UA 9012) and Cognition (PSYCH-UA 9029) to fulfill  the upper-level Biology/Psychology Elective requirement of the major.  Molecular and Cellular Biology II and Biochemistry I can also be taken  at NYU Tel Aviv, while Perception can be taken at NYU Berlin to fulfill  the upper-level Biology/Psychology elective requirement. Due to the  sequential nature of Neural Science courses, Neural Science majors  should plan to study away in the Spring of their Sophomore or Junior  year, or possibly in the Fall of their Senior year. Physics II must  be completed prior to taking Cellular Molecular Neurobiology (NEURL-UA 210),  which is only offered in Spring semesters. This is the primary  sequential constraint on the Spring semester for majors. Majors  intending to do Honors are encouraged to study away during the  Sophomore year. Non-honors majors are better served studying away in  the Junior year, unless they began the major \"late\" - e.g. taking  Introduction to Neural Science (NEURL-UA 100) in their Junior instead  of Sophomore year. Students who wish to study in a non-London or  Sydney location can typically do so if they are not Pre-Health.

Experimental approaches in neural science  vary from analyses of molecular and cellular mechanisms in nerve cells and  groups of nerve cells to behavioral and psychological studies of whole  organisms. Theoretical tools include mathematical and computational  modeling approaches that have proved useful in other areas of science.  Experimental questions include issues related to biophysical and  neurochemical mechanisms within single nerve cells, functional neural  circuits consisting of small numbers  of neurons, the behavior of large systems of neurons, and the  relationship between the activity of elements of the nervous system and the  behavior of organisms.          The undergraduate Neural Science curriculum blends courses from many of the  basic sciences as a foundation for higher level work in Neural Science.            Minimum requirements for graduation include:         6 courses in Neural Science (24 pts)   3 courses in Biology (12 pts)    2 courses in Chemistry (10 pts)    1 course in Physics (5 pts)    1 course in Psychology (Statistics) (4 pts)      1 course at the Calculus level in mathematics (4 pts)    1 upper level elective course in either Biology or Experimental  Psychology.

Advisors at the College Advising office,  and DUSs in other departments, cannot declare a student a Neural  Science major. In order to be eligible to declare a Neural Science major, a  student must have grades of C or better in all courses required for the  major that have been completed   at the time of declaration. Students cannot officially declare the Neural  Science Major until they have received a grade of B- or better in   Introduction to Neural Science (INTRONS) .       Students who have completed INTRONS may submit their request to declare  their major electronically here:           Declaration of Neural Science Major             Students who are not eligible to declare the major may request to receive  announcements of interest to intended majors here:           Neural Science Interest Form           Specific Course Requirements for the Major      Neural Science Courses:   The first course students take in Neural Science is Introduction to  Neural Science (INTRONS) , taught annually in the Fall; ideally this  course should be taken in the sophomore year after a student has completed  the first 2 courses of the Biology Core sequence (Bio I, Bio II). Following  Introduction to Neural Science, students take each of two higher level  Neural Science courses: Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology (CMNB) ,  taught annually in the Fall, and Behavioral and Integrative Neuroscience  (BINS) , taught annually in the Spring; these courses should ideally be  taken in the Sophomore or Junior year.     Students then take three of the Neural Science elective courses:  e.g., Development and Dysfunction of the NS , Computational  Neuroscience , or Special Topics in Neural Science .         Biology Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take the first 3 courses of  the Biology core curriculum: Principles of Biology I, II , and   Molecular and Cell Biology I . The first two of these courses are  preparation for Introduction to Neural Science. The third, MCBio 1, is the  prerequisite to Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology , and is typically  taken in the same semester as INTRONS. MCBio 1 is only offered in the Fall  semester.   In addition, majors can then choose to  take one or more courses from a selection of upper level offerings in the  Biology curriculum (see list below).        Psychology Courses:      Neural science majors are required to take a statistics course:   Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences PSYCH-UA 10. Students  may request the substitution of other courses from minors or other majors  for this requirement as well, but Quantitative Reasoning in the College Core Curriculum is not an  acceptable substitution.  Majors can then choose to take one or more courses from a selection of   upper-level  offerings in the Experimental Psychology curriculum (see list below).        Chemistry Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take 2 chemistry courses with the  associated labs: General Chemistry I & II . As these classes are a  prerequisite to MCBio 1, most majors will take these courses in conjunction  with Bio I & II in their freshmen year. PreHealth note: Pre-health  students must also take Organic Chemistry I & II .        Physics Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take one course in Physics:   General Physics II . Pre-health students must also take General  Physics I .      Physics II is offered annually in the  Spring and is required prior to Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology .   Neural Science majors who are not completing the Pre-Health track   may request an  exemption from the Physics I prerequisite to Physics II from the Physics  department when registering in the Spring semester.        Mathematics Courses:      All Neural Science majors must take Calculus I . There is room in  the curriculum in the event that students require precalculus-level  mathematics. Students interested in Computational Neuroscience research are encouraged  to pursue Caluclus II or above.       Computer Science Courses:    Introduction to Computer Science is recommended for all students,  but not required.     Grading and Academic Performance Requirements   The minimum acceptable grade in courses required for the major is C.  These academic standards must be maintained in order for major standing to  continue.       Honors  Students must apply to the DUS for admission to the Honors Track.   Students requesting Honors status must receive a B or better in  Introduction to Neural Science, achieve a grade point average of 3.65 or  better in all courses required for the major and 3.65 over all courses  taken for credit. Students should also demonstrate a genuine interest in  research. Students must conduct at least one semester of research with a  faculty member affiliated with the Center for Neural Science (or an  otherwise approved faculty member). The student must submit an honors  thesis that must be accepted for Honors   standing by the faculty sponsor and the DUS. Presentation of the  thesis work at NYU's annual Undergraduate Research Conference is required.  Students must also complete 8 additional credits of coursework by taking two laboratory classes and an  Honors seminar.    To apply for admission to the Honors Track, please   submit the application here .       For key dates pertaining to the Honors and Research Track, please see here .      For formatting guidelines for the Honors thesis, please see here .                     Minors   There is no Minor concentration in Neural Science. Neural Science  courses can be taken as electives through the Biology or Psychology  Departments for interested students. Students wishing to major in Neural  Science and declare a Minor in another science department must take 1-2  additional courses in that department, beyond those required for the major  (one for Chemistry, two for Psychology). Students may not minor in Biology.             Double Majors   Students wishing to major in Neural Science and declare a second major in  another science department may be required to take 1-2 additional courses  beyond those required for the major in that department as approved by the  DUSs.           For students wishing to double major in Psychology and Neural  Science:   PSYCH 10 ( Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences ) and NEURL-UA 220  ( Behavioral & Integrative NS ) can be used toward the degree in both  majors. If the student chooses to fulfill the 'Biology/Psychology' elective  requirement with a Psychology course, this course can not be one used  toward the Psychology degree.             There is no allowed double-major for Neural Science and Biology.              Core Curriculum of the College of Arts and Science   All students must meet the additional requirements of the College Core Corriculum in order to have a broad,  well-rounded liberal arts education. Neural Science students need to  satisfy the Expository Writing, Foreign Language, and Foundations of  Contemporary Culture components of the Core Curriculum. In addition, students may need  to pass the English Writing Proficiency exam administered by the Expository  Writing program. The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) requirement is satisfied through the Neural Science major course requirements.          Study Abroad   Neural Science now has study away courses that can be taken at NYU Shanghai.  They are Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology and three Neural Science  electives: Neural Bases of Speech and Language; Networks and Dynamics;  and Free Will and the Brain. In addition, the major requires many  science classes outside of the department, which can be taken abroad.  Students studying in London or Sydney typically take  Physics II (PHYS-UA 9012) and Cognition (PSYCH-UA 9029) to fulfill  the upper-level Biology/Psychology Elective requirement of the major.  Molecular and Cellular Biology II and Biochemistry I can also be taken  at NYU Tel Aviv, while Perception can be taken at NYU Berlin to fulfill  the upper-level Biology/Psychology elective requirement. Due to the  sequential nature of Neural Science courses, Neural Science majors  should plan to study away in the Spring of their Sophomore or Junior  year, or possibly in the Fall of their Senior year. Physics II must  be completed prior to taking Cellular Molecular Neurobiology (NEURL-UA 210),  which is only offered in Spring semesters. This is the primary  sequential constraint on the Spring semester for majors. Majors  intending to do Honors are encouraged to study away during the  Sophomore year. Non-honors majors are better served studying away in  the Junior year, unless they began the major \"late\" - e.g. taking  Introduction to Neural Science (NEURL-UA 100) in their Junior instead  of Sophomore year. Students who wish to study in a non-London or  Sydney location can typically do so if they are not Pre-Health.  We also strongly encourage students to consider Summer and Winter  Study Abroad at other locations when possible. Students should consult  with their Neural Science Advisor for individualized course planning.      For more information, click here for a PDF.

The department\u2019s programs of study and research reflect this contemporary view of biology.    The department offers students the opportunity to explore the various areas of current biology in an integrated yet diverse program that builds from a solid foundation of the basic elements of molecular and cellular biology, genetics, evolution, organ systems and population studies. Students are exposed to modern concepts, state-of-the-art approaches and current methods of experimentation in molecular biology, biochemistry, genomics and bioinformatics within introductory courses taken at the very outset of their studies. A variety of intermediate courses then provides in-depth exploration of major fields of biology. Advanced students may register for graduate-level courses, which are most often given in the specialized areas of faculty research.    Three options are available to students pursuing a major in Biology. The standard Biology track provides the major with a broad background in biology with the laboratory, quantitative and reasoning skills needed for today\u2019s modern biology. The Ecology track also provides students with the broad background in modern biology, but with a focus on ecological concepts, approaches and analytical methods. The Global Public Health/Science major with Concentration in Biology provides students with strong foundations in biological science and global public health, with a focus on one of three emphasis areas: genetics and genomics, infectious diseases or environmental health.    The department also offers a series of discrete minors in the life sciences , specifically in the areas of:      Molecular and Cell Biology    Genetics    Genomics and Bioinformatics    Environmental Biology          Each minor is designed to hone skills in a particular contemporary area of biology and requires a laboratory experience. The minors permit students to create a course of study that will meet their unique academic and career goals.    The Biology majors and minors provide outstanding preparation for careers in research, academia, medicine, dentistry and related fields. Graduates of the department have a remarkable record of success in acceptance into professional schools and in establishing notable careers in the biomedical sciences.    Other courses offered by the department are designed to acquaint nonscience majors with contemporary issues in biology. Such courses are often topical, addressing problems such as environmental pollution, limits of the earth, and human physiology.    Outstanding and highly motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors work, independent study, summer laboratory research, internships and other enhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in undergraduate research projects in faculty laboratories through the many formal and informal opportunities afforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important research accomplishment and contains several specialized research and laboratory facilities that are integrated into the educational programs. These include the undergraduate Molecular Biology Laboratory, the Microscope Facility, the Genomics Core Facility and the Tissue Culture Facility. Field studies are carried out at many regional sites. Department faculty are also affiliated with the NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, the NYU Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences, the NYU School of Medicine, the NYU David B. Kriser School of Dentistry, the American Museum of Natural History, the New York Botanical Garden, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories.    Students with questions about majoring in biology or minoring in a specific area of biology should visit the office of the Department of Biology. Those declaring a major in biology should complete a department declaration form. They are assigned a faculty adviser from the department; students meet with that professor to design a program of study, determine course selections and discuss career goals. The faculty adviser is also available to provide guidance concerning the many options and opportunities afforded by the department for curricular enhancement, including research experiences.
