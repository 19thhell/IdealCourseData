The curriculum prepares you for a career as an applied statistician and data scientist in the private or public sector, as well as for further academic study in a variety of academic disciplines that require quantitative analysis.    Who will I study with?    This is an exciting time to study applied statistics and data science at NYU. The MS program is an initiative of the NYU Steinhardt Center for the Promotion of Research Involving Innovative Statistical Methodology (PRIISM) and is an integrated part of the larger university-wide initiative in Data Science and Statistics , which offers several new master&rsquo;s degrees, including this MS program.    A3SR faculty have particular strengths in:       causal inference    high-dimensional data    measurement    missing data    model selection    multivariate analysis    multilevel modeling    surveys and sampling       All the faculty are deeply committed to using data analysis methods and strategies for the social good. They have worked and consulted for a range of advocacy and policy organizations. They are applying these strategies to important questions in public health, politics, psychology and psychometrics, demography, sociology, labor markets, and education . This program seeks like-minded students who are eager to apply these tools to do good in the world.    Some of the important application-area questions they are exploring include:       What is the role of media in forming public opinions?    What is the effect of gifted and talented programs on student achievement?    What is the relationship between diet and certain forms of cancer?    Do student curricular pathways matter for degree attainment and subsequent labor market outcomes?    What are effective strategies for rehabilitation of stroke patients?       On the methodological front our faculty are working in diverse areas across statistics . Examples include research to:       Assess when observational studies can act as reasonable substitutes for randomized experiments    Develop better strategies to handle missing data    Develop variable selection methods for high dimensional data    Model the dependencies in categorical sequences of events       We encourage you and all our students to work closely with our faculty on research that ranges from applied statistical analysis to the development of customized statistical models.    What other options do I have to study statistics at NYU?    There are many graduate programs in the Steinhardt School and at NYU that you may wish to further explore. We encourage you to explore these options further to find the program that best matches your personal interests and career goals.
