The curriculum follows, first Journalism and then MBA courses. Please note that some of the required courses may change from year to year.   M.A. Courses in Journalism     1. Writing, Research, and Reporting Workshop 1 G54.1021 (4 credits)     The teaching of news writing is divided into two courses given during the first and second semesters of study in the program. In Reporting 1, offered in the fall semester, students learn reporting principles and techniques and work on increasingly challenging in-class assignments. Students also use New York City as a laboratory to report actual business news events, including speeches, company meetings, elections, and courtroom activities. Topics include story structure and organization, writing techniques, news judgment, and the development of sources and story ideas.     2. Writing, Research, and Reporting Workshop 2: Covering Business and Financial News G54.1022 (4 credits)     Reporting 2, offered in the spring semester, focuses on feature writing while continuing development of news writing skills. Students will focus on coverage of business and financial news. Under tight deadline pressure, they will write news articles on the stock and bond markets and on business news generated especially by companies in New York and the tri-state region. They will also cover industry beats by developing reliable sources among analysts and company executives.     3. Law and Mass Communication G54.0011 (4 credits):     Discusses exceptions to the First Amendment language that \"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.\" Subjects covered include prior restraint of the press, libel, invasion of privacy, obscenity, shield laws and protection of sources, free press and fair trial, and broadcast regulations by the FCC.   International students may instead take Press Ethics or History of the News, with permission of the BER Director.   Press Ethics G54.0012 Explores the ethical questions facing working journalists. Focuses on specific cases, both real and hypothetical. Through readings, papers, and class discussions, students analyze the ethical problems raised by these cases and develop their own systems for making ethical decisions.   *History of the News G54.0018 This course surveys the history of the media and how each major development affected reporters and the public. Emphasis is placed on developments of the last century and especially the more recent growth of electronic media. This course is recommended for international students who do not plan to practice journalism in the United States and for whom Law and Mass Communications would not be especially relevant.     4. Specialized Reporting: Investigative Reporting G54.1182 (4 credits)     (This course is selected from the BER roster of courses, and the offering may change from year to year) Students learn a wide range of techniques for gathering information for in-depth business articles and investigations. They learn how to formulate a strategy for effective reporting and then gather the needed information from interviews, documents, and online sources. The work focuses on collecting information from sources such as government agencies, legal source material, and databases. The course also introduces students to the use of spreadsheets for the analysis of information.     5. The Hyperlocal Newsroom\u00a0 G54.1080 (4 credits)     (This course is selected from the BER roster of courses, and the offering may change from year to year.)   Students learn multimedia in the context of a hyperlocal newsroom, focusing on video, still images, and audio as effective reporting tools. Students will produce their work for The Local East Village, a hyperlocal news blog that is a collaborative effort between The New York Times and the Carter Journalism Institute. Published student work will appear under the banner of nytimes.com.     6.\u00a0 Writing the Long-Form Narrative G54.1182 (4 credits)     (This course is selected from the BER roster of courses, and the offering may change from year to year.)   This seminar focuses on the various components that comprise in-depth magazine stories and non-fiction books. We'll dissect great modern and classic magazine stories, books and book proposals for story, character arcs, dialogue, scenes, analysis, structure, transitions, verb tense, point of view and style. The goal is to figure out how memorable magazine features and narrative non-fiction books that keep your attention to the very last page are created, then to take what we've learned and apply it to our own work. There is one semester-long writing assignment\u2014a 5,000+-word feature story\u2014with several shorter related pieces involving scenes, character, dialogue, and analysis, all of which will be incorporated into the final capstone. Along the way we'll work on pitches and story memos, research and interview techniques, time management, outlines, editing and multiple drafts, and all the challenges today's non-fiction narrative writers face.     7. Summer Internship (2 credits)     Internship G54.1290 Students will have an internship during their summer in residence at NYU. They will work in the business and financial reporting section of a newspaper, magazine, broadcasting station, or online publication. Most of these internships will be in New York City.   Directed Reading G54.1299 This course is designed for part-time students, who undertake a substantial project of individual study. Students explore a business or economic subject in depth and produce a publishable article.       \u00a0   MBA Courses in NYU's Stern School of Business     8. Foundations of Finance B01.2311 (3 credits) or similar finance course     Students will learn about the financial markets and the tools available to companies in need of capital. Included: the banking system, the stock and bond markets, options, venture capital, and angel capital. Also: financing choices for corporations, including equity, debt, and derivative financial instruments, and their effect on the value of the company.     9. Financial Accounting and Reporting B01.1306 (3 credits) or similar accounting course     \"Accounting reports are an important means of communication with investors. This course focuses on the development, analysis and use of these reports. It provides an understanding of what these reports contain, what assumptions and concepts accountants use to prepare them, and why they use those assumptions and concepts. The course uses simple examples to provide students with a clear understanding of accounting concepts. It stresses the ability to apply these concepts to real world cases, which by their very nature are complex and ambiguous. In addition to text-oriented materials, the classes also include cases so that students can discuss applications of basic concepts, actual financial reports, and articles from newspapers. In addition to traditional introductory topics other topics may include mergers and acquisitions, purchase and pooling, free cash flow and financial statement analysis.\" (Stern website)     10. Firms and Markets B01.1303 ( 3 credits) or a more advanced economics course     \"This course is about economic principles: those governing the behavior of markets and firms-and strategic interactions between firms. Situations faced by leading corporations will be discussed, including supply and demand; how price depends on both costs and the sensitivity of buyers to price; the advantages and disadvantages of size; whether firms should make or outsource their inputs; how to increase revenue by charging different prices to different customers; the advantages and disadvantages of price competition; how to convey information to buyers and sellers; and winner take - most \"network\" markets. The course structure assumes that all students have had some economics background. They must be comfortable with quantitative concepts and approaches and with graphical/geometric ways of presenting quantitative information.\" (Stern website)     11. Global Economy B01.2303 (3 credits) or a more advanced economics course     \"We use the tools of international macroeconomics to explore the economic environment facing firms operating around the globe. Central issues include the role of economic policy and institutions in the performance of firms and nations; economic indicators and forecasting; employment and unemployment; interest rates, inflation, and monetary policy; global trade in goods and capital; foreign exchange rates; and emerging market crises. These issues are considered from the perspectives of both firms and countries.\" (Stern website)     12. and 13.\u00a0 Two Electives (3 credits each)\u00a0     Choose two courses, meeting applicable prerequisites, and with permission of the BER Director or Assistant Director.\u00a0 Students generally take their electives in subjects that they would like to cover as journalists. These electives are taken during the third semester from a wide array of offering at NYU:   Another MBA course at the Stern School of Business   A course at the NYU School of Law   A course at another NYU graduate school or department                                                   Arthur L.

Writing, Research, and Reporting Workshop 1 G54.1021 (4 credits)     The teaching of news writing is divided into two courses given during the first and second semesters of study in the program. In Reporting 1, offered in the fall semester, students learn reporting principles and techniques and work on increasingly challenging in-class assignments. Students also use New York City as a laboratory to report actual business news events, including speeches, company meetings, elections, and courtroom activities. Topics include story structure and organization, writing techniques, news judgment, and the development of sources and story ideas.     2. Writing, Research, and Reporting Workshop 2: Covering Business and Financial News G54.1022 (4 credits)     Reporting 2, offered in the spring semester, focuses on feature writing while continuing development of news writing skills. Students will focus on coverage of business and financial news. Under tight deadline pressure, they will write news articles on the stock and bond markets and on business news generated especially by companies in New York and the tri-state region. They will also cover industry beats by developing reliable sources among analysts and company executives.     3. Law and Mass Communication G54.0011 (4 credits):     Discusses exceptions to the First Amendment language that \"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.\" Subjects covered include prior restraint of the press, libel, invasion of privacy, obscenity, shield laws and protection of sources, free press and fair trial, and broadcast regulations by the FCC.   International students may instead take Press Ethics or History of the News, with permission of the BER Director.   Press Ethics G54.0012 Explores the ethical questions facing working journalists. Focuses on specific cases, both real and hypothetical. Through readings, papers, and class discussions, students analyze the ethical problems raised by these cases and develop their own systems for making ethical decisions.   *History of the News G54.0018 This course surveys the history of the media and how each major development affected reporters and the public. Emphasis is placed on developments of the last century and especially the more recent growth of electronic media. This course is recommended for international students who do not plan to practice journalism in the United States and for whom Law and Mass Communications would not be especially relevant.     4. Specialized Reporting: Investigative Reporting G54.1182 (4 credits)     (This course is selected from the BER roster of courses, and the offering may change from year to year) Students learn a wide range of techniques for gathering information for in-depth business articles and investigations. They learn how to formulate a strategy for effective reporting and then gather the needed information from interviews, documents, and online sources. The work focuses on collecting information from sources such as government agencies, legal source material, and databases. The course also introduces students to the use of spreadsheets for the analysis of information.     5. The Hyperlocal Newsroom\u00a0 G54.1080 (4 credits)     (This course is selected from the BER roster of courses, and the offering may change from year to year.)   Students learn multimedia in the context of a hyperlocal newsroom, focusing on video, still images, and audio as effective reporting tools. Students will produce their work for The Local East Village, a hyperlocal news blog that is a collaborative effort between The New York Times and the Carter Journalism Institute. Published student work will appear under the banner of nytimes.com.     6.\u00a0 Writing the Long-Form Narrative G54.1182 (4 credits)     (This course is selected from the BER roster of courses, and the offering may change from year to year.)   This seminar focuses on the various components that comprise in-depth magazine stories and non-fiction books. We'll dissect great modern and classic magazine stories, books and book proposals for story, character arcs, dialogue, scenes, analysis, structure, transitions, verb tense, point of view and style. The goal is to figure out how memorable magazine features and narrative non-fiction books that keep your attention to the very last page are created, then to take what we've learned and apply it to our own work. There is one semester-long writing assignment\u2014a 5,000+-word feature story\u2014with several shorter related pieces involving scenes, character, dialogue, and analysis, all of which will be incorporated into the final capstone. Along the way we'll work on pitches and story memos, research and interview techniques, time management, outlines, editing and multiple drafts, and all the challenges today's non-fiction narrative writers face.     7. Summer Internship (2 credits)     Internship G54.1290 Students will have an internship during their summer in residence at NYU. They will work in the business and financial reporting section of a newspaper, magazine, broadcasting station, or online publication. Most of these internships will be in New York City.   Directed Reading G54.1299 This course is designed for part-time students, who undertake a substantial project of individual study. Students explore a business or economic subject in depth and produce a publishable article.       \u00a0   MBA Courses in NYU's Stern School of Business     8. Foundations of Finance B01.2311 (3 credits) or similar finance course     Students will learn about the financial markets and the tools available to companies in need of capital. Included: the banking system, the stock and bond markets, options, venture capital, and angel capital. Also: financing choices for corporations, including equity, debt, and derivative financial instruments, and their effect on the value of the company.     9. Financial Accounting and Reporting B01.1306 (3 credits) or similar accounting course     \"Accounting reports are an important means of communication with investors. This course focuses on the development, analysis and use of these reports. It provides an understanding of what these reports contain, what assumptions and concepts accountants use to prepare them, and why they use those assumptions and concepts. The course uses simple examples to provide students with a clear understanding of accounting concepts. It stresses the ability to apply these concepts to real world cases, which by their very nature are complex and ambiguous. In addition to text-oriented materials, the classes also include cases so that students can discuss applications of basic concepts, actual financial reports, and articles from newspapers. In addition to traditional introductory topics other topics may include mergers and acquisitions, purchase and pooling, free cash flow and financial statement analysis.\" (Stern website)     10. Firms and Markets B01.1303 ( 3 credits) or a more advanced economics course     \"This course is about economic principles: those governing the behavior of markets and firms-and strategic interactions between firms. Situations faced by leading corporations will be discussed, including supply and demand; how price depends on both costs and the sensitivity of buyers to price; the advantages and disadvantages of size; whether firms should make or outsource their inputs; how to increase revenue by charging different prices to different customers; the advantages and disadvantages of price competition; how to convey information to buyers and sellers; and winner take - most \"network\" markets. The course structure assumes that all students have had some economics background. They must be comfortable with quantitative concepts and approaches and with graphical/geometric ways of presenting quantitative information.\" (Stern website)     11. Global Economy B01.2303 (3 credits) or a more advanced economics course     \"We use the tools of international macroeconomics to explore the economic environment facing firms operating around the globe. Central issues include the role of economic policy and institutions in the performance of firms and nations; economic indicators and forecasting; employment and unemployment; interest rates, inflation, and monetary policy; global trade in goods and capital; foreign exchange rates; and emerging market crises.

The curriculum follows, first Journalism and then MBA courses. Please note that some of the required courses may change from year to year.   M.A. Courses in Journalism     1. Writing, Research, and Reporting Workshop 1 G54.1021 (4 credits)     The teaching of news writing is divided into two courses given during the first and second semesters of study in the program. In Reporting 1, offered in the fall semester, students learn reporting principles and techniques and work on increasingly challenging in-class assignments. Students also use New York City as a laboratory to report actual business news events, including speeches, company meetings, elections, and courtroom activities. Topics include story structure and organization, writing techniques, news judgment, and the development of sources and story ideas.     2. Writing, Research, and Reporting Workshop 2: Covering Business and Financial News G54.1022 (4 credits)     Reporting 2, offered in the spring semester, focuses on feature writing while continuing development of news writing skills. Students will focus on coverage of business and financial news. Under tight deadline pressure, they will write news articles on the stock and bond markets and on business news generated especially by companies in New York and the tri-state region. They will also cover industry beats by developing reliable sources among analysts and company executives.     3. Law and Mass Communication G54.0011 (4 credits):     Discusses exceptions to the First Amendment language that \"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.\" Subjects covered include prior restraint of the press, libel, invasion of privacy, obscenity, shield laws and protection of sources, free press and fair trial, and broadcast regulations by the FCC.   International students may instead take Press Ethics or History of the News, with permission of the BER Director.   Press Ethics G54.0012 Explores the ethical questions facing working journalists. Focuses on specific cases, both real and hypothetical. Through readings, papers, and class discussions, students analyze the ethical problems raised by these cases and develop their own systems for making ethical decisions.   *History of the News G54.0018 This course surveys the history of the media and how each major development affected reporters and the public. Emphasis is placed on developments of the last century and especially the more recent growth of electronic media. This course is recommended for international students who do not plan to practice journalism in the United States and for whom Law and Mass Communications would not be especially relevant.     4. Specialized Reporting: Investigative Reporting G54.1182 (4 credits)     (This course is selected from the BER roster of courses, and the offering may change from year to year) Students learn a wide range of techniques for gathering information for in-depth business articles and investigations. They learn how to formulate a strategy for effective reporting and then gather the needed information from interviews, documents, and online sources. The work focuses on collecting information from sources such as government agencies, legal source material, and databases. The course also introduces students to the use of spreadsheets for the analysis of information.     5. The Hyperlocal Newsroom\u00a0 G54.1080 (4 credits)     (This course is selected from the BER roster of courses, and the offering may change from year to year.)   Students learn multimedia in the context of a hyperlocal newsroom, focusing on video, still images, and audio as effective reporting tools. Students will produce their work for The Local East Village, a hyperlocal news blog that is a collaborative effort between The New York Times and the Carter Journalism Institute. Published student work will appear under the banner of nytimes.com.     6.\u00a0 Writing the Long-Form Narrative G54.1182 (4 credits)     (This course is selected from the BER roster of courses, and the offering may change from year to year.)   This seminar focuses on the various components that comprise in-depth magazine stories and non-fiction books. We'll dissect great modern and classic magazine stories, books and book proposals for story, character arcs, dialogue, scenes, analysis, structure, transitions, verb tense, point of view and style. The goal is to figure out how memorable magazine features and narrative non-fiction books that keep your attention to the very last page are created, then to take what we've learned and apply it to our own work. There is one semester-long writing assignment\u2014a 5,000+-word feature story\u2014with several shorter related pieces involving scenes, character, dialogue, and analysis, all of which will be incorporated into the final capstone. Along the way we'll work on pitches and story memos, research and interview techniques, time management, outlines, editing and multiple drafts, and all the challenges today's non-fiction narrative writers face.     7. Summer Internship (2 credits)     Internship G54.1290 Students will have an internship during their summer in residence at NYU. They will work in the business and financial reporting section of a newspaper, magazine, broadcasting station, or online publication. Most of these internships will be in New York City.   Directed Reading G54.1299 This course is designed for part-time students, who undertake a substantial project of individual study. Students explore a business or economic subject in depth and produce a publishable article.       \u00a0   MBA Courses in NYU's Stern School of Business     8. Foundations of Finance B01.2311 (3 credits) or similar finance course     Students will learn about the financial markets and the tools available to companies in need of capital. Included: the banking system, the stock and bond markets, options, venture capital, and angel capital. Also: financing choices for corporations, including equity, debt, and derivative financial instruments, and their effect on the value of the company.     9. Financial Accounting and Reporting B01.1306 (3 credits) or similar accounting course     \"Accounting reports are an important means of communication with investors. This course focuses on the development, analysis and use of these reports. It provides an understanding of what these reports contain, what assumptions and concepts accountants use to prepare them, and why they use those assumptions and concepts. The course uses simple examples to provide students with a clear understanding of accounting concepts. It stresses the ability to apply these concepts to real world cases, which by their very nature are complex and ambiguous. In addition to text-oriented materials, the classes also include cases so that students can discuss applications of basic concepts, actual financial reports, and articles from newspapers. In addition to traditional introductory topics other topics may include mergers and acquisitions, purchase and pooling, free cash flow and financial statement analysis.\" (Stern website)     10. Firms and Markets B01.1303 ( 3 credits) or a more advanced economics course     \"This course is about economic principles: those governing the behavior of markets and firms-and strategic interactions between firms. Situations faced by leading corporations will be discussed, including supply and demand; how price depends on both costs and the sensitivity of buyers to price; the advantages and disadvantages of size; whether firms should make or outsource their inputs; how to increase revenue by charging different prices to different customers; the advantages and disadvantages of price competition; how to convey information to buyers and sellers; and winner take - most \"network\" markets. The course structure assumes that all students have had some economics background. They must be comfortable with quantitative concepts and approaches and with graphical/geometric ways of presenting quantitative information.\" (Stern website)     11. Global Economy B01.2303 (3 credits) or a more advanced economics course     \"We use the tools of international macroeconomics to explore the economic environment facing firms operating around the globe. Central issues include the role of economic policy and institutions in the performance of firms and nations; economic indicators and forecasting; employment and unemployment; interest rates, inflation, and monetary policy; global trade in goods and capital; foreign exchange rates; and emerging market crises. These issues are considered from the perspectives of both firms and countries.\" (Stern website)     12. and 13.\u00a0 Two Electives (3 credits each)\u00a0     Choose two courses, meeting applicable prerequisites, and with permission of the BER Director or Assistant Director.\u00a0 Students generally take their electives in subjects that they would like to cover as journalists. These electives are taken during the third semester from a wide array of offering at NYU:   Another MBA course at the Stern School of Business   A course at the NYU School of Law   A course at another NYU graduate school or department                                                   Arthur L.

Athletics have long served as the preoccupation through which ordinary individuals idealize values such as fair play, sportsmanship, discipline, camaraderie and competition. That remains true today, but the growth of sports as a business and as a cultural touchstone has put athletes, governing bodies and fans in a vortex of competing interests and obligations, with intriguing challenges and opportunities for the modern sports journalist. Even as developing technologies\u2014the Internet in general and social networking sites in particular\u2014bridge gaps between athletes, teams, leagues \u00a0and fans, the need for mediation, investigation and enterprise reporting has become even more relevant and urgent. \u201cSports Reporting and Writing in a Modern Cultural Landscape\u201d will familiarize aspiring journalists with the history of sports reporting, its current state and expected trajectories. Through a combination of literary and journalist readings, paired with an ambitious slate of reporting and writing assignments, students will emerge from the class possessing a comprehensive understanding of the modern sports media landscape and the skills necessary to find gainful employment within it. Guest speakers will incoude some of the best sportswriters and journalists in the country.                                               Arthur L.
