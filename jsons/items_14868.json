Laboratory for Neuroeconomics (Glimcher Lab)    The work of our laboratory seeks to reconcile economically based models  of behavior with neurobiological theories of response generation.

Emotional Brain Institute  The Emotional Brain Institute (EBI) is a joint initiative between New  York University and New York State. The goal of EBI is to understand  emotions and their impact on mind and behavior. A multi-disciplinary  group of researchers is investigating the origins of normal and  pathological emotions from the level of mind and behavior to neural  systems, cell activity, molecules, and genes. In researching these  topics, EBI investigators use state of the art approaches in the study  of brain, mind, and behavior.* *EBI researchers are located at the   Washington Square Campus of NYU and the   NYU Langone  School of Medicine , both in Manhattan, and the   Nathan Kline Institute , in Orangeburg, NY.         NYU Learning, Memory and Emotion Group  The Learning, Memory and Emotion Group at NYU consists of faculty,  postdocs, and students in the Center for Neural Science and Department  of Psychology who study learning, memory, including emotional learning  and memory. The Group meets on the first Friday of each month for the  Memory in Brain (MiB) Journal Club, at which a range of topics in  learning and memory are discussed, often by a guest speaker. Pizza is  served.        NYU ECoG Group  The NYU ECoG Group comprises a diverse group of researchers and clinicians  who are dedicated to advancing our understanding of human cognition and  improving the health of people with cognitive disorders by studying  patients with brain implants.
