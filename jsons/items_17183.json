Geographic Information Systems   The availability of \u201cbig data,\u201d allows us to capture and contextualize information, and then draw conclusions in ways that were never available in the past. We now have the tools to combine and analyze large, disparate data sets in order to make the data more useful. One very effective and popular way to do this is through Geographic Information Systems (GIS).   Many NYU students and faculty currently use GIS technology in their research and coursework. Cultural history classes analyze the migration patterns of New York\u2019s immigrant groups, marine biology classes record soil and water samples to see their effect on local ecology, and classes in public health compare the epidemiology of infectious diseases in different areas; the possible applications of GIS are vast and diverse.   With GIS software, researchers can capture, analyze, and present many types of geographically-referenced data sets. The software has many degrees of interaction depending on how data architects use it. Users can integrate various data sets into one system, overlay map layers, analyze and model spatial data, and visualize the results in maps, reports, and charts.

Semester: Fall       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           In this hands-on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) course students will learn to work with the leading mapping software, ArcGIS. Class and homework exercises will focus on methods of preparing, analyzing, visualizing/mapping a variety of urban planning data, crime data, and data on emergency/disaster impacts and more. They will also learn to save and share the maps they create, and the analysis results, in both printed form and on the internet.      Throughout this Introduction to GIS course students will be working with data that will be supplied by Prof. Naphtali but they will also learn to search for and download GIS data from various internet sites.      By the end of this GIS course, students will have a solid understanding of how GIS maps and ArcGIS tools can be used to visualize and analyze real-world features, to discover patterns in data, to obtain information and to communicate it with others using maps in printed form and on the internet.
