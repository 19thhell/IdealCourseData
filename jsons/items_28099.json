My dice-and-chips metagame, Tic-Tac-Totum, was selected as an Indiecade finalist in 2010. My most recent project was Guts of Glory, a card game designed by Zach Gage which I help-ed develop into a full-fledged boardgame. I am presently working on a research paper on looking at the rules changes in both folk and commercial Monopoly from a game design point of view.
