Do not hide extra keys in easily accessible places    Do not let strangers into your home or apartment to use the telephone    Have working lights at all entrances and turn them on after dark    Let people know where you are going     When You Are Out      Always travel in groups, preferably with 4 or more people    Don&#39;t carry a lot of money    Be aware of your surroundings &mdash; don&#39;t wear headphones, read, talk on the phone, or do anything else that might distract you.

Do not open your window if someone approaches your vehicle to ask for directions, the time, etc.    Keep any valuables in your car in the trunk or otherwise out of sight     General Safety Tips      Program emergency contact information into your cell phone under the listing &quot;ICE&quot; (In Case of Emergency) and carry an ICE identification card in your wallet or purse.
