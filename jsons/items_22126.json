The five-week program is aimed at intermediate and advanced students, including experienced professionals. It is comprised of three courses and is designed to enable students to investigate strategies for creating effective documentary projects in pursuit of human rights. Students will explore multimedia and traditional presentation approaches for their photographic essays, which they will develop through two studio courses, and create a narrative on a human rights issue in New York. A lecture course will provide participants with an opportunity to look at photography's strengths and weaknesses, both real and imagined, in attempting to determine new strategies for impact as both society and technology evolve. There also will be guest speakers from the fields of photojournalism, law, and media invited to speak to students in the program. Students in the past have come from China, India, Ecuador, Egypt, Armenia, Iran, Moldova, Slovenia, Kenya, the United States, as well as other countries. They have pursued documentary projects on homelessness, LGBT issues, immigration, disabilities, gender, urban issues, and the environment, among others. Questions? Check out the FAQ s.
