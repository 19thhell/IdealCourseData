NMO serves to not only encourage mediation, but to provide NYU Law students an opportunity to mediate in real life contexts. The NYU Mediation Organization is designed to offer students a hands-on experience by mediating real disputes arising between real parties, while at the same time relieving the heavy load on overburdened courthouses.   Each semester, students undergo intensive mediation training, including the nature of mediation, mediation techniques, developing listening skills, working with co-mediators, and establishing rapport with parties to a dispute. Every week, teams of mediators apply the dispute resolution techniques learned in training to mediate real disputes, alongside coaches, and mediation supervisors, within the New York State court system. The teams encounter a variety of cases that include landlord-tenant disputes, auto accidents, work contracts, and unpaid bills.   At the beginning of the Fall and Spring semesters, students (1st, 2nd, or 3rd years and LLMs) enter a lottery for the limited number of mediation positions NMO offers.
