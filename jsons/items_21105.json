Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Operations management specifically involves the analysis, design, operation, and improvement of the systems and processes that deliver goods or services and ultimately outputs and outcomes. It is required to achieve the organization\u2019s mission, provide value to the organization\u2019s many stakeholders, and effectively translate policy into action. As such, operations management plays an important part of being an effective manager and policy implementer. In this course, we will develop a lens to perceive processes and systems in a variety of contexts along with an analytical toolbox to examine and understand these. Students will learn how to build basic operations models in Excel to make effective, evidence-based managerial, design, and policy decisions as well as gain defined analytical skills that lend themselves to roles in operations, management, hospital management, policy implementation, human services, consulting, and much more.

The database assures that the NYU community can readily retrieve the most current versions of University policies.     What is a University Policy?     University policies advance our academic mission as an institution of higher education by helping to ensure compliance with applicable laws, ethical norms, and accepted best practices; promoting operational efficiencies; enhancing the opportunities to achieve the University\u2019s goals and reducing institutional risks.     University policies have broad application throughout the University across colleges, schools, institutes and/or operating units. These policies apply to all University Affiliates to the extent that they are relevant to the Affiliates' operations, unless an exception is provided by the President or the President's designee, in consultation with the General Counsel.     Policy Applicability   University policies can apply to some or all members of the University Community, including: (a) the Board of Trustees; (b) faculty, including visiting faculty; (c) researchers, including persons conducting research at or under the auspices of the University; (d) employees; (e) volunteers; (f) fellows, trainees and post-doctoral appointees; (g) students; and (h) others who are performing activities or providing services at or under the auspices of the University, including consultants, vendors, and contractors.   Employees engaged in developing University policies must follow the requirements outlined in NYU's Developing University Policies for drafting, approving, and amending University policies.                                                    Policy Global Applicability     University policies apply to the operations and activities of the University regardless of location . As a Global Network University, operating in an expanding international environment, the University will encounter varying laws and business practices when it conducts its affairs outside the United States. When a University policy or a provision of a policy conflicts with the laws in another country, the University seeks to have its operations and activities comply with the laws of that jurisdiction.     Because differences between University policy and foreign laws may not be self-evident and can be complex, whenever there is a question regarding the University's legal responsibilities at locations outside the United States, the Office of General Counsel must be consulted to evaluate and to advise on the appropriate course of action.
