The book,\u00a0 Privacy, Big Data, and the Public Good: Frameworks for Engagement , published by Cambridge University Press and launched on July 16 at the New York Academy of Sciences, is\u00a0an accessible summary of the important legal, economic, and statistical thinking that frames the many privacy issues associated with the use of big data \u2013 along with practical suggestions for protecting privacy and confidentiality that can help to guide practitioners.   On November 25,\u00a0 Privacy, Big Data, and the Public Good: Frameworks for Engagement was reviewed by Science Magazine, which said the book &#8220; presents a\u00a0collection of essays from a variety of perspectives,\u00a0in chapters by some of the heavy hitters\u00a0in the privacy debate, who make a convincing\u00a0case that the current framework\u00a0for dealing with consumer privacy does\u00a0not adequately address issues posed by\u00a0big data.&#8221;   The full review is available on Science Magazine&#8217;s website .            Claudio Silva receives IEEE&#8217;s 2014 Visualization Technical Achievement Award          November 13, 2014       0 Comments                On November 11, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) presented its 2014 Visualization and Technical Achievement Award to Claudio\u00a0T. Silva , Head of Disciplines at CUSP and professor of Computer Science and Engineering at NYU&#8217;s\u00a0Polytechnic School of Engineering.   The award, one of the highest honors given by the IEEE Computer Science Society&#8217;s Technical Committee on Visualization and Graphics (VGTC), recognizes Silva&#8217;s seminal advances to geometric computing for visualization and contributions to the development of the VisTrails data exploration system. The committee also cited Silva&#8217;s participation in various multidisciplinary projects.   VisTrails systematically maintains provenance for the data exploration process by capturing all the steps researchers follow in the course of an experiment\u2014much like document-tracking applications in Microsoft Word and Google Docs track changes to a document. Tracking provenance is essential because that information allows a researcher to accurately reproduce his or her own results or the results of others, even if they involve hundreds of parameters and complex data sets.   &#8220;Consider that when a researcher is engaged in an exploratory process, working with simulations, data analysis, and visualization, for example, very little is repeated during the analysis process; change is the norm, and new workflows are constantly being generated,&#8221; Silva explained. &#8220;VisTrails manages these rapidly evolving workflows. To make a simple analogy, using it is like having someone in the lab watching over your shoulder and taking concise notes.&#8221;   &#8220;Clauio Silva has blazed a trail of innovation in visualization that has strongly influenced many researchers, including myself,&#8221; said Amitabh Varshney, director of the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee and a professor of computer science and the director of the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies at the University of Maryland. &#8220;One of the reasons his work has had such a significant impact is because it combines elegant foundational research with real-world applications. This award is a well-deserved recognition of Claudio&#8217;s illustrious accomplishments and stunning impact.&#8221;            2014 AT&#038;T Transit Tech Developer Day at CUSP          November 11, 2014       0 Comments             November 22, 2014 &#8211; November 22, 2014   2 MetroTech Center   Map and Directions | Register   Description:  The 2014 AT&amp;T Transit Tech Developer Day App is an opportunity to launch the development of your 2014 MTA App Quest entry.

In this talk I will discuss some of the challenges associated with biclustering, and provide an algorithm that overcomes most of these challenges.   Bio   Dr. Aaditya V Rangan is an Assistant Professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, NYU. He received his PhD in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley. His research interests lie in large \u2013 scale scientific modeling of physical, biological and neurobiological phenomena and the development of efficient numerical methods and related analysis.   Register            AAAI 2015 Workshop on AI for Cities          July 23, 2014       0 Comments                      Almost half of humanity today lives in urban environments and that number will grow to 80% or more by the middle of this century in different parts of the world. Cities are thus the loci of resource consumption, economic activity, social interactions, and education and innovation; they are the cause of our looming sustainability problems but also where those problems must be solved. Cities are also an enormous forum for policy making, as well as an apparently unbounded source of digital data of a wide nature. Artificial Intelligence has the potential to play a central role in tackling the underlying hard computational, decision making, and statistical problems of cities.   With this in mind, CUSP has proposed a worskshop to bring together AI researchers who work on urban informatics and domain experts from city agencies in order to: i) identify and characterize the prototypical AI problems that cities face, ii) discuss data access, open platforms, and dissemination of information, iii) present recent research in this nascent subfield, and iv) strengthen the path from research to decision and policy making. The workshop will be held on January 25-26, 2015, in Austin, Texas.

Numerous privacy concerns have been raised by use &#8211; or misuse &#8211; of such data in commercial and national security arenas. Yet we are motivated by the potential for \u201cbig data\u201d to be harnessed to serve the public good: scientists can use new forms of data to do research that improves people&#8217;s live; federal, state and local governments can use data to improve the delivery of services to citizens; and non-profit organizations can use the information to advance the public good.   Access to big data raises many unanswered questions related to privacy and confidentiality:\u00a0 What are the ethical and legal requirements for scientists and government officials seeking to serve the public good without harming individual citizens? What are the rules of engagement? What are the best ways to provide access while protecting confidentiality? Are there reasonable mechanisms to compensate citizens for privacy loss?     CUSP, along with\u00a0the\u00a0 American Statistical Association and its Privacy and Confidentiality subcommittee\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0 Research Data Centre of the German Federal Employment Agency , sponsored a book on this very issue, Privacy, Big Data, and the Public Good: Frameworks for Engagement .\u00a0 Published by Cambridge University Press, this book is\u00a0an accessible summary of the important legal, economic, and statistical thinking that frames the many privacy issues associated with the use of big data &#8211; along with practical suggestions for protecting privacy and confidentiality that can help to guide practitioners.   The book launch, held at the New York Academy of Sciences on July 16th, included talks and panels by the book&#8217;s editors and a number of the authors. You can watch these talks and panels below.   Editors&#8217; Panel   Moderator: Michael Holland   Panelists: Julia Lane, Victoria Stodden, Stefan Bender, Helen Nissenbaum   The editors discuss the motivation for the book and how it contributes to the broader conversation on privacy concerns about big data.\u00a0 They also briefly highlight the contribution of authors who were unable to participate in the event.     Panel 1: Law, Ethics, and Economics of Big Data   Moderator: Jake Bournazian   Panel: Helen Nissenbaum, Kathy Strandburg, Victoria Stodden     Authors discuss the fact that \u201cbig data\u201d is more than a straightforward change in technology.\u00a0 It poses deep challenges to our traditions of notice and consent as tools for managing privacy.\u00a0 Because our new tools of data science can make it all but impossible to guarantee anonymity in the future, is it possible to truly give informed consent, when we cannot, by definition, know what the risks are from revealing personal data either for individuals or for society as a whole?   Presentations:       Helen Nissenbaum   Victoria Stodden         Panel 2: Practical Concerns of Working with Big Data   Moderator: Julia Lane   Panelists: Bob Goerge, Daniel &#8220;Dazza&#8221; Greenwood, Carl Landwehr   Based on their experience building large data collections, authors discuss some of the best practical ways to provide access while protecting confidentiality.\u00a0 What have we learned about effective engineered controls?\u00a0 About effective access policies?\u00a0 About designing data systems that reinforce &#8211; rather than counter &#8211; access policies?\u00a0 They also explore the business, legal, and technical standards necessary for a new deal on data.   Presentations:       Bob George   Carl Landwehr         Panel 3: Statistical Framework: Issues &amp; Practical Responses   Moderator: Stefan Bender   Panelists: Frauke Kreuter, Jerry Reiter, Peter Elias   Since the data generating process or the data collection process is not necessarily well understood for big data streams, authors discuss what statistics can tell us about how to make greatest scientific use of this data. They also explore the shortcomings of current disclosure limitation approaches and whether we can quantify the extent of privacy loss.   Presentations:       Frauke Kreuter   Jerry Reiter   Peter Elias         Capstone Speaker: Theresa Pardo   Our capstone speaker is\u00a0the Director of the Center for Technology in Government at the University at Albany, the Open NY Policy Advisor for Open.NY.Gov, and the President of the Digital Government Society.\u00a0 She shows us how \u201cbig data\u201d can be harnessed to serve the public good by presenting a guide for making information in the public sector more available and more usable.

The project may be within larger, ongoing research efforts involving city agencies and CUSP industry partners, a self-contained effort involving agencies and corporations, or entrepreneurial in focus and content.         What Makes the Program Special?   Seven elements are at the heart of why this program is unlike any other.       Discipline Specialization   Select an informatics discipline that will guide your applied work in the program. Discipline specializations are targeted at building skills for data acquisition and management, integration, and analysis in a number of subfields.   Domain Specialization   Choose to specialize in one urban domain (transportation and mobility; buildings and the built environment; public health, security, and emergency response; or environmental sustainability) that will serve as the basis for your Urban Science Intensive project.   Entrepreneurship and Innovation Leadership Specialization   You&#8217;ll have the option to specialize in either change leadership and organizational behavior or entrepreneurship and new venture creation. These skills are critical for successfully applying your degree to real world situations.   City Challenge Program   A week-long cohort-building program and immersion in the dynamics of New York City agencies, city operations, and the CUSP intellectual community. You&#8217;ll attend the City Challenge in August before you start your first full semester.

The book,\u00a0 Privacy, Big Data, and the Public Good: Frameworks for Engagement , published by Cambridge University Press and launched on July 16 at the New York Academy of Sciences, is\u00a0an accessible summary of the important legal, economic, and statistical thinking that frames the many privacy issues associated with the use of big data \u2013 along with practical suggestions for protecting privacy and confidentiality that can help to guide practitioners.   On November 25,\u00a0 Privacy, Big Data, and the Public Good: Frameworks for Engagement was reviewed by Science Magazine, which said the book &#8220; presents a\u00a0collection of essays from a variety of perspectives,\u00a0in chapters by some of the heavy hitters\u00a0in the privacy debate, who make a convincing\u00a0case that the current framework\u00a0for dealing with consumer privacy does\u00a0not adequately address issues posed by\u00a0big data.&#8221;   The full review is available on Science Magazine&#8217;s website .            Claudio Silva receives IEEE&#8217;s 2014 Visualization Technical Achievement Award          November 13, 2014       0 Comments                On November 11, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) presented its 2014 Visualization and Technical Achievement Award to Claudio\u00a0T. Silva , Head of Disciplines at CUSP and professor of Computer Science and Engineering at NYU&#8217;s\u00a0Polytechnic School of Engineering.   The award, one of the highest honors given by the IEEE Computer Science Society&#8217;s Technical Committee on Visualization and Graphics (VGTC), recognizes Silva&#8217;s seminal advances to geometric computing for visualization and contributions to the development of the VisTrails data exploration system. The committee also cited Silva&#8217;s participation in various multidisciplinary projects.   VisTrails systematically maintains provenance for the data exploration process by capturing all the steps researchers follow in the course of an experiment\u2014much like document-tracking applications in Microsoft Word and Google Docs track changes to a document. Tracking provenance is essential because that information allows a researcher to accurately reproduce his or her own results or the results of others, even if they involve hundreds of parameters and complex data sets.   &#8220;Consider that when a researcher is engaged in an exploratory process, working with simulations, data analysis, and visualization, for example, very little is repeated during the analysis process; change is the norm, and new workflows are constantly being generated,&#8221; Silva explained. &#8220;VisTrails manages these rapidly evolving workflows. To make a simple analogy, using it is like having someone in the lab watching over your shoulder and taking concise notes.&#8221;   &#8220;Clauio Silva has blazed a trail of innovation in visualization that has strongly influenced many researchers, including myself,&#8221; said Amitabh Varshney, director of the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee and a professor of computer science and the director of the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies at the University of Maryland. &#8220;One of the reasons his work has had such a significant impact is because it combines elegant foundational research with real-world applications. This award is a well-deserved recognition of Claudio&#8217;s illustrious accomplishments and stunning impact.&#8221;            2014 AT&#038;T Transit Tech Developer Day at CUSP          November 11, 2014       0 Comments             November 22, 2014 &#8211; November 22, 2014   2 MetroTech Center   Map and Directions | Register   Description:  The 2014 AT&amp;T Transit Tech Developer Day App is an opportunity to launch the development of your 2014 MTA App Quest entry.

In this talk I will discuss some of the challenges associated with biclustering, and provide an algorithm that overcomes most of these challenges.   Bio   Dr. Aaditya V Rangan is an Assistant Professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, NYU. He received his PhD in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley. His research interests lie in large \u2013 scale scientific modeling of physical, biological and neurobiological phenomena and the development of efficient numerical methods and related analysis.   Register            AAAI 2015 Workshop on AI for Cities          July 23, 2014       0 Comments                      Almost half of humanity today lives in urban environments and that number will grow to 80% or more by the middle of this century in different parts of the world. Cities are thus the loci of resource consumption, economic activity, social interactions, and education and innovation; they are the cause of our looming sustainability problems but also where those problems must be solved. Cities are also an enormous forum for policy making, as well as an apparently unbounded source of digital data of a wide nature. Artificial Intelligence has the potential to play a central role in tackling the underlying hard computational, decision making, and statistical problems of cities.   With this in mind, CUSP has proposed a worskshop to bring together AI researchers who work on urban informatics and domain experts from city agencies in order to: i) identify and characterize the prototypical AI problems that cities face, ii) discuss data access, open platforms, and dissemination of information, iii) present recent research in this nascent subfield, and iv) strengthen the path from research to decision and policy making. The workshop will be held on January 25-26, 2015, in Austin, Texas.   Topics include     Spatiotemporal inference of urban processes (social or natural)   Energy consumption/disaggregation models of large urban areas   Planning/Scheduling for city operations   Decision making for urban science and for city policy   AI models of transportation and utilities networks   Resource allocation in urban systems   Event detection of urban activity and processes   Active learning, sampling biases and dataset shift in city data   Multi-agent simulations of urban processes   Visualization and city operational systems   Cross-city comparative analysis   Improving public health systems in cities   Crowdsourcing for urban science and decision making   Open data platforms and data access tools for data science     Preliminary Agenda         09:00 &#8211; 09:10   \u00a0-   \u00a0Introduction and opening remarks       09:10 &#8211; 09:40   \u00a0-   \u00a0 Invited talk &#8211; Juliana Freire, NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering        09:40 &#8211; 10:10   \u00a0-   \u00a0Invited talk &#8211; Autonomous Machines and Robots in Cities &#8211; Manuela Veloso, CMU       10:10 &#8211; 10:30   \u00a0-   \u00a0Coffee Break       10:30 &#8211; 11:00   \u00a0-   Invited talk &#8211; Adi Botea, IBM       11:00 &#8211; 11:30   \u00a0-   \u00a0Invited talk &#8211; Craig Knoblock, USC       11:30 &#8211; 12:30   \u00a0-   \u00a0Lunch Break       12:30 &#8211; 01:00   \u00a0-   \u00a0Invited Talk &#8211; Mike Flowers, NYU CUSP       01:00 &#8211; 03:00   \u00a0-   \u00a0Paper Presentations       03:00 &#8211; 03:30   \u00a0-   \u00a0Data access &#8211; city data portals, initiatives, and restrictions       03:30 &#8211; 04:00   \u00a0-   \u00a0Coffee Break       04:00 &#8211; 04:30   \u00a0-   \u00a0Data access &#8211; city data portals, initiatives, and restrictions       04:30 &#8211; 05:00   \u00a0-   \u00a0Open discussion and concluding remarks       05:00 &#8211; 06:00   \u00a0-   \u00a0Social event         Submission Requirements   Papers must be formatted in AAAI two-column, camera-ready style.

Numerous privacy concerns have been raised by use &#8211; or misuse &#8211; of such data in commercial and national security arenas. Yet we are motivated by the potential for \u201cbig data\u201d to be harnessed to serve the public good: scientists can use new forms of data to do research that improves people&#8217;s live; federal, state and local governments can use data to improve the delivery of services to citizens; and non-profit organizations can use the information to advance the public good.   Access to big data raises many unanswered questions related to privacy and confidentiality:\u00a0 What are the ethical and legal requirements for scientists and government officials seeking to serve the public good without harming individual citizens? What are the rules of engagement? What are the best ways to provide access while protecting confidentiality? Are there reasonable mechanisms to compensate citizens for privacy loss?     CUSP, along with\u00a0the\u00a0 American Statistical Association and its Privacy and Confidentiality subcommittee\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0 Research Data Centre of the German Federal Employment Agency , sponsored a book on this very issue, Privacy, Big Data, and the Public Good: Frameworks for Engagement .\u00a0 Published by Cambridge University Press, this book is\u00a0an accessible summary of the important legal, economic, and statistical thinking that frames the many privacy issues associated with the use of big data &#8211; along with practical suggestions for protecting privacy and confidentiality that can help to guide practitioners.   The book launch, held at the New York Academy of Sciences on July 16th, included talks and panels by the book&#8217;s editors and a number of the authors. You can watch these talks and panels below.   Editors&#8217; Panel   Moderator: Michael Holland   Panelists: Julia Lane, Victoria Stodden, Stefan Bender, Helen Nissenbaum   The editors discuss the motivation for the book and how it contributes to the broader conversation on privacy concerns about big data.\u00a0 They also briefly highlight the contribution of authors who were unable to participate in the event.     Panel 1: Law, Ethics, and Economics of Big Data   Moderator: Jake Bournazian   Panel: Helen Nissenbaum, Kathy Strandburg, Victoria Stodden     Authors discuss the fact that \u201cbig data\u201d is more than a straightforward change in technology.\u00a0 It poses deep challenges to our traditions of notice and consent as tools for managing privacy.\u00a0 Because our new tools of data science can make it all but impossible to guarantee anonymity in the future, is it possible to truly give informed consent, when we cannot, by definition, know what the risks are from revealing personal data either for individuals or for society as a whole?   Presentations:       Helen Nissenbaum   Victoria Stodden         Panel 2: Practical Concerns of Working with Big Data   Moderator: Julia Lane   Panelists: Bob Goerge, Daniel &#8220;Dazza&#8221; Greenwood, Carl Landwehr   Based on their experience building large data collections, authors discuss some of the best practical ways to provide access while protecting confidentiality.\u00a0 What have we learned about effective engineered controls?\u00a0 About effective access policies?\u00a0 About designing data systems that reinforce &#8211; rather than counter &#8211; access policies?\u00a0 They also explore the business, legal, and technical standards necessary for a new deal on data.   Presentations:       Bob George   Carl Landwehr         Panel 3: Statistical Framework: Issues &amp; Practical Responses   Moderator: Stefan Bender   Panelists: Frauke Kreuter, Jerry Reiter, Peter Elias   Since the data generating process or the data collection process is not necessarily well understood for big data streams, authors discuss what statistics can tell us about how to make greatest scientific use of this data. They also explore the shortcomings of current disclosure limitation approaches and whether we can quantify the extent of privacy loss.   Presentations:       Frauke Kreuter   Jerry Reiter   Peter Elias         Capstone Speaker: Theresa Pardo   Our capstone speaker is\u00a0the Director of the Center for Technology in Government at the University at Albany, the Open NY Policy Advisor for Open.NY.Gov, and the President of the Digital Government Society.\u00a0 She shows us how \u201cbig data\u201d can be harnessed to serve the public good by presenting a guide for making information in the public sector more available and more usable.

The NYU center was designated just last year as part of the City\u2019s groundbreaking Applied Sciences NYC initiative , which seeks to increase New York City\u2019s capacity for applied sciences. Building on its mission to define the emerging field of Urban Informatics, CUSP will shape its students into the next generation of scientists who will understand urban data sources and how to manipulate and integrate large, diverse datasets. These skills will enable them to develop solutions to pressing urban problems that recognize and account for the constraints embedded in complex urban systems.   &#8220;NYU\u2019s Center for Urban Science and Progress will establish New York City as a global leader in urban informatics, and I\u2019d like to welcome their inaugural class of graduate students to Downtown Brooklyn,&#8221; said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. &#8220;As a key part of our Applied Sciences initiative, we are excited to see CUSP attract even more of the best and brightest from around the world to New York City.\u201d   \u201cWe are truly excited to welcome our first class of students,\u201d said CUSP Director Steve Koonin.\u00a0 \u201cWe believe that CUSP\u2019s curriculum offers a vigorous, dynamic and comprehensive educational program.\u00a0 This first group of students has outstanding credentials, validating the idea that the best young minds are drawn to studying cities, and we are particularly honored to have Mayor Bloomberg \u2013 whose Applied Sciences NYC initiative made all this possible \u2013 here to welcome them.\u00a0\u00a0 Using New York City as its classroom, this accomplished group of students, along with CUSP researchers, will be poised to study and use big data analytics to drive decision-making in urban areas.\u00a0 We believe that CUSP\u2019s graduates will go on to work for private technology firms, public sector agencies, and in entrepreneurship and new venture creation.\u201d   The incoming class of 25 students will receive a Master of Science in Applied Urban Science and Informatics. The class holds degrees from 24 universities around the world and come with training in more than 20 different academic disciplines \u2013 some from the core disciplines like Mathematics, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering and Physics; others with strong preparation in the social sciences such as Sociology, Political Science, and Urban Studies &amp; Planning.\u00a0 The unprecedented range of backgrounds illustrates the diversity of the inaugural class ranging from one student with a Ph.D. in Mathematics and another with a degree in Studio Art with near perfect quantitative GRE scores.   The M.S. program offers students the opportunity to engage in the interdisciplinary study of urban science and informatics and to apply their technical skills to challenges facing cities around the world.\u00a0 The intensive, one-year, three-semester M.S. program provides students with core courses in the science of cities, urban informatics, and information and communication technology in cities.\u00a0 Students will select from multiple policy domains to gain breadth and depth in the application of big data analytics to urban problems.\u00a0 The program also contains a focus on entrepreneurship and innovation leadership, and students will be given the option to study technology entrepreneurship or \u201cchange leadership\u201d in an existing organization.\u00a0 The core of the one-year curriculum is a two-semester project \u2013 the Urban Science Intensive \u2013 during which students, working closely with mentors from CUSP\u2019s Industrial and National Laboratory partners, will apply the principles of informatics to address an actual urban problem with a New York City agency to have a direct and meaningful impact on the quality of life in cities.
