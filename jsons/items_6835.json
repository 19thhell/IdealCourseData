Home Since its establishment in 1923, the Department of Music at New York University has held a central position in American music scholarship and creativity. NYU faculty member Gustave Reese was one of the founding members of The American Musicological Society in 1934, and by mid-century the department had attracted a world-renowned group of scholars and musicians, from the pioneering musicologist Curt Sachs to composers of both concert and popular music such as Marion Bauer and Percy Grainger. Building on this legacy, the Department established its ethnomusicology sub-field in 1978, and a composition and theory sub-field in 1992. It has since grown into one of the country\u2019s most exciting, intellectually vibrant centers for the interdisciplinary study of music and sound. The NYU Department of Music offers studies in historical musicology, ethnomusicology, and composition and theory at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. With its leading research faculty, the Department grants degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy. The Department also sponsors a colloquium series, musical ensembles, graduate and undergraduate concerts, the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society concert series, and a range of interdisciplinary symposia/conferences. Our facilities include early and world music instrument collections, the Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media , and the Waverly Labs for Music and Computing , which provide faculty and students with equipment, lab and workshops spaces for research and creation in music and sound art.

Home > Undergraduate Program     Undergraduate Program Undergraduate students in the department study, create, and perform music in an environment that combines the benefits of a well-rounded liberal arts education with the resources of a major research university.      Resources    Our students have a wealth of resources available for their research, performance, and creative work. The Shorin Music Performance Center offers a large number of rehearsal and practice rooms and the Department has its own intimate, loft-likeperformance space that serves as a recording studio and as a venue for recitals and concerts. Two cutting-edge technology labs - The Washington Square Computer Music Studio and the Media Lab - provide digital resources for composition and research. Professional sound recording and video equipment is available for check-out. The Department hosts the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society , the Collegium Musicum, and the Washington Square Harp and Shamrock Orchestra , the only Irish music ensemble in any university in the U.S. Our students can also join ensembles sponsored by the Steinhardt School of Education , such as the NYU Symphony Orchestra. The Department's greatest asset, however, is its location in the heart of New York City, one of the world's great cultural centers. Many of our courses are structured around live performances at venues ranging from the city's  top concert halls to its most obscure performance spaces. We also encourage students to take advantage of our location by pursuing internships with NYC-based recording companies, music magazines, or major performing arts organizations.      The Undergraduate Program    Students pursuing a major or minor in music gain proficiency in theory, history, criticism, and interpretation of music traditions throughout the world. At the same time, our students develop skills in analysis, critical thinking, composition, and writing that are valuable across disciplines. As a result, the major and minor in music constitute excellent preparation for graduate study in music and related fields in the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences; for careers in music, media, and culture industries; or for any occupation demanding clear and original thinking, command of the written word, analytical skills, and creativity.    In addition to a curriculum designed for majors and minors, we offer a wide range of innovative courses - in historical musicology, ethnomusicology, popular music, music theory, composition, historical performance, jazz, and the emerging field of sound studies - that are addressed to the general student. Recent and upcoming undergraduate courses include:               Harmony and Counterpoint (4 semesters) History of European Music (4 semesters)    Popular Music in Latin/o American and the Caribbean Music, War and Memory Twelve Masterworks of 20th century Music    Principles of Composition: Electroacoustic Music    Advanced Seminar in Jazz Studies    Introduction to Celtic Music    The Art of Listening: From Bach to Bjork on the Streets of New York    Global Hip Hop and the Politics of Culture    Musical 'Complexities'/Theoretical Perplexity    Anthropology of Improvisation    Alternate Canons: The Black Rock Coalition    Native American Music and Poetics    Spectral Music: A Chord or and Attitude?
