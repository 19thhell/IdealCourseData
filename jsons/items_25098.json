The degree focuses on legal and financial translation as well as software localization. It is offered in English to Spanish , French to English and Spanish to English online, and in Chinese to English on-site, in New York City.   The program's rigorous curriculum prepares you to become an effective, professional translator by providing a foundation in translation and language theory, while addressing the practical aspects of translation as applied to the fields of business, finance, and law. You will learn to produce accurate, clear, and elegant texts in English. In addition, you will acquire the skills and the knowledge base needed to ensure textually and culturally accurate terminology in the preparation of business contracts, and books and articles on global commerce, trade, or the law. The program is taught by a faculty of accomplished translators and scholars who incorporate their applied professional experience into a curriculum that is rooted in translation theory and linguistic analysis.   Course offerings are organized into three groups: translation and language theory, legal and financial subject matter, and practical translation courses, with both required and elective courses in each group. While there are no required concentrations, the balance of required and elective courses allows you to focus more on legal or financial translation. The curriculum of the Chinese to English program reflects the needs of that specific market, covering a broader area of commercial translation and a course in technical translation. The final course is a capstone project, which can be either of a theoretical nature or a complex translation of significant length, which is defended in person at NYU or via video link in real time.   Students have the opportunity to expand the range of their skills and knowledge by auditing courses offered in our continuing education Certificates in Translation , enriching their portfolios by taking courses in areas of translation not offered in the master's program. All students, both online and on-site, benefit from the NYU Wasserman Center for Career Development at the NYU School of Professional Studies , where advisors work with them on job searches, interviewing skills, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 preparation, and other career-related areas.

It aims at educating a much needed  new generation of literary translators. The program is supported by all the  faculty members of the prestigious NYU French department and, as such, is  guaranteed to offer an equally top-rate theoretical and analytical education in  translation.         NYU provides the perfect environment for this type of  program in translation. Our two main  advantages are 1) our location in New York City where, besides the French Publishers\u2019  Agency, the vast majority of American publishers likely to publish French books  in translation are located, and 2) the NYU Paris center, where the students  will spend a six-week Summer session allowing them to meet with contemporary  French writers, publishers, and foreign rights managers. For more information, check out our Facebook page and the blog created by Literary Translation students.  Admission The  requirements for admission are a B.A. with a strong concentration of French  (e.g. major in French literature or language, major in Comparative literature  with a specialization in French literature); a statement of purpose (2 pages double-spaced); a translation sample consisting of approximately 3000 words (double-spaced) translated from the French (fiction, drama, essay, poetry, or  social sciences) with a photocopy of the original including all the necessary  references; three letters of recommendation; an official transcript of  undergraduate studies; GRE scores; and TOEFL scores (for those whose native  language is not English). ( http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication )      Applications are accepted for fall admission only .      The application deadline is April 15th, 2015.                      Program content and  requirements This one-year program (Fall and Spring semester in New York,  intensive six-week Summer session in France) will comprise eight four-credit  courses (32 credits in total) plus a thesis. Two thesis formats will be  accepted:      1) The typical thesis will consist of the original translation  of a book-long piece, such as a play, a collection of short stories, poems or  essays, a short novel or a long novella, preceded by a foreword-type analysis  of the specific translation problems raised by the text.      2) For students interested in a more fully analytical  approach, the thesis could consist of a 60- to 100-page comparative study of  existing translations. List of Courses  Fall: Theory of Translation: FREN-GA 1020 A survey course that will inform students on the major  issues at stake in literary translation by means of a broad history of  translation theory, from the Romans to the twentieth century with a particular  focus on French theorists, and through a more focused study of specific  problems in literary translation, such as poetry and translation, translating  dramatic texts, translating the vernaculars, etc.                  Stylistics and Semantics of Written French: FREN-GA 1022 Ce cours propose  un entra\u00eenement intensif \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9crit.

Workshop in Translation I: FREN-GA 1021 Regular submission, analysis, and discussion of students\u2019  translations of book excerpts in a wide variety of genres, from autobiographies  and memoirs to works of philosophy, religion and history, and self-help and  oenology books to literary fiction. The titles will be provided by the French  Publishers\u2019 Agency and the students\u2019 translation samples will be submitted to  American publishers, via the Agency.                  Spring: French Literature or French Civilization Graduate Course: 4 points Any French Department literature or civilization course.

Workshop in Translation II: FREN-GA 2010 Regular submission, analysis, and discussion of students\u2019  own translation projects, which should constitute the basis for students\u2019 final  theses. This course will take the form  of a seminar, conducted by a professional literary translator. Students will work on methodology and  research issues related to translating a piece of publishable length and learn  about the revising and editing process involved in translation.                      Six-week Summer  Session in France (from mid-May to the end of June): Translation II: FREN-GA 2009/9003 This course will be a course in translation analysis and  comparative poetics. It will teach the students to read and analyze texts in translation and, through comparative  analysis, they will learn about specific issues raised by literary translation  (issues related to textual genres, cultural issues, prosodic and rhythmic  issues, register and dialect issues, etc.) as well as gain a concrete historical  knowledge of translation theory.                  Creative Writing Workshop: FREN-GA 2000/9000 Regular submission and discussion and analysis of student  work in one or more fictional modes (short story, short novel, novel, etc.),  with examination of relevant readings illustrating point of view, plot,  setting, characterization, dialogue, and aspects of style.

The degree focuses on legal and financial translation as well as software localization. It is offered in English to Spanish , French to English and Spanish to English online, and in Chinese to English on-site, in New York City.   The program's rigorous curriculum prepares you to become an effective, professional translator by providing a foundation in translation and language theory, while addressing the practical aspects of translation as applied to the fields of business, finance, and law. You will learn to produce accurate, clear, and elegant texts in English. In addition, you will acquire the skills and the knowledge base needed to ensure textually and culturally accurate terminology in the preparation of business contracts, and books and articles on global commerce, trade, or the law. The program is taught by a faculty of accomplished translators and scholars who incorporate their applied professional experience into a curriculum that is rooted in translation theory and linguistic analysis.   Course offerings are organized into three groups: translation and language theory, legal and financial subject matter, and practical translation courses, with both required and elective courses in each group. While there are no required concentrations, the balance of required and elective courses allows you to focus more on legal or financial translation. The curriculum of the Chinese to English program reflects the needs of that specific market, covering a broader area of commercial translation and a course in technical translation. The final course is a capstone project, which can be either of a theoretical nature or a complex translation of significant length, which is defended in person at NYU or via video link in real time.   Students have the opportunity to expand the range of their skills and knowledge by auditing courses offered in our continuing education Certificates in Translation , enriching their portfolios by taking courses in areas of translation not offered in the master's program. All students, both online and on-site, benefit from the NYU Wasserman Center for Career Development at the NYU School of Professional Studies , where advisors work with them on job searches, interviewing skills, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 preparation, and other career-related areas.

It aims at educating a much needed  new generation of literary translators. The program is supported by all the  faculty members of the prestigious NYU French department and, as such, is  guaranteed to offer an equally top-rate theoretical and analytical education in  translation.         NYU provides the perfect environment for this type of  program in translation. Our two main  advantages are 1) our location in New York City where, besides the French Publishers\u2019  Agency, the vast majority of American publishers likely to publish French books  in translation are located, and 2) the NYU Paris center, where the students  will spend a six-week Summer session allowing them to meet with contemporary  French writers, publishers, and foreign rights managers. For more information, check out our Facebook page and the blog created by Literary Translation students.  Admission The  requirements for admission are a B.A. with a strong concentration of French  (e.g. major in French literature or language, major in Comparative literature  with a specialization in French literature); a statement of purpose (2 pages double-spaced); a translation sample consisting of approximately 3000 words (double-spaced) translated from the French (fiction, drama, essay, poetry, or  social sciences) with a photocopy of the original including all the necessary  references; three letters of recommendation; an official transcript of  undergraduate studies; GRE scores; and TOEFL scores (for those whose native  language is not English). ( http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication )      Applications are accepted for fall admission only .      The application deadline is April 15th, 2015.                      Program content and  requirements This one-year program (Fall and Spring semester in New York,  intensive six-week Summer session in France) will comprise eight four-credit  courses (32 credits in total) plus a thesis. Two thesis formats will be  accepted:      1) The typical thesis will consist of the original translation  of a book-long piece, such as a play, a collection of short stories, poems or  essays, a short novel or a long novella, preceded by a foreword-type analysis  of the specific translation problems raised by the text.      2) For students interested in a more fully analytical  approach, the thesis could consist of a 60- to 100-page comparative study of  existing translations. List of Courses  Fall: Theory of Translation: FREN-GA 1020 A survey course that will inform students on the major  issues at stake in literary translation by means of a broad history of  translation theory, from the Romans to the twentieth century with a particular  focus on French theorists, and through a more focused study of specific  problems in literary translation, such as poetry and translation, translating  dramatic texts, translating the vernaculars, etc.                  Stylistics and Semantics of Written French: FREN-GA 1022 Ce cours propose  un entra\u00eenement intensif \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9crit.

Professors Edelstein\u00a0and Zhang, who teach \"Projects in Studio Art: China\" and \"Introduction to Studio Art: China\" provide\u00a0an ideal setting for students to develop Western-style painting techniques alongside Chinese ink painting and calligraphy techniques. The blended exposure to multiple styles has proven to inspire unique student work.   Nicholas Andrew Sanchez, a sophomore student\u00a0showcasing an ink portrait of a recumbent nude, said he initially had no foundation in Chinese painting styles. Over the course of the semester, he pursued Chinese ink painting and calligraphy, gradually building his skills and understanding of light and heavy brush strokes, using line to evoke a sense of fluidity in his work.\u00a0Sanchez says he has developed a strong interest in Chinese painting styles\u2014the careful realism of Gongbi technique being his favorite\u2014and will further practice and explore them. \u00a0     Another student, Rebecca Grinberg, stated that her ink painting Rabbit \u00a0was inspired both from the American supernatural drama film Donnie Darko and an idiom her Chinese roommate taught her: \"\u5154\u5b50\u4e0d\u5403\u7a9d\u8fb9\u8349.\"\u00a0When translated, its meanings is: \"A rabbit does not eat the grass near its own home,\"\u00a0or \"A\u00a0wise rabbit will never rob his neighbor's henroost.\"\u00a0She drew correlations between aspects of the film and the idiom, discovering a cross-cultural connection between different artistic mediums. Grinberg's\u00a0ink composition consisted of a rabbit\u2019s head in a style that mimicked the film\u2019s rabbit mask motif,\u00a0with the Chinese idiom alongside it in neat strokes of calligraphy.   Associate Vice Chancellor Hongxia Liu acknowledged the exhibition as a great accomplishment of active teaching. The exhibition not only started an art space at NYU Shanghai,\u00a0but also showed\u00a0another side of NYU Shanghai as a research university. Here, there is a respect for creative inspiration and\u00a0passion for\u00a0the arts, cultivating students to make art a lifelong interest.   \u00a0   Photos by Rhine Lu                        VIEW ALL NEWS                                        About NYU Shanghai Vision and Mission Statement   Leadership   Statement of Labor Values   Technology Services   Work Here   Getting Around Campus   FAQs   Contact Us     Admissions &amp; Financial Aid Chinese Admissions   Chinese Financial Support   US/International Admissions   US/International Financial Aid   Financial Aid FAQs   Contact Us   Welcome Center     Academic Life Academic Calendar   Our Curriculum   Our Majors   Our Faculty   Our Library   Study Away   Academic Support   Registration Services   Non-Degree Educational Programs     Campus Life New Student Programs   Office of the Dean of Students   Athletics and Recreation   Career Development   Getting Settled   Health and Wellness   Residential Life and Housing   Student Involvement   Student Services   Be Safe     Research Research Resources   Research News   Research at NYU Shanghai               Gateways      Prospective Students   Current Students   Faculty   Employees   Community   News   Events / Calendar                        NYU SHANGHAI   Copyright \u00a9 2015 NYU Shanghai.
