Davis Projects for Peace proposals are submitted by students, and will be implemented in upcoming summer to promote peace and address the root causes of conflict among parties. Applicants are encouraged to design projects that employ innovative techniques for engaging their target population, focusing on conflict resolution, reconciliation, building understanding and breaking down barriers, and maintaining peace. Through a competition on over 90 campuses, projects will be selected for funding at $10,000 each.              About Davis Projects For Peace   Davis Projects for Peace is funded by Kathryn W. Davis, a lifelong internationalist and philanthropist. Mrs. Davis has committed $1 million to fund these numerous $10,000 projects for peace. She believes that today\u2019s youth \u2013 tomorrow\u2019s leaders \u2013 ought to be challenged to formulate and test their own ideas.   What is a \u201cProject for Peace\u201d?   Some of the most compelling projects to date have reflected one or more of the following characteristics:     Diplomacy or otherwise contribute to advancing peace processes underway   Promoting economic opportunity and entrepreneurship among those in post-conflict areas   Finding creative ways to bring people on opposite sides of issues together   Utilizing art, sports, music or other techniques to promote a common humanity   Developing leadership and mediation skills training for those in conflict or post-conflict societies   Starting or leveraging initiatives, organizations (e.g. education, health) or infrastructure projects to build/rebuild community     In general, projects should be building blocks for a sustainable peace. The overall program is intended to be worldwide in scope and impact, but specific projects may be undertaken anywhere, including in the U.S.   Funding   Davis funding per project is limited to $10,000. However, projects with larger budgets are welcome, and we encourage seeking out co-funding from other sources (such as other philanthropists, a college or university, foundation, NGO/PVO or students\u2019 own fundraising).   Eligibility   Undergraduate students are eligible to submit proposals. Groups of students from the same campus, as well as individual students, may submit proposals.

The program is dedicated to training future leaders, endowing them with the skills and experience to advance reconciliation and coexistence for future generations.   The academic objective of Paths to Peace is to focus on the historical, political, cultural, and religious relationships between Israelis and Palestinians. All students in the program will be required to take two mandatory courses, together with NYU students, one on Israel and one on Palestine. They will also participate in two weekly workshops to be held on two separate days and to be conducted by experienced Palestinian and Israeli facilitators. Workshop participants will engage in an in-depth process of exploration, observation and analysis of the conflict and will have the opportunity to gain important insights into their identities as well as the dynamics of groups in conflict.   Students will be allowed to select up to two additional courses based on their own academic interests. These courses should be selected from the University's undergraduate college of Arts and Science or American Language Institute (if further English language training is required based on your level at the start of the program).   Program participants will attend off-campus excursions, such as visits to the UN Headquarters, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, and a weekend in Washington, DC. Each student is expected and required to participate fully in the program and to attend all classes and activities comprising the program. In the event that the University determines, in its sole discretion, that a student has failed to meet the required standard of participation, the student will be subject to immediate dismissal from the program and will be required to return to his/her country of origin.   Questions about the program? Email paths.to.peace@nyu.edu .                       Applications to participate in Paths to Peace for either fall 2015 semester or spring 2016 semester are currently being accepted. Fall 2015 semester is from August 25 \u2013 December 23, 2015. Spring semester is from January 19 \u2013 May 17, 2016. Successful candidates are required to arrive on time for the start of the program and return home at the end of their semester at NYU. You are eligible to apply if you:   * have lived most of your life in Israel, Gaza Palestinian Territories or West Bank Palestinian Territories.   *are currently registered full time and are in good academic standing at the bachelor\u2019s/undergraduate level at an accredited college or university in Israel or Palestine AND you anticipate completion of studies in 2017 or after.   *you were born on or between the following dates: September 2, 1990 \u2013 September 1, 1996. This means that you are not younger than 19 years and not older than 24 years as of September 1, 2015.   Successful applicants will receive a scholarship to cover tuition, room and board, health insurance, books, travel, and a small living stipend for the academic semester. Additionally, successful applicants we identify as needing to improve their English language skills will be able to attend supplementary language courses prior to departing for New York.   The application deadline is Friday, February 13, 2015. Your application will not be considered unless it is complete.   Applicants from Israel should contact Dr. Keynan at irit.keynan@nyu.edu with further questions or to request an application form.

Davis Projects for Peace proposals are submitted by students, and will be implemented in upcoming summer to promote peace and address the root causes of conflict among parties. Applicants are encouraged to design projects that employ innovative techniques for engaging their target population, focusing on conflict resolution, reconciliation, building understanding and breaking down barriers, and maintaining peace. Through a competition on over 90 campuses, projects will be selected for funding at $10,000 each.              About Davis Projects For Peace   Davis Projects for Peace is funded by Kathryn W. Davis, a lifelong internationalist and philanthropist. Mrs. Davis has committed $1 million to fund these numerous $10,000 projects for peace. She believes that today\u2019s youth \u2013 tomorrow\u2019s leaders \u2013 ought to be challenged to formulate and test their own ideas.   What is a \u201cProject for Peace\u201d?   Some of the most compelling projects to date have reflected one or more of the following characteristics:     Diplomacy or otherwise contribute to advancing peace processes underway   Promoting economic opportunity and entrepreneurship among those in post-conflict areas   Finding creative ways to bring people on opposite sides of issues together   Utilizing art, sports, music or other techniques to promote a common humanity   Developing leadership and mediation skills training for those in conflict or post-conflict societies   Starting or leveraging initiatives, organizations (e.g. education, health) or infrastructure projects to build/rebuild community     In general, projects should be building blocks for a sustainable peace. The overall program is intended to be worldwide in scope and impact, but specific projects may be undertaken anywhere, including in the U.S.   Funding   Davis funding per project is limited to $10,000. However, projects with larger budgets are welcome, and we encourage seeking out co-funding from other sources (such as other philanthropists, a college or university, foundation, NGO/PVO or students\u2019 own fundraising).   Eligibility   Undergraduate students are eligible to submit proposals. Groups of students from the same campus, as well as individual students, may submit proposals.

The program is dedicated to training future leaders, endowing them with the skills and experience to advance reconciliation and coexistence for future generations.   The academic objective of Paths to Peace is to focus on the historical, political, cultural, and religious relationships between Israelis and Palestinians. All students in the program will be required to take two mandatory courses, together with NYU students, one on Israel and one on Palestine. They will also participate in two weekly workshops to be held on two separate days and to be conducted by experienced Palestinian and Israeli facilitators. Workshop participants will engage in an in-depth process of exploration, observation and analysis of the conflict and will have the opportunity to gain important insights into their identities as well as the dynamics of groups in conflict.   Students will be allowed to select up to two additional courses based on their own academic interests. These courses should be selected from the University's undergraduate college of Arts and Science or American Language Institute (if further English language training is required based on your level at the start of the program).   Program participants will attend off-campus excursions, such as visits to the UN Headquarters, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, and a weekend in Washington, DC. Each student is expected and required to participate fully in the program and to attend all classes and activities comprising the program. In the event that the University determines, in its sole discretion, that a student has failed to meet the required standard of participation, the student will be subject to immediate dismissal from the program and will be required to return to his/her country of origin.

The program is dedicated to training future leaders and endowing them with the skills and experience necessary to advance reconciliation and coexistence for future generations.   Students admitted into the program are provided tuition, housing and living expenses for one term of study at NYU. During their tenure they are enrolled in an academic course of the history of Israel and Palestine, as well as a workshop that focuses on the historical, political, cultural, and religious relationships amongst the heritage nations of the students represented in the program, and issues relating to conflict resolution, righting historical wrongs, and different models of coexistence. Program participants also participate in off-campus retreats and other excursions that expose them to educational and cultural opportunities in and around New York City related to the focus of the program. Participants are also given the opportunity to enroll in additional courses related to their own degree or research interests.
