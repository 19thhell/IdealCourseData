Focuses on fundamental theoretical and methodological issues pertaining to the academic study of religion. Exposes students to, and familiarizes them with, some of the more important theories of the origin, character, and function of religion as a human phenomenon. Students are given an opportunity to encounter and test an assortment of the main scholarly approaches to understanding and interpreting religious phenomena, including psychological, sociological, anthropological, historical, and hermeneutical perspectives. Advanced Seminar: Comparative Topics in the Study of Religion RELST-UA 15 Prerequisites: junior or senior status, Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion (RELST-UA 1), and at least two other religious studies courses, or permission of the instructor. Offered in the spring. 4 points. Complements and develops the methodological and theoretical emphasis encountered in Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion, albeit with a higher level of specificity and sophistication. The focus is on a specific thematic motif with cross-cultural applicability (for example, ritual, the body, sacrifice, religion and the state). Students can explore the import of the motif in question for their own area of specialization, as well as examine its manifestations in other traditions. Students are expected to make formal presentations to the class. What Is Islam? RELST-UA 85 Identical to MEIS-UA 691, HIST-UA 85. Offered yearly. 4 points. An introductory course dealing with the life of the Prophet Muhammad and the origins of Islam; the beliefs and practices of the Islamic community; differences between Sunni and Shi\u2019ite Islam; Sufism; the spiritual, intellectual, and artistic life of the Islamic commonwealth; and modern Islamic revival. Gender, Sexuality, and the Body in Early Christianity RELST-UA 86 Offered periodically. Becker. 4 points. Students reexamine the light shed by ancient writings (and other evidence) not only on the role(s) of women in ancient Christian groups but also on the ideologies of gender promoted or assumed by those groups. The focus, while predominantly on women, also extends to the way in which gender identities were constructed and adhered to by males and females. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam RELST-UA 102 Identical to MEDI-UA 25, MEIS-UA 800, HBRJD-UA 160. Offered yearly. 4 points. This course seeks to uncover the differences and similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as religious traditions, and to assess their roles and interactions in the formation and functions of human societies. We will examine the ancient origins and contemporary relevance of these monotheistic traditions through the methodological and theoretical frameworks of the academic discipline of religious studies to gain an understanding of their connections to culture, society, and politics. We will root our study in consideration of ancient and medieval sources of each religion, while simultaneously reflecting upon the significance of their development for modern societies. We will emphasize the immense variety of expression found among Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Indeed, our study will uncover the existence of Judaisms, Christianities, and Islams, rather than a trio of theological monoliths. Such variation will be placed in tension with the strong similarities\u2014family resemblances\u2014shared among these religions.

Introduction to the New Testament RELST-UA 302 Identical to CLASS-UA 293, HBRJD-UA 22. Becker. 4 points. Introduces students to issues and themes in the history of the Jesus movement and early Christianity through a survey of the main texts of the canonical New Testament, as well as other important early Christian documents. Students are given the opportunity to read most of the New Testament text in a lecture hall setting where the professor provides historical context and focuses on significant issues, describes modern scholarly methodologies, and places the empirical material within the larger framework of ancient history and the theoretical study of religion. Religions of India RELST-UA 337 Offered yearly. 4 points. Introduces students to the vibrant religious traditions of South Asia. Examines Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, Jain, and Sikh traditions, as well as the ancient and modern contexts in which they are situated. Students focus on the ways that various problems (material, intellectual, political) have served as catalysts for the formation and dissolution of communities of interpretation and practice and reexamine the multiple pasts of South Asia without projecting modern categories onto those traditions. Belief and Social Life in China RELST-UA 351 Identical to ANTH-UA 351, EAST-UA 351. Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points . The Chinese word for religion means \u201cteaching.\u201d \u201cTeaching\u201d immediately implies at least two people, and belief in China has always been theorized and practiced as mediated by the presence of others, miraculous and mundane. The course explores what Chinese people \u201ctaught\u201d themselves about the person, society, and the natural world and thus how social life was constructed and maintained. It examines in historical perspective the classic texts of the Taoist and Confucian canon and their synthesis; and Buddhism and the synthesis of the \u201cThree Teachings.\u201d We will introduce modern religious life in Taiwan and in the People\u2019s Republic. Classical Mythology RELST-UA 404 Identical to CLASS-UA 404. Meineche. 4 points. See description under Classics in this Bulletin. Jewish Responses to Modernity: Religion and Nationalism RELST-UA 470 Identical to HBRJD-UA 719. 4 points. See description under Hebrew and Judaic Studies in this Bulletin. Confessional Culture from Augustine to Oprah RELST-UA 561 Offered every other year. Pellegrini. 4 points. Traces the different uses and forms \u201cthe confession\u201d has taken in Western culture. How has the confession evolved from a specifically religious practice to become a genre of self-making in a putatively secular modernity? A consistent concern is the way confessional practices have increasingly become linked to sex and sexuality. The range of texts and genres surveyed includes philosophical and religious treatises, political pamphlets, legal history of confession, psychoanalytic case studies, feminist consciousness-raising, coming-out stories, self-help literature, tell-all celebrity autobiographies, TV talk shows, YouTube, and film/video. What can we learn from the differences and similarities between these confessional modes, their cultural locations, their historical moments, and their ideological effects?

Jews and Christians in the Ancient World RELST-UA 611 Identical to CLASS-UA 611, HBRJD-UA 128. Offered periodically. Becker. 4 points. Students acquire a basic knowledge of the early history of Judaism and Christianity. However, on the theoretical level, the course aims to provide students with a forum for asking some of the questions most relevant to religious studies: Are we to use self-definition, typology, or both in our formulating religious categories? How do certain categories help and hinder our understanding of religious and other social phenomena? What is the relationship between ideology and the social world? How do we learn about the \u201creal\u201d world from literary evidence? Religion, State, and Politics RELST-UA 613 Offered periodically. 4 points. Introduces students to the debate on secularism by following a comparative approach. Students first gain basic knowledge related to the emergence and development of the secularization paradigm. In a second step, they confront it with empirical data. Concretely, this course introduces different examples of state-religion relationships and discusses the impact of the respective historical experiences and religio-cultural backgrounds on them. This agenda serves to develop a critical overview on the scope and limits of secularization theory and provides students with basic tools to situate current debates on religion in a broader theoretical frame. Religious Bodies RELST-UA 642 Identical to ANTH-UA 29. No prerequisites. Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Human physicality is something that we share in our \u201cnatures,\" yet constantly elaborate differently in our \u201ccultures.\" This course explores some of the rich and often conflicted relationships between cultures of religious practices and the human body: the body as medium both for ritual and religious experience; the body as locus for virtue and sin; the split between mind and body. We look at the body in various situations\u2014gendered, sexualized, covered, naked, suffering, disabled, altered, missing\u2014and interrogate notions of representations and ideals\u2014from the religious ban on representing the human body to divine anthropomorphism. This course examines a variety of religions and practices. Religion and Media RELST-UA 645 Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Introduces the long-standing and complex connection between religious practices and various media. Analyzes how human hearing, vision, and the performing body have been used historically to express and maintain religious life through music, voice, images, words, and rituals. Attention is then devoted to more recent electronic media such as radio, film, television, video, and the Internet. An anthropological/historical perspective on studying religion is pursued. Prior course work in religious studies, anthropology, or media studies would be helpful, but it is not necessary if you are willing to work hard. Religion, Sexuality, and Public Life RELST-UA 646 Offered periodically. Pellegrini. 4 points. This country was founded on the promise of religious freedom, and yet U.S. laws and policies regulating sexual life derive much of their rationale from specifically religious notions of \u201cgood\u201d versus \u201cbad\u201d sex, what bodies are \u201cfor,\u201d and what kinds of human relationships are valuable. How are we to understand this apparent contradiction? If sexual life is a special case, what makes it so? Finally, what are the implications, for both sexual and religious freedom, of treating sexual life as a special case? Course materials are designed to introduce students to critical approaches to the study of religion in society, as well as to familiarize them with important work in the interdisciplinary areas of gender and sexuality studies.

This course in the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \u201cIslamic society\u201d is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. The emphasis in the premodern period is first on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search for religious identity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic societies in the words of their own writings."}]}]
