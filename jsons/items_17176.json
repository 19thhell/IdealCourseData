Students will work collaboratively on a current environmental problem. Tasks will include characterizing the problem, analyzing possible solutions and publicly presenting the results. Capstones are small, intensive seminars. Space is not guaranteed every semester, therefore seniors are encouraged to enroll before their final semester if possible.    Aims of the Capstone Seminar   The aim is to improve students\u2019 ability to synthesize and integrate material from a range of disciplines; to deploy diverse methodologies and vocabularies in a problem-solving context; to bring theoretical knowledge and skills to bear on practical problems; to work in teams with other students; and to communicate results to a variety of audiences.    Capstone Description The syllabus will vary depending on the problem that is addressed in a particular section of the course. Examples of problems that could be addressed in the Capstone include green roofs for NYU buildings, a transportation plan for mid-town Manhattan, an energy plan for stabilizing global or national greenhouse gas emissions, or a plan for disposing of New York City garbage. Students will work together to define the problem, and explore and evaluate solutions. They will also address such fundamental questions as how to characterize and frame a problem and how to evaluate solutions. They will explore various dimensions of a problem, from technical considerations to issues of social justice. Each capstone will work as a single, problem-solving team under the leadership of an adjunct-practitioner. Students may work individually or collaboratively as part of the team. Capstones will meet weekly, and much of the work may be done outside of class in interviewing stakeholders, analyzing data, visiting sites, and so on. The first several weeks will provide an overview of the semester\u2019s research topic. Students will then start their collaborative research projects. Experts may be brought in to brief the seminar on particular aspects of the problem under discussion. The Environmental Studies Program Director will supervise the capstones in order to ensure their academic integrity and to guarantee that the workload and expectations are uniform across sections. There will be regular sharing of research and critical feedback from peers, faculty and practitioners. At the end of the term, the research projects will be presented to students, ES faculty and interested members of the NYU community.                     Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 0100 formerly V36.0100)    Overview    A comprehensive survey of critical issues in environmental systems science, focusing on: human population; the global chemical cycles; ecosystems and biodiversity; endangered species and wildlife; nature preserves; energy flows in nature; agriculture and the environment; energy systems from fossil fuels to renewable forms; Earth\u2019s waters; Earth\u2019s atmosphere; carbon dioxide and global warming; urban environments; wastes; and paths to a sustainable future. This course is a gateway to the Environmental Studies major and minor, and one of its core courses. It will cover a very significant amount of demanding material, in order to prepare students for upper-level courses. This course will be challenging, and students should expect a steep learning curve. Teaching Assistants will be available to help students along the way.    Aims of the Course    This course will serve as one of the two required introductory core courses for students entering the major or minor in Environmental Studies. It will provide students with a comprehensive survey of major topics in environmental systems science, from the structure and dynamics of the natural environment to human impacts upon the environment of living things, air, water, and soils. This course will serve as the main technical introduction for students in the Environmental Studies major who are taking the Environmental Science Track, so instructors of the subsequent, more specialized courses in the Environmental Science Track can assume that students have the background of a general environmental science course. For students who are taking the Environmental Values and Society Track in the Environmental Studies major, this course will serve as the main source of technical understanding, so it must be broad enough to provide a foundation for their further work in their track.         Syllabus                   Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 0101 formerly V36.0101)    Overview    A systematic survey of central concepts and issues relating to environment and society including environmental history and concepts of nature and the environment; the rise of environmentalism; environmental skepticism; anthropogenic global change; population and consumption, ecological footprint analysis and other environmental indicators; environmental justice; public goods and collective action problems; regulatory regimes; environmental politics; environmental movements; environmental values; environmental protest and disobedience; and the future of environmentalism. This course is a gateway to the Environmental Studies major and minor, and one of its core courses. It will cover a very significant amount of demanding material, in order to prepare students for upper-level courses. This course will be challenging, and students should expect a steep learning curve. Teaching Assistants will be available to help students along the way.    Aims of the Course    This course will serve as one of the two required core courses for students entering the NYU major (or minor) in Environmental Studies. It will provide students with a systematic survey of central issues concerning environment and society, and an introduction to some central concepts. This course will serve as the main technical introduction for students in the Environmental Studies major who are taking the society concentration, so instructors of the subsequent, more specialized courses in the can assume that students have the background of a general environment and society course. For students who are taking the \u201cscience track\u201d in the Environmental Studies major, this course will serve as the main source of understanding environment and society issues, so it must be broad enough to provide a foundation for their further work as well.   Syllabus                  Environmental Studies Internship (ENVST-UA 0800 formerly V36.0800)    Overview    The internship, taken either semester during the junior year, will prepare students for their professional lives by providing them with experience in environment-related organizations such as non-profits, research institutes and governmental organizations. At the beginning of the internship, students and the internship advisor will agree to a learning contract that establishes specific goals as well as a schedule for achieving them. Interns will meet collectively during the semester to share their experiences and to present brief reports. Please visit our Internship Page for lists of internships and scholarships.  Environmental Studies Honors Seminar (ENVST-UA 0950 formerly V36.0950)        Overview An advanced course for Environmental Studies majors pursuing honors. Students will pursue independent, high-level research projects, and 'workshop' them in the seminar under the supervision of a core faculty member.

Students will work collaboratively on a current environmental problem. Tasks will include characterizing the problem, analyzing possible solutions and publicly presenting the results. Capstones are small, intensive seminars. Space is not guaranteed every semester, therefore seniors are encouraged to enroll before their final semester if possible.    Aims of the Capstone Seminar   The aim is to improve students\u2019 ability to synthesize and integrate material from a range of disciplines; to deploy diverse methodologies and vocabularies in a problem-solving context; to bring theoretical knowledge and skills to bear on practical problems; to work in teams with other students; and to communicate results to a variety of audiences.    Capstone Description The syllabus will vary depending on the problem that is addressed in a particular section of the course. Examples of problems that could be addressed in the Capstone include green roofs for NYU buildings, a transportation plan for mid-town Manhattan, an energy plan for stabilizing global or national greenhouse gas emissions, or a plan for disposing of New York City garbage. Students will work together to define the problem, and explore and evaluate solutions. They will also address such fundamental questions as how to characterize and frame a problem and how to evaluate solutions. They will explore various dimensions of a problem, from technical considerations to issues of social justice. Each capstone will work as a single, problem-solving team under the leadership of an adjunct-practitioner. Students may work individually or collaboratively as part of the team. Capstones will meet weekly, and much of the work may be done outside of class in interviewing stakeholders, analyzing data, visiting sites, and so on. The first several weeks will provide an overview of the semester\u2019s research topic. Students will then start their collaborative research projects. Experts may be brought in to brief the seminar on particular aspects of the problem under discussion. The Environmental Studies Program Director will supervise the capstones in order to ensure their academic integrity and to guarantee that the workload and expectations are uniform across sections. There will be regular sharing of research and critical feedback from peers, faculty and practitioners. At the end of the term, the research projects will be presented to students, ES faculty and interested members of the NYU community.

Ethics and the Environment   ENVST-UA 400 Identical to PHIL-UA 53. Offered in the fall. Jamieson. 4 points.   Environmental philosophy is a large subject that involves questions in metaphysics, the philosophy of science, and the history of philosophy, as well as in such normative areas as ethics, aesthetics, and political philosophy. This course is primarily devoted to these normative areas. Beginning with some basic concepts in value theory, the goal is not to arrive at definite solutions to specific environmental problems, but rather to improve students' ability to think critically, read closely, and argue well about environmental issues. The course also introduces students to some major controversies in environmental philosophy. The ultimate aim is to aid students in arriving at their own rational, clear-minded views about the matters under discussion. Climate Change and Environmental Justice ENVST-UA 405 Identical to SCA-UA 632. Ross. 4 points. Introduces students to the basic approaches to climate change, through readings from climatologists, economists, anthropologists, geographers, cultural analysts, and activists of various stripes. Consideration is given to the \u201cdebate\u201d about climate change that has been generated by deniers and advocates for the fossil fuel industries. The context for discussing the natural and social impact of global warming is further defined by examining the principles of climate justice. Modeled on the American-derived principles of environmental justice in the 1990s, the climate justice movement poses a legal and humanitarian challenge to champions of \u201cnatural capitalism\u201d who place their faith in market-driven solutions. Students look at how populations are unevenly affected by climate change, and how this imbalance is being addressed by a range of advocates of decarbonization. Economics and the Environment   ENVST-UA 410 Offered in the spring. Damon. 4 points.   Students study how the earth's scarce resources are allocated by individuals and society, and how economic tools can contribute toward solutions to environmental challenges. Broad concepts considered include market failure; sustainability; valuation of social benefits provided by the environment; estimating social costs and benefits of alternate environmental policies; determining desirable levels of pollution control and choosing policies to achieve it; and managing natural resources, both renewable (e.g., forests, fisheries, and water) and nonrenewable (e.g., oil and minerals). The course format consists of lectures, discussions, and group projects. Cooperation &amp; the Commons. ENVST-UA 412 Prerequisite: Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100). 4 points. Why do littered environments encourage people to litter more? Why do people who see they are using less energy than average often start using more? Why was the global ban on ozone-harming CFCs successful, while the Kyoto Protocol to curb greenhouse gas emissions a failure? This course examines the tragedy of the commons, with particular emphasis on environmental problems, as well as the various means to cooperate and overcome the tragedy, with particular emphasis on research into human behavior. The first half of the course focuses on theory and makes students familiar with some of the foundational literature in cooperation research while the second half focuses on applied research, as well as how to change social norms. To better understand behavioral phenomena and answer how humans share and consume resources, we will review some of the latest studies in evolutionary biology, experimental economics, and psychology. We will also turn to evolutionary biology for insights into the intricacies and origins of cooperation.    Environmental History of the Early Modern World   ENVST-UA 415 Identical to HIST-UA 115. Appuhn. 4 points.   From the perspective of environmental history, the early modern period (ca. 1500\u20131800) marks a moment of sudden and unprecedented global transformation. Rising core populations created increasing demand for food and natural resources, which in turn led to major alterations to the landscape as states and individuals sought to derive greater benefits from nature. This course analyzes the ways in which this process unfolded in different parts of the world, while familiarizing students with basic problems in environmental history, including the changing human relationship to the natural world, the relationship between environmental change and human societies, and the importance of biotic exchange in world history. The course is divided into two parts. In the first part, we consider what can be called the \"Eurasian Advantage\" or \"Biological Conquest Model\" made popular by Jared Diamond. In the second part, we consider parallel developments in other parts of the world that cast doubt on this account.    Environmental History of New York City   ENVST-UA 420 Identical to HIST-UA 275. Needham. 4 points.   This course investigates topics in the environmental history of New York City from the 17th century to the present. Environmental history is a relatively new field of history that attempts to take nature and natural forces seriously as key components of historical change. Through readings, site visits, and writing assignments, the course introduces students to the field of environmental history and investigates the history of our immediate environment. As a history-department workshop, the course also introduces students to the key elements of the discipline of history: finding and reading articles, conducting research, and evaluating primary and secondary sources.    History of Ecology and Environmentalism   ENVST-UA 425 Offered in the fall. Anker. 4 points.   Students trace the history of ecology and environmentalism back to natural history collected in the 18th century. The global history of ecological concern stays at the center of this course, which discusses environmental worries in the British, German, Scandinavian, African, and American contexts in subsequent centuries. The chief focus is on more recent U.S. experience in trying to deal with pollution, asthma, and global warming, among other issues. Various ecological understandings of human philosophy, race, gender, fear, religion, sociology, and economy are subject to critical discussion. Readings include texts by scientists such as Carolus Linnaeus, Arthur Tansley, and Julian Huxley, as well as social and philosophical writings of authors such as H. G. Wells, John Muir, Jan Smuts, and Arne Naess.    Education and the Environment   ENVST-UA 430 Offered in the spring. Schlottmann. 4 points.   This course (1) discusses major topics and schools of thought in environmental education, (2) analyzes the ethical, practical, and conceptual implications of this, and (3) assesses these various approaches for clarity and practicality. Students address four primary questions: What forms does environmental education take? What values inform environmental education? What might an ethically defensible, effective form of environmental education look like? How much do concepts and arguments matter in better understanding and implementing environmental education? The course aims to advance our integrative and practical thinking about complex and multifaceted environmental topics, as well as to understand environmental values as they relate to education.    Food, Animals, and the Environment   ENVST-UA 440 Identical to ANST-UA 440. Offered in the spring. Schlottmann, Sebo. 4 points.   Students study human interaction with both food and animals, as well as the environmental impacts and ethical issues that arise from such interaction. Focus is on the moral standing of animals, animals as food, and the environmental impacts of agriculture, transportation, and consumption. The course also surveys major thinkers in the field, including Michael Pollan, Peter Singer, Jim Mason, Wendell Berry, David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Martha Nussbaum. Students engage in collaborative research projects, and we hope to schedule field trips to local agricultural sites.    Topics in Environmental Values and Society   ENVST-UA 450 (or ENVST-UA 9450 at NYU Prague, Shanghai, and Sydney) Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101) or permission of the instructor. Offered every semester. Anker, Damon, Rademacher, Sachs, Schlottmann. 4 points.   An intermediate course for students in the major or minor in environmental studies in the environmental values and society track. The aim of the course is to advance understanding of a specific topic concerning the social aspects of environmental problems. Familiarity with social aspects of environmental problems is assumed. Topics include Thinking Globally, Acting Locally; Economics and the Environment; History of Ecology and Environmentalism; Environmental Education; and Food and Animals.    European Environmental Policy   ENVST-UA 460 (or ENVST-UA 9460 at NYU Berlin) Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101). Offered in the fall at Washington Square; offered every semester at NYU Berlin. Wazeck. 4 points.   This course offers an introduction to European environmental policy. The European Union (EU) is often seen as a leader in environmental policy, and it is a major player in international environmental policy making. But how does the EU, a unique economic and political union of 27 states, actually make and implement environmental policy? In this course, we explore these questions by focusing on different aspects of European environmental policy. The first part provides a historic overview of the emergence and development of European environmental policy and law. Who are the central actors? Which institutions are involved in policy making? What are the basic regulation principles? The second part concentrates on the EU policy-making process, and on the implementation of environmental policy in the Member States. A third part deepens these aspects by discussing case studies such as the regulation of chemicals, waste management, air pollution, and GMO. A fourth part concentrates on challenges for European environmental policy and sets it into an international context: How to cope with the enlargement of the EU? What is EU Climate Change policy, and how does the European Emissions Trading System work?    Climate and Society   ENVST-UA 470 Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101). Recommended: Climate Change (ENVST-UA 226). Offered in the fall. Schlottmann. 4 points.   An intermediate environmental studies elective about how societies understand and respond to climate change. We analyze the values, assumptions, and perceptions that contribute to our understanding of climate change. The main topics are: ethics, justice and responsibility; definitions of nature; cost-benefit analysis and the precautionary principle; geo-engineering; contrarianism; framing and communication; social engagement; and education. Central questions include: Is climate change a technical or social problem? What makes climate change uniquely challenging to understand and respond to? Which ethical and perceptual frameworks are best suited for both understanding and responding to climate change? Who is responsible, and what moral implications does this have? What assumptions about values, behavior, economics, and nature do we make when discussing climate change? How does climate change challenge our conceptions of nature, morality, society, and economics? Does climate change pose a special challenge to society, or does it simply amplify existing challenges? Introduction to Urban Political Ecology Theory and Method ENVST-UA 490 Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101). Offered every semester. Rademacher. 4 points. Few aspirations hold the global promise, and political traction, of urban sustainability. While sustainability can be defined and measured through a host of metrics, its actual lived practice often proves somewhat more elusive. This reading intensive seminar explores the gap between aspirations for, and the enactment of, urban sustainability. Drawing from theories, methods, and research techniques associated with political ecology, we consider how contests over environmental knowledge, sociocultural ideology, and discourse shape human engagement with urban nature, and in turn influence social and natural transformation. After laying the theoretical groundwork for political ecological inquiry, the course turns to methodological techniques and research approaches designed to illuminate these dimensions of urban environmental change. Toward the end of the course, each student designs a research proposal that engages an environmental problem using political ecological techniques. Journalism and Society: Covering the Earth (Journalism)   ENVST-UA 503 (or ENVST-UA 9503 at NYU Sydney and NYU Washington, D.C.) Identical to JOUR-UA 503. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. Fagin. 4 points.   As Web-based platforms increasingly dominate mass media, what specific forms should the \"new\" environmental journalism take? This course traces the development of traditional environmental journalism from John Muir to John McPhee and looks closely at how the field is adapting to a fast-changing media landscape. With the help of guests and timely readings, we confront thorny questions about environmental advocacy, citizen media, issue framing, risk balancing, and the scientific process. We produce stories that matter on the biggest news beat of all. This advanced seminar includes intensive journalistic writing assignments, as well as extensive readings for in-class discussion.    Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Ecocriticism   ENVST-UA 510 (or ENVST-UA 9510 at NYU Sydney) Identical to ENGL-UA 735. Chaudhuri. 4 points.   An introduction to the emerging field of ecocriticism and an exploration of some of its main questions, issues, methods, and texts. We trace the origins and development of key tropes of ecological thought\u2014such as wilderness, pastoralism, pollution, and catastrophe\u2014in literary and cultural texts ranging from the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh to the Hollywood eco-blockbuster Avatar. We apply the lenses of environment and species to classics like Euripides' The Bacchae, Shakespeare's The Tempest, and Thoreau's Walden, as well as to works that exemplify new conjunctions between ecological thought and contemporary discourses on globalization, environmental justice, and queer theory, such as novels like Animal's People by Indra Sinha and Lives of the Animals by J. M. Coetzee, and films like Brokeback Mountain and The Yes Men Fix the World.    Animals and Society   ENVST-UA 610 Identical to ANST-UA 200 and SOC-UA 970. Jerolmack. 4 points.   Analyzes the ways that animal and human lives intersect. Specifically, this course examines how relationships with animals both reflect and shape social life, culture, and how people think about themselves. We explore the myriad and contradictory positions that animals occupy in society (e.g., as pets, pests, mascots, and food) and deconstruct the social origins of these seemingly natural categories. (After all, one society's pet is another society's dinner.) We also take a grounded look at what actually happens when humans and animals interact, which sheds new light on the nature of human and animal consciousness and troubles some of the assumptions we make about the necessary role of language and symbols in interaction. Fundamentally, students learn how the roles that animals take on in our lives, and the ways that we think about and relate to them, are inherently social processes that are patterned by geography, culture, class, gender, and so on. Central questions include: How do ideas about, and relationships to, animals vary across time and space? What roles do science, literature, and media representations play in shaping how we think about animals? How and why did pets become honorary members of the American family? Why are some animals, but not others, granted moral status and legal protection in society? How do humans and animals coordinate interaction without language?    Animals and Public Policy   ENVST-UA 630 Identical to ANST-UA 500. No prerequisites. Offered in the fall. 4 points.   Provides an overview of public policy with respect to the somewhat contradictory treatment of animals by humans, with a focus on how public policy is created and how social change occurs. We consider what public policy consists of and what actors and factors play a role in the creation of public policy; how society views animals; the capacities of animals; how ethics relates to animal treatment; how animals are currently utilized by our society; and political and other efforts to improve or alter the current treatment of animals, including the influence of science, government, business, and nongovernmental organizations in defining and influencing animal-related policies. We focus on legislation, litigation, regulation, and ballot initiative and consumer campaigns and their effectiveness, as well as other strategies that relate to improving animal welfare. We also discuss the meaning of \"animal rights\" and the success and impact of the modern animal protection movement.
