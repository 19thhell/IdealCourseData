Student Rush and SRO Policies   Student rush and standing room only (SRO) tickets are a great way so get a deep discount on Broadway show tickets on the day of the performance you wish to see!   To make tickets more affordable to students and other theatergoers on a budget, many Broadway shows have implemented rush and standing room only (SRO) policies. Anyone willing to get up and get to the box office early, spend some time in a line, or stand during the show, can get greatly discounted tickets to most shows on Broadway. For up-to-date information on broadway and off-broadway rush policies, visit www.playbill.com.          Rush/Lottery tickets: Rush tickets are usually for students only, so be prepared to flash your NYU ID! In most cases, scoring rush tickets means waiting on line at a specified time at the theatre's box office for an opportunity to purchase discount ticktets. Beware that usually the line for rush tickets can form much, much earlier than the time that the box office puts them on sale. In other cases, the box office conducts a lottery in order to determine who will have the opportunity to purchase tickets. You don't need to arrive early to the box office in such cases - you just need a little luck.              Standing Room Only tickets: Standing room patrons stand in numbered spaces that are the width of a regular seat. They are usually located at the back of the orchestra. SRO tickets are trickier to get because they are only available if the show is sold out. There\u2019s no definite way to predict in advance whether a performance will sell out, without actually calling the box office a few hours before curtain time. Shows that sell out often include Wicked, The Book of Mormon, The Lion King, and Jersey Boys. Also, it is likely that any show will sell out very early in its run. Unless otherwise specified, one SRO ticket is sold per person.            Here are a few of the sites our staff use to check student rush and SRO policies at Broadway theatres:   \u00bb Playbill   \u00bb Broadway for Broke People   \u00bb Broadway Spotted              CollegeTix   New York University has joined CollegeTix at Telecharge.com!   NYU Ticket Central has partnered with Telecharge.com to give students exclusive access to specially priced Broadway and off-Broadway tickets! These discounted student tickets are available online and can be ordered in advance of the performance. No more waiting in long rush lines outside the box office!   These tickets are for NYU students only . Students are required to present one valid student ID per ticket at the theater's box office; tickets must be picked up at the theater's box office beginning a half hour before show time.   Important: NYU IDs that are not student IDs ( for example: Fac/Staff/Admin IDs, Alumni IDs, Family IDs, etc. ) will not be honored for this offer. Student tickets will not be released to anyone without NYU student ID. Anyone attempting to pick up student tickets without presenting one NYU student ID per ticket will be charged the regular price or the tickets will not be released.   For a complete list of currently participating shows, visit our Steals and Deals page.          How to order:     Log into your NYUHome Account ( http://home.nyu.edu)   Click on the \u201cNYU Life\u201d tab on the upper right-hand part of the page. The Ticket Central channel will appear somewhere on the \u201cNYU Life\u201d page. (Scroll down the page if you don\u2019t see it at first.)

Remember, each person you purchase a ticket for must have an NYU student ID!   If you have any questions about this offer, please call NYU Ticket Central at 212-998-4941.              TKTS Ticket Booths   Like student rush and standing room only policies , the TKTS\u2122 ticket booths are a resource you can use to purchase discount tickets on the day of the performance you want to see. (There are some exceptions for weekend matinees.)   Established in 1973 for the betterment of theatres and theatregoers alike, TKTS sells unsold tickets on the day of performance for many Broadway shows for 25-50% off the box office price plus a $3.00 service charge per ticket.   For example, if the price of a ticket for an orchestra seat to Aladdin is normally $95.00, the price at the ticket booth might be 50% off - or $47.50 - plus a $3 service charge.   The main TKTS booth is located in Father Duffy Square, on West 47th Street between Broadway and 7th Avenue. The electronic signs in front display what shows are available for that day.        Times Square TKTS:         For same-day evening performances Monday, Wednesday - Saturday: 3pm - 8pm  Tuesday: 2pm - 8pm  Sundays: 3pm until one-half hour before the latest curtain time being sold.  For same-day matinee performances Wednesdays and Saturdays: 10am - 2pm  (Please note: no evening tickets are sold from 10am to 2 pm at Times Square)  Sundays: 11am - 3pm      Tip: Get there early! Lines can get long very quickly - especially during good weather and the holiday season!   Satellite locations: There are 2 additional TKTS locations, one in lower Manhattan at the South Street Seaport, and one in Downtown Brooklyn at Metrotech Center.        South Street Seaport TKTS:   Location: South Street Seaport at the corner of Front and John Streets (the rear of the Resnick/Prudential Building at 199 Water Street)         For same-day evening and next day matinee performances Monday - Saturday: 11am - 6pm  Sunday: CLOSED  Matinee tickets are only sold on the day before   the performance at TKTS Seaport      *You must buy matinee tickets the day before at the Seaport branch. For example, Wednesday matinees are sold Tuesdays.        Downtown Brooklyn TKTS:     Location: 1 Metrotech Center at the corner of Jay Street &amp; Myrtle Street Promenade         For same-day evening and next day matinee performances Tuesday - Saturday: 11am - 6pm  (Closed for lunch 3pm-3:30pm)    Matinee tickets are sold on the day before  the performance at TKTS Downtown Brooklyn.           **You must buy Wednesday and Saturday matinee tickets the day before at the Downtown Brooklyn branch. For example, Wednesday matinees are sold on Tuesdays. Sunday matinee performances and Saturday/Sunday evening performances are not available at this location.             Tip: As both TKTS booths draw from the same pool of tickets, consider using the downtown location which usually draws less if a crowd!         TKTS Time Square accepts cash, travelers checks and TKTS Gift Certificates. TKTS Seaport&amp;nbsp; and TKTS Downtown Brooklyn accept credit cards, cash, travelers checks or TKTS Gift Certificates.

Student Rush and SRO Policies   Student rush and standing room only (SRO) tickets are a great way so get a deep discount on Broadway show tickets on the day of the performance you wish to see!   To make tickets more affordable to students and other theatergoers on a budget, many Broadway shows have implemented rush and standing room only (SRO) policies. Anyone willing to get up and get to the box office early, spend some time in a line, or stand during the show, can get greatly discounted tickets to most shows on Broadway. For up-to-date information on broadway and off-broadway rush policies, visit www.playbill.com.          Rush/Lottery tickets: Rush tickets are usually for students only, so be prepared to flash your NYU ID! In most cases, scoring rush tickets means waiting on line at a specified time at the theatre's box office for an opportunity to purchase discount ticktets. Beware that usually the line for rush tickets can form much, much earlier than the time that the box office puts them on sale. In other cases, the box office conducts a lottery in order to determine who will have the opportunity to purchase tickets. You don't need to arrive early to the box office in such cases - you just need a little luck.              Standing Room Only tickets: Standing room patrons stand in numbered spaces that are the width of a regular seat. They are usually located at the back of the orchestra. SRO tickets are trickier to get because they are only available if the show is sold out. There\u2019s no definite way to predict in advance whether a performance will sell out, without actually calling the box office a few hours before curtain time. Shows that sell out often include Wicked, The Book of Mormon, The Lion King, and Jersey Boys. Also, it is likely that any show will sell out very early in its run. Unless otherwise specified, one SRO ticket is sold per person.            Here are a few of the sites our staff use to check student rush and SRO policies at Broadway theatres:   \u00bb Playbill   \u00bb Broadway for Broke People   \u00bb Broadway Spotted              CollegeTix   New York University has joined CollegeTix at Telecharge.com!   NYU Ticket Central has partnered with Telecharge.com to give students exclusive access to specially priced Broadway and off-Broadway tickets! These discounted student tickets are available online and can be ordered in advance of the performance. No more waiting in long rush lines outside the box office!   These tickets are for NYU students only . Students are required to present one valid student ID per ticket at the theater's box office; tickets must be picked up at the theater's box office beginning a half hour before show time.   Important: NYU IDs that are not student IDs ( for example: Fac/Staff/Admin IDs, Alumni IDs, Family IDs, etc. ) will not be honored for this offer. Student tickets will not be released to anyone without NYU student ID. Anyone attempting to pick up student tickets without presenting one NYU student ID per ticket will be charged the regular price or the tickets will not be released.   For a complete list of currently participating shows, visit our Steals and Deals page.          How to order:     Log into your NYUHome Account ( http://home.nyu.edu)   Click on the \u201cNYU Life\u201d tab on the upper right-hand part of the page. The Ticket Central channel will appear somewhere on the \u201cNYU Life\u201d page. (Scroll down the page if you don\u2019t see it at first.)   In the &quot;Ticket Central&quot; section, click on the link to CollegeTix . This will open a pop-up window that will let you browse the offers and purchase tickets.     Remember, each person you purchase a ticket for must have an NYU student ID!   If you have any questions about this offer, please call NYU Ticket Central at 212-998-4941.              TKTS Ticket Booths   Like student rush and standing room only policies , the TKTS\u2122 ticket booths are a resource you can use to purchase discount tickets on the day of the performance you want to see. (There are some exceptions for weekend matinees.)   Established in 1973 for the betterment of theatres and theatregoers alike, TKTS sells unsold tickets on the day of performance for many Broadway shows for 25-50% off the box office price plus a $3.00 service charge per ticket.   For example, if the price of a ticket for an orchestra seat to Aladdin is normally $95.00, the price at the ticket booth might be 50% off - or $47.50 - plus a $3 service charge.   The main TKTS booth is located in Father Duffy Square, on West 47th Street between Broadway and 7th Avenue. The electronic signs in front display what shows are available for that day.        Times Square TKTS:         For same-day evening performances Monday, Wednesday - Saturday: 3pm - 8pm  Tuesday: 2pm - 8pm  Sundays: 3pm until one-half hour before the latest curtain time being sold.  For same-day matinee performances Wednesdays and Saturdays: 10am - 2pm  (Please note: no evening tickets are sold from 10am to 2 pm at Times Square)  Sundays: 11am - 3pm      Tip: Get there early! Lines can get long very quickly - especially during good weather and the holiday season!   Satellite locations: There are 2 additional TKTS locations, one in lower Manhattan at the South Street Seaport, and one in Downtown Brooklyn at Metrotech Center.        South Street Seaport TKTS:   Location: South Street Seaport at the corner of Front and John Streets (the rear of the Resnick/Prudential Building at 199 Water Street)         For same-day evening and next day matinee performances Monday - Saturday: 11am - 6pm  Sunday: CLOSED  Matinee tickets are only sold on the day before   the performance at TKTS Seaport      *You must buy matinee tickets the day before at the Seaport branch. For example, Wednesday matinees are sold Tuesdays.        Downtown Brooklyn TKTS:     Location: 1 Metrotech Center at the corner of Jay Street &amp; Myrtle Street Promenade         For same-day evening and next day matinee performances Tuesday - Saturday: 11am - 6pm  (Closed for lunch 3pm-3:30pm)    Matinee tickets are sold on the day before  the performance at TKTS Downtown Brooklyn.           **You must buy Wednesday and Saturday matinee tickets the day before at the Downtown Brooklyn branch. For example, Wednesday matinees are sold on Tuesdays. Sunday matinee performances and Saturday/Sunday evening performances are not available at this location.             Tip: As both TKTS booths draw from the same pool of tickets, consider using the downtown location which usually draws less if a crowd!         TKTS Time Square accepts cash, travelers checks and TKTS Gift Certificates. TKTS Seaport&amp;nbsp; and TKTS Downtown Brooklyn accept credit cards, cash, travelers checks or TKTS Gift Certificates.
