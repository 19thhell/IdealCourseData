Sociologists study the ways that social structures and interactions shape human life. We seek to understand the full range of social institutions and practices, from couples and small groups, to social organizations such as businesses and government agencies, to communities, cities, and nations.    Our methods of research are diverse, ranging from the quantitative analysis of large surveys to qualitative approaches such as in-depth interviewing, participant observation, and historical investigation. Indeed, diversity in its subject matter and its methods of research is one of sociology's most distinguishing features. Because sociologists study social interaction in a broad array of contexts, we use whatever method is appropriate for the particular question being posed.    Sociological ideas and methods are used by policy makers, political analysts, and social critics. Many of our concepts have become a part of our common culture and everyday language. Concepts such as \"the self-fulfilling prophecy,\" \"conspicuous consumption,\" \"WASP,\" \"social mobility,\" \"modernization,\" and \"in-groups\" and \"out-groups\" were all originally coined by sociologists.    Similarly, sociologists were studying important topics such as social inequality, race relations, gender discrimination, and sexual diversity long before these became issues of concern among policy makers and in popular culture. Many modern research techniques, such as polling and survey design, were also pioneered by sociologists.    NYU's Department of Sociology reflects the diversity of our discipline. The faculty includes experts in a wide range of subjects, including crime, law, and deviance; sex, gender, and the family; organizations, occupations, and work; immigration; justice; science, politics, social protest, and social policy; power and inequality in modern societies; welfare, culture, and education;and social theory. The faculty also uses a wide variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques in conducting research.    Whether the goal is to become an informed citizen, an expert in the social sciences, or a socially active trailblazer, we offer the tools and knowledge to help students make sense of the world around them. Those planning a professional career or graduate study in sociology or another social science will find a wide range of useful and interesting courses. Students preparing for careers in law, social service, health, public administration, and other professional areas can choose from many relevant substantive courses. Those interested in social research and policy making will benefit from courses that teach practical skills of data gathering and analysis. In all of these courses, we encourage students to study issues from a variety of perspectives.               Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

Sociologists study the ways that social structures and interactions shape human life. We seek to understand the full range of social institutions and practices, from couples and small groups, to social organizations such as businesses and government agencies, to communities, cities, and nations.    Our methods of research are diverse, ranging from the quantitative analysis of large surveys to qualitative approaches such as in-depth interviewing, participant observation, and historical investigation. Indeed, diversity in its subject matter and its methods of research is one of sociology's most distinguishing features. Because sociologists study social interaction in a broad array of contexts, we use whatever method is appropriate for the particular question being posed.    Sociological ideas and methods are used by policy makers, political analysts, and social critics. Many of our concepts have become a part of our common culture and everyday language. Concepts such as \"the self-fulfilling prophecy,\" \"conspicuous consumption,\" \"WASP,\" \"social mobility,\" \"modernization,\" and \"in-groups\" and \"out-groups\" were all originally coined by sociologists.    Similarly, sociologists were studying important topics such as social inequality, race relations, gender discrimination, and sexual diversity long before these became issues of concern among policy makers and in popular culture. Many modern research techniques, such as polling and survey design, were also pioneered by sociologists.    NYU's Department of Sociology reflects the diversity of our discipline. The faculty includes experts in a wide range of subjects, including crime, law, and deviance; sex, gender, and the family; organizations, occupations, and work; immigration; justice; science, politics, social protest, and social policy; power and inequality in modern societies; welfare, culture, and education;and social theory. The faculty also uses a wide variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques in conducting research.    Whether the goal is to become an informed citizen, an expert in the social sciences, or a socially active trailblazer, we offer the tools and knowledge to help students make sense of the world around them. Those planning a professional career or graduate study in sociology or another social science will find a wide range of useful and interesting courses. Students preparing for careers in law, social service, health, public administration, and other professional areas can choose from many relevant substantive courses. Those interested in social research and policy making will benefit from courses that teach practical skills of data gathering and analysis. In all of these courses, we encourage students to study issues from a variety of perspectives.

Global public health/sociology graduates may go on to a diverse array of  careers in law, health, public administration, and social service, as well as  further graduate study in sociology, public health, or other related  disciplines.          This  major requires fifteen 4-point courses (60 points) with a grade of C or better,  as follows. Global  public health requirements (seven courses/28 points):    Health and Society in a Global Context (UGPH-GU 10)   Biostatistics for Public Health (UGPH-GU 20)   Epidemiology for Global Health (UGPH-GU 30)   Health Policy in a Global World (UGPH-GU 40)   Environmental Health in a Global World (UGPH-GU 50)   Undergraduate Global Public Health Internship (UGPH-GU 60)   One foreign language course past the intermediate two level (4 points) Sociology requirements (four courses/16 points): Introduction to Sociology (SOC-UA 1) Sociological Theory (SOC-UA 111)   Research Methods (SOC-UA 301) Advanced Seminar in Sociology (SOC-UA 934) Sociology electives (two courses/8 points), to be chosen from:   Sex and Gender (SOC-UA 21) Race and Ethnicity (SOC-UA 135) Wealth, Power, Status: Inequality in Society (SOC-UA 137) Social Policy in Modern Societies (SOC-UA 313) Sociology of Medicine (SOC-UA 414) The Family (SOC-UA 451) Immigration (SOC-UA 452) Cities, Communities, and Urban Life (SOC-UA 460) Combined major electives (two courses/8 points):   Two courses chosen from sociology and/or GPH, by advisement.

Honors  Program      Students  with at least a 3.65 GPA both overall and in the major (or who have permission  of the director of undergraduate studies) may elect to participate in our  honors program.          In  the fall of their senior year, all honors students register for the first term  of the Senior Honors Research Seminar (SOC-UA 950), in which they develop and  structure their research projects. The faculty member teaching the course  assists the students in finding substantive and methodological advisers among  the faculty.          Students  complete their thesis in the spring semester of senior year. They register for  the second term of the Senior Honors Research Seminar (SOC-UA 951) and work  under the supervision of their selected adviser.          One  semester of the Honors Research Seminar sequence may substitute for one of the  two advanced seminars required for the major.      Honors  students are also encouraged to take graduate courses when appropriate. These  courses should stimulate and deepen understanding of sociology and enhance the  quality of the final thesis. This should be done in consultation with their  advisers.          Advanced  Social Research Methods Honors Program    Students  in this specialized honors program take a graduate methods or statistics course  in place of one elective course.          Social  Theory Honors Program    Students  in this specialized honors program take a graduate social theory course in  place of one elective course.
