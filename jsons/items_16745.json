As students will only live around Washington Square their first year, a branch that has multiple locations in the city will be the most convenient in the long run. Also, a bank in the student's hometown and in New York City allows even more convenience for parents to make deposits and assist with transactions when the student returns home during the summer and holidays.   That being said, most of the major national bank chains in the city have a number of branches and ATM lobbies throughout the city. Almost all offer free checking to students with an NYU ID Card or Admissions Acceptance Letter.        For branch and ATM locations, please click on the following bank links and enter either an address or zip code. NYU buildings are located primarily within the 10012 and 10003 zip codes:     NYU Federal Credit Union   Apple Bank for Savings   Bank of America   CapitalOne   Citibank   Chase   HSBC   Santander Bank   TD Bank     PNC Bank   Valley National Bank   Wells Fargo     You can also do a Google search of businesses by bank name or zip code for banks within a certain area.
