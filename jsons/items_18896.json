An intensive year-long course in writing for film, television, and theatre. The basic principles of dramatic construction are taught in the lecture and analysis session, and are related to the student\u2019s own work in recitations, to presentations at the First-Year Colloquium, and in one-on-one tutorials with the instructor.    All students are required as part of their 6 points to register for 2 recitations: one is the recitation associated with your Craft section, the other is the First-Year Colloquium, which is also required of all first year students.    Presentation is a commonality for all artists and an absolute necessity for the emerging dramatist. In this colloquium each student presents work to the entire first year class using student performers. Students will learn to be constructive and specific in critique sessions, employing analytical skills in conjunction with moral support for their fellow writers.
