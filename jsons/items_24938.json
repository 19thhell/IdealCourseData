Please follow this guide to submit your request. Inclusion of a valid chartfield in the request will help ensure that you are ready to use the core once the request is granted. If no chartfield is included you will have to work with your Principal Investigator, Department Administrator, or Laboratory Manager to set up a billing project.   Principal Investigators, their proxies and department administrators can use this guide to set up a billing project.   Please see the guides below if you need to genereate a Kerberos ID or need to access LIMS from off-campus.   Don't Have a Kerberos ID?   A Kerberos ID is a special form of NYULMC identification and is required to access several NYULMC services, including our online scheduling system and its registration process. If you do not have a Kerberos ID, we will provide one for you. Just email us , providing your complete name and birth date, and a member of our staff will submit a Kerberos ID request on your behalf. The entire process takes about 1-2 weeks, so please plan accordingly.   Accesing from Off-Campus? Create a Quick Link!   The LIMS Scheduler is only accessible from within the NYUMC network. Once you have your Kerberos ID, you can add a favorite on\u00a0 atNYULMC using this guide \u00a0 to easily access our online scheduling system from anywhere.   Additional Questions??
