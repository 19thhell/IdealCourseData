However, confirmation emails will not be emailed prior to the first deadline of October 15th. The email confirmation will contain your password to access the Application Status Check Website . This website is available 24 hours a day. It indicates the current status of your application and any missing application requirements. Any additional information submitted may take up to ten business days after we receive it to be reflected on the Application Status Check Website.    To protect your privacy, we do not release the status of your application or decisions via email, telephone or fax. You must use the Application Status Check Website.    After reviewing your complete application, the Committee will provide you with an initial notification.            Initial Notification  If your application was complete by the deadline, you will receive an initial notification no later than the initial notification date for that deadline. View application deadlines and notification dates .    You will be emailed when your status has changed on the Application Status Check Website . We do not release initial notifications via telephone, fax or mail.    Initial notification possibilities are as follows:     Interview invitation    Waitlist offer    Denial of admission    The admissions interview plays an important role in ensuring that the Stern community is comprised of exceptional individuals. Therefore, an offer of admission is never made prior to the interview invitation.    Please note that you may be placed on the waitlist or denied admission without being interviewed.            Interviews and Post-Interview Decision   Interviews  After reviewing your application, the Committee may invite you to interview. If invited to interview, you will receive the invitation and scheduling information via email. Interviews are available by invitation only .    Interviews are conducted in person in New York City. If invited to interview, you should plan on traveling to New York City to interview as part of our application process. Interviews are typically conducted by our trained admissions professionals, who will have thoroughly read your entire application. When interviewing on campus, we encourage you to use your visit to learn more about Stern by attending a tour and information session, visiting a class and meeting current students.     All applicants invited to interview are required to bring an official transcript from each school attended to the interview . Please view our official transcript requirements before your interview.    Admissions Tips:     Ideally, your interview will not be the first time you have visited or met us prior to applying. We recommend visiting us in New York or meeting us at one of our admissions events around the world . If this is not possible, it is helpful to utilize all of the online resources found in the Meet With Us section of our website (videos, podcasts, virtual campus tour, etc.) and to contact a current student .    Because we have a rolling notification process, you should request your official transcript(s), translations and/or degree conferral(s) early in the application process, before you are invited to interview.      Off-Site Interviews  If you are invited to interview but are not able to come to Stern, you may consider one of our off-site interview locations. For priority consideration for off-site interviews, apply by November 15. We typically conduct off-site interviews in China, India and the United Kingdom in March, but the locations and timing are subject to change each year.    Candidates participating in off-site interviews are not at a disadvantage to those interviewing at Stern. However, if timing is an important consideration, you may be able to interview sooner in New York City.   Alumni/Phone Interview Requests  Alumni or phone interview requests are almost never granted and should be requested only under extreme circumstances. We expect you to interview in person in New York City with the Admissions Committee or at one of our designated off-site interview locations.     Post-Interview Decision  If you receive an interview invitation, it is important to note the amount of time it will take for the Admissions Committee to provide a final decision. Upon receiving the interview invitation, you must first schedule the interview. After the interview, it will typically take up to three weeks to receive a post-interview decision. Also note that the Admissions Committee will not make a final decision until your official transcript(s) and any other requested materials have been received and verified.     Not bringing your official transcript(s) to the interview will result in a delayed decision.    Once the Admissions Committee has issued your decision, you will receive an email indicating your status has changed. You can review your new status on the Application Status Check Website. There are three possible post-interview decisions:     Offer of admission    Waitlist offer    Denial of admission      Offer of Admission  If offered admission, you will view an online admission letter on our Application Status Check Website . We will also mail you a formal letter of admission, which contains your deposit deadline and other important information. If you have been awarded any scholarships, that information will be part of your mailed letter. In addition, you will be given access to our Admitted Student Website.     Waitlist Offer  In our admissions process, you may be placed on the waitlist without being interviewed and/or after being interviewed. If you are placed on the waitlist, you will receive additional information about the waitlist process at that time.     All decisions made by the Admissions Committee are final.

However, confirmation emails will not be emailed prior to the first deadline of October 15th. The email confirmation will contain your password to access the Application Status Check Website . This website is available 24 hours a day. It indicates the current status of your application and any missing application requirements. Any additional information submitted may take up to ten business days after we receive it to be reflected on the Application Status Check Website.    To protect your privacy, we do not release the status of your application or decisions via email, telephone or fax. You must use the Application Status Check Website.    After reviewing your complete application, the Committee will provide you with an initial notification.            Initial Notification  If your application was complete by the deadline, you will receive an initial notification no later than the initial notification date for that deadline. View application deadlines and notification dates .    You will be emailed when your status has changed on the Application Status Check Website . We do not release initial notifications via telephone, fax or mail.    Initial notification possibilities are as follows:     Interview invitation    Waitlist offer    Denial of admission    The admissions interview plays an important role in ensuring that the Stern community is comprised of exceptional individuals. Therefore, an offer of admission is never made prior to the interview invitation.    Please note that you may be placed on the waitlist or denied admission without being interviewed.            Interviews and Post-Interview Decision   Interviews  After reviewing your application, the Committee may invite you to interview. If invited to interview, you will receive the invitation and scheduling information via email. Interviews are available by invitation only .    Interviews are conducted in person in New York City. If invited to interview, you should plan on traveling to New York City to interview as part of our application process. Interviews are typically conducted by our trained admissions professionals, who will have thoroughly read your entire application. When interviewing on campus, we encourage you to use your visit to learn more about Stern by attending a tour and information session, visiting a class and meeting current students.     All applicants invited to interview are required to bring an official transcript from each school attended to the interview . Please view our official transcript requirements before your interview.    Admissions Tips:     Ideally, your interview will not be the first time you have visited or met us prior to applying. We recommend visiting us in New York or meeting us at one of our admissions events around the world . If this is not possible, it is helpful to utilize all of the online resources found in the Meet With Us section of our website (videos, podcasts, virtual campus tour, etc.) and to contact a current student .    Because we have a rolling notification process, you should request your official transcript(s), translations and/or degree conferral(s) early in the application process, before you are invited to interview.      Off-Site Interviews  If you are invited to interview but are not able to come to Stern, you may consider one of our off-site interview locations. For priority consideration for off-site interviews, apply by November 15. We typically conduct off-site interviews in China, India and the United Kingdom in March, but the locations and timing are subject to change each year.    Candidates participating in off-site interviews are not at a disadvantage to those interviewing at Stern. However, if timing is an important consideration, you may be able to interview sooner in New York City.   Alumni/Phone Interview Requests  Alumni or phone interview requests are almost never granted and should be requested only under extreme circumstances. We expect you to interview in person in New York City with the Admissions Committee or at one of our designated off-site interview locations.     Post-Interview Decision  If you receive an interview invitation, it is important to note the amount of time it will take for the Admissions Committee to provide a final decision. Upon receiving the interview invitation, you must first schedule the interview. After the interview, it will typically take up to three weeks to receive a post-interview decision. Also note that the Admissions Committee will not make a final decision until your official transcript(s) and any other requested materials have been received and verified.     Not bringing your official transcript(s) to the interview will result in a delayed decision.    Once the Admissions Committee has issued your decision, you will receive an email indicating your status has changed. You can review your new status on the Application Status Check Website. There are three possible post-interview decisions:     Offer of admission    Waitlist offer    Denial of admission      Offer of Admission  If offered admission, you will view an online admission letter on our Application Status Check Website . We will also mail you a formal letter of admission, which contains your deposit deadline and other important information. If you have been awarded any scholarships, that information will be part of your mailed letter. In addition, you will be given access to our Admitted Student Website.     Waitlist Offer  In our admissions process, you may be placed on the waitlist without being interviewed and/or after being interviewed. If you are placed on the waitlist, you will receive additional information about the waitlist process at that time.     All decisions made by the Admissions Committee are final.
