However, the Hip-Hop we see today is not the same Hip-Hop that we saw when early pioneers formed a distinct sub-culture (encompassing MCing, Beatboxing, DJing, bboying, and graffiti) to speak to the experiences of disenfranchised youth across the world. Commercialization has created two kinds of Hip-Hop: one is focused on the community and connected to a long legacy and history of Black/Caribbean experience, and a second focused on individualism and celebrating instant gratification, funded by big corporations to sell brands and consumption as a lifestyle. What determining factors caused this evolution and what does it mean? This course traces Hip-Hop\u2019s history and its influences through participatory action research, media literacy, and service learning. Students will learn to analyze, interpret, chronicle, and sample Hip-Hop. In collaboration with The Schomburg Center\u2019s Hip-Hop 4.0 Initiative (Education, Creativity, Community, and Legacy), and other institutions/organizations in the New York area (such as the Hip-Hop Education Center, Graffiti Hall of Fame), students will have access to Hip-Hop repositories, lectures, panel discussions, film screenings, and guest speakers. Students will also work on the first major exhibition celebrating Hip-Hop's 40th anniversary at the Schomburg Center.
