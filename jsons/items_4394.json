The educational and human interchanges that ensue are grounded in academic freedom and mutual respect. Members of the academic community are encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and sustained personal independence and are required to engage in responsible social conduct that reflects credit upon the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering community and to model good citizenship in any community. Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are crucial aspects of the academic process. Freedom to learn depends upon appropriate opportunities and conditions in the classroom, on campus, and in the greater academic community. The Institute has developed procedures and policies to safeguard this freedom and to maintain an environment conducive to the learning process. The purpose of publishing disciplinary regulations is to give notice of prohibited behavior. Any behavior that threatens the academic environment, threatens the learning process and the Institute community. Therefore, the Institute exercises its right to discipline and commits its policies and procedures, in the form of the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering Code of Conduct, to the protection and promotion of the academic enterprise. Students who have been found responsible for violating this Code, or who otherwise pose a substantial danger to the Institute community, may be suspended or expelled. Although, this Code is not written with the specificity of a criminal statute, it is binding upon the Institute community. Students may be accountable to both civil authorities and to the Institute for acts that constitute violations of law and of this Code. Disciplinary action at the Institute will not be subject to challenge on the ground that criminal charges involving the same incident have been dismissed or reduced. Students are asked to assume positions of responsibility in the Institute judicial system in order that they might contribute insights and develop skills in the resolution of disciplinary cases. NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering believes that the procedures, policies, and safeguards described herein are indispensable to maintaining an academic environment appropriate to teaching, learning, and development.     1.

Return to top of page                     EXPOS-UA 15 A Spectrum of Essays           Credits: 4 Instructor: Stephen Donatelli Prequisite: Portfolio review           Guises of the Self: History, Literature, Practice&quot;           Subjectivity evolves. Variously known as the I, the self, the persona (performed or feigned) or the identity we make or somehow possess, subjectivity as a subject suits writing because it is never fixed. Concern for the self is not, however, a self-centered pursuit. It has served as a medium through which readers and writers have been able to live deeply as historical agents and spiritual beings. Respect for self has flourished since antiquity. The ancients thought self-knowledge was fundamental to everything else, and conscientiousness is understood today as a cornerstone of citizenship. In this seminar we will acquaint ourselves with some landmark texts in the history of the mutable I, observing many artful variations made by key writers in the tradition of reflective autobiography. We will learn how to read these predecessors by moving with their rhythms or by accompanying them in cinematic time. Readings and visual materials have been chosen to be fun, challenging and various. They provide a selective foundation for what might be called the tradition of the individual person as he or she comes to self-awareness. Our readings serve as occasions for written imitation, reflection and improvisation. We will also rely on them as touchstones for our own writing practice.           While readings and films about the self often operate through closeness and disclosure, the best of them are also philosophical and scientific, thereby supporting our balanced objective of working reflectively and working interpretively. Our writing projects will span a variety of positions between a greater self beyond our own selfs mere self (what the poet Paul Valry once called some self miraculously superior to Myself ), and a more distanced assessment of selected, constructed selves from history and literary history.           Some of our readings are already known to us faintly, thanks to the diligent passivity of our cultural subconscious: Augustines Confessions, the first book of Prousts multi-volume oeuvre , Swanns Way ; Nella Larsens slender masterpiece from the Harlem Renaissance period, Passing; literary innovations by modern masters such as Luigi Pirandello, J.L. Borges, Natalia Ginzburg, and John Barth; and thoughtful analyses of performed and counterfeited selves by Judith Butler and R.D. Laing. Beguiling cinematic visions of erased, unreal, elusive, split, vague and plural selves come to us through Bernardo Bertolucci, Ingmar Bergman and Luis Buuel and in Stan Brakhages cinematic adventures into our inner, psychic life.

EXPOS-UA 15 A Spectrum of Essays: Reconceiving Artfulness and its Risks           Credits: 4 Instructor: Bruce Bromley, EWP Prequisite: Portfolio review           At the height of her fame as a mind that reimagines what essays and novels can do, Virginia Woolf presses her fellow makers and readers to consider that every moment is the centre and meeting place of an extraordinary number of perceptions which have not yet been expressed, showing us how life is always and inevitably much richer than we who try to express it. Like Woolf and her contemporaries, we belong to a world where feelings which used to come simple and separate do so no longer, where beauty is part ugliness; amusement part disgust; pleasure part pain. Emotions which used to enter the mind whole are now broken up on the threshold. These claims mean that we need to reconceive the very notion of threshold, along with the forms by which makers, in the disciplines available to us, structure the experience of living in relation to any boundary. How we ponder artfulness, Woolf implies, requires expansion, as so many influences which play . . . a large part in life have thus far escaped the novelist and her colleaguesamong them,the power of music, the stimulus of light, the effect on us of the shape of trees or the play of colour. To re-see the shapes whereby we express our contact with life will blur the boundaries between customarily separate art forms, Woolf implies, and involve us in the risks inherent in any attempt to make over, to make again, to make anew. What can the risks in play here teach us? At the service of contemplating that question, we will read work by Jennifer Egan, Rainer Maria Rilke, W.G. Sebald, and Woolf herself. We will listen to music that rethinks what sound, ordered into patterns, can make manifest. We will watch films by Pedro Almodvar, Fran&#1195;ois Ozon, Grant Gee, and Fran&#1195;ois Girard. And we will work at crafting essays that honor our attempts to amplify what shaped thinking can communicate. By November 8, 2014, please email Bruce Bromley at bdb2@nyu.edu to inquire how to submit what you think of as your finest essay, which will function as your portfolio review. Notice of selection will occur within eight days of your first contact.

The educational and human interchanges that ensue are grounded in academic freedom and mutual respect. Members of the academic community are encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and sustained personal independence and are required to engage in responsible social conduct that reflects credit upon the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering community and to model good citizenship in any community. Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are crucial aspects of the academic process. Freedom to learn depends upon appropriate opportunities and conditions in the classroom, on campus, and in the greater academic community. The Institute has developed procedures and policies to safeguard this freedom and to maintain an environment conducive to the learning process. The purpose of publishing disciplinary regulations is to give notice of prohibited behavior. Any behavior that threatens the academic environment, threatens the learning process and the Institute community. Therefore, the Institute exercises its right to discipline and commits its policies and procedures, in the form of the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering Code of Conduct, to the protection and promotion of the academic enterprise. Students who have been found responsible for violating this Code, or who otherwise pose a substantial danger to the Institute community, may be suspended or expelled. Although, this Code is not written with the specificity of a criminal statute, it is binding upon the Institute community. Students may be accountable to both civil authorities and to the Institute for acts that constitute violations of law and of this Code. Disciplinary action at the Institute will not be subject to challenge on the ground that criminal charges involving the same incident have been dismissed or reduced. Students are asked to assume positions of responsibility in the Institute judicial system in order that they might contribute insights and develop skills in the resolution of disciplinary cases. NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering believes that the procedures, policies, and safeguards described herein are indispensable to maintaining an academic environment appropriate to teaching, learning, and development.     1.

Variously known as the I, the self, the persona (performed or feigned) or the identity we make or somehow possess, subjectivity as a subject suits writing because it is never fixed. Concern for the self is not, however, a self-centered pursuit. It has served as a medium through which readers and writers have been able to live deeply as historical agents and spiritual beings. Respect for self has flourished since antiquity. The ancients thought self-knowledge was fundamental to everything else, and conscientiousness is understood today as a cornerstone of citizenship. In this seminar we will acquaint ourselves with some landmark texts in the history of the mutable I, observing many artful variations made by key writers in the tradition of reflective autobiography. We will learn how to read these predecessors by moving with their rhythms or by accompanying them in cinematic time. Readings and visual materials have been chosen to be fun, challenging and various. They provide a selective foundation for what might be called the tradition of the individual person as he or she comes to self-awareness. Our readings serve as occasions for written imitation, reflection and improvisation. We will also rely on them as touchstones for our own writing practice.           While readings and films about the self often operate through closeness and disclosure, the best of them are also philosophical and scientific, thereby supporting our balanced objective of working reflectively and working interpretively. Our writing projects will span a variety of positions between a greater self beyond our own selfs mere self (what the poet Paul Valry once called some self miraculously superior to Myself ), and a more distanced assessment of selected, constructed selves from history and literary history.           Some of our readings are already known to us faintly, thanks to the diligent passivity of our cultural subconscious: Augustines Confessions, the first book of Prousts multi-volume oeuvre , Swanns Way ; Nella Larsens slender masterpiece from the Harlem Renaissance period, Passing; literary innovations by modern masters such as Luigi Pirandello, J.L. Borges, Natalia Ginzburg, and John Barth; and thoughtful analyses of performed and counterfeited selves by Judith Butler and R.D. Laing. Beguiling cinematic visions of erased, unreal, elusive, split, vague and plural selves come to us through Bernardo Bertolucci, Ingmar Bergman and Luis Buuel and in Stan Brakhages cinematic adventures into our inner, psychic life.

And we will work at crafting essays that honor our attempts to amplify what shaped thinking can communicate. By November 8, 2014, please email Bruce Bromley at bdb2@nyu.edu to inquire how to submit what you think of as your finest essay, which will function as your portfolio review. Notice of selection will occur within eight days of your first contact.
