The   intensive and rigorous training received in studio is contextualized   within and enriched by a knowledge of the theatre as an art and an   institution, with a history, a literature, and a vital role in culture.    Also, because we recognize that even the most talented actors and   designers face formidable challenges in this exceptionally competitive   profession, we prepare students to pursue other career choices within   the field, including graduate study in fields such as theatre history,   dramatic literature, and performance studies. The theatre studies   curriculum consists of two required introductory courses, Introduction   to Theatre Studies and Introduction to Theatre Production, followed by a   minimum of five theatre studies courses in such areas as dramatic   literature, theatre theory, performance studies. Required Introductory Courses: Intro to Theatre Studies (ITS) for   (4 pts) and Intro to Theatre Production (ITP) for (4 pts). Transfer   students are not required to take ITP but must make up the credits with   another theatre studies class. Must also take 20 points (5 courses) of Advanced Theatre Studies   (B/C). At least 8 of those points (2 courses) must be Group C. The   classes will be labeled (B/C) every semester in the Department of Drama   course listings. Declared double majors are allowed to waive 4 pts of advanced theatre studies B credit.   The Honors Program In Theatre Studies The Honors Program in Theatre Studies consists of two Honors Seminars and one Honors Thesis.   More  Minor in Applied Theatre The Minor in Applied Theatre reflects the growing recognition among professionals in a range of fields that theatrical techniques and practices have wide and vital applications in fields outside of the theatre as traditionally conceived, including education, medicine, therapy, political activism, community work, and social services.
