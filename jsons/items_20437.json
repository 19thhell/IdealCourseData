Tonal actualization. Pitch sensing. \u00a0Resonance exchange. \u00a0Sympathetic vibration.   In a recent conversation I learned an interesting distinction between western and indian singing techniques. European opera and most western vocal technique involves singing from the diaphragm with a vertical concentration of air movement. \u00a0Indian vocal practices emphasize the lateral movement of the chest and lungs &#8211; a horizontal concentration of air movement. The difference between directing breath across your length versus your width. \u00a0The expansion of the chest would be an interesting thing to incorporate into the visualization with a tension sensor.   In addition to vibration throughout the body, what else can we learn about the body from a real-time visualization:: posture / air movement / muscle tension in the face, throat, chest, and abdomen / facial contortion / the expansion of the chest / the vibration of the vocal chords (phonation). \u00a0What are the complexities involved in the physical act of singing and how does it relate to the cognitive influence of pitch, melody, and modes? \u00a0And how does the time-space of sound in music influence the mind?     ~         +++T o p i c s       Flow   Beauty   Vibration   Concentration   Vividness   Happiness   Ecstasy   Polarity   Equanimity   Wellness   Meditation   Vedic Health   Vibrational Healing   The Intention of Song   The Sound of the Body   The Physiology of Speech and Hearing   Sympathetic Vibration   Nadis and The Subtle Body   Listening with Your Body   Speech Pathology   Phonation   Touch   Entelechy and Energeia   The Philosophy of Mind   Dualism   Hinduism   Buddhism   Toaism         +++C o n s i d e r a t i o n s   // What is energy?   // What is happiness?   // Who is the rest of you?   // What parts of the body do we listen with besides the sound input of our ears?   // What energies are activated through the practice of concentration?   // What are the effective energies of wellness?     + \u00a0neuro chemistry: the effects of the bodies natural healing hormones: endorphins, adrenaline, norepinepherine, seratonin, dopamine, oxytosin, neuro-peptides.\u00a0 How these have effects on the immune system, T cells, the brain, calm and happiness.   + \u00a0how laughter and smiling effect the production of these hormones and healing energy   + \u00a0empathy, compassion, giving, volunteering all change energy   + \u00a0power, chi, chakras, subtle bodies, meridians, reiki, energy work   + \u00a0meditation, focused concentration, changing alpha, beta, delta waves   + \u00a0the power of touch   + \u00a0intuition, psychic vibrations   + \u00a0positive affirmations, reframing, acknowledgement, active listening   + \u00a0sound, music and the effect on energy, mood, healing   + \u00a0kirtan chanting         +++A p p l i c a t i o n s       the transmission of vibration from a vocalists body to another body.   the amplification of vibration in a vocalist&#8217;s own body as a biofeedback mechanism.   the prepared voice:: pluralization from a singular action.       +++S e n s o r s \u00a0&amp; \u00a0M o t o r s       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectric_sensor   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentric_(mechanism)       /\\/\\/\\/                                                                     Leave a Reply Cancel Reply            You must be logged in to post a comment.                                   &laquo; Why I fear&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; the dots?
