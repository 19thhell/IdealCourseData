Sanes    Development and plasticity of the auditory CNS      Despite enormous advances in our understanding of growth and formation of the nervous system, we know little about the function of developing networks or the computations they perform. Sensory and motor processing continue to mature long after the mammalian brain looks adult-like, and the environment can exert a powerful influence during this time. Perhaps the most devastating example of this effect occurs when early hearing loss disrupts central auditory processing skills and language acquisition.      Our lab studies the development of central auditory processing, and its relationship to the emergence of mature behavioral performance in normal and deafened animals.       Inhibitory Synaptic Plasticity During Development     Much of our cellular research has concentrated on the development and plasticity of inhibitory synapses. For historical reasons, the vast majority of work in neuroscience has considered the development of excitatory connections, such as those that activate muscles or those carry information from the retina to the forebrain. However, inhibitory synapses are essential to every computation performed by the central nervous system, and their dysfunction is increasingly tied to developmental disorders such as autism or learning disabilities.     Thus, our lab has found that inhibitory projections in the auditory brain stem become more precise   during development - like excitatory systems - and this process is influenced by normal hearing. If the activity of inhibitory connections does influence their stability during development, then there must be a mechanism to control their gain. We have identified one such development mechanism that controls the strength of immature inhibitory synapses, and which may support the refinement of these contacts in response to the auditory experience. As it turns out, GABA signaling is crucial for synaptic plasticity: a specific GABA B receptor antagonist blocks inhibitory long-term depression. Furthermore, the induction and maintenance of inhibitory depression occurs postsynaptically: direct application of GABA, but not glycine, to the LSO neuron is sufficient to produce depression.          Early Hearing Loss Disrupts Inhibitory Synapse Function  When it became clear that inhibitory synapse function is influenced by the auditory environment, we were motivated to explore the implications for hearing loss. In fact, childhood hearing loss creates a major impediment to the acquisition of speech, language, reading and most learning that depends on aural communication. For decades these deficits were attributed solely to the limitations imposed by a damaged cochlea. However, our lab and others have shown that hearing loss leads to rapid, systematic changes in the strength of nearly all synaptic connections in the central auditory nervous system.      In general, we find that early hearing loss leads to a dramatic decrease of inhibitory synaptic strength and an increase in excitatory strength.  This is true for both the auditory midbrain and the auditory cortex. Within 24 hours of hearing loss, inhibitory synapses within the auditory midbrain have become extremely weak, and this is due to a huge depolarization of the inhibitory synaptic reversal potential.   In cortex, FS-evoked IPSCs are are 30% of their normal amplitude and LTS-evoked responses display short-term depression (Takesian et al., 2010). Interestingly, the excitatory synapses are not weakened by deafness, leading to a dramatic imbalance between inhibition and excitation.      Many of these synaptic changes can be observed following a relatively mild hearing loss (in which the cochlea is intact and the animal can hear, albeit with higher thresholds). These synaptic changes can be described as homeostatic in that they increase neuron excitability, thereby resisting the initial challenge. These findings suggest that the deaf central auditory nervous system may operate quite differently when it is activated (for example, by a electrical prosthesis), and draw attention to the importance of considering both peripheral and central factors when trying to explain the perceptual deficits associated with early hearing loss.         Until a few years ago, we would have concluded that the changes in synaptic gain which attend early hearing loss can largely explain many of the known behavioral deficits, including the difficulties with learning. However, we have recently discovered that that the synaptic mechanisms commonly thought to support learning (i.e., long-term potentiation) do not mature properly in the auditory cortex following early hearing loss. This is true for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Kotal et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2010). The general implication is that sensory deficits may lead to learning problems because brain mechanisms that support learning fail to emerge.       Maturation of Auditory Processing and Behavioral Performance  Although the brain slice experiments can tell us much about the cellular mechanisms that support plasticity, they are not able to address how the developing auditory nervous system encodes acoustic cues, or how this processing is perturbed by environmental manipulations. One of the primary stumbling blocks to studies of developmental function has been the use of anesthesia during in vivo recordings. Therefore, we have begun to explore new ways to measure auditory function in developing animals.         In collaboration with Dan Turnbull's laboratory at the Skirball Institute, we have examined the maturation of frequency-specific activity patterns in mouse inferior colliculus using Mn-enhanced MRI. In collaboration with Mal Semple's lab, we have begun to record from single neurons in the inferior colliculus and cortex of awake gerbils. These recordings suggest that the coding of dynamic stimuli, such as sinusoidally amplitude modulated tones, matures over a relatively long postnatal time (Rosen et al., 2010). In collaboration with Jack Kelly, we assess the behavioral performance of developing animals and those reared with early hearing loss. These studies indicate that behavioral performance in juvenile animals is quite immature, and may parallel the maturation of auditory cortex coding properties (Sarro and Sanes, 2010).   Through each of these approaches, we seek to understand the cellular mechanisms that permit synaptic activity to influence the developing nervous system, and how they contribute to the construction of auditory computational circuits.
