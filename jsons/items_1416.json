The adage is most often attributed to Chinese philosopher and general Sun Tzu, but it&rsquo;s been  repeated throughout history by strategists from Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli to &ldquo;godfather&rdquo; Michael  Corleone. And while most understand the logic of keeping tabs on a potential threat, few consider how close we perceive dangers to actually be.  Impressions of the &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; are just what Jay Van Bavel, assistant professor of psychology in  the Graduate School of Arts and  Science, and doctoral candidate Jenny Xiao (GSAS &rsquo;13) set out to explore. Their research, published in June in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin , focused specifically on how far away people imagine their opponents to be compared to their true distance. Van Bavel believes that a better understanding of our biological adaptation to what scares us might play a role in curtailing discrimination and other negative fear  responses. The analysis considered the competition between two  local universities, as well as the debate over immigration. But there may have been no better place to begin a study on perceptions of danger than in the Bronx, looking at one of the fiercest rivalries in sports.         &ldquo;A group that you don&rsquo;t like can seem a lot closer when they&rsquo;re threatening,&rdquo; psychologist Jay Van Bavel says.      Van Bavel and Xiao headed north on the subway in June 2010 to speak with New York Yankees fans as they poured out of the  stadium after a game. At the time, the Bombers sat atop the American League East, while archrivals the Boston Red Sox were one game behind in second, and the Baltimore Orioles wallowed in dead last, 23 games out. That night, a majority of Yankees fans incorrectly guessed that Boston&rsquo;s Fenway Park is closer to Yankee Stadium than Baltimore&rsquo;s Camden Yards. Because the Red Sox were on the Yankees&rsquo; heels in the pennant race, most fans imagined them to be geographically nearer&mdash;even though Fenway is 20 miles farther from River Avenue than Camden Yards. &ldquo;We found that a group that you don&rsquo;t like can seem a lot closer when they&rsquo;re threatening,&rdquo; Van Bavel says.   This flawed perception, Van Bavel adds, may simply be a method of addressing fear. He cites Joseph LeDoux, a professor at NYU&rsquo;s Center for Neural Science, who draws the analogy of walking in the woods and seeing what may be an animal or a twig. &ldquo;The advantageous thing to do is to jump,&rdquo; Van Bavel says. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re wrong and it was just a twig, it only cost you a few  calories. But if you didn&rsquo;t jump and it was a poisonous snake, then you could die.&rdquo;   Continuing the study, the co-authors turned from baseball to a more serious policy debate. They asked more than 300 NYU undergraduates how threatening they believed Mexican immigration was to American identity. Participants who strongly identified with American pride and who felt that Mexican  immigrants were detrimental to the country were more likely to propose that Mexico City is  closer to New York City than it actually is. Another study measured the perceived distance  between NYU and Columbia University, located in northern Manhattan&rsquo;s Morningside Heights. For this survey,  researchers aimed to manipulate the response. They offered some NYU participants articles that focused on positive comparisons of the two schools; in turn, these participants estimated that the distance between the universities was greater than it is. But other NYU participants who read material that presented Columbia as superior&mdash;as an older or more selective institution&mdash;presumed that the two schools were physically closer than in reality. &ldquo;These issues have come up over and over throughout human history,&rdquo; Van Bavel says. &ldquo;There have been forms of discrimination that manifest themselves in putting up barriers and segregating groups to certain water fountains. By understanding how perception plays a role in this, we may understand more about the ways to deal with it.&rdquo;  Van Bavel plans to do more research using this manipulative approach, which foretells that it may be possible to change hostile attitudes or misperceptions toward groups that people view as dangerous. &ldquo;You can heighten a threat by making Columbia seem more [competitive with] NYU,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;or you can remove that threat by making it clear that Columbia and NYU are two world-class universities in the same city.

Their research, which appears in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin , shows how social categorization, collective identification, and identity threat work in concert to shape our representations of the physical world.   \u201cSun Tzu, the Chinese military general, philosopher, and author of what is arguably the most famous book on military strategy, reportedly coined the famous phrase \u2018Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer\u2019,\u201d wrote the study\u2019s co-authors, NYU\u2019s Jenny Xiao, a doctoral candidate, and Jay Van Bavel, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology. \u201cThis phrase, which has been adopted by strategists from Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli to Michael Corleone, reflects the adaptive value of attending very closely to one\u2019s enemies. In the same way, our participants appeared to be doing something quite similar\u2014they reported that their \u2018enemies\u2019 were closer, but only when they posed a potential threat. Our research, then, suggests that we keep our enemies psychologically closer by changing our representation of the physical world, in this case, physical distance.\u201d   Previous scholarship has shown that people categorize themselves on the basis of an individual identity, a collective identity, or both, depending on the social and motivational context\u2014a process known as self-categorization. More specifically, earlier studies have shown that categorical labels make people exaggerate perceived distance between arbitrary categories. For example, people overestimate distance on a map between a domestic and a foreign location, relative to distance between two domestic locations or between two foreign locations. In other words, categorization enlarges estimations of between-group physical distance.   However, it\u2019s not clear these perceptions hold when we see an entity as a threat. The NYU researchers sought to clarify our understanding of perceived distances, but through a different lens: how collective identities and threats to these identities may alter estimates of large-scale physical distances.   In doing so, they drew from existing scholarship in biology.   \u201cBiologists have found that it is usually more adaptive for organisms to respond to potential threats as if they are truly threatening than to fail to respond,\u201d wrote the study\u2019s co-authors. \u201cSo, it\u2019s possible that certain threats to people\u2019s collective identities may trigger similar defensive reactions, such as reducing estimations of physical distance between the in-group and a threatening out-group\u2014what we term the threat hypothesis.\u201d   To test their theory, the researchers interviewed Yankee fans and non-Yankee fans outside of Yankee Stadium on June 18-19, 2010\u2014prior to the start of games against the New York Mets. At the time of the interviews, the Yankees were in first place in the American League East, the Red Sox were in second place (one game behind the Yankees), and the Baltimore Orioles were in last place (23 games behind the Yankees). A series of questions identified participants as either Yankees fans who were threatened by the Red Sox or non-Yankee fans who felt no such threat.   Participants were then asked to estimate the distance from Yankee Stadium both to Fenway Park (actual distance =190 miles) and to the Orioles\u2019 home stadium, Camden Yards (170 miles). Camden Yards was chosen as the control location because it is the home of a non-threatening group in the same division as the Yankees and Red Sox, and is a similar (albeit slightly shorter) distance from Yankee Stadium as Fenway Park. Participants\u2019 distance estimations were assessed by either a written report in miles, or a map measure, in which they saw a map of the northeastern U.S., with a 500-mile-radius circle centered on Yankee Stadium, and then indicated the location of these two stadiums on two maps.   Their results, which also took into account participants\u2019 geographical expertise, supported the researchers\u2019 hypothesis: non-Yankees fans correctly estimated that Fenway Park was marginally farther than Camden Yards; in contrast, Yankees fans estimated that Fenway Park, the home stadium of a threatening group, was marginally closer than Camden Yards, the home stadium of a non-threatening group. Therefore, the relative difference in distance estimations to the two stadiums (Fenway Park and Camden Yards) differed as a function of the perceivers\u2019 baseball identity\u2014being a fan of the Yankees or not.   The researchers also considered whether or not the threat hypothesis could apply in other contexts. Specifically, they examined whether subjective feelings of threat from Mexican immigrants were associated with their distance estimations to Mexico City. Here, they also made distinctions between two types of threats: symbolic threats, which concern threats to the worldviews of an in-group, such as values, beliefs, morals, cultures, and attitudes, and realistic threats, which concern threats to the political and economic power of the in-group, as well as threats to the welfare of its members.   The researchers predicted that the effects of identity threat would be specific to distance estimation to Mexico City, but not to other, non-threatening cities in North America (e.g., Los Angeles and Vancouver). To measure perceived threat, participants were asked to what extent they agreed with statements such as \u201cImmigration from Mexico is undermining American culture\u201d (symbolic threat) and \u201cMexican immigration has increased tax burden on Americans\u201d (realistic threat).   Participants then estimated the distance in a straight line from New York City to Mexico City, Mexico (actual distance =2086 miles), Los Angeles (actual distance =2443 miles), and Vancouver (actual distance =2425 miles). Participants were instructed to estimate these distances by indicating a number between zero and five thousand miles.   As the researchers hypothesized, perceived symbolic threat significantly predicted estimated distance to Mexico City\u2014specifically, greater perceived symbolic threat from Mexican immigration was associated with shorter estimated distance to Mexico City (from New York City). However, contrary to the researchers\u2019 expectations, this was not the case for participants who had perceived realistic threat or for those who perceived Mexican immigrants as a perceived symbolic and realistic threat. This distinction suggested that perceptions of distance to enemies are limited to symbolic threats.
