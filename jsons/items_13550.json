Gilbert All Rights Reserved           Baroque Style    The classical style would reflect a much simpler approach to sound in time than had been the Baroque style which was a highly complex polyphonic musical texture, whose energy was derived from the rhythmic continuo, the unity of texture, and the continuous organic development of a motivic \"germ\" which was the essence of the musical substance of each specific form. The term \"baroque\" was originally a perjorative that was used to describe a style that was too ornamental, even too sentimental and bombastic for the tastes of the aristocracy in the late 18th Century. The picture above of a concert in a Baroque Concert Hall  reveals the highly ornamented archtectural style of the Baroque era which was reflected in the musical style as well. A detail of this Baroque orchestral concert reveals the setup of the orchestra with some audience on the stage as well as dignitaries seating in the middle of the orchestra perhaps the 17th version of \"surround sound.\"    In general, architecture, furniture, and sculpture reflected the ornate tastes of people in the Baroque era. Underlying the basic structure was the substance which gave expression to the structure. The organ in the Baroque church as pictured here shows the ornate treatment of the pipes and superstucture of the organ. Such ornamentation reflects two important points: ornamentation can be a way of individualizing and personalizing the general, and ornamentation also lends itself to a great deal of attention paid to detail. In musical practice the musician had to be highly accomplished in the art of ornamentation in order to improvise over a basic structure. In Da Capo settings the return to the A section always was invested with the improvisation of the performer which provided a deepening of the expressive range of the materials. Baroque ornamentation produces a rich and complex effect which the 18th Century interpreted as too bombastic and confusing. The 18th Century was more concerned with the universality of expression.   In Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F Major (1st movement), we have an excellent example of the concerto grosso style. The work itself is in concerto grosso form with three movements (fast-slow-fast), with the middle movement using only the solo instruments plus continuo (continuo consisted of a keyboard instrument, usually harpsichord, plus a bass instrument, such as cello).  You can select the music at the right to follow an excerpt of the score with the music. Concerto grosso style refers to the alternation of orchestra, ripieno (the ripieno consisting of the solo instruments with continuo), and tutti (orchestra + ripieno). The continuo is always present. The harpsichordist read from the bass line and improvised the upper voices according to a figured bass which described the arrangement of the intervals above the bass.   The Baroque style was strongly influenced by the Doctrine of Affections and the values emphasized the unity of affect (i.e., unity of mood) within the same movement. If there was a \"contrasting section,\" it was consider a shading of the original affect. This was reflected in the music as a unity of texture. The main shift in texture is simply the alternation of the performing groups which also controlled the dynamic levels. The musical material was derived from the opening motive was appeared in the first measure. This motive then underwent continuous development and modulated to the diatonically related keys. The larger the form, the more keys that are included. The use of tonality and modulation was a major factor in sustaining larger forms. This first movement is in three sections. The continuous steady rhythm and overlapping of the orchestra and ripieno often disguises the \"seams\" that denote sections, although in this movement Bach helps us by bringing the instruments to a brief halt for half a beat before resuming with a unison orchestral passage that signals the third section and the return to the key, much the way a recapitulation works in sonata form."}, {"content": "NYU Course: Music Literature--The Classical Period: Baroque Style                                                                                     E85.2073: Music Literature: The Classical Period  Ideals of Classicism   Copyright 1997-98 John V. Gilbert All Rights Reserved           Ideals of Western Art as Manifest in the &quot;New&quot; Classicism of the 18th Century   The \"high classic style\" is beautifully epitomized in Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik .  The opening measures reval the clarity of the structure, the theme being stated as an arpeggiation of the tonic G Major triad in second inversions, being answered by the argpeggiation of the dominant sevent in root position. The theme itself is a co,plex structure made up of simple structures. Measures 1-10 are a contrasting period form with a two measure extension coupled to a parallel period form (mm. 11-18). The cadence at measure 18 serves as the end of the second period form and the beginning of the transition (mm. 18-27) to the dominant to prepare for the second theme. Notice how the textures provide contrast within this highly unified statement of the theme: the first four measures are unison with rests creating an openness to the texture, the next four plus extension use a contrasting interation of a g-pedal tone and steady, connected and rhythmically vital eighth-note activity. The second half of the theme begins with a legao duo in the upper strings with imitation in the lower voices, and the transition to the dominant is based on the texture and material presented in measures 5-10.   In this opening passage (the first half of the Exposition) the classical ideals of balance, symmetry, clarity, contrast, restraint, moderation, proportion, and form are revealed. Notice how the contrasting sections of texture tend to balance each other. The symmetry of period form is the basic organizing force, the two period forms are joined to form a double period form for the structure of the first theme. Mozart avoids the predictability of this symmetry through the use of the extension and using an elision (the end of a section serving as the beginning of the next). Even at its most robust statement (the opening measures and the transition), the energy is restrained, contained within the limits of moderation. There is nothing to excess here.     By clicking on the first page, you can listen to the first movement of this very popular classical work. It is a testament to the work that with all of its performances and recordings, the music remains refresh and vital, a true test of a \"classic\" in the more popular use of the term.   Each movement of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik provides a microcosm of style and form of the late 18th Century musical style. The first movement is exemplary of sonata allegro form, with themes that are extraordinary in their structure, each serving to balance the contrasting thematic material. The development is concise, but highly concentrated, and the recapitulation with the codetta closes the movement. The second movement combines theme and variations with elements of Rondo ultimately encased in a large ABA song form with the B section providing a dark and somewhat agitated contrast to the tranquil opening theme. The third movement is a beautifully structure Minuet, and the closing movement a strikingly refreshing Rondo Sonata. This music was composed relatively late in Mozart's life (K525). Only a mature Mozart could have rendered such elegance in such a seemingly simple syntax, and by looking at all four movements, we have virtually the major forms and stylistic practices distilled to their essence.        A Moment of Confluence: The Brevity of &quot;High Classicism&quot;   There were several factors at work that seemed coalesce in the years 1750-1800 that brought about the conditions under which the high classical style emerged:     Haydn's experience with St&uuml;rm und Drang, empfindsamkeit, obbligato accompaniment and other rhetorical practices common to the time gave him the opportunity to synthesize and refine these elements into his musical style.    In general, there was a deep awareness of compositional techniques and styles which were eclectic and comprehensive. These were a part of the rhetoric of expression which was a deep concern for composers, musicians, and the aristocracy.    Mozart's contact with the international music scene, including Italian and French styles as well as the music of the the Mannheimers, the Viennese School, and the Bach sons enabled him to fuse international, eclectic musical practices into a highly personal style which developed even deeper with his knowledge of Haydn's music, especially the string quartets.    Haydn's efficient classical style seemed to undergo further development as he knew of Mozart's work with the string quartets and the symphonies.    French empirical rationalism had spread throughout Europe, England, and the American colonies. This philosophical stance reinforced classical ideals of rational form, symmetrical structures, balance, restraint, and moderation.    There was a spirit of experimentation with the rise of instrumental technology which led to the development of idiosyncratic instrumental styles, especially in the context of orchestral music. New approaches to the orchestra as a fixed performance ensemble influenced consolidation of form, textural development and contrast, and a strong sense of structural functions (including the use of dynamics and texture) within form. These factors eventually became evident in the emergence of the symphony, the classical concerto, and chamber music, most notably, the string quartet.    The patronage of the arts by the Church yielded to the dominance of patronage by the aristocracy (which was on a equal footing with the Church in the Baroque Era) in the latter half of the 18th Century. The social culture of the aristocracy was reflected in the classical musical style. However, the aristocracy itself began to decline in power throughout the 18th Century. More and more, the musical performers and musicians had to become entrepreneural, seeking to sell their services and their music through public concerts and through publication.    The industrial revolution was contributing to the idea of mass production and the replaceable part. Even Napoleon's modern army reflected this new social value. Previous armies had waged war in which the skills of individual warriors were emphasized. Napoleon turned the army into battalions with functions, so that if one battalion was wiped out, another could be put in its place. Human beings, as part of a complex war machine, became replaceable parts. Underlying the concept of mass production is basic structure stripped to its essence, along with the concept of functional parts. Structure and function become a point of emphasis in classical style.   The orchestra began to emerge as a reflection of this mechanical model. Many \"machines\" for making music were improved and developed (such as the piano with its hammer and levers). The orchestra developed into sections with functions. Because the orchestra demanded greater attention to creating a mixture of sections and control over dynamics and articulations, it needed the shaping and control of a director. The conductor (as foreman of this large and complex musical machine) finally became indispensable. During Mid-Century musical practice the Baroque approach of conducting from the keyboard alternated with the use of the conductor in front of the orchestra.    The Freemasons had come into existence in England and the society spread to Europe and to the American Colonies, often making claims to antiquity. The Freemasons were secret societies fostering the ideal of freedom. Freedom in the days of the monarchies and ruling families was looked on as subversive to the ruling classes. But it is clear that the Freemasons played major roles in the American and French Revolution. Mozart, a Freemason, introduced Haydn to Freemasonry and Haydn was inducted into a sister lodge to Mozart's lodge. Their first associations appear to have come from the meetings and musical performance as part of the masonry activities. Beethoven was also inducted into the Freemasons as was Schubert later on. The impact of Freemasonry on the music and social activities of the times has largely been ignored or underestimated. These secret societies were necessary since open advocacy for the freedom of the individual was regarded as treason by the royal ruling class. The rise of the Freemason movement coincides with the decline of power of the wealthy families and the ruling courts of the royal descendents.      Whereas the Baroque Period was a period of some 150 years, the classical period appears almost as a brief \"hiatus\" which dominates musical practice for about 30 years before yielding to the forces of romanticism which had been held in check by aristocracy which embraced the rationalist philosophy.   This remarkable confluence of forces set the conditions which produced a tremendous amount of music in such a brief time. Major forms which persist through this century were established and solidified. Developmental techniques for transforming musical material were extended and refined. The genre and musical compositions created by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven have become a body of works which may be one of the greatest legacies of the 18th Century.   The romantic elements were more a part of the \"common culture,\" and the collapse of the hold of aristocracy over the individuals in society, which began with the American Revolution and spread to Europe with the French Revolution, helped to support the surge of Romanticism that permeated the arts of the 19th Century. Beethoven, whose heritage was that of Haydn and Mozart was already a part of the new Zeitgeist, the new spirit which was capturing the imagination of artists and philosophers of the 19th Century. His first symphony serves both as homage to classical style and the signaling of a new energy and spirit that would find full fruition by the time of his Symphony No. 3."}]},
