It covers the fundamentals of the Portuguese language with  a focus on Brazil. In this course, Spanish sentence patterns and vocabulary  will be utilized as a basis for the study of similarities and differences  between the two languages. Comparisons among sound systems  (Spanish/English/Portuguese) will familiarize students with standard Portuguese  pronunciation. Written responses to short readings ( cr\u00f4nicas , poetry,  essays and articles) or visuals will help to review and expand grammar points  and to practice transferring common features of Spanish into Portuguese syntax.  Brief presentations on topics related to the arts and society will promote  essential speaking skills. By the end of the semester students will be prepared  to read complex materials and will have acquired basic proficiency in speaking,  writing and understanding standard Portuguese.      This is a zero credit course. A limited number of  spots are available for students from other departments/programs. These  spots will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis. Interested  students should contact Edgardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez at edgardo.nunez@nyu.edu for  permission to enroll.             PORT-GA  2967.001            Title: The New Documentary Film in Brazil       Instructor: Marta Peixoto       Day/Time: Wednesday 4:00-6:00pm            Description: In Brazil, as elsewhere, the last twenty-some years have seen a surge in  documentary filmmaking, aided by the availability of lightweight and  inexpensive recording technologies. This  increase in Brazil, part of the Retomada or Renewal of cinema of all kinds in  the 1990s, made possible by favorable government policies, was accompanied by a  parallel surge in critical thinking about the genre. This course, CONDUCTED IN  ENGLISH, will examine a selection of these Brazilian films from the 1990s to  the present, in connections with film criticism and relevant film theory  (Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, Andr\u00e9 Bazin, and others), in a context of earlier  influential American and European documentary movements and filmmakers (direct  cinema, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, Frederick Wiseman, Jean Rouch, Agn\u00e8s Varda) and of  Brazil's Cinema Novo. We will consider documentary film transnationally as a  genre in its distinction and confluences with fiction films, explore issues  such as: new modes of representation of \"a voz do povo,\" the uses of  fiction in documentary film, ethical concerns about the respectful use of other  people's images and words, and the construction of complex images of Brazil  changing political and social landscape since the end of the military  dictatorship.            Students will expand their critical and theoretical  vocabulary with regard to film and try their hand at film criticism. They may choose a final project on  documentary film from elsewhere in Latin America or Spain.             Readings for the course are available in one or more  of the following ways: for purchase online (amazon.com or elsewhere), posted on  NYU Classes, or at Bobst library. The  films are on reserve at the Avery Fisher Film Library at Bobst.                       SPAN-GA 2965.001            Title: Reading Modern  Spanish Culture through Raymond Williams       Instructor: Jo Labanyi       Day/Time: Wednesday  2:00-4:00pm            Description: The course will  revisit the writings of Raymond Williams, whose pioneering work in cultural  studies from the 1950s to the 1980s had an important influence on Latin  American cultural critics but has been relatively little used by scholars of  Spain. We will discuss a number of key concepts theorized by Williams, trying  them out, through close reading undertaken collectively in class, as ways of  reading excerpts from a wide range of Spanish cultural texts from the 19 th   century to the present. The latter will include fiction, drama, poetry, essays,  travel writing, and journalism (including television journalism). The aim will  be to develop critical tools for exploring the relationship between cultural  texts and social processes, showing how each can illuminate the other. In  particular, we will pursue Williams\u2019 insight that the analysis of literary  forms can offer an understanding of social forms.            The  course will be taught in English to give Spanish-native-speaker students  increased academic competence in English.                    Texts:            This  course is going to be something of an experiment. Unlike most courses, which  have a limited selection of core literary and cultural texts supplemented by a  large amount of critical reading, in this case the core texts will be critical  works by Williams, which will be read in relation to a large selection of short  literary and cultural texts (mostly excerpts).            Works  by Raymond Williams            Ordered  for NYU Bookstore (you should buy these):      Modern Tragedy (1966)      The Country and  the City (1973)      Keywords: A  Vocabulary of Culture and Society (1976; rev. ed. 2014)      Marxism and  Literature (1977)      The Sociology of  Culture (1982;  orig. Culture , 1981)            Selections  from the following will be made available:      Culture and  Society (1958)      The Long  Revolution (1961)      Politics and  Letters: Interviews with New Left Review    (1979)      Culture and  Materialism (2005;  orig.

SPAN-GA 2967.002            Title: Borders and Diasporas          Instructor : Tom\u00e1s Urayo\u00e1n Noel          Day/Time: Tuesday  4:00-6:00pm            Description: This course  seeks to trace the evolution of border and diaspora as key terms  in literary and cultural studies over the past two decades. Books such as  Gloria Anzald\u00faa's Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza (1987) and  Paul Gilroy's The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness   (1993) helped shape contemporary understandings of these two terms by mapping  the Mexico-U.S. borderlands and the black Atlantic as what James Clifford calls  \u201cproductive sites of crossing; complex, unfinished paths between local and  global attachments.\u201d While considering these and other foundational  interventions, we will also explore how more recent work engages other borders  (e.g. Haiti-Dominican Republic, Canada-U.S.) and diasporas (e.g. Caribbean,  Pacific) as well as new spatial logics (e.g. the neoliberal city, the carceral  border, digital cultures). Although we will pay particular attention to U.S.  Latina/o and Caribbean contexts, students are welcome and in fact encouraged to  explore borders and diasporas in ways that intersect with their own research.  Critical readings may include works by Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Paul Gilroy, Guillermo  G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a, Stuart Hall, Claire Fox, N\u00e9stor Garc\u00eda Canclini, Heriberto Y\u00e9pez,  Silvio Torres-Saillant, Ram\u00f3n Sald\u00edvar, Juan Flores, Alicia Schmidt Camacho,  Brent Hayes Edwards, Alejandro Lugo, and Michelle M. Wright. Additionally, we  may engage with popular music and film, and with literary texts, performances,  and/or installations by Am\u00e9rico Paredes, Josefina B\u00e1ez, Craig Santos Perez,  Reina Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, Alan Michelson, Pedro Pietri, Teddy Cruz, and M.  NourbeSe Philip, among others. We will likely also have a number of guest  speakers, readers, and/or performers.            (This  course will be conducted in English; reading knowledge of Spanish is not  required.)                      SPAN-GA 2968.001            Title:  Disputar lo precario. Recorridos de la cultura en el  Cono Sur y Brasil (1970-2010)          Instructor: Gabriel Giorgi       Day/Time: Monday 2:00-4:00pm    Description :  Quiz\u00e1 una de las marcas m\u00e1s perdurables que la llamada \u201cera neoliberal\u201d  imprimi\u00f3 sobre los lenguajes p\u00fablicos sea la constelaci\u00f3n de sentidos y afectos  en torno a la precariedad. Precarizaci\u00f3n, precariado, precariedad/precaridad:  modos, ciertamente heterog\u00e9neos, de nombrar el desfondamiento vertiginoso de la  promesas de seguridad y estabilidad que tanto el Estado de bienestar como la  sociedad neoliberal hab\u00edan instalado desde la segunda mitad del siglo XX. En  esa constelaci\u00f3n alrededor de la precariedad emerge una dimensi\u00f3n clave: la de  una vida que aparece, con un relieve cada vez m\u00e1s n\u00edtido, bajo la luz de  una nueva gesti\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de la vulnerabilidad. En ese contexto, ciertos  recorridos de la cultura en Am\u00e9rica Latina parecen haber ensayado, al menos  desde los a\u00f1os 70, modos de nombrar, de disputar y de narrar los sentidos  posibles de esa precariedad vuelta punto de gravitaci\u00f3n de la imaginaci\u00f3n  pol\u00edtica. El seminario se propone interrogar los modos por los cuales el trabajo  est\u00e9tico y cultural en torno a lo precario funcion\u00f3 como uno de los vectores  creativos m\u00e1s productivos en las \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, donde la  precariedad, lejos de ser una condici\u00f3n fija, estabilizada y definitiva, se  vuelve la instancia de una reconfiguraci\u00f3n de sensibilidades y de debates en  torno a lo com\u00fan. Dos dimensiones parecen especialmente productivas para pensar  estas disputas en torno a lo precario: por un lado, la emergencia de territorialidades  heterog\u00e9neas (Zibechi, Ludmer, Rodriguez), irreductibles a la distribuci\u00f3n  entre p\u00fablico/privado, nacional/global, rural/urbano; por otro, ficciones  y testimonios en torno a econom\u00edas alternativas, a la vez que ef\u00edmeras y  estrat\u00e9gicas, que pasan por el reciclaje de los despojos y las ruinas del  capital y por nuevas relaciones con lo natural y lo viviente. En estas  dimensiones se conjugan tensiones al interior de la denominada \u201csubjetividad  neoliberal\u201d , y se reconfigura la relaci\u00f3n entre lo com\u00fan y lo viviente;  all\u00ed la cultura parece encontrar nuevos terrenos para pensarse pol\u00edticamente, a  la vez que desdibuja sus propios l\u00edmites y tensa su misma especificidad. Los materiales a analizar incluyen textos de Rodolfo Fogwill,  Clarice Lispector , Sergio Chejfec, Gabriela Cabez\u00f3n C\u00e1mara, Diamela Eltit,  Rafael Pinedo, Vinicius Faustini y Iosi Havilio. Tambi\u00e9n discutiremos   films de Mendon\u00e7a Filho y Eduardo Coutinho, junto a materiales te\u00f3ricos e  hist\u00f3ricos de Judith Butler, Ra\u00fal Zibechi, Ignacio Lewcowicz, Pierre Dardot y  Christian Larval, Maurizio Lazzarato, Brett Nelson y Ned Rossiter, entre otros .                              SPAN-GA  2968.002             (This course originates in CLACS)            Title: Latin American Independence in the Age of Revolution          Instructors: Sibylle Fischer  and Sinclair Thomson          Day/Time : Monday 2:00 -  4:45pm, plus Monday evening lectures                  SPAN-GA  2975.001             Title: Iberian  Cultures and the Experimental Filmic Imagination          Instructor: Sara  Nadal-Melsio          Day/Time : Wednesday  6:00-8:00pm            Description: The social and  political imaginaries of Francoist Spain created a singular instance of  temporal dislocation in the filmic avant-garde of the 1960s and 70s. Portuguese   novo cinema, and Ant\u00f3nio Reis\u2019s  pedagogical legacy in particular, also called for a reformulation of \u2018national  art cinema.\u2019      This  course proposes an examination of the political, historical, and aesthetic  conjunctures that allowed both the emergence and survival of, an often  clandestine, experimentalism in the Iberian peninsula. The commitment to  avant-garde practices pushed the envelope of political possibility by  establishing an elective affinity and an affective transfer between the  political and the aesthetic. By addressing this productive double  enunciation through a transnational lens, this course seeks to shed new light  on European peripheral cinematic avant-gardes through the reading of classical  film theory. We will pay special attention to questions of non-synchronicity  and filmic ontology, which were addressed by early film scholars and have  remained central to an Iberian tradition of experimentalism.      In  addition to the films themselves, theoretical readings will include, among  others, Jean Epstein, B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs, Gilles Deleuze, Andr\u00e9 Bazin, Serguei  Eisentein, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re and Stanley Cavell. Primary materials will be  drawn from the work of Pere Portabella, Jacinto Esteve, Antoni Padr\u00f3s, Albert  Serra, Manoel de Oliveira, Ant\u00f3nio Reis, and Pedro Costa among others. Course will be conducted in English. Films will be subtitled in English as well.                  SPAN-GA  2975.002            Title: Introduction to  Aesthetics and Literary Theory          Instructor: Eduardo  Subirats          Day/Time : Monday  6:00-8:00pm   Description : This seminar will  focus on five major works of Western aesthetics: Kant, Schiller, Hegel,  Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. It will reconstruct central categories such as  form, beauty, genius, and myth. It also will focus on a central category: the  metaphysical (not moral) concept of will. Its ultimate goal is a critique of contemporary  artistic decadence, literary commercialism and anti- aesthetics.              SPAN-GA 2977.001            Title: Cubanologies:   Altered States of the Nation          Instructor: Ana Dopico         Day/Time: Tuesday 1:30-3:30pm       Description: This course works  through the Cuban literary, visual, and musical canons to engage the periodizations  and monuments of national culture. We will engage recent critical  studies, historiography and social and cultural theory to establish a  comparative analysis of the relation between state, nation, and empires.   We will think about Cuba beyond an insular state and identity and examine the  Latin American, hemispheric and global constellations that help us reframe Cuba  as subject, fetish, concept, and ideological factory.                  SPAN-GA 2978.001            Title: High and Low:  The Cultures of Latin American Modernismo          Instructor: Laura  Torres-Rodr\u00edguez          Day/Time: Thursday 5:00-7:00pm           Description: This class is an  introduction to the debates around turn-of-the-nineteenth-century aesthetic  production in Latin America. Recent academic contributions have  interrogated the traditional understandings of modernista period,  opening the field to more interdisciplinary methodologies. We will map this  academic corpus and revisit key texts in the construction of a Latin American  aesthetic culture and its contemporary influences. Modernismo is  generally recognized as the epitome of high literary expression in Latin  America because of its discourses on artistic autonomy. However, we will  explore its relations to popular and material culture, consumption economies,  and sexual politics. In addition to the study of canonical works for Latin  America continental definition, we will examine the margins of the movement,  known as bad modernism in order to propose other  aesthetic categories for understanding modernista forms. This  includes, among other approaches, affect and performance theory, political  economy, and gender and postcolonial studies. This course will be  conducted in Spanish.

PORT-GA  2967.001            Title: The New Documentary Film in Brazil       Instructor: Marta Peixoto       Day/Time: Wednesday 4:00-6:00pm            Description: In Brazil, as elsewhere, the last twenty-some years have seen a surge in  documentary filmmaking, aided by the availability of lightweight and  inexpensive recording technologies. This  increase in Brazil, part of the Retomada or Renewal of cinema of all kinds in  the 1990s, made possible by favorable government policies, was accompanied by a  parallel surge in critical thinking about the genre. This course, CONDUCTED IN  ENGLISH, will examine a selection of these Brazilian films from the 1990s to  the present, in connections with film criticism and relevant film theory  (Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, Andr\u00e9 Bazin, and others), in a context of earlier  influential American and European documentary movements and filmmakers (direct  cinema, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, Frederick Wiseman, Jean Rouch, Agn\u00e8s Varda) and of  Brazil's Cinema Novo. We will consider documentary film transnationally as a  genre in its distinction and confluences with fiction films, explore issues  such as: new modes of representation of \"a voz do povo,\" the uses of  fiction in documentary film, ethical concerns about the respectful use of other  people's images and words, and the construction of complex images of Brazil  changing political and social landscape since the end of the military  dictatorship.            Students will expand their critical and theoretical  vocabulary with regard to film and try their hand at film criticism. They may choose a final project on  documentary film from elsewhere in Latin America or Spain.             Readings for the course are available in one or more  of the following ways: for purchase online (amazon.com or elsewhere), posted on  NYU Classes, or at Bobst library. The  films are on reserve at the Avery Fisher Film Library at Bobst.                       SPAN-GA 2965.001            Title: Reading Modern  Spanish Culture through Raymond Williams       Instructor: Jo Labanyi       Day/Time: Wednesday  2:00-4:00pm            Description: The course will  revisit the writings of Raymond Williams, whose pioneering work in cultural  studies from the 1950s to the 1980s had an important influence on Latin  American cultural critics but has been relatively little used by scholars of  Spain. We will discuss a number of key concepts theorized by Williams, trying  them out, through close reading undertaken collectively in class, as ways of  reading excerpts from a wide range of Spanish cultural texts from the 19 th   century to the present. The latter will include fiction, drama, poetry, essays,  travel writing, and journalism (including television journalism). The aim will  be to develop critical tools for exploring the relationship between cultural  texts and social processes, showing how each can illuminate the other. In  particular, we will pursue Williams\u2019 insight that the analysis of literary  forms can offer an understanding of social forms.            The  course will be taught in English to give Spanish-native-speaker students  increased academic competence in English.                    Texts:            This  course is going to be something of an experiment. Unlike most courses, which  have a limited selection of core literary and cultural texts supplemented by a  large amount of critical reading, in this case the core texts will be critical  works by Williams, which will be read in relation to a large selection of short  literary and cultural texts (mostly excerpts).            Works  by Raymond Williams            Ordered  for NYU Bookstore (you should buy these):      Modern Tragedy (1966)      The Country and  the City (1973)      Keywords: A  Vocabulary of Culture and Society (1976; rev. ed. 2014)      Marxism and  Literature (1977)      The Sociology of  Culture (1982;  orig.

SPAN-GA 2967.002            Title: Borders and Diasporas          Instructor : Tom\u00e1s Urayo\u00e1n Noel          Day/Time: Tuesday  4:00-6:00pm            Description: This course  seeks to trace the evolution of border and diaspora as key terms  in literary and cultural studies over the past two decades. Books such as  Gloria Anzald\u00faa's Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza (1987) and  Paul Gilroy's The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness   (1993) helped shape contemporary understandings of these two terms by mapping  the Mexico-U.S. borderlands and the black Atlantic as what James Clifford calls  \u201cproductive sites of crossing; complex, unfinished paths between local and  global attachments.\u201d While considering these and other foundational  interventions, we will also explore how more recent work engages other borders  (e.g. Haiti-Dominican Republic, Canada-U.S.) and diasporas (e.g. Caribbean,  Pacific) as well as new spatial logics (e.g. the neoliberal city, the carceral  border, digital cultures). Although we will pay particular attention to U.S.  Latina/o and Caribbean contexts, students are welcome and in fact encouraged to  explore borders and diasporas in ways that intersect with their own research.  Critical readings may include works by Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Paul Gilroy, Guillermo  G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a, Stuart Hall, Claire Fox, N\u00e9stor Garc\u00eda Canclini, Heriberto Y\u00e9pez,  Silvio Torres-Saillant, Ram\u00f3n Sald\u00edvar, Juan Flores, Alicia Schmidt Camacho,  Brent Hayes Edwards, Alejandro Lugo, and Michelle M. Wright. Additionally, we  may engage with popular music and film, and with literary texts, performances,  and/or installations by Am\u00e9rico Paredes, Josefina B\u00e1ez, Craig Santos Perez,  Reina Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, Alan Michelson, Pedro Pietri, Teddy Cruz, and M.  NourbeSe Philip, among others. We will likely also have a number of guest  speakers, readers, and/or performers.            (This  course will be conducted in English; reading knowledge of Spanish is not  required.)                      SPAN-GA 2968.001            Title:  Disputar lo precario. Recorridos de la cultura en el  Cono Sur y Brasil (1970-2010)          Instructor: Gabriel Giorgi       Day/Time: Monday 2:00-4:00pm    Description :  Quiz\u00e1 una de las marcas m\u00e1s perdurables que la llamada \u201cera neoliberal\u201d  imprimi\u00f3 sobre los lenguajes p\u00fablicos sea la constelaci\u00f3n de sentidos y afectos  en torno a la precariedad. Precarizaci\u00f3n, precariado, precariedad/precaridad:  modos, ciertamente heterog\u00e9neos, de nombrar el desfondamiento vertiginoso de la  promesas de seguridad y estabilidad que tanto el Estado de bienestar como la  sociedad neoliberal hab\u00edan instalado desde la segunda mitad del siglo XX. En  esa constelaci\u00f3n alrededor de la precariedad emerge una dimensi\u00f3n clave: la de  una vida que aparece, con un relieve cada vez m\u00e1s n\u00edtido, bajo la luz de  una nueva gesti\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de la vulnerabilidad. En ese contexto, ciertos  recorridos de la cultura en Am\u00e9rica Latina parecen haber ensayado, al menos  desde los a\u00f1os 70, modos de nombrar, de disputar y de narrar los sentidos  posibles de esa precariedad vuelta punto de gravitaci\u00f3n de la imaginaci\u00f3n  pol\u00edtica. El seminario se propone interrogar los modos por los cuales el trabajo  est\u00e9tico y cultural en torno a lo precario funcion\u00f3 como uno de los vectores  creativos m\u00e1s productivos en las \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, donde la  precariedad, lejos de ser una condici\u00f3n fija, estabilizada y definitiva, se  vuelve la instancia de una reconfiguraci\u00f3n de sensibilidades y de debates en  torno a lo com\u00fan. Dos dimensiones parecen especialmente productivas para pensar  estas disputas en torno a lo precario: por un lado, la emergencia de territorialidades  heterog\u00e9neas (Zibechi, Ludmer, Rodriguez), irreductibles a la distribuci\u00f3n  entre p\u00fablico/privado, nacional/global, rural/urbano; por otro, ficciones  y testimonios en torno a econom\u00edas alternativas, a la vez que ef\u00edmeras y  estrat\u00e9gicas, que pasan por el reciclaje de los despojos y las ruinas del  capital y por nuevas relaciones con lo natural y lo viviente. En estas  dimensiones se conjugan tensiones al interior de la denominada \u201csubjetividad  neoliberal\u201d , y se reconfigura la relaci\u00f3n entre lo com\u00fan y lo viviente;  all\u00ed la cultura parece encontrar nuevos terrenos para pensarse pol\u00edticamente, a  la vez que desdibuja sus propios l\u00edmites y tensa su misma especificidad. Los materiales a analizar incluyen textos de Rodolfo Fogwill,  Clarice Lispector , Sergio Chejfec, Gabriela Cabez\u00f3n C\u00e1mara, Diamela Eltit,  Rafael Pinedo, Vinicius Faustini y Iosi Havilio. Tambi\u00e9n discutiremos   films de Mendon\u00e7a Filho y Eduardo Coutinho, junto a materiales te\u00f3ricos e  hist\u00f3ricos de Judith Butler, Ra\u00fal Zibechi, Ignacio Lewcowicz, Pierre Dardot y  Christian Larval, Maurizio Lazzarato, Brett Nelson y Ned Rossiter, entre otros .

Portuguese   novo cinema, and Ant\u00f3nio Reis\u2019s  pedagogical legacy in particular, also called for a reformulation of \u2018national  art cinema.\u2019      This  course proposes an examination of the political, historical, and aesthetic  conjunctures that allowed both the emergence and survival of, an often  clandestine, experimentalism in the Iberian peninsula. The commitment to  avant-garde practices pushed the envelope of political possibility by  establishing an elective affinity and an affective transfer between the  political and the aesthetic. By addressing this productive double  enunciation through a transnational lens, this course seeks to shed new light  on European peripheral cinematic avant-gardes through the reading of classical  film theory. We will pay special attention to questions of non-synchronicity  and filmic ontology, which were addressed by early film scholars and have  remained central to an Iberian tradition of experimentalism.      In  addition to the films themselves, theoretical readings will include, among  others, Jean Epstein, B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs, Gilles Deleuze, Andr\u00e9 Bazin, Serguei  Eisentein, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re and Stanley Cavell. Primary materials will be  drawn from the work of Pere Portabella, Jacinto Esteve, Antoni Padr\u00f3s, Albert  Serra, Manoel de Oliveira, Ant\u00f3nio Reis, and Pedro Costa among others. Course will be conducted in English. Films will be subtitled in English as well.

It will reconstruct central categories such as  form, beauty, genius, and myth. It also will focus on a central category: the  metaphysical (not moral) concept of will. Its ultimate goal is a critique of contemporary  artistic decadence, literary commercialism and anti- aesthetics.              SPAN-GA 2977.001            Title: Cubanologies:   Altered States of the Nation          Instructor: Ana Dopico         Day/Time: Tuesday 1:30-3:30pm       Description: This course works  through the Cuban literary, visual, and musical canons to engage the periodizations  and monuments of national culture. We will engage recent critical  studies, historiography and social and cultural theory to establish a  comparative analysis of the relation between state, nation, and empires.   We will think about Cuba beyond an insular state and identity and examine the  Latin American, hemispheric and global constellations that help us reframe Cuba  as subject, fetish, concept, and ideological factory.                  SPAN-GA 2978.001            Title: High and Low:  The Cultures of Latin American Modernismo          Instructor: Laura  Torres-Rodr\u00edguez          Day/Time: Thursday 5:00-7:00pm           Description: This class is an  introduction to the debates around turn-of-the-nineteenth-century aesthetic  production in Latin America. Recent academic contributions have  interrogated the traditional understandings of modernista period,  opening the field to more interdisciplinary methodologies. We will map this  academic corpus and revisit key texts in the construction of a Latin American  aesthetic culture and its contemporary influences. Modernismo is  generally recognized as the epitome of high literary expression in Latin  America because of its discourses on artistic autonomy. However, we will  explore its relations to popular and material culture, consumption economies,  and sexual politics. In addition to the study of canonical works for Latin  America continental definition, we will examine the margins of the movement,  known as bad modernism in order to propose other  aesthetic categories for understanding modernista forms. This  includes, among other approaches, affect and performance theory, political  economy, and gender and postcolonial studies. This course will be  conducted in Spanish.

We will explore these questions in texts by Fernando Vallejo, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Alan Pauls and Sylvia Molloy, among others. (2) Figures of abandonment, of precariousness and of disavowal recur, in the most diverse ways, in a large part of recent literary fiction, reflecting directly or obliquely, depending on the specific case, radical transformations of the political and of the relation between politics and literature. We will explore how literature reformulates different juridical, economic, affective and social modalities of abandonment as a sign of the present, turning to texts by Rodolfo Fogwill, Mario Bellat\u00edn, and Martin Kohan, and films de Lucrecia Martel and Eduardo Coutinho, among others.

It covers the fundamentals of the Portuguese language with  a focus on Brazil. In this course, Spanish sentence patterns and vocabulary  will be utilized as a basis for the study of similarities and differences  between the two languages. Comparisons among sound systems  (Spanish/English/Portuguese) will familiarize students with standard Portuguese  pronunciation. Written responses to short readings ( cr\u00f4nicas , poetry,  essays and articles) or visuals will help to review and expand grammar points  and to practice transferring common features of Spanish into Portuguese syntax.  Brief presentations on topics related to the arts and society will promote  essential speaking skills. By the end of the semester students will be prepared  to read complex materials and will have acquired basic proficiency in speaking,  writing and understanding standard Portuguese.      This is a zero credit course. A limited number of  spots are available for students from other departments/programs. These  spots will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis. Interested  students should contact Edgardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez at edgardo.nunez@nyu.edu for  permission to enroll.             PORT-GA  2967.001            Title: The New Documentary Film in Brazil       Instructor: Marta Peixoto       Day/Time: Wednesday 4:00-6:00pm            Description: In Brazil, as elsewhere, the last twenty-some years have seen a surge in  documentary filmmaking, aided by the availability of lightweight and  inexpensive recording technologies. This  increase in Brazil, part of the Retomada or Renewal of cinema of all kinds in  the 1990s, made possible by favorable government policies, was accompanied by a  parallel surge in critical thinking about the genre. This course, CONDUCTED IN  ENGLISH, will examine a selection of these Brazilian films from the 1990s to  the present, in connections with film criticism and relevant film theory  (Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, Andr\u00e9 Bazin, and others), in a context of earlier  influential American and European documentary movements and filmmakers (direct  cinema, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, Frederick Wiseman, Jean Rouch, Agn\u00e8s Varda) and of  Brazil's Cinema Novo. We will consider documentary film transnationally as a  genre in its distinction and confluences with fiction films, explore issues  such as: new modes of representation of \"a voz do povo,\" the uses of  fiction in documentary film, ethical concerns about the respectful use of other  people's images and words, and the construction of complex images of Brazil  changing political and social landscape since the end of the military  dictatorship.            Students will expand their critical and theoretical  vocabulary with regard to film and try their hand at film criticism. They may choose a final project on  documentary film from elsewhere in Latin America or Spain.             Readings for the course are available in one or more  of the following ways: for purchase online (amazon.com or elsewhere), posted on  NYU Classes, or at Bobst library. The  films are on reserve at the Avery Fisher Film Library at Bobst.                       SPAN-GA 2965.001            Title: Reading Modern  Spanish Culture through Raymond Williams       Instructor: Jo Labanyi       Day/Time: Wednesday  2:00-4:00pm            Description: The course will  revisit the writings of Raymond Williams, whose pioneering work in cultural  studies from the 1950s to the 1980s had an important influence on Latin  American cultural critics but has been relatively little used by scholars of  Spain. We will discuss a number of key concepts theorized by Williams, trying  them out, through close reading undertaken collectively in class, as ways of  reading excerpts from a wide range of Spanish cultural texts from the 19 th   century to the present. The latter will include fiction, drama, poetry, essays,  travel writing, and journalism (including television journalism). The aim will  be to develop critical tools for exploring the relationship between cultural  texts and social processes, showing how each can illuminate the other. In  particular, we will pursue Williams\u2019 insight that the analysis of literary  forms can offer an understanding of social forms.            The  course will be taught in English to give Spanish-native-speaker students  increased academic competence in English.                    Texts:            This  course is going to be something of an experiment. Unlike most courses, which  have a limited selection of core literary and cultural texts supplemented by a  large amount of critical reading, in this case the core texts will be critical  works by Williams, which will be read in relation to a large selection of short  literary and cultural texts (mostly excerpts).            Works  by Raymond Williams            Ordered  for NYU Bookstore (you should buy these):      Modern Tragedy (1966)      The Country and  the City (1973)      Keywords: A  Vocabulary of Culture and Society (1976; rev. ed. 2014)      Marxism and  Literature (1977)      The Sociology of  Culture (1982;  orig.

SPAN-GA 2967.002            Title: Borders and Diasporas          Instructor : Tom\u00e1s Urayo\u00e1n Noel          Day/Time: Tuesday  4:00-6:00pm            Description: This course  seeks to trace the evolution of border and diaspora as key terms  in literary and cultural studies over the past two decades. Books such as  Gloria Anzald\u00faa's Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza (1987) and  Paul Gilroy's The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness   (1993) helped shape contemporary understandings of these two terms by mapping  the Mexico-U.S. borderlands and the black Atlantic as what James Clifford calls  \u201cproductive sites of crossing; complex, unfinished paths between local and  global attachments.\u201d While considering these and other foundational  interventions, we will also explore how more recent work engages other borders  (e.g. Haiti-Dominican Republic, Canada-U.S.) and diasporas (e.g. Caribbean,  Pacific) as well as new spatial logics (e.g. the neoliberal city, the carceral  border, digital cultures). Although we will pay particular attention to U.S.  Latina/o and Caribbean contexts, students are welcome and in fact encouraged to  explore borders and diasporas in ways that intersect with their own research.  Critical readings may include works by Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Paul Gilroy, Guillermo  G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a, Stuart Hall, Claire Fox, N\u00e9stor Garc\u00eda Canclini, Heriberto Y\u00e9pez,  Silvio Torres-Saillant, Ram\u00f3n Sald\u00edvar, Juan Flores, Alicia Schmidt Camacho,  Brent Hayes Edwards, Alejandro Lugo, and Michelle M. Wright. Additionally, we  may engage with popular music and film, and with literary texts, performances,  and/or installations by Am\u00e9rico Paredes, Josefina B\u00e1ez, Craig Santos Perez,  Reina Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, Alan Michelson, Pedro Pietri, Teddy Cruz, and M.  NourbeSe Philip, among others. We will likely also have a number of guest  speakers, readers, and/or performers.            (This  course will be conducted in English; reading knowledge of Spanish is not  required.)                      SPAN-GA 2968.001            Title:  Disputar lo precario. Recorridos de la cultura en el  Cono Sur y Brasil (1970-2010)          Instructor: Gabriel Giorgi       Day/Time: Monday 2:00-4:00pm    Description :  Quiz\u00e1 una de las marcas m\u00e1s perdurables que la llamada \u201cera neoliberal\u201d  imprimi\u00f3 sobre los lenguajes p\u00fablicos sea la constelaci\u00f3n de sentidos y afectos  en torno a la precariedad. Precarizaci\u00f3n, precariado, precariedad/precaridad:  modos, ciertamente heterog\u00e9neos, de nombrar el desfondamiento vertiginoso de la  promesas de seguridad y estabilidad que tanto el Estado de bienestar como la  sociedad neoliberal hab\u00edan instalado desde la segunda mitad del siglo XX. En  esa constelaci\u00f3n alrededor de la precariedad emerge una dimensi\u00f3n clave: la de  una vida que aparece, con un relieve cada vez m\u00e1s n\u00edtido, bajo la luz de  una nueva gesti\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de la vulnerabilidad. En ese contexto, ciertos  recorridos de la cultura en Am\u00e9rica Latina parecen haber ensayado, al menos  desde los a\u00f1os 70, modos de nombrar, de disputar y de narrar los sentidos  posibles de esa precariedad vuelta punto de gravitaci\u00f3n de la imaginaci\u00f3n  pol\u00edtica. El seminario se propone interrogar los modos por los cuales el trabajo  est\u00e9tico y cultural en torno a lo precario funcion\u00f3 como uno de los vectores  creativos m\u00e1s productivos en las \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, donde la  precariedad, lejos de ser una condici\u00f3n fija, estabilizada y definitiva, se  vuelve la instancia de una reconfiguraci\u00f3n de sensibilidades y de debates en  torno a lo com\u00fan. Dos dimensiones parecen especialmente productivas para pensar  estas disputas en torno a lo precario: por un lado, la emergencia de territorialidades  heterog\u00e9neas (Zibechi, Ludmer, Rodriguez), irreductibles a la distribuci\u00f3n  entre p\u00fablico/privado, nacional/global, rural/urbano; por otro, ficciones  y testimonios en torno a econom\u00edas alternativas, a la vez que ef\u00edmeras y  estrat\u00e9gicas, que pasan por el reciclaje de los despojos y las ruinas del  capital y por nuevas relaciones con lo natural y lo viviente. En estas  dimensiones se conjugan tensiones al interior de la denominada \u201csubjetividad  neoliberal\u201d , y se reconfigura la relaci\u00f3n entre lo com\u00fan y lo viviente;  all\u00ed la cultura parece encontrar nuevos terrenos para pensarse pol\u00edticamente, a  la vez que desdibuja sus propios l\u00edmites y tensa su misma especificidad. Los materiales a analizar incluyen textos de Rodolfo Fogwill,  Clarice Lispector , Sergio Chejfec, Gabriela Cabez\u00f3n C\u00e1mara, Diamela Eltit,  Rafael Pinedo, Vinicius Faustini y Iosi Havilio. Tambi\u00e9n discutiremos   films de Mendon\u00e7a Filho y Eduardo Coutinho, junto a materiales te\u00f3ricos e  hist\u00f3ricos de Judith Butler, Ra\u00fal Zibechi, Ignacio Lewcowicz, Pierre Dardot y  Christian Larval, Maurizio Lazzarato, Brett Nelson y Ned Rossiter, entre otros .

Portuguese   novo cinema, and Ant\u00f3nio Reis\u2019s  pedagogical legacy in particular, also called for a reformulation of \u2018national  art cinema.\u2019      This  course proposes an examination of the political, historical, and aesthetic  conjunctures that allowed both the emergence and survival of, an often  clandestine, experimentalism in the Iberian peninsula. The commitment to  avant-garde practices pushed the envelope of political possibility by  establishing an elective affinity and an affective transfer between the  political and the aesthetic. By addressing this productive double  enunciation through a transnational lens, this course seeks to shed new light  on European peripheral cinematic avant-gardes through the reading of classical  film theory. We will pay special attention to questions of non-synchronicity  and filmic ontology, which were addressed by early film scholars and have  remained central to an Iberian tradition of experimentalism.      In  addition to the films themselves, theoretical readings will include, among  others, Jean Epstein, B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs, Gilles Deleuze, Andr\u00e9 Bazin, Serguei  Eisentein, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re and Stanley Cavell. Primary materials will be  drawn from the work of Pere Portabella, Jacinto Esteve, Antoni Padr\u00f3s, Albert  Serra, Manoel de Oliveira, Ant\u00f3nio Reis, and Pedro Costa among others. Course will be conducted in English. Films will be subtitled in English as well.                  SPAN-GA  2975.002            Title: Introduction to  Aesthetics and Literary Theory          Instructor: Eduardo  Subirats          Day/Time : Monday  6:00-8:00pm   Description : This seminar will  focus on five major works of Western aesthetics: Kant, Schiller, Hegel,  Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. It will reconstruct central categories such as  form, beauty, genius, and myth. It also will focus on a central category: the  metaphysical (not moral) concept of will. Its ultimate goal is a critique of contemporary  artistic decadence, literary commercialism and anti- aesthetics.              SPAN-GA 2977.001            Title: Cubanologies:   Altered States of the Nation          Instructor: Ana Dopico         Day/Time: Tuesday 1:30-3:30pm       Description: This course works  through the Cuban literary, visual, and musical canons to engage the periodizations  and monuments of national culture. We will engage recent critical  studies, historiography and social and cultural theory to establish a  comparative analysis of the relation between state, nation, and empires.   We will think about Cuba beyond an insular state and identity and examine the  Latin American, hemispheric and global constellations that help us reframe Cuba  as subject, fetish, concept, and ideological factory.                  SPAN-GA 2978.001            Title: High and Low:  The Cultures of Latin American Modernismo          Instructor: Laura  Torres-Rodr\u00edguez          Day/Time: Thursday 5:00-7:00pm           Description: This class is an  introduction to the debates around turn-of-the-nineteenth-century aesthetic  production in Latin America. Recent academic contributions have  interrogated the traditional understandings of modernista period,  opening the field to more interdisciplinary methodologies. We will map this  academic corpus and revisit key texts in the construction of a Latin American  aesthetic culture and its contemporary influences. Modernismo is  generally recognized as the epitome of high literary expression in Latin  America because of its discourses on artistic autonomy. However, we will  explore its relations to popular and material culture, consumption economies,  and sexual politics. In addition to the study of canonical works for Latin  America continental definition, we will examine the margins of the movement,  known as bad modernism in order to propose other  aesthetic categories for understanding modernista forms. This  includes, among other approaches, affect and performance theory, political  economy, and gender and postcolonial studies. This course will be  conducted in Spanish.

The seminar will focus on the Spanish realist novel La Regenta by Leopoldo Alas (1885-1885), a major 19th-century European novel of female adultery which has become established as a classic of world literature. The aim is to provide an environment in which students can tackle a very long text (approximately 700 pages), which all students of Spanish literature should know, by considering manageable sections of the novel in different weeks, in each case exploring different issues relating to realism and 19th-century Spanish culture.

The course will be organized around two axes that condense determining aspects of recent literary work in Latin America: (1) Writings of the \u201cI\u201d: The question of the relation between biography and fiction, between intimacy and public exhibition(ism), and of new modes of constructing subjectivity constitutes one of the most recurrent critical debates of the present. We will explore these questions in texts by Fernando Vallejo, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Alan Pauls and Sylvia Molloy, among others. (2) Figures of abandonment, of precariousness and of disavowal recur, in the most diverse ways, in a large part of recent literary fiction, reflecting directly or obliquely, depending on the specific case, radical transformations of the political and of the relation between politics and literature. We will explore how literature reformulates different juridical, economic, affective and social modalities of abandonment as a sign of the present, turning to texts by Rodolfo Fogwill, Mario Bellat\u00edn, and Martin Kohan, and films de Lucrecia Martel and Eduardo Coutinho, among others.
